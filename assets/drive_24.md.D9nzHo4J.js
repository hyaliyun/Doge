Vedhika made her Tollywood cinema debut with this film, while Srikanth Deva also composed the music for Sivakasi that was reused in this film. The story was written by Perarasu who also wrote and directed the original film, while the Paruchuri brothers wrote the dialogues. Ram Prasad handled the cinematography, while Nandamuri Hari edited the film and Stun Siva choreographed the action sequences. Kalyan Ram decided to star in the film after watching the Tamil original in Vizag. The film was shot at a specially erected street set in Ramanaidu Cine Village, Hyderabad. The climax scenes were shot for a week at Ramoji Film City. The film was released on 21 September 2007, receiving negative reviews from critics. It was a commercial failure, and Kalyan Ram himself was not satisfied with the film's execution by Samudra. The film had an international DVD release on 25 April 2008. During a Facebook live session in 2018, Kalyan Ram said he regretted doing this film because he wasn't confident about it but had to take it in spite of demanding changes that weren't made.

It accesses the memory array in a password dependent order, which reduces the possibility of time–memory trade-off (TMTO) attacks, but introduces possible side-channel attacks. *Argon2i is optimized to resist side-channel attacks. It accesses the memory array in a password independent order. *Argon2id is a hybrid version. It follows the Argon2i approach for the first half pass over memory and the Argon2d approach for subsequent passes. The Internet drafthttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2/ The memory-hard Argon2 password hash and proof-of-work function, draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-03, accessed August 16, 2017 recommends using Argon2id except when there are reasons to prefer one of the other two modes. All three modes allow specification by three parameters that control: *execution time *memory required *degree of parallelism  Cryptanalysis  While there is no public cryptanalysis applicable to Argon2d, there are two published attacks on the Argon2i function. The first attack is applicable only to the old version of Argon2i, while the second has been extended to the latest version (1.3) The first attack shows that it is possible to compute a single-pass Argon2i function using between a quarter and a fifth of the desired space with no time penalty, and compute a multiple-pass Argon2i using only / < /2.71 space with no time penalty. According to the Argon2 authors, this attack vector was fixed in version 1.3. The second attack shows that Argon2i can be computed by an algorithm which has complexity O(7/4 log()) for all choices of parameters (space cost), (time cost), and thread-count such that =∗. The Argon2 authors claim that this attack is not efficient if Argon2i is used with three or more passes. However, Joël Alwen and Jeremiah Blocki improved the attack and showed that in order for the attack to fail, Argon2i 1.3 needs more than 10 passes over memory.

The exact cause of the leak remained unidentified as of 2015, but appeared to be related to coalbed methane extraction. The San Juan Basin contains the Fruitland coal formation. Ashley Ager, a geologist with LT Environmental, Inc., a company with oil and gas industry contracts, has argued that the leak is naturally occurring due to this formation contacting the surface. However, NASA researchers concluded in 2016 that oil and gas production and distribution activities were principally responsible for the methane releases. The Four Corners area includes other methane sources such as seepage from coal mines, but researchers found these sources too small to explain the bulk of the observed emissions.

Some powers such as body swapping and charming are cancelled out with another kiss. The seventh witch's powers operate differently from the others.

Yamada discovers she was a very lonely person, and helps set her straight, after which she develops a crush on him. During the student council recall election storyline, she reveals that she was a victim of bullying by Kaori Yasojima. When Yamada copies the seventh witch power, she inadvertently becomes his spotter (or as Noa puts it, his wife), that is, the person who will not forget him when he uses his memory manipulation power. She later hangs out with Ushio, establishing the Poetry Club with him, and regularly expresses affections towards Yamada whenever she sees him.

In the anime series, she is voiced by Masumi Tazawa in Japanese and by Luci Christian in English. Other witches After Yamada wishes for the witch powers from the first seven girls to go away, he learns that other students have witch powers.

They appear to be supervised by Nancy, the seventh witch, who speculates there may be other groups of seven witches as well. =Tsubasa Konno= is a basketball player who has a submission ability, but unlike Nene's charm ability, the people she kisses will obey her commands rather than try to please her out of love. =Nancy= is a punk-styled student who has the power to manipulate people's memories concerning witches, and to identify when someone has a witch power. She and Sid monitor the witches and which students they affect under the guise of the light music club.

She can turn invisible to the people she kisses. She is a very busy person, so her appearances in the series are brief and quick. =Sora Himekawa= is the president of the Handicrafts Club. She is quite clumsy and accident prone, and her creations are scary-looking. She has the ability to see a special romantic memory of the person she kisses. Her next-door neighbor and childhood friend is Yuri Miura. It is revealed that she along with Nancy became friends with Yamada during their first year prior to the beginning of the series, and that she likes him, eventually confessing her feelings to him but was turned down due to Yamada holding affections for Shiraishi even back then, after which she soon lost her memory of him. In the epilogue, she and Yuri are married and have a child. Male witches Several witch powers are also found on the male students, some of whom can activate their powers by a method other than a kiss. Besides Ryuu Yamada and Hikaru Suzuhara, there are the following male witches: =Ushio Igarashi= was Yamada's schoolmate and friend from middle school, but they have gone their separate ways at the beginning of high school after a fallout in which Yamada gets in trouble for beating up students. He befriends Nene Odagiri and falls in love with her, remaining loyal to her even after Odagiri's charm power is canceled out. After he and Odagiri part ways, he allies with Asuka in the Japanese chess club. He acquires the witch power of stealing a witch ability, which he applies to Moegi of mind-reading.

He usually keeps to himself and can be rather snide when approached but over time begins to open up and is recognized by Yamada and the others as a reliable friend. After Yamada meets with the seventh witch, Tamaki teams up with Yamada to reverse the effect of her powers. He later discovers he has the ability to \\"paste\\" the power back to a witch. He becomes the treasurer of the new student council, and becomes student council president from the recall election.

After he kisses Yamada, he discovers he does not body swap, and upon further investigation by kissing Arisugawa, he discovers he has a new witch ability that allows him to travel to someone's past. In the epilogue, he has opened an ikemen-themed curry shop. =Rui Takuma= is a witch who got his seventh-witch power of erasing people's memories after Rika lost her power. He has long white hair, and uses a walking stick. A top student along with Shiraishi, he easily outsmarts Yamada, but he is anemic and prone to fainting spells. He finds school \\"uninteresting\\" and does not attend classes but has not been expelled for his continued absence because he possesses a genius-level intellect. Upon learning that he has witch powers, he starts attending school again, observes Yamada and his activities, and becomes very interested in his relationships with others. When Yamada tries to enlist his help in regaining everybody's memories, Takuma reveals that he has a split personality which he claims has the witch ability to switch personalities with him at will. Essentially this makes him the only person in the series to possess two witch powers at the same time. His real persona is cruel, arrogant, and physically strong. He originally planned to initiate the witch ceremony using Yamada's abilities as a vessel in order to erase his physically weaker half, but later relents. It is also later revealed that in their first year, he was researching the witches and coveted Shiraishi's power, resulting in a fight with Yamada which led to the student council's decision to erase the students' memories and suspend Yamada from school.

In the epilogue, he presides over Yamada and Shiraishi's wedding as the priest. =Masamune Ichijo= is a member of the Japanese chess club and the opposition to the student council.

After the election, he goes back to being a loner in his class. =Yuri Miura= is a member of the Japanese chess club who has short hair styled in a bowl cut. He has the power of manipulation which he can use on just one person at a time and is activated by giving the person a headbutt. The power allows him to tune into what the target is doing and control their actions as if he was playing a first-person video game. He has a crush on his next-door neighbor Sora Himekawa, and allows her be friends with Yamada, but when her confession to Yamada was rejected and she then lost her memories, Yuri vowed to avenge her. He later becomes the secretary for the new student council when Shinichi Tamaki is elected president. The epilogue chapter shows him with Himekawa and their child attending Yamada and Shiraishi's wedding and regarded as a happy family. =Alex Spencer= is a foreign exchange student from America who obtains the body-swapping power during Yamada's third year. He agrees to reveal his power to Yamada on the condition that the latter helps him make friends at school. To accomplish this, Yamada uses Alex's physical abilities during their body- swap to impress the student body which makes him sought after by every sports club on campus. He first learned about his power and the witches from his host family schoolmate Maria Sarushima. Supporting characters Yoshikawa has mentioned that many of the characters in the storyline are school peers, and hardly any adults: =Haruma Yamazaki= is the president of the student council and is seen as the hottest guy in school. In contrast to his aloof and perverted exterior, he is actually extremely cunning and sly. He accomplishes his goals by manipulating and blackmailing clubs, including the Supernatural Studies Club. Along with the president, the rest of the student council is aware of the existence of witches. Yamazaki manipulates Yamada to find the identities of the seven witches by indulging him with information regarding the witches. He uses the identity of the seven witch as a final test to determine his successor. He later tries to prevent the witches from gathering, but eventually relents in order to determine why he ended up becoming president and to bring back his erased memories. His memories reveal that he was a member of the Supernatural Studies Club where he was in a close relationship with Leona Miyamura whom he had protected when Rika Saionji appeared to erase their memories. He later goes to university where he studies psychology but takes time to enjoy the freedoms of college life. At the end of the series, he works in advertising and has an established relationship with Leona. In the drama series, Haruma discovers he has the \\"witch killing\\" ability, that is he can take a witch's power with a kiss, and give it back with another kiss. He is portrayed by Hidenori Tokuyama. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by Jun Fukuyama in Japanese and by Seth Magill in English. =Leona Miyamura= Toranosuke's older sister, has been living at home, where she hurls scissors like throwing knives at intruders and people that annoy her. She and Haruma Yamazaki were close friends and the only members of the Supernatural Studies Club, but when Yamazaki discovered the identity of the seventh witch, he told her to flee the school and discovered that he had lost his memories. She has feelings for Yamazaki but rejects his confession to her at their graduation because he had used the witches' power to find out how she felt about him, but looks forward to seeing whether he will persist and try again. She later attends a private university in London much to the dismay of both her brother and Yamazaki. In the series epilogue, she has become an archeologist and maintains a relationship with Yamazaki. In the drama series, she stops attending school because her memory was wiped by the seventh witch.

She is present at Yamada and Shiriashi's wedding where she is regarded as more mature but for reasons unknown. =Kaori Yasojima= is the only other female member of the Japanese Chess Club besides Asuka. She had been bullying Noa, causing the latter to develop witch powers, but later reveals that she herself has been a victim of constant bullying but deals with it by putting up a naively positive attitude. She tries to get along with the chess club despite the latter's treatment of her where they often use their powers on her. When her boyfriend cruelly dumps her and leaves her to be assaulted, Yamada saves her and uses the manipulation power to change her responses to bullying. Afterwards, she begins to stand up more for herself, and gains a friend in the process. =Mutta Hagiwara= is a member of the Japanese Chess Club and the only male member confirmed not to be a witch. He likes to joke around with the other members of the club. =Sid= is Nancy's buddy in their \\"light music club\\". He helps Nancy monitor the other witches while providing Yamada with advice and sympathizing with his desire to make Shiraishi happy as he wishes to do the same for Nancy. =Karen Kimishima= is the captain of the girls' archery team. She was initially suspected of being a witch by Yamada because she refused to allow the old Archery Club's room to be reconstructed for reasons that were unclear. Eventually she admits it was simply out of respect for all the club activities that have occurred throughout the room's history. She has a tendency to throw and slam things whenever she gets embarrassed, especially Yamada, whom she likes but refuses to admit. In the anime, she is voiced by Mai Nakahara. =Tatsumi Yamada= is Yamada's younger sister. She enjoys watching male idol stars. =Class representative= A classmate of Yamada's whom he gets to know better as the class prepares for a school trip.

She wears glasses but Yamada later discovers she is quite attractive without them. She tells Yamada that she heard that he had been dating some girl back then, but when Yamada examines her past memories it is not clear who she meant due to her never actually knowing if there was any truth behind the rumour (the person Yamada was supposedly dating appears as a silhouette with no discernible features in her memory). She is last seen attending Yamada and Shiraishi's wedding. =Hino= A girl who had become friends with Yamada and the gang during the end of their first school year.

The farm's current size is , down from a reported maximum of , consisting of about of cleared land, and the balance in woodland. The farm complex is located on the east side of Horseback Road, about south of Troy Road. The connected complex is arrayed with the house at the southern end, with ells extending north to the barn. Secondary farm buildings stand north and east of the barn, and there is summer sleeping house south of the main house. The house has an Italianate exterior, with a bracketed entry hood, and bay windows with paneled corner boards and skirting. The interior of the main house has been completely modernized; the attached ell retains some 19th- century features. The early settlement history of the property is uncertain; an 1859 map of the area shows a house standing, ownership attributed to C. Reynolds. The present house is stylistically from a later period, and was probably built about 1870, along with the barn. The barn is built of hand-hewn timbers, and is unusual for its purlin roof framing, which is not normally found on barns this large. The farm property remained in the hands of members of the Reynolds family until 1977.

It is a necessary condition for being able to implement the function using a strategyproof mechanism. Its verbal description is: In other words:  Notation  There is a set X of possible outcomes. There are n agents which have different valuations for each outcome. The valuation of agent i is represented as a function: v_i : X \\\\longrightarrow R_+ which expresses the value it assigns to each alternative. The vector of all value-functions is denoted by v. For every agent i, the vector of all value-functions of the other agents is denoted by v_{-i}. So v \\\\equiv (v_i,v_{-i}). A social choice function is a function that takes as input the value-vector v and returns an outcome x\\\\in X. It is denoted by Outcome(v) or Outcome(v_i,v_{-i}).  In mechanisms without money  A social choice function satisfies the strong monotonicity property (SMON) if for every agent i and every v_i,v_i',v_{-i}, if: x = Outcome(v_i, v_{-i}) x' = Outcome(v'_i, v_{-i}) then: x \\\\succeq_i x' (by the initial preferences, the agent prefers the initial outcome). x \\\\preceq_{i'} x' (by the final preferences, the agent prefers the final outcome). equivalently: v_i(x) - v_i(x') \\\\geq 0 v_i'(x) - v_i'(x') \\\\leq 0 = Necessity = If there exists a strategyproof mechanism without money, with an outcome function Outcome, then this function must be SMON. PROOF: Fix some agent i and some valuation vector v_{-i}. Strategyproofness means that an agent with real valuation v_i weakly prefers to declare v_i than to lie and declare v_i'; hence: v_i(x) \\\\geq v_i(x') Similarly, an agent with real valuation v_i' weakly prefers to declare v_i' than to lie and declare v_i; hence: v_i'(x') \\\\geq v_i'(x)  In mechanisms with money  When the mechanism is allowed to use money, the SMON property is no longer necessary for implementability, since the mechanism can switch to an alternative which is less preferable for an agent and compensate that agent with money. A social choice function satisfies the weak monotonicity property (WMON) if for every agent i and every v_i,v_i',v_{-i}, if: x = Outcome(v_i, v_{-i}) x' = Outcome(v'_i, v_{-i}) then: v_i(x) - v_i(x') \\\\geq v_i'(x) - v_i'(x') = Necessity = If there exists a strategyproof mechanism with an outcome function Outcome, then this function must be WMON. PROOF: Fix some agent i and some valuation vector v_{-i}. A strategyproof mechanism has a price function Price_i(x, v_{-i}), that determines how much payment agent i receives when the outcome of the mechanism is x; this price depends on the outcome but must not depend directly on v_i. Strategyproofness means that a player with valuation v_i weakly prefers to declare v_i over declaring v_i'; hence: v_i(x) + Price_i(x, v_{-i}) \\\\geq v_i(x') + Price_i(x', v_{-i}) Similarly, a player with valuation v_i' weakly prefers to declare v_i' over declaring v_i; hence: v_i'(x) + Price_i(x, v_{-i}) \\\\leq v_i'(x') + Price_i(x', v_{-i}) Subtracting the second inequality from the first gives the WMON property. = Sufficiency = Monotonicity is not always a sufficient condition for implementability, but there are some important cases in it is sufficient (i.e, every WMON social-choice function can be implemented): * When the agents have single- parameter utility functions. * In many convex domains, most notably when the range of each value-function is \\\\mathbb{R}^+. * When the range of each value- function is \\\\mathbb{R}, or a cube (Gui, Müller, and Vohra (2004)). * In any convex domain (Saks and Yu (2005)). * In any domain with a convex closure. * In any \\"monotonicity domain\\".  Examples  1\\\\. When agents have single peaked preferences, the median social-choice function (selecting the median among the outcomes that are best for the agents) is strongly monotonic. Indeed, the mechanism selecting the median vote is a truthful mechanism without money. See median voter theorem. 2\\\\. When agents have general preferences represented by cardinal utility functions. the utilitarian social- choice function (selecting the outcome that maximizes the sum of the agents' valuations) is not strongly-monotonic but it is weakly monotonic.

She married George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie and travelled with him when he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, Governor General of Canada and Commander in Chief of the Indian Army. While travelling, she collected and catalogued many species of plants, presented scientific papers to societies and donated many collections to different botanical groups. Lady Dalhousie was made an honorary member of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh and was its only female honorary member until her death. A genus of tropical plant, Dalhousiea, is named after her. Family Dalhousie was born Christian Broun on 28 February 1786 at Coalstoun, the ancestral home of the Broun family near Haddington, East Lothian. She was the only child of Christian McDowal and Charles Broun. The Broun family had a history in the legal profession; her father was an advocate and his father a judge, George Broun, Lord Coalstoun. On 14 May 1805, she married George Ramsay, the 9th Earl of Dalhousie and was styled Countess of Dalhousie. Dalhousie and her husband had three sons. Their eldest, George, was born 3 August 1806, a captain in the 26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot, he died on 25 October 1832. Their second son, Charles, died at nine years old. Their youngest, James, born 22 April 1812, inherited his father's title in 1838 and was created Marquess of Dalhousie in 1849.The Peerage: Sir James Andrew Ramsay, 1st and last Marquess of Dalhousie of Dalhousie CastleLeigh Rayment's Peerage Page: The Peerages of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom: D'Abernon to Dearing Scientific work Dalhousie was a keen botanist; she catalogued plants on herbarium sheets, fully identified and complete with collection dates, notes on habitats and some with watercolour pictures she had painted. In 1824, Lord Dalhousie co-founded the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec. Lady Dalhousie's catalogue of Canadian plants was included in the first issue of the society's Transactions in 1829. Dalhousie presented a paper to the Society, and donated her collection of Nova Scotian specimens as part of a herbarium in 1824. Lady Dalhousie donated her entire East Indian Herbarium to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh. The society noted its quality and made Lady Dalhousie an honorary member in 1837; at the time of her death she was the only female honorary member. Records of correspondence with Kew botanist, Sir William Hooker, include large collections of plants from Simla and Penang in 1831. Her collections were included when Joseph Dalton Hooker compiled his Flora Indica. Travels When her husband was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, she travelled with him and their three sons to Canada on the frigate HMS Forth. The family lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia for four years from 1816 to 1820. Whilst there, Lady Dalhousie spent her time in the promotion of science. She toured the countryside with her husband, recommended improvements to farming and collected botanical items. She sent seeds to Dalhousie Castle for the gardens. William Hooker relied on her for botanical samples, and called her a \\"very zealous botanist\\". In 1820, the family moved to Quebec, when her husband was appointed Governor General of British North America. Dalhousie took on the traditional role of a governor's wife, that of \\"Patron of literature and the arts\\". She spent much time in high society and was known for her wit and satirical caricatures of society members. Once established, Dalhousie and her friends, Anne Mary Perceval and Harriet Sheppard, started focusing on natural history and in particular cataloguing local botany. All three women corresponded with and collected for Sir William Hooker who credited their efforts in his book Flora Boreali-Americana. In 1824, the family returned to Dalhousie Castle and began plans for an extensive garden. Their gardener, Joseph Archibald, wrote of her that \\"few ... attained such proficiency as her ladyship in the science\\". Plans for the garden were cut short as the family suffered severe financial losses when their agent went bankrupt. Although the garden was not completed, many of the North American plants had been planted and flowered for the first time in Great Britain. The family moved to a modest farmhouse in Sorel in 1826 and remained there until Lord Dalhousie was appointed Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of India in 1829. On the journey to India, the family stopped at Madeira, St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope. At each place, Dalhousie took time to collect plants and made a detailed catalogue of them. In 1831 she visited the foothills of Simla, along with Penang, near the Malay Peninsula. Death and legacy Dalhousie died suddenly on 22 January 1839 in the home of Dean Ramsay aged 52. One report mentions that she was so dedicated to her studies that she died with a list of plants in her hand. The collection that she and her husband had made was sold in 1985; parts went to the Nova Scotia Museum, the National Gallery of Canada, the Library and Archives Canada and the Provincial Archives of New Brunswick. Three hundred plant specimens collected by the Dalhousie at Sorel between 1826 and 1828 are maintained in the herbarium (HAM) at Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario). For her work in the classification of Indian botany, Robert Graham named a genus of Fabaceae, a flowering plant native to India, after her - Dalhousiea. One of the plants she sent to Graham was a new discovery, so he named the plant Asplenium dalhousiae after her. Sir William Hooker dedicated a volume of Curtis's Botanical Magazine to her. Julia Catherine Beckwith, who is credited as Canada's first writer of fiction, dedicated her first novel to her. Dalhousie was the first owner of one of the \\"Philiadelphia\\" copies of Jane Austen's Emma. Rhododendron dalhousieae Hook. f. was named for her by Joseph Dalton Hooker.

He established the first guitar departments in United States universities, at the College of St. Joseph on the Rio Grande in 1963 and the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque in 1967, where he taught for about 20 years.  Biography  Garcia was born in Havana, Cuba. He received Master of Guitar and Master of Music degrees from the Peyrellade Conservatory, joining their faculty upon graduation in 1954.Summerfield, Maurice J. The Classical Guitar: Its Evolution, Players and Personalities Since 1800. Hal Leonard Corporation, Jan 1, 2003. He chose to leave Cuba to escape the communist regime at the age of 30, buying a two-way ticket from Havana to Miama, Florida (but using only one part of the ticket). He sought and was granted asylum in the United States with support of family and friends. He returned to Cuba as part of the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs Invasion, was captured, and was imprisoned. In prison, he worked on the first of two unpublished concertos convinced his captors to \\"find him a guitar\\". With this guitar, he formed a makeshift studio in prison with other students. Some went on to become accomplished musicians and professors. After two years imprisonment, Garcia was released ($50,000 was paid by the Kennedy administration to Fidel Castro and returned to the U.S., where became a concert guitarist and educator, performing worldwide with major orchestras, including the Havana Symphony, Los Angeles Sinfonietta, New Mexico Symphony Orchestra, and the Dupont Consortium in Washington D.C. He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show and founded the first academic department dedicated to classical guitar at the University of New Mexico. Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco dedicated a composition (Op. 170/39) Cancion Cubana to Hector Garcia.Mario Castelnuovo- Tedesco Papers Guides to Special Collections in the Music Division of the Library of Congress Music Division, Library of Congress Washington, D.C. 2010 Garcia studied with Emilio Pujol (a disciple of the Francisco Tárrega school of classical guitar), and he was appointed assistant in 1969 not only to improve his mastery of the guitar and vihuela but also to help Pujol develop musical materials and notes and to conduct master classes attended by advanced students and performing artists worldwide. Garcia adopted and expanded upon the traditions of both Tárrega and Pujol. Some of these influences led him to adopt a \\"no-nails\\" approach for guitar playing, which runs counter to the contemporary trend in classical guitar for players to grow the nails of the hand used to pluck strings (usually the right hand). The nails are grown and shaped to optimize sound production, but in the \\"no-nails\\" approach, the nails are cut short so that fingertips contact the string directly. The technique produces a sound that has a distinctive, softer characteristic, although the control is often more difficult, especially in passages requiring a rapid arpeggio or tremolo technique. The \\"no-nails\\" approach remains controversial amongst contemporary classical guitarists. Garcia lives with his family in Idaho (previously, he resided in Albuquerque, New Mexico and Miami, Florida). He married Jeanne Marie Baum November 12, 1988. He is officially retired, but maintains a strong interest in the advancement of the instrument and the ideas set forth by Emilio Pujol.  Concert Review  On November 27, 1973 La Mañana, a newspaper in Lérida, Spain, published this review of a concert Héctor García gave. Juan Riera was the reviewer. Below is my translation and I apologize for any errors it may contain. Lew Critchfield June 2020 On more than one occasion we have questioned the motives and influences of today's concert guitarists as to the exclusion of the \\"Sonatas\\" and Fantasias\\" of Fernando Sor. These two forms are the most noble of all this composer's works for the guitar, his musicality and his genius. An answer might be, as overheard in a discussion between a professor regarding the past with the judgement of a performing guitarist, that the length of such works and the difficulties in the conscientious study of them require of concert players a deep understanding and importance in the history of the guitar, the societal atmosphere of the entire period and the esthetic currents governing artistic expression. In another vein, the music of Sor (Sonatas and Fantasias) is out of phase in relation to our present day mindset and practices, actually we lack the foundation necessary. Regarding this we find the meritorious programming by Héctor García in which he included one of the most interesting sonatas by the Catalán composer Fernando Sor. It was dedicated by Sor to Ignacio Pleyel, a famous composer, pianist and founder of a company producing Pleyel Pianos. It was obvious that Héctor García belongs to that category of interpreters whose honest execution does not permit concessions. Ones which, the knowledgeable are aware, he must not enslave himself to these current mannerisms and cave in to popular trends. The artist must offer the values contained in the History of Music's long held traditions. In this way the artist enriches the audience's appreciation and understanding of what they have heard. There is not the least doubt, the Fantasia of Sor we heard favors the above principles and probably has not been heard since Sor's death in 1839. It is a model of the classical era on the guitar and illustrates why those who knew called him the \\"Beethoven of the guitar\\". For this reason it deserves to be studied and offered to the public to hear such admirable polyphonic qualities expressed on the guitar. The first part of the program was no less remarkable. There was a Cuban song by Mario Castel-Nuevo Tedesco dedicated to Maestro Héctor García. Using an original system assigning pitches to the alphabet, Tedesco's theme was derived from Héctor's first and last names. This part concluded with two exquisite songs by Mexican composer Manuel Ponce followed by Ponce's Theme, Variations and Finale. Its virtuosity has made it a popular concert piece among today's guitarists. The second half was dedicated entirely to Emilio Pujol; a concert study dedicated to Scarlatti followed by four Spanish character pieces which are the most significant of this Catalán composer's catalogue of original works. Héctor García's technique identifies fully with the \\"School of Tárrega\\" which Pujol methodically amplified. García's special attribute is his spirituality and his full and confident consideration of the logic serving Art on the guitar. In other words, denying oneself to better serve the Art. One characteristic of the \\"Tárrega School\\" is striking the notes with only the fingertips. His passion and quest was to emulate the sonority of the classical string quartet. Use of just the tip, he imagined and then realized, was the only way to get a pleasing result. With this came a resurgence of fingertip playing. It had been used by the prestigious Renaissance composer Fuenllana and two centuries later by Fernando Sor. Héctor García, convinced that the excellence of sound produced by the fingertips and following Tárrega's example, in a single stroke revived the long lost art and its rewards. He neither imposes false mannerisms nor uses convenient prejudices. With that approach the works of Emilio Pujol were heard with complete fullness of their character. Héctor García has conscientiously studied Pujol's works and in no way diminished their esthetic sentiment. They were played with fluid facility and sonority which only fingertip playing can bring to the guitar's music. This second half of his program embodied a faithful and true hommage to Pujol. This writer is fully convinced that the matters written of at the beginning of this review requires a \\"Pujolistic era\\" something we have desired for a long time. Emilio Pujol's music is surely not easy to interpret yet essentially guitaristic and should not be absent from guitarists' concerts. That which has true value cannot be ignored eternally. It is apparent the International Concursos of Cervera were a revelation to the young artists attending. They discovered music unknown to them. In the final concerts of the concourse we heard from players the profound musical shading demanded by Pujol. The conviviality of the Maestro throughout the concurso awakened the attendees' desire to study his works. The repercussions, like a rock thrown in the middle of a pond, spread his music throughout the international guitar world. Summing up, the interpretations of Héctor García, in my honest judgement, offered a selection of essentially guitaristic works, difficult to interpret and to express. Thankfully his diligence in developing his technique by way of thorough studies, gave him domination of whatever problems arose. The strings, the frets and the spirit were dominated by the facility of his fingers and fully expressing his dynamic concepts. Surely technique can be capricious and uneven, on a good day a player may execute them well and on others only give the impression of doing them well. In Héctor García we saw today a guitarist who is perhaps the best prepared to reveal the principles of Tárrega on the concert stages of the world. The large audience applauded enthusiastically bringing him back for an encore for which he played \\"Guajira Cubana\\".

As a two-year-old in 2010 he was one of the best colts of his generation in Ireland, finishing second in the National Stakes before winning the Beresford Stakes and the Racing Post Trophy. In the following year his only win in four starts came in the Prix du Prince d'Orange. He was retired to stud at the end of the year having won four races in three countries from eight starts. Background Casamento was a chestnut horse standing 16.1 hands high with a narrow white stripe bred in Ireland by D & J Cantillon and C & K Canning. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Shamardal whose wins included the Dewhurst Stakes, Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix du Jockey Club and St James's Palace Stakes. His other progeny have included Able Friend, Mukhadram and Lope de Vega. Casamento's dam Wedding Gift was a successful racemare who won the Listed Prix Saraca and finished third in both the Prix du Calvados and the Prix Vanteaux. She was descended from Vaguely Noble's half-sister Regal Lady. As a foal in November 2008, Casamento was consigned by Tinnakill House to the sale at Goffs and was bought for €54,000 by the bloodstock agent Bobby O'Ryan. The colt entered the ownership of Sheikh Mohammed and was sent into training with Michael Halford at Kildangan, County Kildare. Racing career =2010: two-year-old season= Casamento made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven and a half furlongs at Tipperary Racecourse on 28 August in which he was ridden by Gary Carroll who was able to claim a three-pound weight allowance as he had ridden less than 95 winners. Starting the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting in an eleven-runner field, he took the lead after a furlong and was never seriously challenged, winning \\"easily\\" by two and a half lengths from the Dermot Weld- trained Cannon Hill. Sixteen days after his win at Tipperary, Casamento was moved up sharply in class for the Group One National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh with Declan McDonogh taking over the ride. After taking an early lead he was overtaken by Pathfork two furlongs out but rallied strongly and was gaining on the leader in the closing stages before finishing second by a head. The Aidan O'Brien-trained favourite Zoffany was five lengths back in third place. Pat Smullen took over from McDonogh when the colt started 4/6 favourite for the Group Two Beresford Stakes over one mile at the Curragh on 26 September. His connections paid a supplementary entry fee of €10,000 as he had not been among the original entries for the race. The best-fancied of his six opponents were Mawaakef and Factum who had finished first and second in a maiden race at Killarney. After racing in second behind Robin Hood, Casamento took the lead a furlong and a half from the finish, quickly went clear of the field and won by four lengths from Mawaakef. After the race Halford said \\"he's still a big baby, but he's an exciting horse to have\\", whilst Smullen commented \\"he was very aggressive from the gate but I managed to get him some cover and he settled, which will serve him well for the future... he has the makings of a good one\\". On his fourth and final appearance of the season Casamento was sent to England for the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse, and again had a new jockey, with Frankie Dettori riding the colt. He was one of four Irish-trined challengers and made the 2/1 favourite ahead of the Anglesey Stakes winner Dunboyne Express (later to race with great success in Hong Kong under the name Dan Excel) whilst the Aidan O'Brien stable was represented by Master of Hounds and Seville. The most fancied of the six British trained runners were Titus Mills (Stardom Stakes) and Native Khan (Solario Stakes). Casamento raced behind the leaders before taking the lead two furlongs out and held off the sustained challenge of Sevile to win by three-quarters of a length with a gap of two and a half lengths back to Master of Hounds in third. After the race Dettori commented \\"He's a lovely big horse with plenty of strength and a lot of presence. The race went as planned. I had watched videos of him and knew that he'd get the trip well, so about two-and-a-half furlongs out I let him go. We were in the middle and he idled before Seville came and his challenge helped me along\\". The colt's success gave Halford his first success at Group One level. The trainer said \\"It was a great performance and it all went like clockwork. He was idling in front a bit, but Frankie was always happy with him. He keeps finding and was only doing what he had to do\\". Following his win at Doncaster, Casamento was taken into the ownership of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation and was transferred to the stable Mahmood Al Zarooni. Commenting on the decision, Halford said \\"There was never any problem with that. It was always going to be the case and we were so lucky to get him. I’m so grateful to Sheikh Mohammed for sending me the horse in the first place\\". =2011: three-year-old season= Casamento made his first appearance of 2011 in the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse on 30 April and started 11/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Frankel, Pathfork and Roderic O'Connor. He chased Frankel in the early stages but dropped back soon after half way and finished tenth of the thirteen runners. The colt was then sent to France for the Prix du Jockey Club over 2000 metres at Chantilly Racecourse. He led the field into the straight but was overtaken 300 metres from the finish and faded into ninth place behind Reliable Man. After a break of over three months, Casamento returned for the Group Three Prix du Prince d'Orange at Longchamp Racecourse on 17 September in which he was matched for the first time against older horses. Ridden for the first time by Mickael Barzalona he started a 9.3/1 outsider in a seven-runner field headed by the previously undefeated Desert Blanc and the Prix du Jockey Club runner-up Bubble Chic. The other runners included the Prix Guillaume d'Ornano runner-up Slow Pace, the Prix Omnium II winner Barocci and the Dr. Busch-Memorial winner Lindenthaler from Germany. Casmento raced at the rear of the field before switching to the outside to make his challenge in the straight. He overtook Barocci 50 metres from the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" by a length, with Desert Blanc a nose away in third. Casamento was moved back up into Group One class for his final race, the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Ascot Racecourse on 15 October. Starting a 25/1 outsider he was never in contention and finished eleventh of the twelve runners behind Cirrus des Aigles. Stud record Casamento was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at his owner's Dalham Hall Stud. His early progeny fetched some good prices at auction. He later spent a season in Sweden before moving tor the Sunnyhill Stud in County Kildare. In 2020 he was euthanised at Sunnyhill at the age of 12 after suffering a deterioration of a hoof condition. The most successful of his offspring included Kings Will Dream (Turnbull Stakes), Communique (Princess of Wales's Stakes), Amade (Belmont Gold Cup Invitational Stakes), Princess Yaiza (Prix de Royallieu) and Lamaire (Oaks d'Italia).

Since the traditional English translation (Clumsy Mystic) does not reflect the wide semantic field of the name, the topic of its origin has generated some academic interest in the historical, linguistical and philosophical circles. This article attempts to summarize the findings.  Clumsy – 拙 (zhuō)  Ink on silk manuscript of the Tao Te Ching, unearthed from Mawangdui Clumsiness in the Chinese culture has always been the attribute of a great skill. The Tao Te Ching (道德經), written around 6th century BC by the mystic, philosopher and poet Lao-Tzu (老子), says this in Chapter 45: Chen Jiru (陳繼儒), a painter, philosopher and calligrapher during the Ming Dynasty in his work “Solitary Thoughts by a Small Window” (小窗幽) gives this advice:  Mystic – 隱 (yǐn)  The character 隱, used as a noun, means mystery, hidden matters, secret, hint, thinking, hermit or recluse. Researchers believe that Yin in name Zhuo Yin comes from a poem by the Tang Dynasty poet Liu Cang (刘沧) : Some linguists, however, argue that the last line of the poem was originally “Find joy in gathering firewood, and yoga and in friends”, because characters 瑜 (瑜伽, yoga) and 漁 (fishing) are both spelled yú and are homonyms in Mandarin. The error was introduced later by scribes who were unfamiliar with yoga, during the Qing Dynasty when Tang poetry anthologies were being compiled.[citation needed]  The Seal  The official seal of Clumsy Mystic consists of two vertically oriented characters Zhuo and Yin written in the traditional Great Seal script (大篆) in the Zhuwen style (朱文, lit. “red characters”) that imprints the characters in red ink. centre  References  Category:Chinese traditional music ","title":"Zhuoyin Clumsy Mystic"},{"id":"48963491","title":"Abdul Hamid Khan Dasti"},{"id":"48963549","text":"Kathleen Bertko (born November 8, 1983) is an American Olympic rower.

Life The daughter of Jacob J. Pitts, she was born Anne Pitts in New York City. She completed a bachelor's degree at Queens College and pursued graduate studies at Harvard University although, due to the conventions of the time, she was enrolled through Radcliffe College. In 1946, she married Robert Grosse, also a graduate student in economics. While she was working on her PhD thesis at Harvard, she taught part-time at Bates College and was professor of economics at Brooklyn College; she received her PhD in 1949. In the summer of that year, she moved to Cambridge to work with Wassily Leontief's Harvard Economic Research Project (HERP). She was given a full-time position; her husband was also offered a full-time position with the project and she was appalled to discover that he was given a larger salary. The couple divorced in 1950. From 1951 to 1955, she was a research fellow at Harvard, also teaching at Smith and Wellesley Colleges. In 1953, she married psychiatrist Franklin Carter; she had her first child in 1955. She was offered more flexible work arrangements so that she could continue her work with HERP. During the 1960s, Carter became known as a leading expert in the field of input-output analysis; she served as director for HERP from 1968 to 1972. In 1966, she became an assistant professor in the Harvard economics department, becoming the first woman in the faculty. In 1970, she published Structural Change in the American Economy, which compared technical coefficients of the American economy in 1939, 1947 and 1958 as technology changed over time. In 1971, Carter moved to Brandeis University as a visiting professor. She became full professor the following year. In 1973, when HERP was officially closed, its library and research materials were moved to Brandeis. From 1972 to 1979, Carter was director of the Brandeis Economic Research Center. She was dean of the Economics faculty from 1981 to 1986, chair of the Economics department from 1987 to 1993 and acting Dean of Arts and Sciences from 1999 to 2000. She is now professor emeritus at Brandeis. In 1974, Leontief was asked by the United Nations to study the future of the world economy and he asked Carter to assist with developing an operational \\"world model\\" in support of this project. Carter has served as an economic policy advisor to the American government and other private and international organizations. She was chair for the Russell Sage Foundation and founding president of the International Input-Output Association from 1987 to 1991. In 2009, she received the Carolyn Shaw Bell Prize from the American Economic Association.

The film stars are Scott Eastwood, Freddie Thorp, Ana de Armas and Gaia Weiss. Principal photography began on 4 January 2016 in Paris and Marseille, France. The film tells the story of Andrew and Garret Foster, young brothers who are skilled car thieves and have expertise in luxury cars. They both are sent to steal a Bugatti car in Southern France, but they get caught by the car's owner; a ruthless local crime lord. In exchange for their lives and an apology for attempting to steal his car, the crime lord forces the brothers into stealing a luxury Ferrari car from the crime lord's arch-rival.  Plot  Half-brothers Andrew and Garret Foster operate as international car thieves, targeting high-end of the market vehicles. They steal a rare Bugatti in transit after it is purchased at auction in France, unaware that the car was bought by Marseille crime boss Jacomo Morier. Morier's men capture them when they try to sell the car and take them to Morier's house, where he shows them his garage full of cars. He then means to shoot them but, to escape their punishment, the brothers offer to help Morier complete his collection by stealing a rare 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO (worth $38,000,000) owned by ruthless tycoon and rival, Max Klemp. Morier agrees but sets the condition that the theft must be carried out within one week. The brothers hurriedly recruit a team in Marseille to carry out the job, including Andrew's girlfriend Stephanie and her pickpocket friend Devin. Andrew tells Garret that this will be his last job. They also have to cope with Morier's cousin Laurent keeping watch on their operation, as well as a pair of Interpol agents. Garret, who had recently been conned by a woman who pretended to fall in love with him, begins a relationship with Devin. For insurance, Morier's men kidnap Stephanie in the Marseille marketplace. Andrew and Garret arrive in their flat and Devin tells them Stephanie has been taken. They head to Morier's house to find Stephanie bound and gagged under a spinning car wheel, which Laurent threatens to lower onto her face. Andrew and Garret promise to finish the job in order to save Stephanie. When the day of the robbery comes, the brothers put their plan into effect. Stephanie, locked in a room in Morier's house, attempts to seduce Laurent and fails, although she manages to steal his key to the door and escapes. She sets off the house alarms and leaves with a rifle to meet Andrew, Garret and their team at the door. Morier realises that the events that led up to this point have been part of an elaborate diversion to allow them to steal his own car collection. Morier only understands what is happening as the gang are making their escape and he chases them to the docks. During the pursuit, Andrew proposes to Stephanie and she agrees to marry him. In a final confrontation, Morier is killed when his car is rammed into the water by a large motor coach driven by Devin. Devin leaves, promising to call Garret. Andrew and Garret give all of Morier's cars to Klemp, revealing that this had been the plan all along, and that they had partnered with Klemp to get back at Morier. In a further plot twist, the two Interpol agents were also partnered with Klemp. But as Devin leaves, she has in her hand the code to the garage where Klemp keeps his prized Ferrari. Garret, Stephanie and Andrew are later seen together in Paris. Garrett thinks he has been stood up again when Devin shows up in Klemp's Ferrari and gives the keys to Andrew. When Andrew then gives the car to Garret, Garret thinks this means Andrew is leaving the business. However, Stephanie mentions that there is a very rare car in Barcelona, one out of only nine in the world, and the three are tempted to steal it. Andrew decides to join them and the re-established team begins to make plans.

The road links Kapchorwa, the district capital of Kapchorwa District to Suam, at the international border with Kenya. Location The highway will start at Kapchorwa and continue in a general westerly direction to go through Kween in Kween District, then turn in a southeasterly direction to go through Bukwo in Bukwo District and end at Suam, on the banks of the Suam River, which forms the border between Uganda and Kenya. The total road distance is approximately . The coordinates of the road, southeast of the town of Kween are 01°25'03.0\\"N, 34°37'20.0\\"E (Latitude:1.417509; Longitude:34.622219). Overview The existing road is gravel surface. Most of the road lies within Mount Elgon National Park. The steep terrain becomes muddy and slippery during the wet season. Updating to bitumen surface As early as 2010, the government of Uganda, through Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA), started planning to upgrade the road to grade II bitumen surface with shoulders and drainage channels. In the earlier years, loans were sought from the World Bank and the Danish International Development Agency. In 2014, Kenyan print media reported that the governments of Kenya and Uganda were working together to develop the Kapchorwa–Suam Road in Uganda and the Suam–Endebess–Kitale–Eldoret Road in Kenya. UNRA and the Kenya National Highways Authority (KNHA) are jointly seeking funding from the African Development Bank to jointly develop that road corridor in order to promote trade between the two neighboring countries. It is anticipated that physical works will commence in the 2016/2017 financial year. The Ugandan section of the road will cost an estimated $80 million (UShs270 billion), funded by the African Development Bank and the government of Uganda. In August 2018, Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda and William Ruto, the deputy president of Kenya, officially kick-started the rehabilitation and improvement of this road. The projected cost estimate is US$105.76 million, financed by loans from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and African Development Fund (ADF) and counterpart funding by the Government of Uganda. The improvement to the road is expected to last 36 months.

The family was related to the Palmotta.  History  The founder was Marin de Prodanello ( 1273-1304), also called Bauxellus; his descendants, apart from \\"Prodanello\\", used Bausella as a surname. Another branch of the family, led by Ursacius Prodanelli (fl. 1253–85) (most likely Marin's brother), did not use the Bausella name. Ursacius' sons were distinguished Ragusan officials: Petrus (fl. 1280–1311) was senator and judge, while Johannes (fl. 1283–97) was canon and notary. They were among the eleven smallest houses in the 15th century. Another Petar Prodančić, son of Marin, was merchant who did business in medieval Serbian state. His brother Vito (Vitus/Vid) had two sons, Marin and Petar, who continued family business in Serbia. Petar had five sons, among which Jacob (Jakov/Jakša), James (Giacomo) and Theodore (Teodoro/Teodor) were most successful by the end of the 14th century and the beginning of the 15th century. Jacob was merchant and diplomat, and was succeeded by his son Nicholas (Nicola/Nikola/Nikša) while Teodor was succeeded by his son Petar. In the 16th century there were two last Prodančić family branches left. One of them was that of Petar (~ 1504-1563), son of Nikola, and the other one was that of Stephen (Stefano/Stjepan/Stijepo; 1566-1638), who was the last male member of the family. In the two-century- long period of time, from 1440 to 1640, there were in total 24 members of the family who entered the Grand Council (Consilium maius), a body consisting of all adult Ragusan noblemen.

He posted another picture on 4 May, this time of himself next to Gringe, presumably during a certain scene in the film, announcing in the caption that filming was complete and confirming the film's title as Comment c'est loin. =Music= The musical score for the film was composed by Alexis Rault, while the soundtrack featured new songs from Casseurs Flowters and produced by Skread. The soundtrack album, which also acts as Casseurs Flowters' second studio album, was released in France along with the film on December 9, 2015. It peaked at number 24 on the French Albums Chart, at number 61 on the Belgian Ultratop Albums Chart (Wallonia) and at number 83 on the Swiss Hitparade Albums Chart. In April 2017, the album was certified platinum in France.

It followed the First Battle of Bir el Gubi a failed Allied attempt to capture Bir el Gubi two weeks' previous. Bir el Gubi was a tactical position whose fall would have allowed the Allies to outflank the German-Italian forces in Cyrenaica. The battle was part of Operation Crusader.  Background  On 18 November, north of Bir el Gubi, the Commonwealth forces started a new offensive, Operation Crusader. On 19 November the \\"Ariete\\" Division, in the First Battle of Bir el Gubi repulsed a British attack and on 23 November a great tank battle, Totensonntag (\\"Sunday of the Dead\\" in German), took place in the desert. In Bir el Gubi the \\"Giovani Fascisti\\" Regiment and some Bersaglieri units took position in Bir el Gubi. A tank company of the I Battalion of the 32nd Tank Regiment (Ariete Division) was also sent for support, with ten Fiat L3 tankettes and two M13/40 medium tanks. The Italian soldiers strengthened the existing fortifications, building machine gun and anti-tank gun posts, building barbed wire barriers and digging holes in the ground. These fortifications allowed Bir el Gubi to be defended from attackers coming from any direction. One of the two M13/40s and some of the L3 tankettes, immobilized by mechanical breakdowns, were interred and used as defensive positions.Cappellano, Filippo: Carri leggeri in Libia, Storia militare n. 208/2011, Albertelli Edizioni, Parma, p. 30 The soldiers took position in the holes in the evening of 1 December, under torrential rain. The garrison also had ten 47/32 mm guns, 24 Breda Mod. 37 machine guns, 12 Mod. 35 anti-tank rifles, six Solothurn S-18/100 anti-tank rifles and eight 81 mm mortars.  Battle  Following the withdrawal of 2nd NZ Division Ritchie had reorganised his rear echelon units to release to the front line 4th Indian Infantry Division's 5th and the 22nd Guards Brigade. By 3 December 11th Indian Brigade (belonging to the 4th Indian Infantry Division) was heavily engaged in action against a strongpoint near Bir el Gubi, some 25 miles south of Ed Duda. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Italian 136th \\"Giovani Fascisti\\" Regiment from this hilltop position successfully fought off repeated attacks by the British armour and Indian infantry units during the first week of December. At 12:00 on 3 December, Allied artillery started shelling the Italian positions, causing some losses (among them Major Fulvio Balisti, commander of the I Battalion of the \\"Giovani Fascisti\\" Regiment, who was wounded). During the night, all the Italian units outside of the perimeter of Bir el Gubi were captured, along with their vehicles and equipment. In the morning of 4 December, the Allied forces launched two attacks against Bir el Gubi. Hundreds of men from the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders (part of the 11th Indian Infantry Brigade), supported by tanks and by an artillery barrage, attacked the positions of the I Battalion, while the rest of the 11th Indian Brigade, supported by Valentine tanks of the 7th Armoured Division, attacked the lines of the II Battalion, further north. Both attacks were repelled, and the attackers left dozens of killed on the ground; they did manage, however, to encircle the Italian positions. Around 14:00 on the same day, a third attack was launched against the Italian lines; the Italian defenders resisted for several hours in the face of increasing infantry and artillery pressure, but in the evening the 4th Company had to abandon Point 188 and withdrew to Point 184. The L3 tankettes proved useful against infantry, thanks to their two machine guns and their armour, but were powerless against tanks, and all ten of them were destroyed. General Willoughby Norrie had an overwhelming superiority in the area, but he failed to concentrate and co-ordinate the action of his forces.Gooch, John, ed. (1990). Decisive Campaigns of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, p. 100. The Italians, instead, effectively coordinated the action of their infantry, artillery, and light tanks.World War II Desert Tactics. During the fighting, Colonel Ferdinando Tanucci, commander of the Giovani Fascisti Regiment, was wounded; Lieutenant Colonel Alfred George Butler, of Rajputana Rifles, was killed.Rommel's North Africa Campaign: September 1940-November 1942 Between 4 and 7 December the XXX British Corps launched seven attacks, all repelled with heavy losses by the Italian defenders. Hunger and lack of supplies, however, started to weaken the Italian garrison, which asked for reinforcements; Erwin Rommel decided to send armoured forces (15th and 21st Panzer Divisions) to support the Italians in Bir el Gubi. At dawn on 5 December, the first German armoured units arrive near Point 188, which they recaptured after a fiery clash between German and British tanks. After this, the German tanks headed towards Bir el Gubi. The Ariete and Trieste Divisions were also sent, but the former was stopped by an Allied attack, and the latter lost its way in the desert. Crüwell was unaware that 4th Armoured Brigade (part of the 7th Armoured Division), now with 126 tanks, was over away and he withdrew to the west. The Indian Brigade was broken and had to be withdrawn to refit and arrangements made to bring 22nd Guards Brigade into their place. Tank clashes continued; during the following night the Ariete Division managed to reach Bir el Gubi and joined the German Panzers of general Ludwig Crüwell, and their combined force repelled the last British attacks. With the arrival of the Ariete, the Commonwealth force had lost its numerical superiority, and finally withdrew thus ending the battle. Aftermath Crüwell, however, had lost the opportunity to strike a heavy blow on 6 December as 4th Armoured Brigade (part of the 7th Armoured Divisionhttp://www.desertrats.org.uk/bde/4thABhistory.htm) made no move to close up to 22nd Guards Brigade; he waited too long, and on 7 December the 4th Armoured Brigade closed up.Murphy, W.

Richard's is best known to electrical engineers for the eponymous Richards' transformation. However, much of his career was concerned with radiation transport and fluid flow. Notably, he produced one of the earliest models of traffic waves on busy highways. Early life and education Richards was born in Orono, Maine in 1923. In 1943 he dropped out of his undergraduate course at Harvard after the first year to work at the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) set up on the campus at Harvard during World War II to research electronic countermeasures. At the end of the war, Richards was accepted back into Harvard as a Ph.D student without first completing his bachelor's degree. He received his Ph.D in physics in 1947 with a dissertation on commensurate line theory that marked the beginning of this field.Levy & Cohn, pp. 1056–1057 Career At RRL Richards worked on microwave filters, an important component of radar and countermeasures against it. This work formed the background for his commensurate line theory, although that theory was apparently not well developed enough at the time to be put to use in wartime work. The culmination of this theory was in his 1948 paper \\"Resistor-transmission-line circuits\\", after which Richards left the field of microwave engineering. The theory formed the basis of most transmission-line type microwave filters for at least the next thirty-five years and the design technique is still in use today. Richards' transformation, introduced in this work, is still found in modern textbooks on radio frequency filter design.For instance, Wen, pp. 255–256 During this period Richards also discovered a theorem in complex analysis now known as Richards' theorem which has applications in network synthesis.Wing, p. 122 Between 1947 and 1952 he was a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory helping to develop the magnetic time-of-flight mass spectrometer with Earl E. Hays and Samuel Goudsmit. From 1952 to 1954 he was director of research at Transistor Products Inc. From 1954 to 1968 he was senior physicist with Technical Operations Inc.Woolf, p.86 In 1956, while at Technical Operations, Richards produced a paper \\"Shock waves on the highway\\", one of the earliest theoretical models of traffic waves (there was another paper on this the previous year by Lighthill and Whitham in the UK, but Richards was apparently not aware of it and his work is independent). The traffic flow model described in this paper is now known as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model.Kerner, pp. 67, 82 From 1968 until his death on 19 November 1978 he was a senior scientist with Arcon Corporation. At Arcon he was primarily concerned with radiation transport, particularly neutrons. Editorships Richards was on the publications committee of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and was an editor of SIAM Review.

She is known for deriving cultural insights from scientific analysis of name usage, as well as creating innovative interactive tools to communicate these insights. Wattenberg is frequently quoted in the media on name-related topics. Writing, technology, and entrepreneurship Wattenberg began her career as a baby name expert in 2005, with the publication of The Baby Name Wizard. The book took a new approach to the topic of baby names, focusing on cultural usage over etymologies. Taking advantage of recently released historical data from the U.S. Social Security Administration, Wattenberg provided graphs and statistical analyses of historical name trends. Currently in its third edition, the book has sold over a quarter-million copies. Along with the book, Wattenberg publishes regularly on how names shed light on cultural issues. In addition to contributing to a blog accompanying _The Baby Name Wizard_, she is a frequent contributor to the Huffington Post and Slate. She is often quoted in the media on name news, on topics ranging from celebrity names to cultural implications of name trends. In 2008, Wattenberg co-founded a company, Generation Grownup, to provide news, analysis and tools for expectant parents and others interested in names. When it was acquired by CafeMom in 2014, the company's web properties had 1.5 million monthly unique users, had won awards, and became standard references for name information on the web. The Generation Grownup sites also feature a suite of technological tools for understanding name trends. The _Name Voyager_ was the first visualization of baby name trends. _Namipedia_ is a crowd-sourced encyclopedia of name information that contains entries on more than 40,000 names. The _Name Matchmaker_ provides a direct way for expectant parents to choose names. Cultural commentary Wattenberg's research-driven, analytical approach to understanding names and style has led to new insights into the connection between naming trends and society as a whole. As New York Times columnist David Brooks put it, \\"I didn’t become aware of the true import of names until I read Laura Wattenberg. She has taken her obsession with names ... and has transformed it into a window on American society.\\" For example, Wattenberg has found strong (and counterintuitive) relationships between partisan voting and baby name trends across states in the United States. Wattenberg supplements data analysis with historical research, tracing, for instance, how U.S. attitudes towards names have been intertwined with attitudes towards race for more than a century, and how gun-related names mirror attitudes toward firearms. A key theme in her work is how the common modern desire for a distinct name has led to \\"lockstep individualism\\" in which parents make the same choices even as they attempt to find unique names. Earlier work Wattenberg has an M.S. in psychology from Stanford University, and began her career as a researcher for the Business Enterprise Trust, where she wrote several Harvard Business School case studies on socially conscious business practices. From 1996 to 2002 she led design and development of high-growth technology products for Johnson & Higgins and Marsh & Mclennan.

Zhuj Selmani fought from his tower house (kulla) known as the tower of Sheremeti (Albanian: Kulla e Sheremetit). Surrounded by Montenegrin forces in his tower, he blew it up, killing himself and many of the enemy soldiers. Biography Zhuj Selmani was born in the village of Koshutan near Pejë, in the Rugova highland in 1844, Ottoman Kosovo. He was the son of Selman Muçë Zymeraj, from the Lucëgjekaj clan of the Muriqi brotherhood, part of the wider Kelmendi tribe. =1875 border clash= In 1878, Montenegrin forces attacked Zhuj Selmani and his friends in their tower. After many attacks and being surrounded tightly after many sieges, Zhuj Selmani was severely injured. When hearing upon that the Montenegrins were planning on taking them alive to Cetinje, he fired upon the gunpowder in the tower, killing himself and many of the Montenegrin forces. Oral sources reportedly said that Zhuj Selmani stayed in his tower for about 10 years. During this time, he often played the Lahuta, usually singing of the heroic acts of his predecessors. Zhuj Selmani managed to give his friends courage to resist when the Montenegrins attacked. He was around 30 years old and not married. Recently there was a celebration of his 138th anniversary, and a statue of him was placed in one of Peja's public squares. =Legacy= Selmani appears in Albanian folklore epic songs.

Official Report of the Eleventh Fruit Growers Convention of the State of California, 1889 No Bonnie Brae producing trees are known to currently exist, although there may be some still growing in Southern California that have not been identified as such. History Bonnie Brae lemons were first grown by Hiram Murray Higgins on his 76-acre Bonnie Brae Ranch in Bonita. Higgins had been a successful music publisher in Chicago, and moved to San Diego County for his health, and to get into the burgeoning citrus business in California. He purchased his ranch in 1871 and began cultivating citrus orchards.“It’s Fairly Easy to Get Bored Around Here,” San Diego Reader, Oct. 18, 2007 The Bonnie Brae lemon has been described as having a thin rind, oblong in shape, and seedless. Types List, http://typeslist.com Some speculated that the fruit was a lemon-lime hybrid, but Higgins claimed it was not. In 1889, Higgins described how his special variety of lemon came to be. “I went to San Francisco and bought two barrels of the finest Messina lemons, raised in Sicily; brought them home and let them rot in the barrels. Sowed the seeds in beds, transplanted in the nursery, and in due time into the orchard. When the trees came into bearing, I had every variety from the coarsest citron to the finest lemon, the Bonnie Brae. I took the Bonnie Brae up to San Francisco and submitted them to experts. They were astonished. They said it must be a cross with the lime, but it isn’t for there were no limes on the place.”“Bonnie Brae – Eating and Digesting the Soil – How the Bonnie Brae Lemon was Originated,” The Great Southwest, September 1889 In the same article, Higgins credited the San Diego climate and the soil on his ranch for the special lemon variety. Higgins budded the Bonnie Brae to lemon trees that had borne poor fruit, and also onto orange tree stock. He found the latter to be best. Acclaim In 1885, citrus expert William Spalding wrote, “My attention was first called to the Bonnie Brae by a plate of the fruit on exhibition in the Los Angeles Citrus Fair of 1880. So different was this fruit from other varieties of lemons on display that people were at a loss whether to class it as a lemon at all.”“The Orange: Its Culture in California; with a Brief Discussion of the Lemon, Lime and Other Citrus Fruits,” Press and Horticulturist Steam Print, Riverside, California, 1885 Bonnie Brae won the top ribbon at the 1885 New Orleans World's Fair. After the success of his groves, Higgins began to sell cuttings of his Bonnie Brae lemon trees to other interested growers. One of these was Henry Ernest Cooper, who named his orchards Bonita Ranch after a local pond called Bonita Laguna. The lemon industry was in full swing by the time a group of financiers bought out Cooper's groves and created the Sweetwater Fruit Company. During the 11th State Fruit Growers Convention, held at National City, California, in April 1889, it’s stated that “The largest and finest exhibition of lemons comes from the ranch of H.M. Higgins, on the Sweetwater Valley mesa. It consists of seedling lemons and the Bonnie Brae, a very thin skinned, juicy fruit of fine qualities, possessing many of the properties of the lime.” However, according to an 1889 interview with L.M. Holt, a citrus expert from San Bernardino, California, “It was thought that at one time [the Bonnie Brae] was going to revolutionize the lemon interests in Southern California. There were several parties who budded from that, and it was finally dropped, and have not seen any of that fruit for four or five years. I do not know if it is in existence to-day or not; yet it was a very fine fruit of its kind. But the Bonnie Brae is not the shape of a lemon; it is the shape of a lime.” Higgins died in 1897, age 77, and the Bonnie Brae Ranch was sold.“Images of America: Bonita,” by Steven Schoenherr, Mary E. Oswell, and the Bonita Museum and Cultural Center, Arcadia Publishing, Charleston, SC, 2009 Downfall of Lemon Industry In the early 1900s, a series of calamities severely hurt the lemon industry in San Diego. There was a water drought that began about 1912, a freeze in 1913, and a devastating flood in 1915. In a 1918 article, then Bonnie Brae Ranch manager C.J. Scott wrote, “But owing to this very thin rind and its habit for splitting, [the Bonnie Brae lemon] did not prove to be a good commercial variety. I have left but one [tree] of this variety standing as a memento to the famous lemon.”“Fifty Year Old Lemon Orchard, Example of Longevity,” California Citrograph, Vol. 4; December 1918 The Bonnie Brae Ranch made way for the Bonita Woods subdivision in 1961.

She is known for her controversial involvement with South African Airways and as a close friend of former president Jacob Zuma. During the Zondo Commission of inquiry into state capture the former Chief operating officer of Bosasa testified that Myeni received monthly illicit payments of R300,000 in cash from them, that was to be given to former president Zuma. On 27th May 2020 at the Pretoria High Court, Judge Ronel Tolmay declared Myeni a delinquent director, banning her for life from holding any directorship position. Background  Myeni obtained her Primary Teachers Certificate from Madadeni College and her a Secondary Teachers Diploma from Umlazi College. In 2009 the SAA annual report listed a bachelor's degree in administration from the University of Zululand among her qualifications. It was removed the following year after Myeni admitted she was “studying toward it” with two majors outstanding. She is listed as one of the participants in South African mining company Gold Fields' BEE partner Invictus Consortium. = Directorships = She founded a consulting firm Skills Dynamics in 1999 which has facilitated a number of social development programmes on behalf of various Government Departments and major corporations in and around Richards Bay. As of 2015 she was also a board member of the Jacob Zuma Foundation as well as vice-president of the African Water Association, Chairperson of the South African Association of Water Utilities and the Mhlathuze Water Board, Director of Trade and Investment Kwazulu-Natal. In May 2020 the Pretoria High Court declared Myeni a delinquent director and barred her from holding any directorship position at any entity for life after the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) and South African Airways Pilots Association (SAAPA) brought Myeni to court over her conduct and actions during her period as chairman of the South African Airways (SAA) board. Judge Ronel Tolmay concluded \\"This court cannot but find that she failed abysmally in executing her fiduciary duty. In my view, a lifelong delinquency order is appropriate. Ms Myeni is not a fit and proper person to be appointed as a director of any company, let alone a SOE\\".  South African Airways  Myeni was first appointed to South African Airway's board of directors in 2009. She was appointed chairperson of the board in 2012 following the simultaneous resignation of eight of its fourteen board members including the company's then chairperson Cheryl Carolus. In 2012/13 she had then acting chief executive, Vuyisile Kona removed from his position at the airline amid accusations that she organised the airline's security service to spy on him. In January 2014 six non-executive directors of the state-owned South African Airways wrote to the then minister for Public Enterprises, Malusi Gigaba, of their “major dissatisfaction” with Myeni's leadership. In March 2014 the new chief executive, Monwabisi Kalawe, accused Myeni of corruption after paying for documents that allegedly showed Myeni had foreign bank accounts worth €18.5-million. These documents were proven to be fake and lead to disciplinary proceedings against Kalawe. In May 2014 Myeni accused Kalawe of serious governance breaches. An accusation Kalawe disputed prompting Gigaba to state his “full confidence” in Kalawe following Gigaba's call for the state-owned airline to fix its long-troubled management problems. Gigaba went on to state that he would \\"deal with\\" Myeni for her dispute with Kalawe. Within a week of Gigaba's statement he was shuffled by president Zuma to the Department of Home Affairs. Gigaba was replaced by Lynne Brown as minister for Public Enterprises. Upon Zuma's request Brown replaced Myeni's critics at the airline and keeping Myeni in her position whilst instructing Myeni to reinstate Kalawe as chief executive. An instruction that Myeni ignored. In March 2015 South African Airways signed an agreement with Airbus as part of the airline's turn around plan to lease 5 Airbus A330s. In October 2015, without involving South African Airways executives, Myeni informed Airbus that the airway would be renegotiating the agreement to instead be an outright sale to an unnamed third party that would purchase the planes on SAA’s behalf. This raised concerns around corruption by-passing normal procurement process and triggered a clause in the original agreement that any renegotiation of the agreement would need to be approved by the Ministry of Finance. In an editorial Myeni stated that the reason why a third party rental company was needed was so as to mitigate the impact of volatile exchange rates on the running costs of the aircraft thereby reducing the airline's foreign currency exposure. In early December 2015 the then Minister of Finance, Nhlanhla Nene, rebuffed Myeni's request to renegotiate the deal. This was one of the suspected causes for controversial replacement of Nene as minister by president Zuma a week later with David van Rooyen. This caused a public outcry and a strongly negative reaction by international markets that led to van Rooyen's replacement four days later by the better known former minister of finance Pravin Gordhan (2009-2014). Gordhan rejected Myeni's request and instead announced that the original agreement to lease the planes would be implemented. =Delinquent director judgement= In March 2017, Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse and the South African Airways Pilots' Association (SAAPA) brought an application in the Pretoria High Court for an order to declare Dudu Myeni a delinquent director in terms of section 162(5) of the South African Companies Act 71 of 2008. The application was based on Myeni's conduct whilst chair of the SAA board. During those five years (2012/13 to 2016/17)‚ SAA ran up losses of R16.844bn‚ although it had previously been profitable. To ensure that the delinquency trial could be completed in the allotted five weeks, a decision was made to lead evidence on only two of the cases of alleged misconduct: the ‘Emirates deal’ and the ‘Airbus swap transaction’. Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse and the South African Airways Pilots' Association (SAAPA) called six witnesses against Myeni, including four former SAA executives. Myeni was the only witness in her own defence. In closing argument, the counsel for the plaintiffs, Advocate Carol Steinberg, said during her time at SAA, Ms Myeni blocked, delayed and obstructed important initiatives to turn the airline around. She broke the law and flouted basic governance principles. The evidence in court showed a pattern of repeated misconduct: dishonesty, obstruction and interference, improperly inserting middlemen and governance failures. Accused of bringing the embattled SAA to its knees, and based on her actions during her five-year tenure as chairperson of the SAA board, Myeni was declared a delinquent director and banned from holding any directorship position for life by Judge Ronel Tolmay at the Pretoria High Court on 27th May 2020. Strongly critical of Myeni’s actions Judge Tolmay commented “She was a director gone rogue, she did not have the slightest consideration for her fiduciary duty to SAA,”. As the presiding judge she concluded \\"This court cannot but find that she failed abysmally in executing her fiduciary duty. In my view, a lifelong delinquency order is appropriate. Ms Myeni is not a fit and proper person to be appointed as a director of any company, let alone a SOE,\\". The judge also awarded costs against Myeni. The judgement now goes to the National Prosecuting Authority so a criminal case can be pursued. =Zondo Commission= In 2019 the former chief financial officer of SAA, Phumeza Nhantsi, gave testimony at the Zondo Commission implicating Myeni in illegal activities when Myeni was chairperson of SAA.

The U Lazy S Ranch, formerly known as the Square and Compass Ranch, is a historic ranch in Garza County, Texas, USA. History The ranch was established as the Square and Compass Ranch in 1884. By 1901, when it was acquired by John Bunyan Slaughter, the ranch spanned 99,188 acres. Slaughter also purchased 5,000 cattle and brought 6,000 head of cattle he already owned. Additionally, he changed the name to his cattle brand, 'U Lazy S', which he had registered during the American Civil War. He built a ranchhouse in 1902 and acquired more acres, owning up to 126,227 acres a few years later. In 1906, he sold 50,000 acres to C. W. Post, who founded the new town of Post, Texas. In 1928, the ranch was inherited by Slaughter's son, John B. Slaughter, Jr., who was educated at the Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale University. According to historian William Curry Holden, \\"By 1936, 8,000 Hereford cattle grazed 100,000 acres of U Lazy S land.\\" The ranchhouse, a designated Texas landmark, burned down on January 13, 1936. The ranch was inherited by his nephew, John F. Lott and his niece, Mary Belle Lott Macy, in 1940. Lott split some of the acreage into farms. In 1949, Lott started flying an airplane to drive the cattle and spray herbicide. In the 1950s, the land was faced with a draught. By 1954, Lott planted 1,400 acres of guar to improve the land. He was also the first Texas rancher to use a roto-pitter to break up the rangeland. Two years later, in 1956, Lott's range improvement program had worked. In 1965, Macy split her section of the ranch and renamed it the Running M Ranch. Meanwhile, the U Lazy S Ranch was managed by Lott's son, Jack Lott. By 1966, the ranch spanned 90,000 acres. In October 1968, Lott and his wife hosted François Tombalbaye, the President of Chad, on his official visit to Texas. A year later, in 1969, they donated a carriage house from the ranch and US$10,000 to the National Ranching Heritage Center in Lubbock, Texas. In 1973, a fundraiser for the public library in Post, Texas was held on the ranch.

The cemetery opened in 1786 on a plot of land granted by an Act of Parliament the previous year. The cemetery has been expanded several times and now occupies a 15-acre (6-hectare) site which, prior to the expansion of London, was a rural area of Surrey. It is bounded to the east by Richmond Park and to the north by East Sheen Cemetery, with which it is now contiguous and whose chapel is used for services by both cemeteries. Richmond cemetery originally contained two chapels—one Anglican and one Nonconformist—both built in the Gothic revival style, but both are now privately owned and the Nonconformist chapel today falls outside the cemetery walls after a redrawing of its boundaries. Many prominent people are buried in the cemetery, as are 39 soldiers who died at the South African Hospital in Richmond Park during the First World War and many ex-servicemen from the nearby Royal Star and Garter Home. These residents are commemorated by the Bromhead Memorial, which lists the names of those who are not commemorated elsewhere, while the South African soldiers are commemorated by a cenotaph designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, derived from his design of the Cenotaph on Whitehall in central London. The war graves and the cenotaph are the responsibility of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. History and setting The cemetery was founded following the Richmond: Poor Relief, etc. Act 1785 (25 Geo.3 c.41), which granted Pesthouse Common, formerly owned by King George III, to Richmond vestry. A plot of 1.5 acres (0.6 hectares) was enclosed for a burial ground; a workhouse was also provided. The site was originally a simple square plot divided into four by footpaths; between 1865 and 1879, the cemetery expanded and subsumed the land between the original site and the workhouse, which was laid out in a grid format, and by 1894 the cemetery had further expanded onto a plot of land to the north, also in a grid layout. The cemetery now occupies an area of 15 acres (6 hectares), ten times its original size. In 1873 the local vicar built a wall to divide the consecrated ground (for Church of England devotees) from the unconsecrated ground (for Nonconformists and non-believers), but the move met with consternation in the local community and the wall was found torn down one morning. The vicar offered a reward for information as to the identities of the culprits but was apparently unsuccessful. There was never any attempt to rebuild the wall. The original plot contains many mature trees, including yews, cypresses, and several palm trees. Prior to the expansion of London, the site was originally in a rural and picturesque location, comparable to a smaller-scale Highgate Cemetery, and retains its rural feel today; author Darren Beach describes it as having \\"a decidedly rural feel\\", while historian Hugh Meller calls it \\"an unusually rural cemetery which in spring simulates a country churchyard\\". Richmond Cemetery originally contained two chapels, one of Church of England denomination and one for Nonconformists, both built in the Gothic revival style. The Church of England chapel (shown as \\"Richmond Community Chapel\\" on Richmond Council's map of Richmond and East Sheen Cemeteries) was built in 1875 to a design by Sir Arthur Blomfield and is a grade II listed building. It is constructed predominantly of Kentish ragstone with Bath stone embellishments. The front of the building has a buttressed arch above the main door, which bears the inscription \\"In the Garden was a new sepulchre, there laid they Jesus\\". Above the door are three lancet arches, and in the apex is a large wheel window. The roof is tiled, with the remains of a flèche evident. The chapel fell into disrepair, requiring restoration in the 1990s. It no longer fulfils its original purpose and houses a children's nursery. The Nonconformist chapel, to the north of the Anglican chapel, was sold in 1992 and was also restored in the 1990s. Its design is unusual for an English cemetery chapel, featuring significant plate tracery and decorative sculpture, but the architect is unknown. After a redrawing of the cemetery's boundary, it now stands outside the gates on Grove Road. Beyond the former Anglican chapel are old burial grounds that are now closed. The area called \\"Richmond Old Burial Ground\\" covers about four acres. It was first opened for burials in 1856, and most burials there took place between then and the First World War. Volunteers have now photographed and recorded the inscriptions on more than 1000 graves, recording the deaths of over 2000 people. To the east of the cemetery is Richmond Park, the two sites separated only by a five-metre (sixteen-foot, six-inch) strip of land known as the Freebord or \\"deer leap\\", owned by the Crown to protect the park's boundaries and allow access to the exterior of the wall for inspection and repair. Just to the north is East Sheen Cemetery. The two cemeteries are today joined, forming a contiguous area of graves, though the original boundary is still denoted by a holly hedge. The chapel in East Sheen Cemetery is now used for services for both cemeteries. Both cemeteries are now administered and maintained by Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council. The cemetery enjoys protected status as a result of designation as Metropolitan Open Land and (jointly with East Sheen Cemetery and Pesthouse Common) as a conservation area. Memorials The Bromhead Memorial Richmond Cemetery contains several significant memorials, including a granite tomb belonging to engraver William Harvey, originally set at a steep angle but since subsided, which is decorated by an incised palette in pink granite. The Prendergast family are commemorated by two crosses featuring floral-themed engravings According to Historic England, \\"Richmond Cemetery is unusually endowed with war memorials and war graves\\". An unusual number of recipients of the Victoria Cross—Britain's highest military honour for gallantry—are buried there. Two sections of the cemetery are dedicated to deceased residents of the Royal Star and Garter Home in Richmond. One is denoted by the Bromhead Memorial while the other—opened in 1994—is marked with a Christian cross by a local stonemason. Both plots contain standardised gravestones and do not allow personalised memorials. The Bromhead Memorial is a large monument close to the boundary with East Sheen Cemetery. Dedicated to Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Charles Bromhead and his wife Margaret, former governors of the home, it takes the form of a triptych with stone panels, in front of which is a low spine wall; both the spine walls and the panels in the triptych are engraved with the names of deceased ex-servicemen from the home who are not commemorated elsewhere. The whole memorial is set on a stone base with three steps, and at the very front is a sculpture of a seated lion. It was designed by Cecil Thomas and was unveiled in 1957 as a gift from the governor of the home in a ceremony presided over by Field Marshal Lord Alanbrooke and the Bishop of Southwark. It is a grade II listed building. South African Memorial among the war graves Another section is given over to war graves commemorating 39 soldiers who died at the South African Hospital which operated in Richmond Park during, and immediately after, the First World War; the section is marked by a Cross of Sacrifice and a cenotaph (the South African War Memorial). The cenotaph was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and is a grade II listed building. The design is derived from the Cenotaph on Whitehall, the most famous of Lutyens' memorials in Britain and the most influential on other First World War memorials. It is of coarse granite construction, with a springbok inscribed in the apex of the front and rear while the sides both carry a carved stone wreath; the only text inscribed on the monument are the phrases \\"union is strength\\" and \\"our glorious dead\\" on the front, and the same text translated into Dutch on the rear. The memorial was unveiled by South African General Jan Smuts on 30 June 1921. The war graves section is cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) on behalf of the South African government. The cenotaph became a focus for commemorations in the 1920s and 1930s, after which it appears to have been forgotten and was neglected until 1981 when the CWGC became aware of it and agreed with the South African government to take responsibility for its upkeep. There are a total 178 Commonwealth service personnel from both World Wars buried in this cemetery. CWGC Cemetery report.

It was a Śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism, Jainism and the Ājīvika school. They have been recorded in Buddhist and Jain texts. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were specialized in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own. Sources All of our knowledge of the Ajñana come from the Buddhists and Jain sources. The Ajñana view points are recorded in Theravada Buddhism's Pāli Canon in the Brahmajala Sutta and Samaññaphala Sutta and in the Sūyagaḍaṃga of Jainism. Along with these texts, the sayings and opinions of the Sceptics (ajñanikah, ajñaninah) has been preserved by Jain writer Silanka, from the ninth century, commenting on the Sutrakritanga. Silanka considers sceptics \\"those who claim that scepticism is best\\" or as \\"those in whom no knowledge, i.e. scepticism, is evident\\". Apart from the specific technical meaning, Silanka also uses the word ajñanikah in a more general sense to mean anyone who is ignorant. Origin The traces of scepticism can be found in Vedic sources such as in the Nasadiya hymn and hymn to sraddha (faith) in Rigveda. In Brahmanas and Early Upanishads doubt regarding a person's existence after death is cast, while the Yajñavalkya argued for the impossibility of knowing the ultimate reality or the atman. However the flourishing of sceptical thoughts seems to have occurred in a period with diverse, conflicting, and irreconcilable theories, regarding morality, metaphysics, and religious beliefs. It is natural, in the absence of a commonly accepted criterion of truth, for some people to wonder if any theory could be true at all. The Sceptics specifically pointed to the conflicting theories of atman and the requirement of omniscience, and hence the criticism of omniscience, to obtain true knowledge. A proliferation of view points existed during the period immediately preceding the rise of Buddhism, as attested in the Buddhist and Jain texts. The Buddhist Brahmajal Sutta lists four types (or schools) of Sceptics along with fifty- eight other schools of thought, while the Jain Sutrakrtanga lists sixty-seven \\"schools\\" of Sceptics among three hundred and sixty-three different schools of thought. While the list is artificially constructed according to Jain categories, the four main schools of thought, Kriyavada, Akriyavada, Ajnanikavada, and Vainayikavada, and their subgroups must have existed. Thus, philosophical Scepticism is thought to have appeared around this historic time frame. Jain account =On atman= The Ajñana claimed that the possibility of knowledge is doubtful since the claims to knowledge were mutually contradictory. Silanka quotes, \\"They posit the theory that since those who claim knowledge make mutually contradictory assertions, they cannot be stating the truth.\\" Regarding Sceptic's point of view, Silanka in his commentary writes, as translated by Jayatilleke: The conflicting theories of atman can be traced to Early Upanisads. The idea of atman \\"made of everything\\" (sarvamayah, idammayah adomayah) would be omnipresent (sarvagatam) (Brhadaranyaka 4.4.5) while the transcendent atman defined negatively (Brhadaranyaka 3.9.26) would not be so. Again at Katha 2.3.17 the atman is of \\"the size of a digit\\", while at Chandogya 3.14.3, the atman is \\"smaller than a kernel of a grain of millet\\". Again at Brhadaranyaka 2.3.1, Brahman which is identical with the atman is said \\"both to have form and also be formless.\\" Likewise at Katha 2.3.17 the atman \\"resides in the heart\\" while at Aitareya Aranyaka 2.1.4.6 it is located in the head. =On omniscience= In the same passage, Silanka continues: This criticism of omniscience seems to be directed at those teachers who claimed omniscience, or to their followers who later claimed them to be omniscient, specifically the Jain leaders and Purana Kassapa, and maybe later to Makkhali Gosala and the Buddha, on the basis of which they claimed to speak with authority. The dictum, that with a limited knowledge no one can know that any person is omniscient, may possibly be an old saying of the Sceptics; and they may have extended the idea to say that since human intellect was limited, no one could claim to know everything with such limited intellect. The passage may also be seen as a critique of epistemology. =On knowledge= In the same passage, Silanka further continues: To the Sceptics, none of the contending theories, proposed by limited intellect, can be known to be true, since they are mutually contradictory. Also, any new theory is bound to contradict existing theories, and hence cannot be true. Hence nothing can be known to be true. Thus the Sceptics conclude that the contradictions of metaphysics and the impossibility of omniscience leads them to accept Scepticism. In a similar vein, the Sceptics held that This may also be the reason why the Sceptics held to another dictum that Likewise, Silanka comments, \\"owing to the difficulty of knowing another's mind, they do not grasp what is intended by the words of their teacher and thus repeat the other's words like a barbarian without understanding the real meaning.\\" Regarding this passage and the maxims on knowledge, Jayatilleke compares the Sceptic's views with that of the Greek sophist Gorgias, as given in his book \\"Nature or the Non-existent,\\" and proposes that the Sceptics may have arrived at their position using similar lines of reasoning. According to Jayatilleke's interpretation of the passage given by Silanka, perception is divided into near, middle, and outer, and we perceive only the near; so each person's view of what they see of an object will be different according their perspective. Since our knowledge depends on our individual perspective, the knowledge would be subjective since different person will have differing perspectives. In the absence of objectivity, there is no knowledge and all private experiences of impressions of different individuals would be incommunicable. =Futility of knowledge = According to Silanka, This quotation suggests that the Sceptics preferred scepticism not just on intellectual basis, but also for pragmatic or moral reasons. What these disadvantages are, Silanka does not elaborate, but can be found in the Buddhist sources. Regarding the futility of knowledge, Silanka puts these questions of the Sceptics: The Sutrakrtanga affirms that the Sceptics \\"teach final beatitude and final deliverance.\\" Thus, the Sceptics may have contended that knowledge is not necessary for salvation but tapas, which seem similar to karmapatha. =On psychological states= Silanka in his commentary mentions sixty-seven types of Sceptics. However, these sixty-seven types are obtained combinatorially by taking nine categories (navapadartha) of Jainism, each with seven forms of predication (saptabhangakah), to give sixty- three (9 × 7) forms of sceptical questions, which were considered to represent sixty-three \\"types\\" of Sceptics asking these questions. The last four \\"types\\" were added to complete the list of sixty-seven types. However, according to Jayatilleke, these last four \\"types\\" may represent the kind of questions the Sceptics themselves might have asked. The last four questions are: # Who knows whether there is an arising of psychological states? # Who knows whether there is no arising of psychological states? # Who knows whether there is and is no arising of psychological states? # Who knows whether the arising of psychological states is impredicable? Such psychological speculations seem to be rife during this era, as evinced in Pali Nikayas, especially the Potthapada Sutta. Buddhist account In the Pali texts, the Sceptics are nicknamed Amarāvikkhepikas, which translates as \\"eel-wrigglers,\\" probably in reference to their \\"verbal jugglery.\\" They are collectively spoken of as \\"some recluse and brahmins who wriggle like eels. For when a question is put to them on this or that matter, they resort to verbal jugglery and eel-wriggling on four grounds.\\" Brahmajala Sutta describes four schools of Scepticism, the first three of whom advocated Scepticism on the basis of fear of falsehood (musavadabhaya), fear of involvement (upadanabhaya), and fear of interrogation in debate (anuyogabhaya), respectively, which all of them considered undesirable since it led to remorse or worry, and which led to a moral danger. While these three schools seem to have valued mental equanimity, it appears that the fourth school of Sceptics, associated with the philosopher Sanjaya Belatthiputta, did not share this value. A notable commonality among all these schools is the arrangement of propositions according to five-fold logic, alongside the usual two-fold mode and the four-fold mode (catuṣkoṭi) common in Pali Nikayas. The fifth mode is given as the denial of denials, that is, the rejection of the dialectician's view. =First school= The first school is described in the Brahmajala Sutta: In the absence of adequate information, the Sceptics prudently recommend suspension of judgement. The Sceptics felt that it was not just intellectual dishonest, but also morally dangerous not to do so. However, according to Jayatilleke, this was probably not a temporary suspension of judgement, until new information could come by to make a better evaluation; but rather it was meant to be a permanent state of affair by outright denying the very possibility of knowledge, and hence of questions regarding morality. Thus, their Scepticism is motivated by both intellectual as well as moral reasoning (i.e. fear of asserting falsehood due to ones prejudices). They seem to have contended that knowledge was not necessary for salvation but for karma-patha. =Second School= The second school of Sceptics is describe in Brahmajala Sutta in similar terms as the first, except that for them to be led to believe in a proposition by one's likes, desires, aversions, and resentments would be entanglement (upadanam), and such entanglement would be a source of worry (vighato) and as such a moral danger (antarayo). According to Jayatilleke, this group adopted Scepticism mainly due to morality, since to do so otherwise would lead to lead to worry and mental disquietude (vighata), and not necessarily due to the considerations of rebirth, as understood according to the Buddhist connotation of the word \\"entanglement\\". =Third School= In Brahmajala Sutta, the third school of Scepticism is shown to put forward such arguments in support for their view point: According to Jayatilleke, it is not clear from this passage if they wished to avoid debate because they were Sceptics or whether they adopted Scepticism because they wanted to avoid debate. According to him, it is probable that \\"they would have seen no point in debate since one was nowhere nearer the truth at the end of it and at the same time feared debate because it could result in loss of their mental equanimity with they valued.\\" =Fourth School= The fourth school of Scepticism described in Brahmajala Sutta is associated with Sanjaya Belatthiputta, whose views are also recorded in the Samaññaphala Sutta, since identical language is used to describe them. Sanjaya is described as a contemporary of the Buddha, as a well-known and celebrated teacher, and as a leader of a sect who was held in high esteem by the common folk. He is said to have taught Sariputta and Moggallana, before their conversion to Buddhism. In Brahmajala Sutta, this fourth school of Sceptics is described as thus: A similar account is given in the Samaññaphala Sutta. In both the accounts, the stupidity of this school is emphasised, highlighting the antipathy that the Buddhists felt about this school. In the Brahmajala Sutta, out of sixty-two philosophical schools mentioned, this school is singled out as being \\"a product of sheer stupidity;\\" whereas in the Samaññaphala Sutta, Ajatasattu singles out Sanjaya as \\"the most foolish and stupid.\\" Notable in this account of the fourth school of Scepticism is the lack of concern for good life and peace of mind, which the previous three schools regarded as desirable, and hence their advocacy of scepticism. Jayatilleke states that Sanjaya may have been a more thorough-going sceptic, to the point of being sceptical about a sceptic's way of life, and as such might have been a more vocal critic of his opponents and their regard for mental tranquillity, valued by the Buddhists as well. Judging by the propositions listed, Sanjaya's scepticism seems to have encompassed both metaphysics and morality. Sanjaya seems to grant the possibility of their truth, while denying the possibility of knowing this. Criticisms The Jains criticised the Sceptics by pointing out that their scepticism should lead them to the conclusion that they know nothing whatsoever, yet they assert the knowledge of their scepticism and claim to know such propositions as \\"ignorance is best\\". Silanka criticises the Sceptic's belief, that one cannot know what is on another's mind, saying \\"the inner mind of another can be apprehended by his external features, gestures, movements, gait, speech and the changes in his eyes and face.\\" Influence Although criticised by the Buddhists as eel-wrigglers, in the Pali canon, the Buddha is depicted negating various the four-fold logical alternatives or catuṣkoṭi when posed with metaphysical questions, which is similar to the logic employed by the Ajñanins. However, all four schools of Ajñanins arrange their logic as five- fold formula, which seems to be based on the acceptance of the four-fold formula. This may mean that such logical schema was a common feature of the pre-Buddhist era. Alternatively, since there is no known school of Indian thinkers apart from the Buddhist who adopted a four-fold logical schema, and since all Sceptical schools are depicted to have the five-fold formula of denial, which seems to be based on the acceptance of a four-fold form of predication, this may suggest the four-fold schema to be the Buddhist invention. Indeed, two of the foremost disciples of Buddha, Sariputta and Moggallāna, were initially the students of Sanjaya; and a strong element of skepticism is found in early Buddhism, most particularly in the Aṭṭhakavagga sutra. The catuṣkoṭi was later used as a tool by Nagarjuna to formulate his influential brand of Madhyamaka philosophy. Since skepticism is a philosophical attitude and a style of philosophising rather than a position, the Ajñanins may have influenced other skeptical thinkers of India like Nagarjuna, Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa, and Shriharsha . According to Diogenes Laërtius, the Greek philosopher Pyrrho developed his skeptical philosophy in India when Pyrrho was there during the conquest of Alexander the Great. Based on the so- called \\"Aristocles passage,\\" Jayatilleke draws many similarities between his philosophy and the Indian philosophies current at the time. In particular, he lists the following: Scholars including Barua, Jayatilleke, and Flintoff, contend that Pyrrho was influenced by, or at the very least agreed with, Indian scepticism rather than Buddhism or Jainism, based on the fact that he valued ataraxia, which can be translated as \\"freedom from worry\\". Jayatilleke in particular contends that Pyrrho may have been influenced by the first three school of Ajñana, since they too valued freedom from worry. If this is true, then the methods of the Ajñanins may be preserved in the extent work by Sextus Empiricus.

It was located in a rural area north of modern-day Potwin. No buildings remain at this former community site. History A post office named Plum Grove was established on July 1, 1870 in northwest Butler County, Kansas.Plum Grove; Kansas Post Offices, 1828-1961; Kansas Historical Society. The postmaster (and landowner) was John R. Wentworth and the post office was named for the established plum bushes near his homestead. This post office was located next to the East Branch of the Whitewater River near the modern day intersection of NW 110th Street and NW Buffalo Road. Over the next 2 years, some businesses were started at Plum Grove. On October 7, 1872 a county election passed funding bonds for a proposed railroad through the Whitewater River valley. The route was close to Plum Grove, so it was decided to move the tiny community west to ensure it would be next to the future railroad. Unfortunately, the financial panic of 1873 caused the rail project to be abandoned. Though it was a setback, the community continued to grow while it kept trying to get a rail depot.Railroad Meeting at Plum Grove; The Peabody Gazette; Page 3 of February 11, 1876. At its peak, Plum Grove had a maximum population of 60 or 100 (depending on source), several general stores, drug store, tree nursery, boarding house, blacksmith shop / livery barn / hog pens, saw mill, and a community water well.Plum Grove, Brainerd, Whitewater, and Potwin from 1870 to 1900; Roland H. Ensz; Emporia State University; 1970. In the spring of 1885, the McPherson branch of the Missouri Pacific Railroad was built east/west a few miles south of Plum Grove. Again a railroad failed to route through Plum Grove, then the community started to dissolve. Merchants, houses, people moved over time to one of the nearby new communities of Brainerd or Potwin,New town of Brainerd and Potwin; The Peabody Gazette; Page 4 of June 11, 1885. and a small number to Whitewater and Peabody. In 1887, the Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railway was built north/south about 5 miles west of Plum Grove, and it was the \\"final straw\\". The post office closed on October 31, 1888 and most lots were vacated by 1889. Afterward, the rural school was the only thing that remained. A new school was rebuilt at the site in 1895 and it served until 1955 when it was discontinued and the building was moved. The school water well was filled in the late 1960s, thus erasing the last evidence of Plum Grove.Plum Grove, Kansas: The Rise and Demise; Jerrol Kim Claassen; Kansas State University; 1982. Today, it is active farmland. Geography Plum Grove was located at the modern day intersection of NW 110th Street and NW Santa Fe Lake Road in northwest Butler County, Kansas, which is 3 miles north and 1 mile west of modern-day Potwin. It sits on the shared township boundary of Plum Grove and Milton. Education The modern day rural area around Plum Grove is served by the Remington USD 206 public school district, and the rural Frederic Remington High School is about 4 miles south of the former Plum Grove.

The chapel was built for the farmers working the surrounding fields. At the time, attacks from the sea were common. The chapel was partially damaged during World War II, with serious damage but large portions surviving. Today the church is a landmark in San Gwann, in architectural contrast with the modern housing of the area. History The exact date when Saint Margerita Chapel was built is unknown but it was around the event of the Great Siege of Malta. It was mentioned for the first time in an inscription of Monsignor Pietro Dusina in 1575, when he was sent by the papacy to inspect the sparse chapels on the Maltese islands. He found the chapel to be the property of a local man named Salvu Calleja who made sure that a Mass took place in the chapel once a year on the feast day of St. Margaret. However, according to the standards of an inspecting Monsignor, it was not suitable to be a place of worship, as it was not well kept and had no door. He ordered that the chapel not be used until a door was attached to the entrance.\\"Il-Kappella ta’ Sta Margerita “tal-Ħereb” - San Gwann\\", Kapelli Maltin - Maltese Chapels. In the inscription it is written:\\"San Gwann Malta\\". Saint Margaret Chapel was deconsecrated in 1605, since in the late 16th century and in the early 17th century attacks by the Ottoman Empire increased and the chapel fell into disuse. It was consecrated again in 1618 by Bishop Baldassare Cagliares. Bishop Michele Girolamo Molina in 1658 observed that it suffered serious neglect while abandoned, and Father Giacomo Pullucino took the initiative to restore the chapel, finishing in 1666. Pullicino died in 1680 and was allowed to be buried inside the chapel, as documented by Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa, the parish priest of Birkirkara. At the time San Gwann was a part of Birkirkara and consequentially San Gwann was originally part of Birkirkara parish, and ecclesiastical decisions were taken there.

He is also a long-term nonprogressor diagnosed in 1992. Levy is the CEO and founder of the Black and Latino AIDS Coalition, Inc (Blac NY), a community-based AIDS advocacy organization. It advocates on behalf of Black and Latino people with AIDS and their families and works for the prevention of HIV and AIDS. In 1998, Levy helped pass HIV Reporting and Partner Notification. It was the most controversial HIV legislation in New York State history. The legislation changed the way New York State tracked new HIV and AIDS cases via partner notification. Before the legislation, the federal government's Ryan White Program allocated money based on the proportion of patients with AIDS in each region. The highest number of AIDS cases was in New York City among white gay men. Consequently, the white gay population received the most money. The new legislation changed this allocation to give more funding to people who were newly diagnosed with HIV infection. A majority of people with HIV diagnoses were black and Latino heterosexuals. Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn sponsored a bill that required people infected with HIV to notify their sexual partners. Blac NY was the only AIDS organization in New York State to support the bill. Levy engaged in heated debates in the HIV community concerning the need for establishing a system of tracking HIV infection. Blac NY Dennis Levy, Rick Levy, and his brother Harry Levy founded the Black and Latino AIDS Coalition, Inc (Blac NY). It was one of the nation's first AIDS organizations for heterosexual black and Latino people living with AIDS. Blac NY was modeled after the national direct action advocacy group ACT UP and received financial assistance and technical help from Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC). Under Levy's leadership, Blac NY educated thousands of black and Latino heterosexuals about AIDS. He helped turn public attention to the crisis by writing about \\"AIDS in the hood\\".1998 Daily News Special (Archives) 'A Frontline Fight: Battling AIDS through education and advocacy' (Jay Mwamba)'Black and Latino AIDS Coalition of New York: Working to stop the spread of AIDS', Amsterdam Newspaper July 28, 1999. (R. McCullough) Levy challenged the mainstream AIDS establishment on the issues of mandatory reporting and partner notification. Dennis Levy was part of the changing face of AIDS as a heterosexual African American man. Heterosexual African Americans represented one of the largest and fastest growing populations for new AIDS cases. Levy addressed the homophobic fears of African American heterosexual men. Blac NY worked to get the help of black and Latino churches in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The effort resulted in over 30 national HIV/AIDS organizations and leaders calling for the development and implementation of a comprehensive national AIDS strategy. On July 13, 2010, the White House released the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), the nation's first comprehensive, coordinated HIV/AIDS roadmap with clear and measurable targets. Marijuana legalization For his AIDS, Levy began a regimen that included an antiviral therapy, but the therapy's side effects included disorientation and nausea and caused pain throughout his body. Nothing he tried reduced the side effects. A friend suggested Levy try smoking marijuana. Levy began smoking marijuana regularly and it helped him with his side effects from AIDS medicines and eliminated the incredible headaches he used to get. He discovered many people used marijuana for similar reasons. There is evidence that medical marijuana works. Levy decided to become an advocate for legal medical marijuana, so he founded the New York State Committee to Legalize Marijuana with Rick Levy. Dennis Levy became President and Rick Levy was Vice President of Social Media. Levy has worked with International social and political activist Dana Beal in advocating for the legalization of marijuana.  Politics  Levy is a member of the Green Party of New York. He was the Green party candidate for the New York State Assembly Seat of the convicted speaker Sheldon Silver in an April 19, 2016, special election. Levy faced Democratic candidate Alice Cancel, Republican Lester Chang, and Working Families Party candidate Yuh-Line Niou. Cancel won with 41% of the vote, besting Niou by 1,034 votes, with Chang and Levy together taking 23%.

Life  Emberger was born at Thann, in Haut-Rhin, France in 1897, which was then part of German occupied Alsace. He developed an interest in Natural History, exploring the Rhine plain of Alsace, and the nearby Vosges mountains. At the age of 17, to avoid conscription into the German army, he escaped to Lyons, in France. There he began studies in biologie at the University of Lyons, and obtained a degree in sciences naturelles in 1918. He obtained his doctorate under Professor Marie Antoine Alexandre Guilliermond, then head of the Department of Agricultural Botany, at Lyons. Following his studies, his first position was as an organic chemistry technician in the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy. There he produced his first publication in 1919 in the Bulletin de la Société Botanique de France, an account of his exploration at Grande Chartreuse. He began working as a pharmacist in 1920 and within a year had had six papers presented at the Académie des Sciences by Gaston Bonnier. In 1921 he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Montpellier. Within five years he had been appointed head of the botany department at the Institut scientifique de Rabat in Morocco (1926–1936). Returning to France he was, for a short time, professor at the Faculty of Science at Clermont-Ferrand, before once more taking a position in Montpellier, succeeding his step-father, Charles Flahault as head of the botany department (Directeur de l'Institut botanique de l'Université et du Centre d'Etudes phytosocio-logiques de Montpellier). There he worked closely with Josias Braun-Blanquet, also a student of Flahault. He remained in that position until his death at St Sulpice in Savoie in 1969.  Work  Emberger's scientific contributions cover four main areas of research, cytology, biogeography, comparative morphology and phylogeny, and biosystematics. His cytological work focussed on the ferns, horsetails, and the lycopods. His biogeographical work concentrated on the vegetation of the Mediterranean basin and in particular the western High Atlas region of Morocco. He published work on the distribution and classification of Moroccan flora, in particular, halfah grass (Stipa tenacissima). His Moroccan work also included studies on the altitudinal zonation of the mountain regions there and the phytogeography of the desert climate, in particular the argan tree (Argania spinosa). Other work included studies of association in equatorial forests, which led to a biogeographical classification of climate, in which he drew comparisons between Australia and homologous zones of the Mediterranean. In biosystematics he developed a classification scheme for vascular plants.  Selected publications   * see also Taxon.

The Bhagavata is a devotional account of the Supreme Being and His incarnations. Book 1 of the Srimad Bhagavata discusses the origin of the Bhagavata, and introduces the reader to the glories of Krishna as the Supreme Lord. This book consists of 19 chapters. The Bhagavata is authored by Veda Vyasa and the source material for this summary is the translation presented by Swami Tapasyananda.Swami Tapasyananda. Srimad Bhagavata Additional material and analysis is included. Gita Press. Srimadbhagavat MahapuranaGita Press. PadmapuranaGita Press. Narada Purana  Chapter 1 Introduction and background of the Bhagavata. * The Bhagavata is told by Suta to Saunaka Muni and others at Naimisaranya. * Purposes of reading the Bhagavata presented as questions  Purification by listening to the glories of Narayana.  Enjoying reading about Narayan's Avtars.  Dharma during Kaliyuga is devotion. Chapter 2 The importance of Bhakti (devotion) as it is the best path to the Supreme * Deconstruction of worldly reasoning and progress – frenzied activity leads to confusion while devotion leads to peace. * Devotion leads to supreme peace and happiness. * People worship based on their own thinking, desires, understanding  Worship of Krishna as the Supreme Being brings infinite benefits.  Worshippers of Pitris (Ancestors), and elemental powers get the finite rewards they seek (such as wealth and power) * These rewards ultimately come from Krishna alone. Chapter 3 First Avatar (Incarnation) of the Supreme Lord is the Purushavtara, as the form of the entire universe that is created and destroyed * 23 Other Main Avtars – Sanka and the Kumaras, Cosmic Boar, Devarishi Narada, Rishis Nara and Narayana, Kapila, Dattatreya, Yajna, Rishabha, emperor Prithu, Divine Fish, Tortoise, Dhanvantari, Mohini, Nrisimha (Man-Lion), Vamana, Parasurama, Veda-Vyasa, Ramachandra, Balarama and Krishna, Buddha, Kalki * There are an infinite number of Avtars * Krishna is referred to as the ‘complete’ Avatar * The Supreme Being creates and destroys the universe, but is not affected by the process of creation and dissolution. * Maharishi Veda Vyasa wrote the Bhagavata  Vyasa taught the Bhagavata to Shuka Rishi (Vyasa's son)  Shuka Rishi taught the Bhagavata to King Parikshit, where the Suta listened  This version is the Suta's narration Chapter 4 Illustration of the spiritual greatness of Suka Rishi * Vyasa re-edited the Vedas for people to understand during Kaliyuga  Vyasa wrote the Mahabharata to teach people the lessons of the Vedas  The Mahabharata covers Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha, but does not cover Bhakti (devotion). * Even after composing the Mahabharata (with 125,000 verses), Vyasa still felt unsatisfied. Vyasa guessed that this was because the Mahabharata did not cover the devotional aspects of Krishna.  Narada arrives at Vyasa's Ashram. Chapter 5 Narada explains that Vyasa feels incomplete because of not writing about Bhakti (devotion) and the glories of the Supreme Lord and His incarnations. * Narada describes the importance of Bhakti as the easiest and best path to the Supreme and the best way to escape from the pitfalls of Samsara (worldly life). * Story of Narada before reaching the status of Devarishi Narada  Highlights the importance of serving Holy Men in order to develop Bhakti. * Narada describes that even though action (Karma) is usually a cause of bondage, Karma dedicated to God leads to Bhakti. Chapter 6 Continuation of Narada's story (of his previous life)  After Narada's mother suddenly died, Narada turned completely to spirituality, but was unable to see Vishnu in that form  Narada was reborn as Devarishi Narada in the current Kalpa (cycle of creation)  Devarishi Narada travels the universe singing Narayana's praises Chapter 7 Vyasa enters into Samadhi and realized that Bhakti is the easiest way to eliminate the sufferings of Avidya (ignorance of the spiritual Truth) and achieve spiritual bliss  Vyasa wrote the Bhagavata Purana * Even though Suka Rishi was already fully absorbed in the abstract Self, Devarishi Vyasa taught the Bhagavata to his son, Suka Rishi * At the end of the Mahabharata war, Ashwattama (one of Duryodhana's allies) tried to destroy the victorious Pandavas. However, Ashwattama accidentally killed the Upa-Pandavas (the 5 children the Pandavas had by Draupadi).  Arjuna captures Ashwattama, but is reluctant to kill Him, as Ashwattama is the son of Drona (the teacher of the Pandavas) and Draupadi does not Drona's wife (Kripi) to suffer in the way that she is suffering.  Krishna instructions to Arjuna to punish Ashwattama without killing him. Chapter 8 While Parikshit was still in Uttara's womb, Ashwattama tried to destroy him, so as to destroy the Pandavas’ lineage. * Uttara prays to Krishna to protect her fetus  Krishna saves the Pandavas’ lineage and Uttara's fetus (Parikshit). * Kunti praises Krishna both for His actions on earth and as the Supreme Person  Kunti asks Krishna to make her mind detached from material objects and become continuously absorbed in Krishna * Krishna is about to leave for Dwaraka, but Yudhishthira stops Him, as he blames himself for the destruction caused by the war. Chapter 9 Krishna and the Pandavas go to Bhishma (where he is lying on the bed of arrows after the end of the Mahabharata War) so that Yudhishthira can learn about the duties of a king * Bhishma praises Krishna  As Time, the Supreme Being controls all  Krishna is only seen as the Supreme by those who Krishna allows  Bhishma asks for complete devotion to Krishna  Bhishma thinks of Krishna's form and actions as he sees them during the War * Bhishma leaves his body while looking at and thinking of Krishna Chapter 10 Krishna leaves for Dwaraka and all the inhabitants of Hastinapura are greatly saddened that Krishna is leaving them * Krishna's praises by the women of Hastinapura as He is leaving  Krishna is the Supreme  Krishna creates, upholds, and dissolves the universe as a game, but is unaffected by it  Krishna incarnates to destroy evil  Dwaraka has even surpassed Heaven, as Krishna is living there  How lucky Krishna's wives are Chapter 11 Krishna arrives in Dwaraka  Dwaraka is instantly enlivened when Krishna returned, as everyone there lives for Krishna  Glories, beauties, and decorations of Dwaraka * All the citizens of Dwaraka instant left whatever they doing and ran to meet Krishna when they heard the sound of His conch. * Depth of love of Krishna's wives for Krishna * Krishna welcomes each individual in the correct way, according to his/her position, age, and status Chapter 12 (Continuation of the incident in Chapter 8) How Krishna saves Parikshit  Krishna enters Uttara's womb in His supreme 4-armed form scaled down to the size of a thumb, and dissipates the power of the Brahma-missile released by Ashwattama  Parikshit (as a 10-month-old fetus) sees Krishna  Parikshit is born due to Krishna's grace and protection * To celebrate, Yudhishthira gave numerous valuable gifts to Brahmanas * Brahmanas predict what Parikshit will do – both his glories in life and his death * Parikshit is called Parikshit as he is always trying to verify that the Krishna who saved him is same as Krishna the Supreme Being Chapter 13Vidura learns about the Atman from Maitreya as he had gone on a pilgrimage to avoid the Mahabharata War * Vidura returns to Hastinapura * The Pandavas rule justly for 36 years and the citizens are content * Vidura tells Dhritarashtra that Time (Death) is approaching  One should not have attachment to the body and sense objects.  The wise man renounces after all his work is completed.  Vidura, Dhritarashtra, and Gandhari leave for the forest silently, without letting anyone know * Yudhishthira is depressed at the departure of Vidura, Dhritarashtra, and Gandhari * Narada arrives and instructs Yudhishthira  The world is controlled by the Supreme  Time (Death) cannot be stopped  People must follow the path created for them  Importance of renunciation after one's work is done – do not call back one who has renounced the world Chapter 14 Yudhishthira sees bad omens and worries that the time for Krishna to end His incarnation has come * Arjuna returns from Dwaraka in a greatly distressed and confused state * Yudhishthira asks Arjuna numerous questions about the reasons for his dejection and of the well-being of people in Dwaraka Chapter 15 Arjuna is dejected and weak because of Krishna ending His incarnation (and thus not being there with Arjuna) and is lamenting because of His complete love of and dependence on Krishna * Arjuna's report to Yudhishthira  Without Krishna, Arjuna could not even defeat a small band of herdsmen.  This life is meaningless without Krishna.  Arjuna lists all his achievements (such as Draupadi's Swayamvara and the Mahabharata War) and how they were due to the actions and grace of Krishna alone.  Arjuna remembers his life with Krishna, all that Krishna did for him.  With Krishna, Arjuna could defeat everybody and have complete victory. Without Krishna, Arjuna has lost all his skills.  Krishna has caused the Yadavas to destroy themselves in order to lighten the burden of the earth.  Krishna is the cause of all power, achievement, and success. * Through intense devotion, Arjuna remembered the teachings of the Geeta, and viewed himself as the Atman. * The Pandavas renounce the Kingdom after finding out that Krishna has left and dissolve the sense of attachment with the body and the world.  Parikshit is made King.  The Pandavas soon become absorbed into Narayana. * The day Krishna left His earthly form is the start of Kaliyuga (the age of sin and degradation). * Anyone who listens to and believes this account with faith will have devotion to Krishna and be freed from the cycle of Samsara (birth and death). Chapter 16 Parikshit's life and glories (all of which are due to Krishna). * Parikshit greatly enjoyed listening to the glories of Krishna, especially the story of how Krishna saved him. Parikshit gave numerous gifts to those who sang Krishna's praises and stories. * There is no point in excess chatter about things. Time is much better spent discussing the glories of Krishna. * Earth (in the form of a cow) and Dharma (in the form of a bull) discuss the coming of Kali, and the problems that this will bring, now that Krishna has left.  Destruction of the family and social order.  People will be completely attached to material life without thoughts of spirituality. * Earth praises Krishna as having all good qualities, including those required for both spiritual progress and earthly power.  Krishna is truth, kindness, generosity, infinite happiness, physical and mental strength, knowledge, courage, lordship, intellectual power, beauty of form, faith, and lovability. * Without Krishna, who has all good qualities and has purified the earth, the degradation into Kaliyuga will be unrestrained. Chapter 17 Parikshit sees Dharma and Earth being tortured by Kaliyuga (personified). * In Kaliyuga, the one with a stick and a loud voice (rather than knowledge and good qualities) will prevail. * Parikshit and Dharma converse about the coming of Kaliyuga. * Different groups have different views about what causes the enjoyments and sufferings one is undergoing.  Some say that people decide their own futures  Others say that the planets do this  Others say that it is Karma  Others say that it is Nature  The few who understand know that everything is under the control of the Supreme Being * Thinking about something causes the same experience as doing it. * Parikshit captures Kali and banishes him from the kingdom. Kali can only live in 5 evil places:  Places where people gamble excessively  Places where people drink alcohol in an unrestrained manner  Places of slaughter  Places of excess, unrestrained sensual enjoyment  Money, especially money that is unfairly obtained Chapter 18 Parikshit did not kill Kali as there are some great qualities of Kaliyuga  In Kaliyuga people get rewarded for good instantly (but sins are not punished until later)  Only incorrect actions are punishable; incorrect thoughts are not * Kali attacks those of weak resolve whom he can sway, but does not affect those who are genuinely good and have a strong resolve to stay on the correct path * The Bliss of Krishna's glories is far above that of worldly enjoyments and also Heaven.  The Ganga is the water that Brahma poured on Vishnu's feet, and has the power to purify the world because of Vishnu's powers. * Parikshit goes to the forest and feels thirsty  He enters a sage's ashram and asks for water.  However, the sage does not notice as he is in deep meditation (Samadhi).  In anger, Parikshit places a dead snake on the sage to test if he is actually in Samadhi (deep meditation) or someone pretending.  Parikshit is cursed by the sage's son for insulting his father. * Parikshit will be bitten by Takshaka (a very poisonous snake) within 7 days. * The sage reprimands his son for cursing Parikshit, stating the importance of the King for the protection of the country. * The sage did not feel even slightly antagonized towards Parikshit for placing the dead snake, as Holy Men are above happiness and sadness, praise and insult. Chapter 19 Parikshit is deeply repentant for this mistake. * Parikshit does not mind if the curse destroys everything of his, but wants his sin to be erased and his mind never to turn against Holy Men again. * Parikshit sees the curse as a good thing, as it will force him renounce. * Parikshit leaves the kingdom to his son and goes to the banks of the river Ganga. * A large number of great sages assemble and Parikshit praises them. * The sages bless Parikshit. * Parikshit asks the sages what he (one who knows that he is about to die in 7 days) should do. * Sri Suka, the son of Vyasa arrives.  Suka Rishi is an Avadhuta (one who travels with no attachment to the body, fully absorbed in the Atman).  Suka Rishi's body is very handsome and in perfect condition even though he does not care for it. * Parikshit is very happy that Suka Rishi, a very great sage, has come. * Parikshit asks Suka Rishi what he (one who knows that he is about to die) should do.

Completed in 1943, the ship spent all of 1944 in the Norwegian waters and was twice damaged by British aircraft attacking the battleship . She escorted troop convoys from northern Norway when the Germans began evacuating the area beginning in October. Z34 was transferred to the Baltic with two of her sister ships at the beginning of 1945 and participated in the Action of 28 January 1945 when they were intercepted off the Norwegian coast by a pair of British light cruisers. The ship was only lightly damaged during the battle and all three destroyers were able to disengage. Over the next several months, she escorted evacuation convoys and German cruisers as they bombarded Soviet positions. She also attacked Soviet troops with her own guns. Z34 was badly damaged by a Soviet torpedo in mid-April and had to be towed to port for emergency repairs. They sufficed to allow her to take a group of refugees and cut-off troops to Denmark in early May. The ship was surrendered to the Allies in Germany and was allocated to the United States when they divided up the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine. Still not fully repaired from the torpedo hit in 1945, the ship was scuttled in early 1946. Design and description The Type 1936A (Mob) destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936A class and had a heavier armament. The class had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of and a maximum draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by six Wagner water-tube boilers. The ships had a design speed of , and their maximum speed was . The Type 1936A (Mob) destroyers carried enough fuel oil to give a range of at a speed of . The crew of the ships numbered 11–15 officers and 305–21 enlisted men, plus an additional 4 officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The Type 1936A (Mob) ships were armed with five TbtsK C/36 guns in a twin-gun turret forward and three single mounts with gun shields aft of the main superstructure. Their anti-aircraft armament varied and Z34s consisted of four Flak M42 guns in a pair of twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and ten C/38 guns in two quadruple and two single mounts. The ships carried eight torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes was provided for each mount. They had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchgerät) was fitted to detect submarines. A S-Gerät sonar was also probably fitted. The ship was equipped with a FuMO 24/25 radar set above the bridge as well as a FuMB 34 radar detector. =Modifications= A FuMO 63 Hohentwiel radar was installed in 1944–1945 in lieu of the aft searchlight. Before 31 March 1945, a pair of RaG anti-aircraft rocket launchers were fitted. By the end of the war, Z34s light anti-aircraft gun armament consisted of one to three , six 3.7 cm and sixteen 2 cm guns. Service history Z34 was first ordered from Seebeckwerft (yard number 666) as a Type 1938B destroyer on 28 June 1939, but the Kriegsmarine cancelled the order in September 1939, re-ordering the ship from AG Weser (Deschimag) (yard number W1004) as a Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer on 19 September 1939. The ship was laid down at Deschimag's Bremen shipyard on 14 January 1941 and launched on 15 May 1942. Construction was slowed by shortage of manpower and materials and Z34 was not commissioned until 5 June 1943. The ship sailed to Norway shortly after she finished working up on 1 November. The following month, she was one of the escorts for the battleship during Operation Ostfront on 25 December, an attempt to intercept the British Convoy JW 55B that was bound for the Soviet Union. All of the battleship's escorts were detached the following day to increase the likelihood of intercepting the convoy and thus did not participate in the ensuing Battle of North Cape. Z34 remained in the Arctic throughout 1944 to defend the damaged battleship Tirpitz. Z34 was damaged during British airstrikes on 17 July and 29 August; her crew helped to put out a fire aboard the oil tanker during the latter attack. Beginning in October, the ship escorted convoys during Operation Nordlicht, the evacuation of northern Norway. On 1 December, she towed a damaged troopship into Hammerfest and then continued on to Tromsø where she began a refit on the 11th. On 22 January 1945, , Z34 and , laid minefields in Magerøya, Laafjord, and Brei Sounds. On 25 January the three destroyers departed Tromsø for the Baltic. Three days later they were intercepted by a squadron of British ships, including the light cruisers Diadem, and Mauritius off the Sognefjord. During the ensuing Action of 28 January, Z31 was heavily damaged and the lightly damaged Z34 made several fruitless torpedo attacks on the cruisers to cover Z31s withdrawal. Laying smoke as they withdrew, the faster destroyers were able to outpace the cruisers and take shelter in Aspofjord protected by German coastal artillery. Z34 was only lightly damaged during the engagement and ferried 200 artillerymen from Kiel to Gotenhafen on 3 February. A week later she escorted the heavy cruiser as the latter bombarded Soviet positions near Frauenburg in support of the 4th Army. Over the next several months, Z34 evacuated refugees from Kolberg, escorted the heavy cruisers Admiral Scheer, Lützow, and during their bombardment missions, and bombarded Dievenov and Tolkemit herself. During the former action, the ship was credited with the destruction of twelve tanks and four anti-tank guns. She was lightly damaged by Soviet aircraft on 29 March. Two days later, Z34 was the first German ship to engage aircraft with her rockets. In early April, the ship escorted the ocean liners and as they carried 17,000 refugees to Copenhagen, Denmark. Z34 began a brief refit on 4 April at Swinemünde and bombarded Soviet positions near Grossendorf on the 10th. During a duel with a Soviet coastal artillery battery at Oxhöft, a 15 cm shell prematurely detonated in the barrel and destroyed the gun. It was replaced by a weapon taken from the decommissioned . While returning to Hela after another escort mission, the ship was attacked by two Soviet motor torpedo boats on the night of 15/16 April. She evaded one torpedo, but was struck by another. The hit flooded the aft turbine room, disabled both turbines, knocked out all power, and gave the destroyer a list to port. While drifting the next day, Z34 was attacked by Soviet aircraft and an anti-aircraft rocket detonated on deck, killing eight crewmen and wounding fourteen. She was towed into Swinemünde by the torpedo boat and the minesweeper where she received emergency repairs. The ship also had her light anti-aircraft armament augmented by weapons taken from the wreck of Lützow. On 4 May she arrived at Copenhagen with a full load of refugees and was decommissioned at Kiel on the 10th. Z34 was allocated to the United States when the Allies divided the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves in late 1945. Due to her poor state of repair, the United States Navy declined to make use of the ship and she was scuttled in the Skaggerak on 26 March 1946 with a load of chemical munitions aboard.

It consists of the words \\"SELL THE HOUSE SELL THE CAR SELL THE KIDS\\", stenciled in black, block letters in alkyd enamel on an off-white painted aluminum and steel plate measuring 84 x 72 inches (213.4 x 182.9 cm). The quotation is from the 1979 Francis Ford Coppola movie Apocalypse Now, where it is written in a letter mailed home by a character who has lost his mind in the jungle. The work (a first version of which exists on paper) was originally displayed in April 1988 at a collaborative show in the East Village at the 303 Gallery, along with three urinals sculpted by artist Robert Gober. It was purchased, with the urinals, by its first owners Werner and Elaine Dannheisser, who are thought to have paid around $7,500 for the painting (according to a later estimate by Bloomberg Business). \\"It was probably the painting of the year\\", said Richard Flood, chief curator of the New Museum, who said its text served as \\"a kind of late-'80s mantra\\" in the wake of the 1987 \\"Black Monday\\" stock market crash.Flood, Richard. Wool Gathering, Parkett, no. 83, 2008, p. 142. Retrieved January 5, 2016. To critic Kay Larson, the stark formatting and \\"fractured code\\" of Wool's syntax in Apocalypse Now conveys a warning of disaster \\"in the coldest terms\\" and with \\"telegraphic urgency\\". Peter Schjeldahl has written about the \\"hiccup in comprehension\\" caused by the elimination of standard spacing and punctuation. The painting is unusual in Wool's output for having a title, and Flood has observed that the word \\"apocalypse\\" itself originally connoted \\"revelation\\", the disclosure of knowledge and the lifting of a veil. Apocalypse Now was exhibited in the Whitney Biennial of 1989. After the Museum of Modern Art turned down Elaine Dannheisser's 1996 offer of its donation—at the time, the painting was probably valued at under $80,000, and MOMA already owned a Wool—the painting was owned by a series of prominent collectors, beginning in 1999 when it entered the collection of Donald L. Bryant, Jr. in St. Louis, Missouri. In 2001, according to former Christie's auctioneer Philippe Ségalot, Bryant confided that \\"my wife hates it. She can’t live with a work that says ‘SELL THE HOUSE SELL THE CAR SELL THE KIDS.’ So do you know anyone who might want to buy it?\\" Ségalot engineered a 2001 sale to François Pinault, owner and chairman of Christie's auction house, for approximately $400,000. Pinault sold it four years later to hedge fund manager David Ganek (of Level Global Investors) for approximately $2 million. Ganek was reported to have taken bank loans out against the painting, which changed hands again shortly before a Christie's auction on November 12, 2013, where it sold for $26,485,000 to an unnamed buyer. In its lot description, Christie's described the painting as \\"timeless and affecting, imposing and arresting\\" and \\"of robust relevance today\\". The sale of Apocalypse Now broke the previous Christopher Wool auction record of £4,913,250 ($7,758,022) set in February 2012 by Untitled ('Fool'). The record was in turn eclipsed in May 2015 when Untitled ('Riot'), a work Wool painted in 1990, sold for $29,930,000 at Sotheby's. An unnamed European curator told The Art Newspaper that Wool's reputation as a blue-chip \\"must-have artist\\" was established by a 2008 limited edition monograph issued by Taschen, but that his market inventory, in relatively short supply, was at risk of being controlled (like that of Jean- Michel Basquiat) by a small, powerful clique of collectors.

Completed in 1942, the ship spent most of her brief career deployed in France. She participated in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay at the end of 1943 before she was accidentally rammed by the destroyer in early 1944. Towed back to port, the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) decided that Z37 was too badly damaged to repair and disarmed her hulk. Decommissioned later that year, she was scuttled by her crew before being scrapped by the French in 1949. Design and description The Type 1936A (Mob) destroyers were slightly larger than the preceding Type 1936A class and had a heavier armament. They had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of and a maximum draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller shaft, were designed to produce using steam provided by six Wagner water-tube boilers. The ships had a design speed of , but their maximum was . The Type 1936A (Mob)-class destroyers carried enough fuel oil to give a range of at a speed of . The crew of the ships numbered 11–15 officers and 305–21 enlisted men, plus an additional 4 officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship. The Type 1936A (Mob) ships were armed with five TbtsK C/36 guns in a twin-gun turret forward and three single mounts with gun shields aft of the main superstructure. Their anti-aircraft armament varied and Z37s consisted of four Flak M42 guns in a pair of twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and seven C/38 guns in one quadruple and three single mounts. The ships carried eight torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. A pair of reload torpedoes was provided for each mount. They had four depth charge launchers and mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. A system of passive hydrophones designated as 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchgerät) was fitted to detect submarines. A S-Gerät sonar was also probably fitted. Z37 was equipped with a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24 radar set above the bridge. =Modifications= Another quadruple 2 cm mount replaced the forward single 2 cm gun sometime after early 1943. The ship was fitted with a FuMB Metox radar detector after commissioning. Service history Z37 was first ordered from Oderwerke Stettin as a Type 1938B destroyer on 26 June 1939, but the German Navy cancelled the order in September 1939, re-ordering the ship as yard number G627 from Germaniawerft as a Type 1936A (Mob) destroyer on 19 September 1939. The ship was laid down at Germaniawerft's Kiel shipyard on 2 January 1940 and launched on 24 February 1941. Construction was slowed by shortage of manpower and materials and Z37 was not commissioned until 16 July 1942. On 23 January 1943 Z37 set out as part of the escort for the battleship and heavy cruiser from the Baltic sea to Norway, but the operation was cancelled when the force was spotted by British aircraft. On 5 March 1943, the 8th Destroyer Flotilla (, , and Z37) was transferred via the English channel to the French Atlantic coast in Operation Karin. Despite attacks by British coastal artillery and motor torpedo boats, the Flotilla managed to pass through the Straits of Dover unscathed, but Z37 ran aground at Le Havre on 6 March, damaging her starboard propeller, and was under repair until 18 March. On 28 March, Z37 was one of four destroyers that formed the distant escort for the Italian blockade runner Himalaya setting out from Bordeaux for the Far East, with 9 torpedo boats providing a close escort, but the force turned back when spotted by British air reconnaissance. On 30 March, Z37, together with the destroyers Z23, Z24 and Z32, set out to meet the incoming blockade runner Pietro Orseolo. Heavy British air attacks were repelled, but Pietro Orseolo was damaged by a torpedo from the American submarine before reaching safety in the Gironde estuary on 2 April. On 9 April, Z37 set out on another attempt to cover the break out of Himalaya, but again this was foiled by British air attacks. On 24 December 1943, six destroyers of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla (Z37, Z23, Z24, and ) and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla (of six torpedo boats) set out to meet the blockade runner Osorno, meeting her on 25 December. They managed to escort Osorno to the Gironde despite heavy air attack, but Orsono struck a submerged wreck and had to be beached to save her cargo. On 26 December, the 8th Destroyer Flotilla, again including Z37 (but without ZH1) and the 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla set out again to meet another inbound blockade runner, Alsterufer. Unbeknownst to the Germans, Alsterufer was attacked and set on fire by a B-24 Liberator bomber of No. 311 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF on 27 December and was abandoned by her crew. At about midday on 28 December, the British cruisers and , on patrol in the Bay of Biscay to intercept blockade runners, encountered the German destroyers and torpedo boats, resulting in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay. Heavy seas prevented the German force from using its theoretical advantages in speed and firepower, with the destroyer Z27 and the torpedo boats and sunk. Z37 fired six torpedoes against the British cruisers, all of which missed. On 30 January 1944, Z37 was carrying out exercises in the south of the Bay of Biscay with Z23 and Z32 when she collided with Z32. One of Z37s torpedoes exploded, starting a fire which set off some of her anti- aircraft ammunition and caused extensive flooding. She was towed back to Bordeaux, but the damage was considered too severe for repair, and her guns were removed to strengthen the shore defences of the Gironde estuary, with her crew being deployed as ground troops. She was decommissioned on 24 August and then scuttled. Her wreck was broken up in 1949.

She was laid down in 1941, and completed two years later. Her anti-aircraft armament was modified heavily under Project Barbara. She served with the 4th Destroyer Flotilla her entire time under German service, and spent much of her life escorting task forces, patrolling, laying mines, and bombarding land forces. She served in the Baltic briefly in 1943, before being reassigned to the Arctic area around Norway from 1943 to 1945, and then serving in the Baltic again in 1945. After the war, she was taken by the Royal Navy, renamed Nonsuch, the sixth ship of her name. She was used for extensive machinery trials, before being used to test a charge, which broke her keel and flooded her. She was too damaged to refloat, and instead sold to Arnott Young & Co., on 8 November 1949, to be scrapped. Design and armament Z38 was long at the waterline and long overall, had a beam of , a freeboard of , and a draft of . She had a displacement of at standard load, and at full load. She had a complement of 332. She had 15 watertight compartments, and carried of oil. Before her Project Barbara modifications, Z38 was armed with a twin L/48 gun in a turret forward (200 rounds of ammunition), three single L/48 guns in a gunhouse on her aft (600 rounds), ten (20,000 rounds), four anti-aircraft guns (8,000 rounds), two quadruple torpedo tubes, and 60 mines. After her modifications, she carried sixteen 2 cm guns and six 3.7 cm guns, and the rest of her armament was unchanged. Her propulsion system consisted of six Wagner boilers feeding high-pressure superheated steam (at and ) to two sets of Wagner geared steam turbines. These gave the ship a rated power of , and a top speed of . She had a range of , at her cruising speed of . Z38 was fitted with a FuMO 21 radar on her bridge, and four FuMB 4 Sumatra aerials were placed around the searchlight platform on her foremast. She had a degaussing coil around her forecastle. Service history Z38 was ordered on 19 September 1939; was laid down by Germaniawerft in Yard G628 in Kiel in 1941; was launched on 5 August 1941, and was commissioned on 20 March 1943. Z38 was immediately assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. In August 1943 Z38 served as a practice torpedo retrieval boat for the training cruisers Nürnberg and Emden. On 24 September Z38 travelled from Sassnitz to Trelleborg, to escort Lützow during Operation Hermelin, alongside German destroyers Z5 Paul Jacobi, Z14 Friedrich Ihn, Z15 Erich Steinbrinck, and Z27. On 22 October Z38 left Swinemünde for Kaafjord. On 25 December, a task force, under the command of Rear Admiral Erich Bey, made up of the German battleship Scharnhorst, and destroyers Z29, Z30, Z33, Z34, and Z38, were ordered to intercept Convoy JW.55A, which was made up of 19 ships. On 26 December Bey formed a patrol line using his destroyers. After ordering the destroyers back to base, Scharnhorst was located by British cruisers, who opened fire upon her. During the ensuing Battle of North Cape, Scharnhorst was sunk by the British fleet, including the British battleship Duke of York. From 30 to 31 May 1944 Z29, Z33, Z34, and Z38 formed a patrol line between Bear Island and the North Cape. Between 30 June and 1 July Z29, Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38, sortied to Bear Island. On 31 July German battleship Tirpitz, Z29, Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38 sailed into the Arctic Ocean from Altafjord, for exercises. From 21 to 31 October Z29, Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38, covered the evacuation of the Mountain Corps Norway unit, from around Murmansk to Norway. From 6 to 17 November Z31, Z33, Z34, and Z38 covered German forces retreating from Tanafjord. On 22 January 1945 Z31, Z34 and Z38, laid mines in Magerøya, Laafjord, and Brei Sounds. On 25 January Z31, Z34, and Z38 sailed out of Tromsø, making for the Baltic. On 28 January while off the Sognefjord the three destroyers were intercepted by a squadron of British ships, including the light cruisers Diadem, and Mauritius. During the battle, one of Z38s funnels caught fire, splitting a boiler tube. After this Z38 broke off from the battle, and made for Kiel alongside Z34. Once there Z38 received 200 coastal artillerymen, to be taken to Gotenhafen. From 16 to 20 February Z34, Z38, T5, and T6 escorted the passenger liner Hamburg to Sassnitz. On 22 February Z38 escorted the German steamer Deutschland to Sassnitz. On 18 and 19 February Z38, alongside German cruiser Admiral Scheer, destroyer Z43, and minelayers T28 and T35, bombarded Soviet 39th Army positions, near Peyse and Gross-Heydekrug, on the south coast of Samland. On 23 February Z38, Z43, and T28 bombarded these locations again. At one point during this, while between Königsberg and Fischhausen, Z38 and T8 became icebound, and were freed by tugs. From 4 to 6 March Z38 bombarded Soviet armour and positions near Wollin, before taking refugees from Pillau to Gotenhafen. On 7 March Z35, Z38, and T28 escorted the steamship Pretoria to Copenhagen. On 13 March after returning to Gotenhafen Z38 bombarded Großendorf. For the rest of March Z38 was controlled by the Wehrmacht (German army), rather than the Kriegsmarine. On 4 April her upper deck was damaged in an air raid. On 5 April Z38 became involved in a battle off Oxhöfter Kämpe. On 9 April Z38 escorted German cruisers Lützow and Prinz Eugen from the Bay of Danzig to Swinemünde. From 28 April to 4 May Z38 helped defend the Dievenow channel of the Oder river. On 3 May Z38 and Z39 escorted the battleship , which had hit a mine near Greifswalder Oie, to Swinemünde. On 4 May Z38 picked up refugees from Swinemünde, and made way for Copenhagen. On the same day, Z38 and T33 rescued the crew of the training ship Hektor, which had been heavily damaged in an air raid. On 7 May Z38 returned to Swinemünde and transported more refugees to Copenhagen. On 8 May Z6, Z10, Z14, Z20, Z25, Z38, Z39, T17, T19, T23, T28, and T33 set sail from Hela to Glücksburg, with 20,000 soldiers and civilians, arriving on May 9. On 9 May Z38 arrived at Kiel, after delivering her War Diary to the commanding officer's house off of Flensburg Förde. On 8 May Z38 was decommissioned. At some point after her decommissioning, Z38 was sailed by a mixed German and British crew to Wilhelmshaven, and then, on 6 July 1945 Z38 sailed for Portsmouth, to be used as a trial vessel. Her German crew remained on board until 22 September 1946. While in British service, Z38 was renamed Nonsuch, the eleventh of her name, and used for testing purposes. Z38 was originally given the pennant number R40, but this was later changed to D107. After arriving in England, Z38 was used for various trials and evaluations in the Firth of Clyde, before being laid up in the Portchester creek. In October 1946 it was decided that Z38 was to be commissioned for extensive machinery trials, at the same time as being used as an air target ship under the Commander-in- Chief, Rosyth. In January 1947 Z38 was at full complement, and expected to enter service in June of the same year, in order to relieve HMS Fernie as an air target ship. In September 1948 Z38 was scheduled to be paid off into a reserve fleet, after her trials were finished in mid-October. In December of that year, it was decided that Z38 would be scrapped, after showing off her auxiliary machinery to British shipbuilders, and removing certain equipment. However, in March 1949 Z38 was instead used for ship target trials, replacing Kimberley. After this decision was made, Z38 was disarmed and then towed to Loch Striven. In October 1949, Z38 was placed over a charge, which was then detonated. The explosion threw up a plume of water that was high, and broke her keel approximately 1.6 seconds after the explosion. Her second boiler room flooded almost immediately, and the other two gradually filled with water. Z38 was then beached, and after inspection shown to be too damaged to refloat, and so it was decided that Z38 was to be handed over directly to shipbreakers while still beached. On 8 November 1949 Z38 was sold to Arnott Young & Co Ltd for scrapping. By August 1950, the shipbreakers had removed the damaged section, and refloated her after-end. The after-end was taken to the breakers yard in Dalmuir for further inspection, but the fore-end was broken up as it was laid on the beach.

She was laid down in August 1940 and completed three years later. Her anti-aircraft armament was increased extensively during the war. She served with the 6th Destroyer Flotilla her entire German career, which she spent escorting transports in the Baltic Sea, laying mines, and bombarding land forces. She served with a total of three different countries: from 1943 to 1945 with the Kriegsmarine as Z39, from 1945 to 1947 with the US Navy as DD-939, and from 1948 to 1964 with the French Navy as Q-128. Throughout her German career, she laid numerous barrages of mines in the Baltic Sea and bombarded Soviet forces several times. In the last months of the war, Z39 helped escort steamships, which were evacuating German soldiers and civilians from Eastern Europe to Denmark. She was damaged twice, once by Soviet planes while in Paldiski, and then by British planes, while in Kiel. At the end of the war, she was transferred to the United States Navy. It conducted experiments testing her equipment—her high-pressure steam propulsion plant in particular. After the US Navy deemed her obsolete, she was transferred to the French Navy, where she was cannibalised for parts, and made into a pontoon boat for minesweepers. Background =Destroyer Function= During World War Two, destroyers served three basic functions: to act as screening ships to defend their fleets from those of an enemy; to attack an enemy's screening ships; and to defend their fleet from submarines. How destroyers were actually used varied by country. Germany did not use her destroyers to defend against submarines, hence their lack of strong anti- submarine armament. Germany relied on a massive fleet of trawlers which had been requisitioned and re-fitted as minelayers instead. The role of the destroyer began to vary more widely as the war progressed. British destroyers were built for escorting fleets, defending them from enemy planes and sinking submarines. German destroyers were built to escort fleets, or act as torpedo boats. =Interbellum= Following the end of World War One, Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, which put strict limits both on the size and displacement of warships that she could possess. During the Interbellum, the period between the first and second world wars, the average size Allied ships and their armaments in almost all warship categories grew substantially. As a result of the treaty, Germany felt that her ships could not compete with those of the Allied navies and began to ignore the treaty, at first covertly, and later openly after Hitler publicly denounced it. The displacements of all German ships at the time were purposefully understated to have their official sizes comply with the treaty. At first, these changes were made with the goal of being able to match or exceed French and Polish destroyers, but later it was necessary that these destroyers be able to match British destroyers, a much more difficult goal. Due to the comparatively small number of German shipyards, compared to the British or French, Germany adopted a policy of overarming her destroyers to compensate for their low numbers, so that they bore similar armament to French and Polish light cruisers. Several negative consequences resulted from this, however, such as making them slower and overweight. Although German heavy destroyers matched British light cruisers in armament, they were much less seaworthy, and had far worse facilities for control and use of their guns. =Plan Z= Plan Z was a German naval re- armament plan, started in 1939, which involved building ten battleships, four aircraft carriers, twelve battlecruisers, three pocket battleships, five heavy cruisers, forty-four light cruisers, sixty-eight destroyers, and 249 submarines. These ships were to be split into two battle fleets: a \\"Home Fleet\\", to tie down the British war fleet in the North Sea, and a \\"Raiding Fleet\\", to wage war upon British convoys. Erich Raeder, the Grand Admiral of the Kriegsmarine, was assured by Hitler that war would not start until at least 1945. Raeder had wanted the deadline for the completion of Plan Z to be extended to 1948, but Hitler insisted on 1945. World War Two began in 1939, meaning that very few of Germany's heavy ships were finished at that point. Germany's main naval opponents were France and England. Compared to the number Germany had upon entry (in parentheses) they had: 22 battleships (two), seven carriers (none), 22 heavy cruisers (four), 61 light cruisers (six), 255 destroyers (34), 135 submarines (57, of which less than half could actually serve in the Atlantic or North Sea). Due to the clear advantage her enemies had, Raeder remarked that the Kriegsmarine could not hope to win, and thus the only course for them was to \\"die valiantly\\". Design and armament Z39 was long at the waterline and long overall, had a beam of , and a draught of . She had a displacement of at standard load, and at full load. Her crew complement was 332. Before her Project Barbara modifications to improve the anti-aircraft capabilities of German ships, she was armed with: seven anti-aircraft (AA) guns, two twin 3.7 cm SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns, a twin L/48 gun on a forward turret, two single L/48 guns in a gunhouse aft, two quadruple torpedo tubes, and 60 mines. She had the Greek coat of arms on either side of her twin turret. After the modifications, she carried eighteen guns and fourteen guns; the rest of her armament remained unchanged. Her propulsion system consisted of six Wagner boilers feeding high-pressure superheated steam (at and ) to two sets of Wagner geared steam turbines. These gave the ship a rated power of , and a top speed of . She had a range of , at her cruising speed of . Z39s sensor suite included a FuMO 21 radar, which was placed on the ship's bridge, and four FuMB4 Sumatra aerials on the foremast searchlights. She also had several other radars and radar detectors, including a FuMB 3 Bali and FuMO 81 Berlin-S on her masthead, and a FuMO 63 Hohentweil K. She also had a degaussing cable which wrapped around the entire ship, but was covered by her spray deflector. Service history Z39 was ordered on 26 June 1939, laid down by Germaniawerft in Yard G629 in Kiel on 15 August 1940, launched on 2 December 1941, and was commissioned on 21 August 1943. Her commissioning had been delayed by lengthy construction times, and Z39 was not fully operational until 7 January 1944. There were a number of reasons for these construction issues. The small number of German shipyards forced the Kriegsmarine to prioritize construction, inexperienced naval engineers, and the lack of workers. At some point between her launching and commissioning, she was modified under Project Barbara, with the addition of three pairs of anti- aircraft guns, one pair forward of her bridge, one pair abreast after her funnel, and one pair abreast forward of her funnel. She had one pair of single guns added to her after funnel platform. She had a pair of twin guns added to her bridge wings. She had a pair of quadruple guns and a pair of single guns added to an extended deckhouse in her No. 3 gun position. After these changes, she began minelaying operations in the Skagerrak and the Kattegat until March when she was transferred to Reval off the Gulf of Finland. =German service= After this move, she served in the 6th Destroyer Flotilla, alongside German destroyers , , and . Between 12 and 13 February Z39 laid mines in the \\"Dorothea A\\" barrage, alongside two other destroyers and three minelayers. On 10 March, she took part in minelaying operations along with two other destroyers. Between 11 and 12 March, she bombarded Soviet forces near Narva-Jõesuu. From 13 March to 22 April, she took part in six different minelaying operations. One such operation lasted from 13 to 14 April, in which Z39, two other destroyers, and six minelayers laid the \\"Seeigel 6b\\" mine barrage south of Suur Tyärsaari. From 16 to 17 April, Z39, two other destroyers, and six minelayers laid the \\"Seeigel 3b\\" barrage off of Vigrund Island in Narva Bay. A smokescreen was laid during the operation to prevent the ships from being shelled by Soviet coastal artillery. An operation from 21 to 22 April, involving Z39, two other destroyers, and six minelayers was cancelled midway after one of the minelayers hit a mine and sank. From 23 to 24 April, Z39, two other destroyers and eight minelayers laid the \\"Seeigel 7b/3\\" barrage in Narva Bay. From 25 to 26 April Z39, two other destroyers and nine minelayers laid the \\"Seeigel 8b\\" barrage southwest of Suur Tyärsaari. During the operations between 13 and 26 April, a total of 2,831 mines and 1,174 sweep detonators were laid. On 23 June of the same year, she was damaged by Soviet bombers while moored off of Paldiski and was escorted to Libau by Z28. After reaching Libau on 29 June, Z39 made her way to Kiel for repairs by way of the Piast Canal near Swinemünde. While at port in Kiel on 24 July, she was hit by a bomb when the British air force bombed Kiel Harbour, causing damage to her quarterdeck and leading to her having to be towed back to Swinemünde. She was repaired using parts cannibalised from Z44 and Z45. Z44 had been damaged in an air raid on 29 July while in Bremen and sunk so that only her superstructure remained above water and Z45 was being built. Z39 had been repaired enough to be seaworthy on 28 February 1945 and was ordered to sail to Copenhagen for more extensive repairs, however, due to Nazi Germany's lack of fuel, she sailed to Sassnitz instead. During this time, the Kriegsmarine, which had always dealt with shortages in oil, reached critically low levels of oil supply. On 25 March, repairs on Z39 finished while she was in Swinemünde; she resumed operations on 1 April. From 5 April to 7 April, she escorted transports and parts of Task Force Thiele around the Bay of Danzig. From 8 April to 9 April, she provided naval gunfire support for the German army. On 10 April she and T33 escorted the German destroyer , which had sustained damage from both mines and bombs, to Warnemünde and Swinemünde. From 1944, German surface ships were called upon to provide support for the Army Group North along the Baltic Sea coast. This often involved shelling land targets for which the German ship crews had no training. This tactical use of cruisers, destroyers, and torpedo boats was difficult in the restrictive waterways of the Baltic, but despite these difficulties, it justified the continued existence of the surface fleet. The Soviet Union's ongoing advances along the east Baltic coast also spurred this change. From the spring of 1945 to near the end of the war, the surface forces of the Kriegsmarine became almost entirely focused upon resupplying and supporting garrisons along the Baltic Coast. After March 1945 the Kriegsmarine embarked upon the task of evacuating hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers from the east ahead of the Soviet forces, which were rapidly pushing westward. Z39 took part in a number of these evacuation operations. On 15 April Z39, two other destroyers, and four torpedo boats escorted German steamships Matthias Stinnes, Eberhart Essberger, Pretoria and Askari to Copenhagen, with a total of 20,000 refugees. On 2 May, she shelled Soviet Army forces from the Oder estuary. On 3 May, she, alongside the battleship , moved to protect the bridge across the Peene river at Wolgast. After Schlesien hit a mine near Greifswalder Oie on the same day, Z39 towed her to Swinemünde, where Schlesien was deliberately grounded. The ship was placed so that her guns could fire on and defend roads leading into the city. A day later, Z39, three other destroyers, one torpedo boat, one ship's tender, one auxiliary cruiser, one anti-aircraft ship, and five steamer ships, sailed for Copenhagen, taking 35,000 wounded soldiers and refugees with them. On 8 May, Z39, six other destroyers, and five torpedo boats set sail with 20,000 soldiers and civilians from Hela to Glücksburg, and arrived on 9 May. Following the German surrender, she was decommissioned from the Kriegsmarine on 10 May 1945 at Kiel. =American and French service= Z39 underway off Boston on 22 August 1945 At some point after the war ended, Z39 was sailed by a mixed German and British crew to Wilhelmshaven, and then, on 6 July 1945, to Plymouth. The US claimed her as a prize ship on 12 July. She left England on 30 July, and arrived in Boston on 7 August, where, on 14 September, after extensive trials, she was commissioned into the US Navy as DD-939. She was used by the US Navy to test her equipment, namely her high- pressure steam propulsion plant. In late 1947, the US Navy deemed her obsolete, and transferred her to the French Navy. After arriving in Casablanca in January 1948, she sailed to Toulon, redesignated Q-128, and was cannibalised for her parts, which were used to repair the French destroyers Kléber (ex-), Hoche (ex-Z25), and Marceau (ex-). She served as a pontoon for minesweepers near Brest until she was broken up in 1964.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Rudolf Ising. The short was released on June 11, 1932, and stars Goopy Geer, one of the few recurring characters in the early Merrie Melodies series. Summary The iris opens to a night-time scene, perhaps in the Ozarks or Appalachia, and the music of \\"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain.\\" Goopy Geer's nameless sweetheart comes out of a cabin scatting the music. Goopy himself stands by a tree unknowingly accompanying her on his harmonica before they meet. A songbird and her children trill a tune, \\"Moonlight for Two,\\" which the happy couple pick up together, dancing about as the birds continue their accompaniment. The dancing ends when Goopy and the young lady hop onto a precarious wooden cart which, boarded, rolls down the hill at whose top it had been placed and through a cabin whose formation is confounded by the impact and whose logs, sent into the air, fall to earth again in a neat pile. The ungoverned cart crashes into a tree but reassembles into a perfect wheelbarrow, now bearing only the girl and pushed along by Goopy; across a plank bridge merrily they roll along, the bridge yielding to their weight not to the point of breaking but only bending enough that the happy couple are wetted by the shallow water beneath. We cut to a large cabin, where a square dance is taking place: amongst other partners, two donkeys dance, their tails joining to form a makeshift jump-rope for a kitten; a goat-like fiddler continually resins his bow between his toes. Outside, our two darlings arrive; gentleman Goopy helps his lady out of the wagon and onto the porch of the cabin and he, ascending the steps, miraculously shrinks from his lofty height to a shape squat and round; this he amends by doffing his hat and pulling his long ears skyward. \\"Howdy, folks!\\" cries Goopy as he and his lady enter. The couple dance as the band play the title piece. The cabin's stove enters the number, dancing for a bit, then refreshing itself by quaffing coals. A canine couple caper excitedly; as they reach a table in the corner of the room, the boy takes a barrel of moonshine therefrom and, partaking thereof, finds his lanky body burnt, as a cigar, to a butt. Goopy Geer snaps his fingers madly, and produces a rhythm by pulling a lever on and thereby releasing the ash from his new dance-partner, the stove. A dishevelled villain enters with a shotgun; he lowers at Goopy's sweetheart, whereupon Goopy orders him to stand back. This challenge is met with shotgun bursts and our hero staggers back from the scene, stepping in a pair of spitoons and falling back on the table. He frees the spitoons from his feet, flinging them at the cackling cad. Goopy runs to his stunned foe and they rumble! Goopy at a disadvantage, the stove challenges the villain: it burns the brute's behind and breathes fire to the villain's slight retreat. The beast lowers at his adversaries; Goopy cleverly takes the lever of the stove and with it fires hot coals at the invader who, yelping with pain, retreats. Our hero and his helper shake hands. Victory! Falsetto Goopy Geer's speaking-voice in this cartoon is a falsetto, characteristic of Bosko (as played by Carman Maxwell), the star of the main star of the contemporary Looney Tunes series. This is interesting as, in the earlier Goopy Geer film, the voice of the character was deep and raspy. This is reminiscent of Bosko's own change from the speech exemplified in Sinkin' in the Bathtub (the first Looney Tune) and Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid to the better- known falsetto that he uses from Congo Jazz onward. Goopy's singing voice remains much as it was in the earlier short. Alternate versions When the cartoon was redrawn colorized in 1973, it was renamed Barnyard Frolics and featured different music.

Arising near Chetco Peak in the Klamath Mountains, it flows generally south to meet the Middle Fork Smith River at Gasquet, California. The combined streams form the Smith River. Wild and scenic The entire of the river that lie within Oregon are part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. In 1988, was designated \\"wild\\" in two separate segments, from the headwaters to Horse Creek and from Baldface Creek to the Oregon–California border. The stretch between Horse and Baldface creeks was classified \\"scenic\\". Recreation Hiking trails near the North Fork include North Fork Trail, which follows a ridge along the southeast edge of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest in Oregon. Suitable for hikers and horseback riders, the trail passes through the area of the Biscuit Fire. Connected to the North Fork Trail is the Baldface Trail, which crosses Baldface Creek, a North Fork tributary. The trail, which also passes through the Biscuit Fire area, is suitable for day hiking but not for horse riding. The North Fork Trail also connects to the Kalmiopsis Rim Trail, which links to a large network of trails in and near the wilderness and other parts of the national forest. The Rim Trail alone is long. Sourdough Campground, undeveloped but open to dispersed camping in a meadow along the river, lies near the confluence of the North Fork with Baldface Creek in Oregon. Further downstream, North Fork Campground is about from the lower river on the California side of the border in Six Rivers National Forest. The remote campground, open all year, has five sites for tent or trailer camping, picnic tables, fire rings, a vault toilet, and limited parking, but no drinking water or garbage pickup. Lightly used by whitewater enthusiasts because it is difficult, remote, and often of insufficient flow for boating, the river is sometimes run for its lower in rafts or kayaks. This segment, all within California, is rated Class III (intermediate) and IV (advanced) on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Water quality The North Fork's water is of outstanding quality, with low turbidity and almost no pollution. Little logging or road building has occurred in its watershed, and silting after storms is not a problem. However, a proposed nickel mine along Baldface Creek threatens to pollute the river and damage its anadromous fish habitat as well as that of the main stem Smith River. In 2012, the Red Flat Nickel Corporation asked permission from the United States Forest Service to allow exploratory mining along the creek. Many local, state, and tribal agencies as well as environmental, fishing, and recreational organizations strongly oppose mining in the watershed. Tributaries Named tributaries of the North Fork Smith River from source to mouth are Horse, Chrome, and Hardrock creeks. Then comes Packsaddle Gulch, Baldface, Fall, and Cedar creeks, followed by Diamond, Still, and Stony creeks.

The concept began with a Soviet Council of Ministers resolution dated February 26, 1955 and the Ministry of Aviation Industry order dated March 8, 1955. The resolutions were in response to the threat from long-range supersonic bombers such as the United States' Convair B-58 \\"Hustler\\" and the equally threatening British Vickers Valiant, among others. The current generation is the Uragan-5B. Background During World War II, the Soviet Union relied primarily on visual and sound methods to detect intruding aircraft. Radar equipment and technology was available, but was available only in limited supply. As the war progressed, the Soviets received significant information on nearly all of the radars which were then in operation by the United States and Britain. Among the systems were the United States' SCR-584 fire control radar and the British Experimental Searchlight Control—SLC \\"Elsie\\" radar. Knowledge of these radars gave the Soviets a basis to produce their own radar systems. In 1945 the Soviets recognized the urgency of developing a defense against a probable threat from Europe. American and British aircraft were the most likely and most immediate threat. An air defense system became a high priority for the U.S.S.R. when viewed in the context of Soviet military heritage. The Soviets knew that they would need an integrated early warning system to defend themselves from nuclear bombers then under development in the West, and wanted a system that integrated search, tracking and interception functions. Before 1950, the Soviets produced the Pegmantit 3 (also known as the P-3), an acquisition radar based on foreign technology. The P-3 was referred to by the NATO reporting name \\"Dumbo\\" in the west). Dumbo was soon joined in 1949 by the Перископ НИИ-244 (Periscope RI-244), a purely Soviet-designed First Soviet microwave EW radar called Token and later Bar Lock by NATO. These radar sets were quickly produced and installed across the country. A number of other early warning radar systems were under development by 1950, and there was a significant increase in improving existing radar system designs between 1952 and 1955. Over time, Soviet research assimilated foreign technology, integrating these new concepts to their own designs. By 1955, the early warning and detection system had nearly continuous coverage around the periphery of their entire country and Eastern Europe except for a few of the least vulnerable portions. A contemporary U.S. Air Force evaluation Background Intelligence Data for Posture Statement on Strategic Initiatives which was released for public publication in AF/INAF 3 January 1975, revealed that: : By Western standards, the system performance was unimpressive : A greater number of radars were needed to give continuous coverage : The Soviet Union’s great size was an advantage, as it permitted radar detection far from the defended area : The system was relatively maintenance-free as it was built for simplicity : Mobility and easy concealability were highly prized features The continued development of nuclear weapons drove the Soviets to develop a more effective air defense system, one that reduced the delay between detection and interception, and integrated anti-aircraft artillery, including missiles, into the existing interceptor plan, giving a layered network of increasing firepower as threats closed on their targets. This required a new radar system, high speed computers, and a communications system to move the data. The new system was nicknamed Uragan (Hurricane). Purpose Overall, the Uragan series of air defense systems were intended to intercept enemy supersonic bombers flying at 40,000 – 60,000 feet within 40–60 miles of the strategic target. The intercept system was intended to: * perform automatic interceptor guidance * allow an on-board pilot to perform the interception manually * attack the threat at the greatest distance possible * withdrawal from the attack * return the aircraft to its base Components The overall defense system consisted of: * a number of ground radar stations (each with a detection range of 345 km) * a digital control computer to plot targets and calculate an intercept course * a \\"SAZO\\" IFF system to identify the interceptor's radar return * a \\"SPK\\" command data link to connect the ground and air portions of the system * a number of ground-based automatic guidance transmitters located around strategic targets * a number of interceptor type- fighters equipped with \\"SRP\\" Almaz airborne radar with a detection range of 25 km, an autopilot and a computer for final intercept and weapon delivery. The Soviet military sent a number of interceptor aircraft specifications to the design bureaus for proposals. These proposals produced families of similar designs from each bureau, including prototypes, armed and reconnaissance variants. Only a few of these projects were known in the west, and many were never discovered at all, as only a few of each were produced, and they were often recycled into later variants. Examples of this process is a series of aircraft intended for the Uragan project developed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau. The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-3U became the I-7U when the proposed engine was canceled. An armament change resulted in the I-7K, and after a landing incident, the I-7K became the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-75 after it was rebuilt. The I-3/7/75 design progressed as the Ye-6, later becoming the Ye-50P and ultimately the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21F. The Sukhoi design bureau also produced a series of experimental aircraft for the Uragan program. Among them are the Sukhoi P-1, T-3, T-405, Su-9, Su-9U, T-431 and finally Su-11. Similar designs were proposed by Yakovlev and Lavochkin. The Uragan system enabled the intercept and downing of a number of intruding aircraft including: * a US reconnaissance Lockheed C-130 Hercules over Armenia, with 17 casualties in 1958.\\"The Shootdown of Flight 60528.\\" National Vigilance Park- NSA/CSS via nsa.gov, 15 January 2009.

He taught for many years at the Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture, and he helped to found the American Iris Society. Biography Robert Swan Sturtevant was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, on December 30, 1889, the only child of noted agronomist Edward Lewis Sturtevant, the first director of the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, and his second wife, Hattie (Mann) Sturtevant. He had four half-siblings from his father's first marriage to Hattie's sister Mary Elizabeth (Mann) Sturtevant. Sturtevant was especially close to his much older half-sister Grace, who would become a noted iris breeder. In 1901, they co-purchased an estate in Massachusetts, Wellesley Gardens, which Grace made the center of her iris-breeding operations and where she educated her half-brother in horticulture. Sturtevant attended Wellesley High School and Milton Academy. He graduated from Harvard College with an A.B. in 1912 and went on to get a master's degree in landscape architecture from Harvard in 1916. Between 1916 and 1918, he worked as a landscape architect for the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted. When America entered World War I, he served overseas in the field artillery, reaching the rank of corporal. After his discharge in 1919, he became an instructor at the Lowthorpe School of Landscape Architecture. In 1927, he became the school's director. Although he only headed the school for a few years, he remained on the faculty for 25 years. When the American Iris Society was founded in 1920, Sturtevant became its first secretary and drafted the society's constitution. He also served as the first editor of the American Iris Society Bulletin, a position he held for 14 years. He edited the AIS's first book, The Iris: An Ideal Hardy Perennial (1947). Sturtevant was a member of both the Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain and the American Horticultural Society. Sturtevant moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1933 and joined a landscape architecture firm. In 1935, he created a landscape design for Orton Plantation in Brunswick County, North Carolina, not all of which was implemented and only some of which survives today. In 1946, he developed landscaping for thirty acres of the Lloyd–Howe House estate, an area southeast of the main house known as the Clarendon Gardens. Sturtevant died in a house fire in Nashville on Feb. 22, 1955. He was survived by his wife, Margaret (Coolidge) Sturtevant, and a son, David Mann Sturtevant. A second son, Roger van Deren Sturtevant, was killed in the Korean War in 1950 while serving with the U.S. Marines.

It was written between June, 2011 and January, 2013 by Mexican composer Gabriel Pareyon, after more than a decade of literary, musical and linguistic research. Its text and poetical contents directly come from the homonymous poem, compiled by friar Bernardino de Sahagun amidst the 16th century, among Nahua informants that survived the Conquest of Mexico. This original text is comprised within the collection of Aztec songs known under the title of Cantares Mexicanos or Mexicacuicatl. Premiered in August, 2014, in Arcelia, Guerrero, under the guidance of music and stage director Jose Navarro-Noriega, the piece's plot originates from a reinterpretation proposed by historian and linguist Patrick Johansson, on the erotic sense of the concept cuecuechcuicatl (playful ribald) and the expressive whole that it embodies: song, poetry, music and dance, where sexuality is rather a source for philosophical-existential depth. Innovation The piece offers a carefully analyzed vision of the Nahua universe without pursuing an archaeological reconstruction or attempting a folklore piece. It proposes a distinct operatic structure that brings new ways to relate the arts, scenically and methodologically, different to the European tradition. The orchestra is formed exclusively by ancestral original Mexican instruments (mainly percussions such as huehuetl and teponaztli, but also a wide gamut of Native Mexican aerophones), for which a score with an original notation distinct from the pentagram signature style, has been created based on symbols of the ancient iconography of Mexico. Xochicuicatl cuecuechtli proposes a treatment of the voice, based in the articulation and dramatization of each word in Nahuatl, totally different to Western traditional vocalization. The expressiveness involved does not allow any artistic discipline to overtake another, allowing poetry, dance and music to compose a symbolic whole. Plot and structure The symbolic complexity of this cuecuechcuicatl (operatic genre of the Mexican erotic-philosophical tradition), evidences the existentialist conception of sexuality in the Aztec universe as a \\"return\\" to death. The initial sound of a conch (Lobatus gigas) refers to the myth of human gestation in the underworld, where the breath of Quetzalcoatl penetrates the conch (a female symbol) and the product of sound enters in its turn on heard of the divinity of death (Mictlantecuhtli), fertilizing it. Then the demiurge Quetzalcoatl adopts the shape of a Cuicamatini (Master Singer, a bearer of wisdom), who teaches music (cuicatl) to three young women (the Ahwahnees) which in turn learn the art of preparing food from maize. The world of the ahuaianis is disturbed by the arrival of a stranger: the Tohuenyo, a Huastec, agile and attractive young man that seduces the three luscious girls. After a lustful play, with a climatic dance (mitotl), finally the ahuaianis leave the Tohuenyo, who discovers his destiny as loneliness and darkness. The plot changes when the patron of blossoms, colour, poetry and music, Xochipilli, suddenly appears in an epiphany, bringing a present for the Tohuenyo: an ocarina (a huilacapiztli, symbol of sex and death), referring to the ephemeral nature of the sexual act and the human existence. In short, the work refers to the sexual act as an analogy of life, intense and brief, spirited and fleeting. The show consists of 28 scenic frames, with 6 characters performed by 5 performers (dancers that follow their own score, in addition to lyrics and special vocalization also performed by them), and 20 musicians on stage playing during an hour. Awards Xochicuicatl cuecuechtli received a Special Mention at the Music Theatre NOW festival as a 2015 Winning Selection by the International Theatre Institute in cooperation with the German Centre of ITI.

Following the hard- fought but decisive Mongol victory at the Battle of Mohi, Batu Khan pillaged the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary, with particular focus on soft targets such as small villages and towns. One exception was Esztergom, the capital and largest, wealthiest city in the Kingdom of Hungary until its destruction. It was the last city to be looted and destroyed by Batu Khan before he sent a reconnaissance party against the Holy Roman Empire and later withdrew of all Mongol forces from central Europe back to Russia.The Rise and Fall of the Second Largest Empire in History: How Genghis Khan almost conquered the world by Craughwell, Thomas pp. 270-277 Most of the information on the siege and its aftermath comes from the chronicle of Roger of Torre Maggiore, the Italian (Apulian) archbishop of Split. Background Following the Mongol conquest of the Kievan Rus states, the Cumans fled from their former lands and appealed to King Bela IV of Hungary for refuge, which he accepted on the condition they provide him military service. Batu Khan immediately threatened the king to round up all the Cumans or be annihilated. King Bela IV refused, and his kingdom was subsequently invaded. Bela as unable to secure military support from any other European states, bar Moravia, Bohemia, and the Polish duchies, which the Mongols dealt with separately. Bela's kingdom was ill-prepared for the Mongol invasion. At the time, Hungary was one of the poorest and most sparsely populated areas of Europe. The population was estimated at slightly over 2 million in the mid-thirteenth century despite its large land area, with the largest city, Esztergom, having only 12,000 inhabitants.Gyorffy, Magyarorszag nepessege, pp. 50-51 Its armies consisted primarily of light cavalry with some light infantry, and only a handful of crossbowmen, mounted knights, and heavy infantry, in contrast to the areas further west where such troops were nearly ubiquitous. The focus on light cavalry made Bela's army appear \\"oriental\\" to Western observers.Sugar, pp. 27 Most critically, Hungary had an almost complete lack of stone fortifications, with less than a dozen stone castles; even the nobles mostly relied on wood and earth forts.Pow, pp. 72Sugar, pp. 26 The Mongols were very successful in their initial advance. After sacking Buda, they won a large victory over Bela at the Battle of Mohi, which effectively wiped out most of Hungary's army in a day. After this they proceeded to lay waste to most of Hungary's unfortified places, with particular devastation inflicted on the plains regions, where 50-80% of settlements were destroyed. The Mongols also searched stringently for King Bela. In early 1242, they crossed the frozen Danube river, hoping to pillage the richest territories of the kingdom of Hungary.Pow, pp. 68 Battle Batu Khan decided to assault the city in January 1242. His troops battered the walls of Esztergom with catapults and stone throwers. They easily reduced the walls and wooden towers, and had prisoners fill the moat with earth. Rogerius states that when the Hungarians and foreigners in the city realized it was going to fall, they torched their houses along with huge amounts of dyed fabrics and any other valuable commodities. They also slaughtered the animals and buried their gold and silver, or sent it to the citadel, the only fully stone fortification in the city.Pow, pp. 132 Many citizens also fled to the citadel. While the rest of the city was sacked, the citadel held, with the garrison commanded by the Aragonese knight Simon (also spelled \\"Simeone\\"), an ispán of Spanish origin. Batu ordered his engineers to batter down the walls of the citadel, hoping to get at the valuables inside, but the catapults failed to do sufficient damage, forcing him to attempt to storm the citadel. The Mongols were beaten back time after time, with Rogerius noting the effectiveness of the garrison's crossbowmen in inflicting enormous damage on the Mongol force (the exact term Rogerius used, \\"balistarii\\", was used in most contemporary sources to refer to crossbowmen; despite some confusion, he and other contemporary chroniclers usually referred to siege engines such as ballistas as \\"machina\\"). After heavy casualties, Batu accepted defeat and broke off the siege. Aftermath The Mongols never stayed long enough to stage an effective siege on any of the Hungarian fortification unlike the wars with the Jin dynasty and Samarkand that took more than 3 to 12 months of siege. Batu was enraged by the result of the siege. Any valuable plunder he could have taken in exchange for his significant losses was either destroyed or sent to the citadel, which held all the city's remaining wealth in the \\"high upper castle.\\" In his anger, Batu slaughtered the hostages he had taken during the sack of the city itself, including 300 noblewomen and any civilians he could find. Rogerius states that only 15 civilians survived the sacking, though modern historians find that claim doubtful, believing many more should have been inside the citadel. Attempts by other Mongol forces to assault other Hungarian stone fortifications met with similarly dismal results, despite their success in pillaging the rest of the country before their withdrawal. Székesfehérvár and the Pannonhalma Archabbey held, as did the fortress of Klis, where the defenders launched boulders down the hillside onto the Mongols who were crawling toward the citadel after the Mongol stone-throwers again failed to reduce the walls or did not bother .Thomas of Split, History of the Bishops, 299. While small in scope, the siege of Esztergom proved an immensely influential event for King Bela IV, who interpreted the engagement as a ringing endorsement of stone fortifications, crossbowmen, and a defensive, scorched earth strategy in the face of Mongol invasions. He would reform his country's military doctrine immensely during the remainder of his rule, and his successor put these lessons into practice when the Mongols returned in 1285. The Mongols had set their sights on the gates of Vienna and raided as far in Wiener Neustadt and Korneuburg. But then they withdrew from the region. The traditional explanation for this is that the Mongols received news of the death of Ögedei Khan and this halted the Mongol advance so that all Mongol leaders in Europe could return to Mongolia and participate in the kurultai that would elect a new Khan. But this explanation has been challenged because the kurultai wasn't actually held until a year later and a new khan wasn't elected until 1246. Moreover, Batu Khan, who led the European invasion, refused to return to Mongolia. A more recent explanation is that because of the existence of a number of stone fortifications, and the willingness of the populace to flee rather than be enslaved, the Mongols were only able to devastate Hungary, not subjugate it. Bela never surrendered or agreed to pay tribute. And Batu's forces suffered casualties too heavy to sustain. So the Mongols simply withdrew.Lindsey Stephen Pow, “Deep Ditches and Well-Built Walls: a Reappraisal of the Mongol Withdrawal from Europe in 1242,” master's thesis, Department of History, University of Calgary, September 2012. Nonetheless, they had inflicted considerable damage on the kingdom of Hungary, with 300,000 to 500,000 people dying either during the invasion or as a result of the ensuing famine (15-25% of the population).The traditional figure is 25%, but László Veszprémy, taking account of recent scholarship, says \\"some fifteen percent\\". \\"Muhi, Battle of,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology, ed.

This vessel is primarily remembered for its having been named Unio when built in 1861, in the first year of the American Civil War, and then having the name completed, to Union, by a new, staunchly pro-Union owner, James D. Miller. Union appears to have sunk in 1869, been salvaged, and then dismantled, with the machinery going to a new steamer then being built for service on the Umpqua River. Construction The steamer Unio was built at Canemah, Oregon by Capt. John T. Apperson, and launched on October 19, 1861. With the American Civil War in progress, Apperson left off the final “n” on the name. Unio was placed on the Yamhill River route from Oregon City. Unio was small, with dimensions reported to have been 96 feet long, probably exclusive of the fantail, and 16 foot beam (width). The boat drew about 4 feet of water when loaded. The steamer was driven by two engines, each with a 9 inch bore and a 48 inch stroke. Unio was measured at 111.59 tons for the United States merchant vessel registry. The official merchant vessel registry number was 25165. Upon launch, Unio was reported to be capable of running up the Willamette River to Salem and further in low water, and a prosperous business was anticipated for the steamer, should the state fair be held in Salem the next year. Regular service Unio was expected to make its first trip from Canemah to Lafayette on Saturday, November 23, 1861. By early December 1861, Unio was making regular trips from Canemah to Lafayette, under Captain Apperson. Capt. James D. Miller bought Unio from Captain Apperson in December 1861, after he had returned from work on mines along the Snake River. It was Miller who added the final “n” and thereafter the vessel became known as the Union. The name change occurred prior to April 22, 1862, when Miller was reported to be the captain of the boat, and Apperson the clerk. On Friday, October 3, 1862, Union was the first boat of the season to arrive at Salem, coming down river from Oregon City. The steamer returned the next morning with passengers bound for the Oregon State Fair. Except for a short time in 1862, when he served as commander on the Mountain Buck and the Julia, Captain Miller operated the Union until 1865 when he sold it to the Willamette Steam Navigation Company, of which J.T. Apperson was the secretary. The next year the boat was sold to the People's Transportation Company. In December 1866, Union was owned by the People’s Transportation Company, of which Asa Alfred McCully (1818-1886) was president. Under the winter shipping arrangements of the company, the steamer Alert departed Portland daily at 7:00 a.m., for Oregon City, where it connected with steamers running to points on the upper Willamette River, upstream from Willamette Falls. The Reliance ran on Mondays and Thursdays to Corvallis, Oregon; the Fannie Patton ran to the same city on Tuesdays and Fridays; the Active ran every Wednesday for Harrisburg, Lancaster, and Eugene; and Union ran on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for Dayton and Lafayette on the Yamhill River. In 1867 and 1868, Captain George Jerome was in charge of Union. In June 1868, officers of Union included Capt. J.T. Apperson, engineer Edward Fellows, and steward Allen. Disposition On Tuesday, January 19, 1869, Union was sunk in the Lafayette rapid on the Dayton River. Initial reports of the sinking could provide no information as to the extent of any damage to the boat. In late September 1869, Josiah B. Leed (1829-1889) doing business as J.B. Leeds & Company bought the boiler and engines of the Union to be installed on a steamer, later to be named Swan, being built for use on the Umpqua River. Nicholas Haun (also seen spelled Hann, Hahn, and Horn), formerly of the Willamette Steam Navigation Company, was an owner of the new steamer. Swan, a similar sized sternwheeler, was built by Hiram Doncaster (b.1838) across the Umpqua river from Gardiner, Oregon. With Haun in command, Swan became the first and only steamboat to reach Roseburg, Oregon on the Umpqua river, a journey of 100 miles which took 11 days.

There are two distinct subspecies differing in their growth habit but both have grey leaves due to a covering of white or grey hairs, and purple to blue, rarely white flowers. Description Eremophila compacta is an erect shrub usually growing to about high with rough stems due to raised leaf bases. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are lance-shaped or egg-shaped, mostly long and wide. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs in leaf axils on a straight stalk long. There are 5 lance-shaped, pointed, hairy, green to brownish-purple sepals, long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube and the lobes are purple to lilac-coloured on the outside and the tube is white inside and filled with long spidery and woolly hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering time depends on subspecies and the fruits that follow it are covered with sticky resin, oval-shaped, flattened and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Spencer Le Marchant Moore in 1921 and the description was published in Journal of Botany, British and Foreign. The type specimen was collected by \\"Miss Brown\\" at \\"Yalgoo on redsoil hills or flats\\". The specific epithet (compacta) refers to the growth habit of the type species. In his monograph, Eremophila and allied genera, Robert Chinnock described two subspecies and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eremophila compacta S.Moore subsp. compacta, commonly known as compact eremophila is a compact shrub growing to a height of and which has a shorter flower stalk (), densely hairy, forward- facing sepals and flowers during most months after rain; * Eremophila compacta subsp. fecunda Chinnock is an open shrub growing to a height of and which has a longer flower stalk (), sparsely hairy, spreading sepals and flowers between May and October. Subspecies fecunda usually has blue petals but can have pink or white flowers and is a softer-looking shrub. The specific epithet is derived from the \\"Latin compacta, close together\\". The epithet fecunda is derived from the \\"Latin fecunda, fruitful, fertile; referring to the abundance of this subspecies\\". Distribution and habitat Eremophila compacta occurs near and between Carnarvon, Cue, Paynes Find, Murchison and Mount Augustus in the Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions where it grows in red sandy or clay soils. Conservation status Eremophila compacta is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Compact poverty bush has attractive silvery- grey foliage and pink to purple flowers.

The main channel is fed from sources near Laughton, Rushy Green on the outskirts of Ringmer, two streams near Selmeston and several near Ripe. History Glynde Reach and the River Ouse were almost certainly a tidal inlet at the time the Domesday book was produced in 1086. The main industry was the production of salt by the evaporation of sea water, and salt works were recorded at Ripe and Laughton. During the early 14th century, meadows were created on parts of the flood plain by building embankments, but conditions worsened later in the century. Meadows at Beddingham were flooded in the summer for five years in the 1360s and three in the 1380s, but not at all in the 1370s. The state of the land was affected by the state of the Ouse, and reductions in the volume of water to scour the main outlet at Newhaven as a result of the embanking resulted in a large shingle bar forming, and the mouth moving eastwards to Seaford. Consequently, conditions on the floodplain, known as the Lewes and Laughton Levels, worsened. Some of meadow owned by the Archbishop of Canterbury near the junction of the Glynde Reach and the Ouse became a permanent fishery called the Brodewater in the 15th century. In 1537, after the Prior of Lewes and various riparian landowners had consulted with Dutch drainage engineers, the Commissioners of the Levels raised a water scot, levied on all whose land was threatened by flooding, and by 1539 had cut a new outlet channel for the River Ouse through the shingle bank at Newhaven. The improved drainage benefitted the levels, enabling the Archbishop of Canterbury's Brodewater to revert to meadow, and it was still in use as such in 1616. Conditions worsened later in the 17th century, again connected with the deteriorating outlet to the Ouse, and so the Commissioners for the Levels employed the engineer John Smeaton to carry out a survey and recommend solutions. He visited the area on four days in June 1767, after a period of wet weather, to inspect the meadow lands, locally known as brooks. He found that the brooks at Ranscombe, near the junction between Glynde Reach and the Ouse, in common with those to the west of the Ouse, had low and poorly maintained embankments, and at high tide, the water level in the river was above the levels of the meadows. To the east of Ranscombe, the brooks bordering Glynde Reach were generally at a higher level, but were affected by stagnant water lying on the surface. He attributed this to the fact that there was no gradient on the river, which followed a winding course, and was confident that if the issues at Ranscombe could be resolved, those on the Glynde would also be. He proposed that the River Ouse should be straightened, that embankments should be raised at Ranscombe and to the west of the Ouse, and that a huge sluice should be constructed on the Ouse at Piddinghoe, to prevent tides from entering the river system. By 1768, the Commissioners had implemented some of Smeaton's suggestions, widening the Ouse below Lewes and dredging it to remove the worst shoals, but they did little to straighten the river, and his great sluice was not constructed. =Development= The next great advance came not as a result of land drainage proposals, but from an attempt to make the Ouse navigable. William Jessop surveyed the Ouse with this in mind in 1768, and made two proposals. The Ouse would be made navigable above Lewes, almost to its source, by constructing locks and weirs. Below Lewes, he proposed radical reworking of the channel, to make it straighter, deeper and wider. This second proposal was authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1791, and responsibility for the work was shared between a new body of Trustees for the river and the Commissioners of the Lewes and Laughton Levels. It would be funded by tolls for using the river, and by drainage rates for those who owned land on the levels. The balance between tolls and rates was too onerous for the landowners, and a second Act was obtained in 1800 to adjust them. The project was managed by a Lewes schoolmaster and civil engineer called Cater Rand, who employed a team of several hundred navvies. Work on the Ouse was competed by 1795, and from 1796 to 1803 they tackled the Glynde Reach. The faster-moving water in the rivers and its scouring effect on the mouth of the Ouse meant that drainage was significantly improved. Ranscombe Brooks and the Laughton Levels could again be used for agriculture, although there were complaints from a group of chair-bottomers, who lost their source of reeds to make chair seats. From 1783 until his retirement in 1828, the Expenditor for the Lewes and Laughton Levels was John Ellman, better known for his agricultural achievements, particularly the improvement of the Southdown sheep breed. He worked tirelessly to organise and supervise work carried out on the Glynde Reach and in the valley, where part of his farm was located on the levels. Such improvements reduced the incidence of flooding, and improved the draining of the land if such an event occurred. In 1973 a dam and pumping station was constructed across the channel at Beddingham, to prevent tidal water from entering the Laughton Level completely.

By 1978, this informal survey was narrowed to sites in the area of Kavousi. In the same year (1978), Gesell and Day were joined by William D.E. Coulson to establish the Kavousi Project. When formal excavations at the sites of Vronda and Kastro began in 1987, the Kavousi Project became known as the Kavousi Excavations.

Archaeological Sites Investigated  =Kavousi Vronda= View of Kavousi Vronda from the south (2001), with the island of Pseira in the distance. Settlement site, c. 427 meters above sea level, established slightly later than Kavousi Kastro and inhabited for up to four generations (around 120 years) before being abandoned at the very end of the Late Minoan IIIC period (c. 1050 BCE).Boyd 1901, pp. 131–136; Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1983; Haggis 2005, pp. 134, site 77; Day, Klein, and Turner 2009; Day and Glowacki 2011; Day et al. 2016. Vronda (\\"Thunder Hill\\"; or Βρόντας) was briefly explored by Harriet Boyd [Hawes] in 1900 and extensively excavated by the Kavousi Project from 1987 to 1992. At its greatest extent, the Vronda settlement covered an area of at least 0.50 hectares and consisted of about 20 houses, a large \\"special status\\" building on the summit that may have been the home of the community leader and a place for ritual feasting and drinking ceremonies (Building A-B), a freestanding temple or shrine of the \\"Goddess with Upraised Arms\\" () (Building G), and a kiln. In the Subminoan–Protogeometric periods (late 11th and 10th centuries BCE) — and continuing until the early Geometric period (9th century BCE) — Vronda was used as a cemetery for inhumation burials in at least 11 small, stone-built and corbeled tholos tombs. Located at the northern and northwestern edges of the Late Minoan IIIC settlement, these tholos tombs may have been constructed by the descendants of the original villagers, some of whom most likely had moved to the higher settlement at Kavousi Kastro. In the Late Geometric–Early Orientalizing periods (8th to 7th centuries BCE), numerous stone-built enclosures (cists) for cremation burials were constructed within and around the long-abandoned and partially collapsed Late Minoan IIIC houses and shrine. As an extensively excavated settlement from a single period of occupation, Kavousi Vronda provides insights into domestic activities, architecture, religion, and social organization of a community at the very beginning of the Greek Dark Ages (Late Minoan IIIC, or 12th to 11 centuries BCE). Its later cemeteries, used by the inhabitants of Kavousi Kastro and/or nearby Azoria until the mid-7th century BCE, attest to regional mortuary practices, rituals, and ideological concerns throughout the Early Iron Age. =Kavousi Kastro= View of Kavousi Kastro, looking east from the summit of Kavousi Vronda (2002). Settlement site, c. 713 meters above sea level, founded early in the Late Minoan IIIC period (12th century BCE) and continuously inhabited down to the Orientalizing period (late 7th century BCE), after which the site was abandoned.Boyd 1901, pp. 137–143; Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1983; Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1992; Coulson, Haggis, Mook, and Tobin 1997; Coulson 1998; Haggis 2005, pp. 136, site 80 The Kastro (\\"Citadel\\" or \\"Castle\\"; ) was briefly explored by Harriet Boyd [Hawes] in 1900 and extensively excavated by the Kavousi Project from 1987 to 1992. At its greatest extent, the settlement on the Kastro covered an area of at least 0.84 hectares. While most of the preserved architectural remains belong to the Late Geometric–Early Orientalizing phases (8th to 7th centuries BCE), there is ample evidence for the construction of walls, rooms, and houses in the Late Minoan IIIC and Protogeometric periods (12th to 10th centuries BCE), with renovations and additions over time. In particular, the Kastro settlement seems to have grown significantly at the end of the Late Minoan IIIC period. Since this is precisely the same time that the settlement at Kavousi Vronda was abandoned, it is likely that at least some of the population of Vronda was absorbed into the community at the Kastro. The Kastro may have become the dominant site in the Kavousi region from the 11th through the 8th centuries BCE. In the Late Geometric period (second half of the 8th century BCE), the excavated portion of the settlement included at least 21 houses, one of which (Building H) may have been a \\"special status\\" structure distinguished by its size and highly visible location on the western slope. Kavousi Kastro thus reveals a long sequence of occupation that provides insights into domestic activities, architecture, and social organization of a community throughout the entire Early Iron Age. Its well-preserved Late Geometric–Early Orientalizing (8th to 7th centuries BCE) settlement enhances our understanding of ancient society in a key period of Cretan history immediately before the transition to larger urban centers in the Archaic period (6th century BCE), such as at nearby Azoria. =Aloni (Skala)= Location of four tholos tombs, c. 300 meters southwest of Kavousi Kastro, originally excavated by Harriet Boyd [Hawes] and Blanche Wheeler in 1901 and reinvestigated by the Kavousi Project in 1981.Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1983, pp. 410–412; Haggis 2005, pp. 134–135, site 78. The tombs at Aloni (\\"Threshing Floor\\"; ), also known locally as Skala (\\"Stairway\\" or \\"Ladder\\"; ) are now designated Aloni I–IV. Only three tombs (Aloni I, II, and IV) were still preserved in 1981. Ceramic remains suggest periods of use in the Subminoan–Protogeometric, Geometric, and Late Geometric–Early Orientalizing periods. Based on their location and period of use, it is likely that these tombs formed part of a cemetery used by inhabitants of Kavousi Kastro. =Plaï tou Kastrou= Location of at least one stone-built tholos tomb on a slope c. 200 meters south of Kavousi Kastro, from which the British archaeologist Arthur Evans had obtained antiquities in 1896 and 1899.Boyd 1901, pp. 149; Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1983, pp. 412–413; Haggis 2005, pp. 136–137, site 81. The artifacts from the tomb at Plaï tou Kastrou (\\"Slope of the Kastro\\"; or Πλαγί του Κάστρου) date to the Subminoan–Early Protogeometric and Late Geometric–Early Orientalizing periods. Based on its location and period of use, it is likely that the tomb at Plaï tou Kastrou was used by inhabitants of Kavousi Kastro. =Skouriasmenos= Location of a well-built, stone tholos tomb, c. 500 meters southeast of Kavousi Kastro.Boyd 1901, pp. 143–148; Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1983, pp. 412; Haggis 2005, pp. 136–137, site 81. Although the tomb at Skouriasmenos (\\"Rusty Ridge\\"; ) had been systematically robbed prior to 1900, the architecture of the tomb is particularly well-preserved. When Harriet Boyd [Hawes] visited the site in 1900, she found several vessels dating to the Late Geometric–Early Orientalizing period. Based on its architectural sophistication, location, period of use, and contents, it is likely that the Skouriasmenos tomb was used by an important family or individual from the settlement at Kavousi Kastro. =Ridopoulia= Three small rock-shelters containing burials east of the modern village of Kavousi, on a terrace known locally as Ridopoulia ().Gesell, Day, and Coulson 1983, pp. 413–420; Haggis 2005, pp. 126–127, site 60. One rock-shelter (now designated Ridopoulia I), excavated by the Kavousi Project in 1981, had been previously robbed but contained fragments of Late Minoan III ceramics. Another rock shelter (Ridopoulia II) is said to have been cleared by a local landowner in the mid-20th century; a third tomb (Ridopoulia I) is said to have been excavated by a local landowner and American archaeologist Richard Seager in the early 20th century. Based on their location and period of use, it is likely that these tombs formed part of a cemetery used by a Late Minoan III settlement on the site of the modern Kavousi village.

It is a Looney Tunes cartoon, featuring Bosko, the original star of the series. It was released on February 11, 1933, though one source claims the release date is April 10, 1933.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic: a History of American Animated Cartoons. Von Hoffmann Press, Inc., 1980. p. 405 Like most Looney Tunes of its day, it was directed by Hugh Harman; its score is by Frank Marsales. The film features Bosko and Honey in a vaudeville-act. This is the first cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. Summary The title card is a curtain; it parts, revealing an asbestos sheath, which paradoxically burns up to reveal the stage. There sits Bosko at a piano, playing, scatting, occasionally snapping his fingers; then enters Honey. In time with the music, they greet each other. Bosko leaps from his stool and the couple dance. As the number ends, Honey intones, \\"Gee, Bosko, you're swell.\\" Our hero steps over and, bathed in the spotlight, his sweetheart having departed for the moment, sings an ode to Honey and their mutual love. As this yields to further dancing and scatting, Honey re-enters and the two complete the number to an unseen audience's applause. They run off stage, hand-in-hand, and Bosko stumbles cheerfully back on an instant later. Returning to his instrument, he repeats the melody from the opening, supplementing the theme twice by casting off his right glove, which tumbles leftward along the keys and then hurries back on its fingers (as if on foot) the first time to its master's hand and the second to Bosko's right knee, where it stands, endowed with a face and a voice of its own. \\"Well, what can you do?\\" Bosko asks. \\"I don't know,\\" replies the glove. Bosko thrice enjoins the glove to demonstrate its talents and thrice it refuses. \\"Now,\\" undauntedly says Bosko, \\"say 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.'\\" Giggling with modesty, and at Bosko's repeated request, the glove obliges; it gives another bashful laugh before returning to Bosko's hand. The pianist plays \\"Shave and a Haircut',\\" and, descending from his stool again, tap dances in the same rhythm. Seeming-nervously, he begins another tap dance and, tipping his hat, taps stage left; graceful at first, our hero loses his balance after a moment and falls. The audience roars with laughter. Picking himself up, Bosko dusts off his hat, and, donning it again, feigns a limp stage right before hopping on one foot and turning then to skip a bit leftward. He repeats the tap dance-routine from before and falls just as before. Enter Honey from the right, skipping: in a raspy voice she scats \\"Was That the Human Thing to Do?\\" She exits and returns a moment later in outsize shoes: donning a long, blond wig and extending her chin, she states, \\"I think I go home now,\\" in a probable homage to Greta Garbo. As she marches sultrily off, Bosko marches in time behind her, straw hat in hand, chin firmly in the air: he waits a moment for the audience's applause for Honey before he begins his Maurice Chevalier-impression. In time with the film's theme music, he sings, \\"Just whistle and blow your blues away.\\" Ridding himself of the straw hat, he hurries toward the piano, pulls a balloon from his pocket, inflates it, and places it before his nose. Now an obvious caricature of Jimmy Durante, he sits at the keyboard and plays as he states, \\"I know I'm not good looking, folks. But what's one opinion against a million?\\" The audience are now a chorus of boos. Huffing, Bosko-Durante dons a rumpled fedora (apparently stored within the piano) and complains, \\"Am I mortified? Am I mortified?!\\" as he tosses the hat to the floor. Audience and Honey applaud. Bosko then begins scatting and leaping about madly and playing trumpet; Honey dances passionately, the lights around her flashing; Bosko bangs on the various percussive instruments lining the stage and repeats his failed tap dance again, falling this time into a large drum off of stage left. Popping out, he briefly becomes Durante again: \\"Am I mortified?\\" He takes, apparently from within the drum, a wilted silk hat, puts it on, and, producing a clarinet from nowhere in particular, begins to play in the fashion of Ted Lewis as he walks stage right. Releasing his clarinet and tipping the hat, he most fittingly asks, \\"Is everybody happy?\\" A face upon a bass drum that stands next to Bosko concurs with \\"Whoopee!\\" Bosko takes up the instrument and bangs it in time to the music of \\"America\\" as he marches rightward; the man on the drum produces and brandishes a stein of beer as the drummer does so. Honey enters waving an American flag and Bosko proceeds to his exit. The face on the drum It has been suggested that the man depicted on the drum is Ted Lewis, whom Bosko certainly imitates in his act; although this is possible, the face also bears a passing resemblance to that of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. That the figure is Roosevelt is strengthened by the fact of that president's recent inauguration (on March 4 of the year the cartoon was released) and the figure's holding a glass of beer, signaling the pending repeal of Prohibition, a measure favored by the president.

It was built in 1933. It is also known as Evans Firebricks Ltd and Pindi Pindi Firebricks Company. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2000.  History  The former Pindi Pindi Brickworks were established in 1933 for Edmund Evans. The production of bricks on the site was related to the presence of coal at the Fleetwood Colliery, in the Whiptail Ranges, a source that was first commercially exploited in 1927-28. This colliery supplied the brickworks with coal following the opening of the Pindi Pindi site. Production of bricks was possible due to the high quality of clay in the area. The brickworks were established by Edmund Evans, a resident of Dinmore, a bricklayer by trade with experience in brick manufacture. A local resident, W Adams, assisted him in investigating the site. Construction on the brickworks site, established to supply the North Queensland market, began in May 1933. The first production of bricks took place at the end of 1933. Local shareholders in the Mackay area invested in the establishment of the works, with the brickworks trading under the name of Evans Firebricks Ltd. In 1934, the works employed 18 local workers, three of whom quarried the material at the clay pit and fifteen employed in the works environment. 78 000 bricks were produced during this time. Increasing demand for building bricks, as well as for firebricks, necessary for the sugar industry in North Queensland, saw the continued expansion of the brickworks. In 1937 the company won a lucrative contract to supply refractory firebricks used in the construction of brick arches in locomotive firebricks for the Northern Division of Queensland Railways. It was the only local company capable of producing this material. Following the replacement of Evans in 1938, Newbold Industries purchased the works, and Bill Gunthorpe was appointed as manager. Gunthorpe took up residence on site, living in a brick veneer dwelling, thought to be the first constructed in the area. This dwelling is currently separated from the brickworks site, situated on the Bruce Highway, across from the sheds. At this time, the works were renamed the Pindi Pindi Firebricks Company and continued to supply materials for the construction industry in North Queensland. With the outbreak of World War II the works were forced to close, as a result of labour shortages and the loss of construction contracts in North Queensland. At the time, the threat to Australia from invasion was considered so real that machinery on site was buried to prevent it falling into the hands of the Japanese. At the end of 1947, the company closed, only to be reopened in 1949 by a local resident, Tony Giaiotti. Edmund Evans returned on site to act as an advisor to Giaiotti. The bricks at Pindi Pindi were made by the semi-plastic method. A tramline ran from the clay and shale pit to the works. The clay was ground in the pan and then dropped into the brick press. The building bricks and fire bricks used the dry press method, however, bricks for fire arches in locomotive fireboxes had to be fashioned by hand. Early bricks produced on site were stamped with EFB (Evans Fire Bricks). The original brick pan and press were from Fowlers in Sydney. The pug-mill (mud mixer) was designed by Evans. The single cylinder engine remaining on site was imported from England, and is thought to be still capable of operating. Products from the works also found markets in other parts of Queensland, firebricks being used at the Mount Isa smelters as well as at Ipswich. Labour shortages continued to afflict the works at this time, and during the sugar crushing season, the works closed entirely. During the 1950s, the brickworks changed hands three times, being sold in 1951 to George Fattseas of Mackay. In 1955, Bitkin and Machen purchased the site, but closed the works in 1958. A local Mackay builder, Alan Porter, purchased the works in 1961, reopening them and continued in ownership until 1977. The Pindi Pindi works closed in 1977 with the brickworks being relocated to a new site at Glenalla Road, Mackay. At the time of closure, most of the machinery was moved to the new works; however, the kilns, brick pan and press and single cylinder engine (Ruston Hornsby) remain on site. Bricks from the former Pindi Pindi Brickworks were used to construct the Mackay Central State School (formerly the Mackay Intermediate School), Mackay Court House and Mackay Technical College. The brickworks are no longer in operation.  Description  The former Pindi Pindi Brickworks site is bounded by Blackrock Creek to the south and the Bruce Highway and railway line to the west. At present, the former Pindi Pindi Bricworks site includes the remnants of the kilns, the brick chimney stacks and the brick-floored \\"storage area\\". Evidence of the clay and shale pit quarrying operation is still present, and now shares the boundary with another property on the eastern side of the allotment. The original processing area is still visible, with the floor being constructed of bricks produced at the works. Original wooden supports, roof beams and trusses also remain, along with corrugated iron roofing. The majority of the walls are open and the roofed area has dirt floors. Two brick kilns, with chimneys, remain. Located at the base of the kilns are a number of openings with arched brick lintels. The original clay conveyor belt and pan are also present under the covered works area. Two small, brick offices remain in the western corner of the site as does a single storey brick house. The house is located near the river at the southern end of the property.  Heritage listing  The former Pindi Pindi Brickworks was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Pindi Pindi Brickworks, established in 1933, is important as an industrial in North Queensland, demonstrating industrial processes of the inter-war period. The establishment of the Brickworks resulted from the demand for the supply of building materials in North Queensland, as well as being the source of production for the supply of firebricks for the local sugar milling industry. It was the first brickworks to be established outside Brisbane capable of producing refractory firebricks, supplying these by contract to Queensland Railways. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The site demonstrates a rare aspect of Queensland's history as the brickworks chimney stacks at the Pindi Pindi site are among the last remaining stacks in the district. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. As an industrial archaeological site, the former Pindi Pindi Brickworks has the potential to reveal information which could contribute to an understanding of Queensland's heritage, providing more information on the manufacture of bricks in North Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former Pindi Pindi Brickworks is significant for the landmark qualities of the chimney stacks. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The bricks produced at the former Pindi Pindi Brickworks are associated with the development of the character and fabric of North Queensland, particularly in the Mackay area.

It receives freshwater inflow from the upstream Lough Feeagh at the base of the Burrishoole Catchment and tidal input of saline water from Clew Bay, through the Burrishoole Estuary. The lagoonal estuary is notable for the perenially anoxic deep water in the main inner basin. Tidal currents transport salty, dense oceanic water from Clew Bay into the inner basin and river inflows form a buoyant seaward surface layer. The large density contrast between these two water layers limits vertical mixing and the salty, dense bottom water becomes isolated and develops stagnant, anoxic conditions. Given the highly unusual physical environment, Furnace has served as a model system for important ecologically- motivated research including the population dynamics of euryhaline invertebrates, a paleolimnological reconstruction of its evolution toward anoxic conditions, which appears to have occurred at ca. 3400 calendar years before present, divergent evolution in fish ecotypes, bio-physical interactions between benthic fish and internal waves and dynamics of sub- surface chlorophyll maxima.

The third system and first severe tropical cyclone of the 1978–79 season, Peter developed on 29 December from a weak low pressure area over the Gulf of Carpentaria. Peter moved southeastward and deepened while brushing Arnhem Land. Initially a tropical low, it strengthened into a Category 1 cyclone by 12:00 UTC on 29 December. Peter intensified further on 30 December and became a Category 2 cyclone. On the following day, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph). Peter weakened to a Category 1 cyclone before making landfall near the mouth of the Edward River in Queensland. While crossing the Cape York Peninsula, the storm weakened slowly. After reaching Pacific Ocean near Cooktown, the storm decelerated and meandered offshore, but dissipated just offshore on 4 January. While trekking slowly offshore the east coast of Queensland, the storm dropped very heavy rainfall, peaking at at Mount Bellenden Ker, making it the wettest tropical cyclone on record in Australia. Severe flooding occurred, especially in the Cairns area. The most severe damage was dealt to sugar cane, which suffered 70 to 90 percent destruction. Some flights were canceled at the Cairns Airport due to standing water. Floodwaters forced at least 50 people to flee their homes in Cairns. A number of roads, including major highways, were flooded throughout coastal areas of Far North Queensland. Rainfall and winds also resulted in many power and telephone service outages through the region. There were two fatalities and damage reached approximately $10 million (1979 AUD; $11.4 million 1979 USD). Meteorological history During the final week of December 1978, an area of atmospheric convection developed over northern Australia and surrounding areas. During 28 December, an area of low pressure developed over the eastern Arnhem Land within this area of atmospheric convection. Over the next day the system moved northwestward toward the Gulf of Carpentaria and developed further, with the first gale force wind associated with the system reported from an automatic weather station on 29 December. The system was subsequently named Peter by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) after it moved into the Gulf and developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After being named, Peter continued to intensify further as it tracked southeastward toward the Cape York Peninsula. The system was subsequently considered to have peaked as a Category 2 tropical cyclone on 31 December, with 10-minute sustained winds estimated at by the BoM. Several hours later, the system made landfall between Aurukun and the Edward River mission, Queensland, at around 20:00 (Australian Eastern Standard Time, 11:00 UTC). As Peter made landfall during 31 December winds of , were reported from both Fitzroy Island and the Edward River mission weather stations. Over the next couple of days the system gradually weakened over land, before it emerged into the Coral Sea near Cooktown, Queensland, on 1 January. The system subsequently weakened below tropical cyclone intensity and became a tropical low during 2 January. The system was last noted on the following day as it degenerated into a complex low pressure system and moved back over the Cape York Peninsula. The complex low subsequently moved westwards over the Peninsula and into the Gulf, where it developed into Tropical Cyclone Greta. Impact The Darwin Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC) in Northern Territory issued a cyclone warning on 30 December for the coast of Arnhem Land from the Wessel Islands to Port Roper, located near the mouth of the Roper River. Although a cyclone warning indicates expectation of landfall, Peter would never strike Northern Territory. The strongest observed winds in the territory was on Northeast Island, while the highest precipitation total was in Nhulunbuy, of which fell in 24 hours. Very rough seas were reported along the coast of some areas, beaching a fishing vessel onto the rocks at Gove harbour. In Queensland, the Brisbane TCWC issued cyclone watches and flood warnings as the storm passed over the Cape York Peninsula. Some areas experienced strong winds, with gusts up to at Edward River Aboriginal Mission and Fitzroy Island. The storm dropped very heavy rainfall while drifting offshore Queensland, with Mount Bellenden Ker recording over a period of approximately three days, making Peter the wettest tropical cyclone in Australia. About of that fell in a 24-hour period, which was the country's highest daily rainfall total. Other significant precipitation amounts included in Millaa Millaa and in Cooktown. Due to the heavy rainfall, severe flooding occurred, mostly between Tully and Cooktown, with the worst impact in the Cairns area. Many creeks and rivers, such as the Herbert, the north and south branches of the Johnstone, and McLeod rivers overflowed or reached dangerous levels. Much of the damage in North Queensland occurred to newly planted sugar cane, with approximately 70 to 90 percent of area's crop destroyed. Twenty growers in Goondi each lost between $20,000 to $30,000 in sugar cane. Damage to this crop was comparable to the floods in 1977. In total, the storm destroyed 270,000 to 315,000 tonnes of sugar cane. Standing water at Cairns Airport led Ansett Australia to cancel some flights. Portions of many roads, including major highways such as the Bruce, Captain Cook, Gillies, and Kennedy highways were reported by the Royal Automobile Club as closed due to inundation and washouts. Many motorists were left stranded by floodwaters on Bruce Highway. Emergency personnel crews were put on standby in Innisfail as water up to threatened dozens of homes in the eastern part of town. In Cairns, over 50 people fled their homes. On 5 January, the Coast Guard of Australia began evacuating some 160 stranded campers in areas about 140 km (85 mi) north of Mossman. Foods shortages occurred in some areas of Far North Queensland, forcing several emergency food drops, including to about 250 people on 4 January and 70 people on 5 January. Additionally, a policeman was winched by helicopter to deliver food supplies to 10 isolated people on 7 January in Goldsborough, which is located in the Gillies Range to the west of Gordonvale. Overall, Peter left two fatalities and about $10 million (1979 AUD) in damage, at least $4.5 million of which was done to sugar cane in Babinda, Innisfail, and Tully. After the storm, the Government of Queensland declared the Cairns area as a natural disaster area. About week later, the Cabinet supported a measure by Minister for Primary Industries, Vic Sullivan, to offer low-interest loans to farmer who lost significant amounts of crops and livestock. Later, Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen requested aid from the national government. Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser approved low- interest loans up to $25,000 (1979 AUD) for small businesses and the implementation of other measures for recovery.

Melchior was often referred to as the oldest member of the Magi. He was traditionally called the King of Persia and brought the gift of gold to Jesus. In the Western Christian church, he is regarded as a saint (as are the other two Magi).  Tradition  The Gospels in the New Testament do not give the names of the Magi (or even their number), but their traditional names are ascribed to a Greek manuscript from 500 AD translated into Latin and commonly accepted as the source of the names.Metzger, Bruce, New Testament Studies: Philological, Versional, and Patristic, Volume 10, 1980, BRILL, Melchior was described by St Bede in the 8th century as being \\"an old man, with white hair and long beard.\\" Melchior is also commonly referred to as the King of Persia. Following the Star of Bethlehem, the Magi first travelled to the palace of Herod the Great, who then asked for the Magi to find the Child Jesus and report back to him. Upon arriving at the house, the Magi worshipped him and opened their gifts, with Melchior giving the gift of gold to signify Jesus' kingship over the world. According to a medieval saints calendar, following his return to Persia, Melchior met up with the other Magi again in 54 AD in the Kingdom of Armenia to celebrate Christmas before dying at the age of 116 on 1 January 55 AD. Commemoration Melchior, along with the other Magi, is purported to be buried in the Shrine of the Three Kings in Cologne Cathedral following his remains being moved from Constantinople by Eustorgius I in 314 AD to Milan. In 1164, Holy Roman Emperor Fredrick Barbarossa moved them to Cologne.David Lowenthal, The Heritage Crusade and the Spoils of History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), xvi.

He began his career in theater in Vienna, Austria in 1919, before moving to Berlin in 1925. Being Jewish, his work began to be restricted in the 1930s in Nazi Germany. Fleeing the Nazis he returned to Austria in 1936, where to hide his heritage, he created the persona of Kaspar Brandhofer, a Tyrolian peasant, and became a sensation as a natural actor on the stage in Vienna. When he admitted his ruse, he became blacklisted in Austria, after which he emigrated to the United States in 1937. He had an active film career in the United States, appearing in almost 40 films between 1938 and 1946. While on tour with the USO, he died in Manila in 1946. Early life He was born in the city of Dolyna, in what is now Ukraine, to Jewish parents. In 1913 he entered the Academy of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna. At the outbreak of World War I, he volunteered for the Austro- Hungarian Army and served in the Infanterie-Regiment Hoch- und Deutschmeister Nr. 4. In 1916 he married his first wife, Stephanie Wagner, with whom he had two children, Margaret and John Henry Royce. He entered the war as a private in 1914, and rose to the rank of lieutenant by the war's end. Wounded several times, he received a medal for valor. Career =Early stage career= He adopted the stage name of Leo Reuss. His first stage appearance was as the Duke of Albany in a production of King Lear at the Vienna Komödienhaus, on May 30, 1919. This was under the tutelage of the famous Austrian actor/director Rudolph Schildkraut. Following this, he went to Munich in 1921, where he joined the Kammerspiele. This propelled him to travel to Berlin, where he joined the Berliner Staatstheater (Berlin State Theater), with Leopold Jessner as director. It was here that he gained fame as a stage actor. During his time in Berlin he also worked under Erwin Piscator and Bertolt Brecht. By 1925 he was divorced, and living with actress Agnes Straub. The two left the Berlin State Theater, and joined the Berliner Volksbühne. The two formed the Schauspielerin Agnes Straub (Agnes Straub Touring Company). However, as the Nazi regime gained more and more power in Germany, it became increasingly difficult for Reuss to work, due to him being Jewish. The implementation of the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 were the final straw, and Reuss returned to his native Austria. However, in Austria he also found it difficult to obtain work due to his Jewish heritage. =Subterfuge= In order to get work as an actor, Reuss began an elaborate subterfuge. He retreated to a cabin he owned up in the mountains. There he lived and studied the mannerisms of the local Tyrolian farmers, while letting his hair and beard grow. He practiced at adapting their ways of speech and movement. After a year, he showed up in the created persona of Kaspar Brandhofer, a Tyrolian peasant, having grown a full beard. To further hide his identity, he bleached all of his hair, head and body, by bathing every ten days in diluted hydrogen peroxide. He also had obtained papers from one of the peasants he had been observing in the mountains. Armed with this new Christian identity, he began presenting himself as a naturally taught actor. Having worked with director Max Reinhardt years before, Reuss was fearful that the director would recognize him, but Reinhardt did not. In fact, his ability so impressed the director, that Reinhardt recommended him to Ernst Lothar, in Vienna. Lothar gave him a featured role in the stage adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's novella, Fräulein Else. Many of the actors in the play had worked with Reuss over the years, so once again he knew that he could not drop the character of Brandhofer for a second. The play debuted on December 2, 1936, at the Theater in der Josefstadt. His performance was hailed as a great success, and Brandhofer was touted as a potential star, with one paper calling him \\"the sensation of the evening.\\" Other accolades came in naming him \\"the humble peasant of the Austrian Alps, the finest natural actor of his generation,\\" while the Nazis lauded him as proof of the superiority of Aryan blood. Lothar gave him a three-year contract. However, after the reviews were in, he announced his true identity. Rather than being pleased with the reviews, he felt \\"emptiness and loneliness\\", and that he felt the necessity of his assuming the Brandhofer persona was an indication that the Nazi regime's power was growing to an untenable level. The resulting uproar of his fraud caused him once again to have to relocate, this time to the United States, where he had been given a contract by MGM, after Louis B. Mayer had seen his performance in Vienna. =The United States= Forced to flee Austria in 1937, Reuss changed his name again, this time to Lionel Royce, and immigrated to the United States. He began his American film career in 1938, with a small role in the epic, Marie Antoinette, starring Tyrone Power and Norma Shearer. He enjoyed a productive film career for the next 8 years. He began 1939 with a few small roles in films such as a German in Let Freedom Ring, and then was cast in the important role of Mr. Bachspiegel in Broadway Serenade. After this he was cast as Hintze, one of the Nazi spies, in Confessions of a Nazi Spy. In 1939, his work as General Von Ehrhardt in Nurse Edith Cavell was praised for his stand-out performance. At the close of the year, he appeared on-screen with the Ritz Brothers in Pack Up Your Troubles. In this film Royce would work with Joseph Schildkraut, the son of his one-time mentor, Rudolph Schildkraut. Outside of film, in 1939 Royce joined the Continental Players, a theater group made up of refugees from the Nazi regime in Europe. The brainchild of William Dieterle, it was funded by him and Harry Warner, with the famed German director Leopold Jessner taking the directing helm. After attaining some notability in the United States, Royce was approached by the German embassy in Washington. They had been instructed by their leaders in Berlin to offer Royce \\"honorary Aryan\\" status, if he would return to Germany and take over control of UFA. Royce refused. Royce opened 1940 as Dr. Rudolph Grosser, one of the suspects in the detective picture, Charlie Chan in Panama. His performance as Max Sturm in the 1940 drama, Four Sons was called \\"superb\\" by some media. His role as the German interrogator Herr Deckart in the wartime drama, The Man I Married, starring Joan Bennett and Francis Lederer, received positive reviews. Also in 1940, Royce was one of three henchman who try to subvert the mission of Fredric March in Victory. He closed out the year in the featured role of Colonel Zimmerman in the action film, The Son of Monte Cristo, which stars Louis Hayward, Joan Bennett, and George Sanders. His final film appearance was in the classic film noir, Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford. Death and legacy In 1946, he joined a USO tour, going to entertain the troops in the Pacific Theater. While the tour was in Manila, Royce died suddenly of a heart attack, on April 1, after being taken to Subic Bay Naval Hospital. The irony of Royce's film career is that he ended up portraying the very people he had fled from in Germany and Austria. In the 1990s, a play about Royce's life was written by Felix Mitterer, titled In der Löwengrube (English: In the Lion's Den). It premiered at the Volkstheater in Vienna on January 24, 1998. In 2005 a biography about Lionel Royce appeared in Germany; Title: \\"The rats enter the sinking ship - the absurd life of Leo Reuss\\" written by Gwendolyn von Ambesser, edited by Edition VA.

His experience was the subject of the 2004 narrative short film Stand Up for Justice: The Ralph Lazo Story. Biography Ralph Lazo, born in Los Angeles in November 3, 1924, was of Mexican American and Irish American descent. His mother died when he and his sister were young, leaving them in the care of their father, who found work painting houses and murals. As a Belmont High School student at age 17, Lazo learned that his Japanese American friends and neighbors were being forcibly removed as part of the Japanese American Internment and incarcerated at Manzanar. Lazo was so outraged that he joined friends on a train that took hundreds to Manzanar in May 1942. Manzanar officials never asked him about his ancestry. \\"Internment was immoral,\\" Lazo told the Los Angeles Times. \\"It was wrong, and I couldn't accept it.\\" \\"These people hadn't done anything that I hadn't done except to go to Japanese language school.\\" Lazo attended school at the camp, and also spent time entertaining orphaned children who had been forcibly relocated to Manzanar. In 1944, Lazo was elected president of his class at Manzanar High School. After his graduation, he remained at the camp until August 1944, when he was inducted into the US Army. He served as a Staff Sergeant in the South Pacific until 1946, helping liberate the Philippines. Lazo was awarded the Bronze Star for heroism in combat. The film Stand Up for Justice: The Ralph Lazo Story documents his life story, particularly his stand against the incarceration. After the war, Lazo returned to Los Angeles, where he graduated from UCLA with a degree in sociology and earned a master's degree in education from Cal State Northridge. Lazo spent his career teaching, mentoring disabled students and encouraging Hispanics to attend college and vote. Lazo also helped raise funds for a class-action lawsuit to win reparations for Japanese Americans interned during the war, which resulted in the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. This act offered an apology to interned Japanese Americans on behalf of the U.S. government and stated that the internment was based on \\"race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.\\" Lazo died in 1992 from liver cancer, at the age of 67.

Saint Balthazar; also called Balthasar, Balthassar, and Bithisarea, was according to tradition one of the biblical Magi along with Caspar and Melchior who visited the infant Jesus after he was born. Balthazar is traditionally referred to as the King of Arabia and gave the gift of myrrh to Jesus. In the Roman Catholic Church, he is regarded as a saint (as are the other two Magi).  Tradition  The Gospel of Matthew does not give the names of the Magi (or even how many there were), but their traditional names are ascribed to a Greek manuscript from 500 AD translated into Latin and commonly accepted as the source of the names.*Metzger, Bruce, New Testament Studies: Philological, Versional, and Patristic, Volume 10, 1980, BRILL, In this original manuscript, Balthazar is called Bithisarea, which later developed into Balthazar in Western Christianity. Balthazar was described in the 8th century by Saint Bede as being \\"[of] black complexion, with [a] heavy beard\\" with the \\"myrrh he held in his hands prefigured the death of the Son of man\\". As part of the Magi, Balthazar followed the Star of Bethlehem first to the palace of Herod the Great who instructed them to return to him when they had found the Child Jesus. When they arrive at the house, the Magi worshipped him and presented their gifts. Balthazar gave the gift of myrrh, which symbolised the future death of a king, as myrrh was an expensive item at the time. Following his return to his own country, avoiding King Herod, it is purported that Balthazar celebrated Christmas with the other members of the Magi in Armenia in 54 AD but later died on 6 January 55 AD, aged 112. January 6 is also the feast day of Balthazar because is the date of his death. Balthasar and Gaspar are characters in the novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ and the various film adaptions of the novel, which chronicles his later years.  Commemoration  Balthazar, along with the other Magi, is purported to be buried in the Shrine of the Three Kings in Cologne Cathedral following his remains being moved from Constantinople by Eustorgius I in 344 AD to Milan. In 1164, Holy Roman Emperor Fredrick Barbarossa moved them to Cologne.David Lowenthal, The Heritage Crusade and the Spoils of History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), xvi. Balthazar is commemorated on Epiphany with the other members of the Magi but in Catholicism, Balthazar's feast day is on 6 January because it was the day that he died. Blackface controversy and traditional iconic representation Many traditionally Christian countries stage pageants that include roles for the three wise men. In mainland European countries it is customary for Balthazar, based on Saint Bede's description of him, to often be portrayed by a person in blackface. In a tradition dating from the Middle Ages dark skinned people were described as bringers of gold. In the 21st century, a number of campaigns in Spain pushed for a black person to play Balthazar rather than a person in blackface, which potentially goes against the tradition that local city Councillors play the role. Adorazione dei Magi (Adoration of the Magi) by alt= Others have pointed out that, until recent times, many smaller Spanish towns had no people of sub-Saharan origin. Since King Balthazar, in traditional pictorial representations from the Late Middle Ages, is represented as a black person (as an integrating or cosmopolitan graphic symbol, in the tradition that the \\"wise men\\" or \\"magi\\" who worshipped Jesus in Bethlehem represented the peoples of the whole world), fitting in with this traditional icon motivated his representation in the cavalcades of Three Wise Men by a person made up in black. In many Spanish towns that custom continues, while others now ask a prominent resident of African descent, for instance a star athlete of a local sports team, to take on this role in the cavalcades.

Abstract : We have seen that the theory of games that emerges from this research is quite remote in both its concerns and its findings from the von Neumann Morgenstern theory. To arrive at actual strategies for the play of games as complex as chess, the game must be considered in extensive form, and its characteristic function is of no interest. The task is not to characterize optimality or substantive rationality, but to define strategies for finding good moves—procedural rationality. What is emerging, from research on games like chess, is a computational theory of games: A theory of what it is reasonable to do when it is impossible to determine what is best—a theory of bounded rationality. The lessons taught by this research may be of considerable value for understanding and dealing with situations in real life that are even more complex that the situations we encounter in chess—in dealing, say, with large organizations, with the economy, or with relations among nations. The game of chess has sometimes been referred to as the Drosophila of artificial intelligence and cognitive science research - a standard task that serves as a test bed for ideas about the nature of intelligence. * Larkins Wins 56th Armed Forces Open. * Hater, David A. 2016. \\"Officers Pay Double: Larry Larkins wins 56th Armed Forces Championship, and our correspondent examines how Chess helped our overseas forces.\\" January 2016.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the use of chess programs to study human thinking. The work on chess programs has produced a collection of mechanisms sufficient to play chess of modest caliber. Independently of their detailed characteristics, they help understand what must be done in order to play chess. The approach used was to examine in some detail the behavior of a man deciding what move to make in a specific middle game position. Having available a protocol, a transcript of the verbal behavior of the man while he is analysing the board and making his decision. Previous work with protocols in other tasks (proving theorems, guessing sequences, learning concepts) has aimed at constructing computer programs that match the behavior in detail. In this paper the authors undertake only the first stages of such an analysis, laying bare the reasoning the subject employed, by examining his protocol in detail. The analysis draws upon ones general knowledge about reasoning mechanisms and how to organize * United States, and National Audiovisual Center. USAF Sports and Recreation 1964.

Abstract: The type of reasoning done by human chess masters has not been done by computer programs. The purpose of this research is to Investigate the extent to which knowledge can replace and support search In selecting a chess move and to delineate the issues involved. This has been carried out by constructing a program, PARADISE (PAttern Recognition Applied to Directing SEarch), which finds the best move in tactically sharp middle game positions from the games of chess masters. * Young, Franklin Knowles.

Most of this equipment received the generic prefix FuG for Funkgerät, meaning \\"radio device\\". Occasionally the shorted Fu designation were used and there were exceptions to both these systems. Number ranges were not unique across the services so sometimes different equipment used by different services had the same FuG prefix. This article is a list and a description of the radio equipment. Armoured force communications Fug 1: Also known as Torn.E.b And Pack Receiver b. A Medium-wave receiver it operated in the 0,1 to 7,095 kHz frequency range. Repackaged for use in several other receivers and transceivers. FuG 2: A high-band HF/low-band VHF receiver. Also known a USW receiver c1. It operated in the 27,000 to 33,300 kHz (27-33.3 MHz) range. The FuG 2 was never used on its own but as an additional receiver in command tanks and relay devices. It was usually installed in section leader and company commanders' vehicles, to allow them to listen on one frequency while transmitting and receiving on another. As it operated on the same band as the FuG 5 it allowed them, for example, to listen to the regimental command net while talking to the subordinate units at the same time. Matching the transmitters that operated in this frequency range, this receiver provided for 50 kHz channel steps in the 27.0 to 33.3 MHz range for a total of 125 available channels. FuG 3: A low-band VHF receiver. It operated in the 42-47.8 MHz range. Repackaged as FuG 3 neu for use with motorcycle troops. FuG 4: A medium-wave receiver used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000 kHz frequency range. It was used with the same antenna as the Fug 8. It was usually used for communication with a Fug 8 in the same installation. (Fug 8 + Fug 4) FuG 5: A high-band HF/low-band VHF transceiver. It operated in the 27,000 to 33,300 kHz (27-33.3 MHz) frequency range with a transmission power of 10 Watts. This equipment provided for 125 radio channels at 50 kHz channel spacing. It was usually used with a two-metre antenna. Was present in almost all German tanks and some other vehicles. Was the standard kit for tank-to- tank communication within platoons and companies. Range was approx 2–3 km when using AM voice and 3–4 km when using CW. Reworked to produce the FuG 5 (Luft) variant which was used for air-to-ground communication until replaced with the FuG 7. FuG 6: A high-band HF/low-band VHF transceiver. It operated in the 27,000 to 33,300 kHz (27-33.3 MHz) frequency range with a transmission power of 20 Watts. It was usually used with a two-metre antenna. It was used by armoured observation posts. These were usually early-model tanks with some of their armament removed and replaced by equipment for artillery observers. It was used by the observers to communicate with the armoured unit leaders via their Fug 5 radios. Main advantage over the FuG 5 was greater range. Range was approx 4–6 km when using AM voice and 6–8 km when using CW. Comparable to the American SCR-508 tank radio, which covered a similar frequency range (20-27.9 MHz) at 25 watts. The major difference between German Army tank sets and US Army tank sets was the American use of FM for the high-HF/low-VHF bands. FuG 7: A VHF transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 42,000 to 48,300 kHz (42-48.3 MHz) frequency range with a transmission power of 20 Watts. It was usually used with a 1.4 metre antenna. It was matched with the Luftwaffe transceiver Fug 17 in ground support operations. It was used for CAS operations, though these became rare after late 1944 with the result that many command tanks with this equipment fitted were converted to other roles. Ground-to-air range 60 km AM voice to 80 km CW. FuG 8: A medium- wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000 kHz frequency range with a transmission power of 30 Watts. It was used with various antenna ranging from 1.8 to 9-metre antenna. It was used for communication back to the regimental command post. Range 25 km AM voice to 140 km CW using the nine-metre antenna, the station had to be stopped to use this antenna. FuG 9: A transceiver, operated in the 0.1 - 7.1 MHz (100 kHz - 7100 kHz) range. FuG 10: A medium-wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000 kHz frequency range with a transmission power of 30 Watts. It was used with a frame antenna on various reconnaissance units. Range 10 km AM voice to 40 km CW. FuG 11: A medium-wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000 kHz frequency range with a transmission power of 100 Watts. Used at the regimental command post. Range 70 km AM voice to 200 km CW. FuG 12: A medium-wave transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in command tanks. It operated in the 1,130 to 3,000 kHz frequency range with a transmission power of 80 Watts. It was used with a two-metre antenna. Reconnaissance units later in the war. FuG 13: A Fug 6 with two receivers rather than one. FuG 14: Multi-radio setup consisting of several separate radios. FuG 15: A HF receiver. It operated in the 23,000 to 24,950 kHz (23-24.95 MHz) frequency range. It was matched with transceiver Fug 16 for use with Sturmartillerie (self-propelled artillery). FuG 16: A HF transceiver (receiver/transmitter) used in the command vehicles of Sturmartillerie units. It operated in the 23,000 to 24,950 kHz (23-24.95 MHz) frequency range with a transmission power of 10 Watts. It was usually used with a two-metre antenna. Range 2 km AM voice to 4 km CW.

UHF Communication Link Equipment  From 1936 the German forces started deploying a range of communication links using UHF frequencies to form a point-to-point mesh communication network. During the war this was extended to cover the majority of the occupied areas or Europe and North Africa. Both the army and the air force made use of the same equipment. The units of the T series were \\"backpack\\"-style mobile equipment. The K series were truck mobile units using a range of masts up to approximately 11 m tall. The G series were still mobile but were intended to form more of a backbone for communications and were intended to remain in place for longer periods than the K. They again used a series of masts up to 50 m high. Depending on the set a range of communication facilities were available consisting of voice and/or teletype and Hellscriber. Range was line- or-sight so the ranges reported here were assuming the antenna could \\"see\\" one another.http://www.cdvandt.org/SIGESO-DMG-RF-FH- Allemands.pdfhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/ht7s2xjb8vovnbn/article-German- Communication-UHF-DMGmichael.pdf?dl=0 German UHF Communication Systems DMG 2 T: Pack unit, operating on the 475 - 525 MHz band, single channel voice or 800 character-per-second teletype.

The tamboori is very similar to the tanpura, despite being smaller and played with a bow. A tamboori is played as a melodic instrument, unlike the tanpura. Each string has a fundamental tone with its own spectrum of overtones, which makes a rich and vibrant sound, due to interactive harmonic resonance that will support the external tones played by the soloist. The name tamboori is derived from tama or tana, referring to a musical phrase, and borri, or bori which means \\"vibrant\\". The body shape of the tamboori somewhat resembles that of the sitar, but it has no frets. One or more tambooris may be used to accompany vocalists or instrumentalists.

The exact origins of the tower could date back to pre- history with different architecture. It is argued that the tower could be of Punic origins rather than Roman but the latter have adapted it. The site of the tower was used as a cemetery, or more, during the Muslim caliphate in the medieval times. Following the expulsion of the Muslims in Malta a church dedicated to St. Helen was built on the site.https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/47565/1/1.pdf Today roughly one-third of the tower still stands and is neglected. The tower is one of a chain of towers that were built at their time, probably designed to aid each other from invasion coming from the sea. Eight coastal towers are believed to have existed in Malta and none on the nearby island of Gozo; six of which are known as the Punic-Roman towers. The remains of rural villa, consisting of a cistern and Roman wall, are found close by.https://www.gov.mt/en/Government/Documents/PA%20Listings%20Notices/1996/gn638_96.pdf Name The name Ta' Cieda was given in the medieval ages by Christians of which origins is from the devotion to St Helen.Anthony, Luttrell (undated). \\"The Capella of Birkirkara: 1402\\". Melitensia. Retrieved 20 January 2016. p. 157. History =Pre-historic origin= The area of San Ġwann has been inhabited since pre-historic times and evidence of this are the cart ruts in San Ġwann situated not far from the tower. Excavation have suggested that the tower may have pre-historic origins but archaeologists believe that some rocks may have had adaptive reuse. Indeed, the round shape tower suggest that it was built sometimes later as other pre-historic fortification in Malta show different construction of pre-historic defense. A Neolithic/Bronze structure has also been found close by at Wied Ghomor (Ghomor Valley).Braun, Hugh (1946), \\"Works of art in Malta: losses and survivals in the war\\", H.M. Stationery Off., p. 21. =Punic and Roman= The Ta' Cieda Tower and modern housing at the back In 1915 archeologist Thomas Ashbey said that the tower is of Phoenician origins.Cutajar, Tony (2015), \\"Appeal to preserve San Ġwann’s neglected historical heritage\\", Times of Malta. The tower is generally believed to be a Roman tower, hence the references as San Gwann Roman Tower or Ta' Cieda Roman Tower or Ta' Cieda Round Tower. Archeologists, such as Professor A. Bonanno, argue that speaking on the context of the time it is more likely that the tower was built during the Punic period rather than the Roman period as attack were less likely during the latter. Round tower designs were already established at the time of the Punic period. Indeed, historians hold that the Maltese archipelago in the third century was at the aim of Carthage and the Romans by invading the native Punic civilisation. Despite these plausible arguments it is also argued that the tower may have been built by the Punic people and then embellished by the Romans. From the findings it is also suggested that the Romans may have built it in the form of a folly to overlook the plantation of the olive trees which originate in the area since Roman times. Even if so it is not clearly known as no Roman villas were ever recorded to exist in the area, but Romans did rule the islands for a long period.Adolphus Lewis, Harrison (1977), \\"Ancient Malta: A Study of Its Antiquities\\", Smyth, , p. 112.Buhagiar, Mario (2005), \\"The late Medieval art and architecture of the Maltese islands\\", Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti, , p. xxii. For instance Roman villas and Roman buildings were excavated near other Roman towers in the south of Malta such as in Hal Safi and Żurrieq, and as a chain of towers working together this may be also a plausible argument.Sagona, Claudia (2015), 'Melita and Gaulos during the Punic Period', in \\"The Archeology of Malta\\", Cambridge University Press, , p. 239. In 1960 Doctor David Trump has brought to the attention of a Roman cistern not far from the tower. This structure is historically important as the use of cement, that at times is thought to be a modern use, was used by the Romans that does not date to the Punics. This concludes that the origins of the tower is Punic but that the tower was readopted by the Romans. Roman pottery was unearthed and Roman tombs have been excavated and documented.C. Cutajar Tony (2006), \\"Neglected heritage in San Gwann\\", Times of Malta. It has been said that the tower \\"may have served as a centre point around which one of Malta's more important mediaeval settlements had developed out of late Roman economic activity in the area\\".C. Cutajar, Tony (2009), \\"Neglected heritage sites in San Gwann\\", Times of Malta. =Muslim period= A different angulation of the remains During the Muslim period the area at the tower is known to have at least been used as an Islamic cemetery, one of the early Islamic cemeteries in Malta. The reuse of former building by the Arabs was common as it facilitated effort from cutting rock. Some Punic and Roman building have been discovered to be reused in Malta during the Islamic caliphate, this could have possibly included the Ta' Cieda Tower. On site of the tower there were burial ground dating to the Arab period but these stone slabs and other evident Islamic symbol on the islands were eradicated after the expulsion of the Muslims from the lands. However several names of areas in San Gwann are still carrying Arab names.Buhagiar, Mario (1986), \\"Late Roman and Byzantine catacombs and related burial places in the Maltese Islands\\", B. A.

It is documented that close by the Ta' Cieda Tower a church dedicated to St. Helen was built. This church is important in the Roman Catholic Church's history in Malta as it was the first parish church to be built for the parish of Birkirkara. It is to note that back then, when the parish church was built, the San Gwann lands were all (or most of) part of Birkirkara. The church was named as St. Helen Church, also known as Capella di Birchirchara, built before 1402 and was abandoned in the late 14th century of which no traces remain. The title of the parish church of Birkirkara was transferred to the 'Old Church', namely the Santa Maria Church in Mriehel, Birkirkara. Today Birkirkara's parish church is also dedicated to St. Helen as St Helen's Basilica.\\"San Gwann\\", Malta-Canada.Buhagiar, Mario (2005), \\"The late Medieval art and architecture of the Maltese islands\\", Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti, , 9789993210351, p. 193 Modern Vegetation, dumping and dilapidation at the site of Ta' Cieda TowerC.

The news of the review came when Prime Minister Cameron announced the review at a press conference in late March 2014. “We want to challenge the extremist narrative that some Islamist organisations have put out,” the Prime Minister said, and \\"What I think is important about the Muslim Brotherhood is that we understand what this organisation is, what it stands for, what its beliefs are in terms of the path of extremism and violent extremism, what its connections are with other groups, what its presence is here in the United Kingdom. Our policies should be informed by a complete picture of that knowledge.\\" Following the announcement at the press conference questions were asked at the House of Lords and the government made it clear that some of the findings of the review would be published. A government announcement stated that “the purpose of the review is to produce an internal report to the Prime Minister to inform government policy towards the Muslim Brotherhood.” The government also asked interested parties to submit evidence to be used in the review. In November 2016, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee released a report denouncing the previous report and attempting to cast the Muslim Brotherhood in a better light. However, this newer report has garnered criticism for its alleged bias as well. Jenkins Commission Sir John Jenkins was asked to draw up a report on the philosophy and values and alleged connections with extremism and violence by the Muslim Brotherhood. Other key players in the review team were Sir Kim Darroch, the prime minister's national security adviser, Sir John Sawers, the current chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and Charles Farr, at the time of writing Director General of the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism in the Home Office. The final authors of the review were Sir John Jenkins and Charles Farr.  Review period  The investigative part of the review was completed in July 2014. The government also asked interested parties to submit evidence to be used in the review. Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood leaders Ibrahim Munir Mustafa, Secretary-General Mahmoud Hussein, as well as the leader of the Tunisian Ennahdha party, Rached Ghannouchi, have given expert evidence. As well as former general comptroller of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, Hammam bin Said, and his deputy Zaki bin Arshid, and Saad Eddine Othmani, a leading figure of the Moroccan Islamist Justice and Development Party were interviewed by the commission. Then the drafting process took some time with The Daily Times reporting mid September 2014 that the report was handed over the Prime Minister's office. Final report and main findings The final report by the Jenkins Commission remains classified but the publication of the findings of the report were delayed multiple times until they were released in a session of the House of Commons on 17 December 2015. First part of the report The findings are presented in two main parts. The first part was done by Sir John Jenkins, he examined the development, ideology and structures of the Muslim Brotherhood, historically and through its foundational writings. The four main subjects discussed by Jenkins were focused on the Muslim Brotherhoods: * Foundational ideology and structures * The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt * The Muslim Brotherhood internationally * The Muslim Brotherhood, violence and terrorism =Conclusions from first part of the main findings= Some of the conclusions of the first part are: “Hassan al Banna accepted the political utility of violence, and the Brotherhood conducted attacks, including political assassinations and attempted assassinations against Egyptian state targets and both British and Jewish interests during his lifetime;” “in return for freedom to reorganise politically and socially in Egypt in the 1970s, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood officially disowned violence;” “However, the Muslim Brotherhood at all levels have repeatedly defended Hamas attacks against Israel, including the use of suicide bombers and the killing of civilians. The Muslim Brotherhood facilitate funding for Hamas. The leadership of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, its Jordanian counterpart and Hamas are closely connected. There are wider links with Muslim Brotherhood affiliates throughout the region. Senior members of the Muslim Brotherhood routinely use virulent, anti-Semitic language;” “Senior Muslim Brotherhood figures and associates have justified attacks against coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan;” “Some members of the Muslim Brotherhood (mainly in non Muslim countries) have strongly criticised Al Qaida. But leaders in the Muslim Brotherhood have claimed that the attacks on 09/11 were fabricated by the US, and that the so called ‘war on terrorism’ is a pretext to attack Muslims.” “Sir John concluded that it was not possible to reconcile these views with the claim made by the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood in their evidence to the review that “the Muslim Brotherhood has consistently adhered to peaceful means of opposition, renouncing all forms of violence throughout its existence”. Second part of the report The second part of the on the Muslim Brotherhood in the United Kingdom was written Charles Farr. He examined in detail the Muslim Brotherhood's development, ideology and activities in the UK. =Conclusions from second part of the main findings= “In the 1990s the Muslim Brotherhood and their associates established public facing and apparently national organisations in the UK to promote their views. None were openly identified with the Muslim Brotherhood and membership of the Muslim Brotherhood remained (and still remains) a secret. But for some years the Muslim Brotherhood shaped the new Islamic Society of Britain (ISB), dominated the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) and played an important role in establishing and then running the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). MAB became politically active, notably in connection with Palestine and Iraq, and promoted candidates in national and local elections. The MCB sought and obtained a dialogue with Government.” “Mr Farr found that as of mid-2014 the Brotherhood in the UK comprised a range of organisations, loosely associated together but without common command and control or a single leader. Some of these organisations had emerged in and from the UK. Others represented third country Brotherhood organisations using London as a base for overseas activities.” “The military wing of Hamas was proscribed in the UK as a terrorist organisation in 2001 but Hamas has been active here for over ten years.” ”Muslim Brotherhood organisations in the UK – including charities – are connected to counterparts elsewhere in Europe. MAB are associated with the Federation of Islamic Organisations in Europe (FIOE), established by the Muslim Brotherhood in 1989. FIOE subsequently created the European Council for Fatwa and Research, another pan European Muslim Brotherhood body, intended to provide religious and social guidance to Muslims living in Europe.” Final conclusions “The Muslim Brotherhood have promoted a radical, transformative politics, at odds with a millennium of Islamic jurisprudence and statecraft” The Muslim Brotherhood generally tries to transform and remodel individuals and communities through a bottom up approach and where possible participate in politics. But if needed the Muslim Brotherhood is willing to use violence and terror in pursuit of their long term goals; The Muslim Brotherhood in the West uses double speak, the public narrative in the West in English the message is significantly different than in Arabic; \\"There is little evidence that the experience of power in Egypt has caused a rethinking in the Muslim Brotherhood of its ideology or conduct.\\" \\"Much about the Muslim Brotherhood in the UK remains secretive, including membership, fund raising and educational programmes. But Muslim Brotherhood associates and affiliates here have at times had significant influence on the largest UK Muslim student organisation, national organisations which have claimed to represent Muslim communities (and on that basis have sought and had a dialogue with Government), charities and some mosques. Though their domestic influence has declined organisations associated with the Muslim Brotherhood continue to have an influence here which is disproportionate to their size;\\" \\"the Muslim Brotherhood in the UK claimed to act in support of Muslim communities here and use London as a base for activism elsewhere, notably with other Muslim Brotherhood organisations in Europe, in Egypt and the occupied Palestinian territories and in the Gulf. This activity is sometimes secretive, if not clandestine;\\" The Muslim Brotherhood have been publicly committed to political engagement in the United Kingdom. \\"Aspects of Muslim Brotherhood ideology and tactics, in this country and overseas, are contrary to our values and have been contrary to our national interests and our national security.”  Foreign Affairs Select Committee’s recent criticism of 2014 report  In November 2016, Britain's Foreign Affairs Select Committee, headed by Crispin Blunt, published a new report which harshly criticized the 2014 report. This most recent report was drafted over a period of nine months and specifically denounced the initial selection of Sir John Jenkins: “Notwithstanding his knowledge, experience, and professional integrity, Sir John Jenkins’s concurrent service as UK ambassador to Saudi Arabia made his appointment to lead the Muslim Brotherhood Review misguided. It created the impression that a foreign state, which was an interested party, had a private window into the conduct of a UK Government inquiry…This has undermined confidence in the impartiality of the FCO’s work on such an important and contentious subject.”https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmfaff/118/118.pdf In their own words, the authors of this 2016 report stated their intent was to conduct an inquiry into ‘political Islam’, its characteristics, and how well the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has understood and engaged with ‘political-Islamist’ groups.” Crispin Blunt has also encountered judgement for reportedly being a Muslim Brotherhood advocate, as he has sat in on meetings with the group and has spoken publicly about how the Brotherhood should not have been ousted in 2013. = Stated shortcomings of 2014 report = The Committee lists three main shortcomings of the prior report: * Failure to mention the Muslim Brotherhood’s ousting in 2013, despite democratic election, and minimization of the amount of Brotherhood sympathizers killed in the process * Selection of Sir John Jenkins * Neglect to release evidence used as the basis for the review = Committee’s mild assessment of the Muslim Brotherhood = Overall, the Committee’s assessment attempts to sheds the Muslim Brotherhood in a better light than the previous assessment. In its opening assessment summary of political Islam, the authors provide the caveat that “the Muslim Brotherhood is a secretive group, with an ambiguous international structure. But this is understandable given the repression it now experiences”. A few other highlights include: * The report somewhat outlines the Muslim Brotherhood structure and funding, based upon documents directly submitted by the group itself to the Committee, and states that “the Muslim Brotherhood continues to be a powerful and organized voice in Egypt”. * As far as the Brotherhood's varying public messaging through translations, the Committee provides evidence from certain witnesses that argue “political Islamists may have positive and pragmatic reasons for varying their messaging”, rather than attempting to be deceptive. However, the Committee does concede that the “FCO is right to judge political Islamists by both their words and their actions”. * Another point the Committee makes is actually in agreement with the prior report that the Brotherhood should not be designated as a terrorist organization. The Committee states “the evidence so far in Egypt is that if the Muslim Brotherhood supported or condoned violence, then Egypt would be a far more violent place today”.

As a children's author, Robertson has written the book Rock and Roll Highway (2014), a biographical book about his father, The Band co-founder Robbie Robertson. He has also co-written Legends, Icons, and Rebels (2013), a contemporary pop and rock and roll history starter book, which he created in collaboration with Robbie Robertson, Jared Levine, and Jim Guerinot. As a musician and composer, Robertson has composed over 4,000 pieces of music that have been used in over 100 different television shows, films, and advertisements. He has collaborated with musician Daniel Davies on several projects, including songs featured in the soundtracks of the films Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! and The Vatican Tapes, as well as the entirety of the soundtrack to the film Condemned (all 2015). Robertson has also performed on two of Robbie Robertson's solo albums, and was project coordinator on The Band box set Live at the Academy of Music 1971 (2013). Biography =Childhood= As a child, Robertson had little knowledge of his father Robbie Robertson's prominence, as The Band had recorded their last performance when the younger Robertson was two years old. Robertson remembers his father at the time as \\"the guy that made me do my homework, drove me to little league games, made me breakfast and brought me to school.\\" It was through listening to the Peter Gabriel album Security that the younger Robertson started to connect with music on a more personal level. This led to Robertson picking albums from his father's collection to listen to, and his father telling him the stories about the artists, many of which were from the elder Robertson's personal experiences. It was in his teens that Robertson came to better understand his father's place in music history. Robertson began playing the drums at age 14 after listening to the drumming of Led Zeppelin's John Bonham. =Children's author= It was when Robertson was working a part-time job involving programming music for children that he noticed that children would respond overwhelmingly favorably when he would play music by artists such as Marvin Gaye and Johnny Cash amongst more traditional children's music. Robertson expressed to his father an interest in creating a resource that would give children a foundation in music education, and help them choose quality music. The elder Robertson discussed the idea with his friend Jared Levine, and then met music industry professional Jim Guerinot, who initiated the work of building the project. The four worked together over the course of five years to create the book, which was entitled Legends, Icons, and Rebels: Music that Changed the World. Released by Tundra Books in 2013, Legends, Icons, and Rebels is a hardcover book with two CD's that introduces children ages nine to twelve to the stories of twenty-seven foundational contemporary music artists such as Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Billie Holiday, and others. The book was featured as Best of the Month in Non Fiction Books by Amazon.com, and was listed as one of Rolling Stone magazine's \\"20 Best Music Books of 2013\\". After the release of Legends, Icons, and Rebels, publisher Christy Ottaviano approached Robertson about writing a children's book about his father. Entitled Rock and Roll Highway: The Robbie Robertson Story, the book was published by Henry Holt and Co. in 2014, and tells the story of Robbie Robertson's life. The book is intended for children ages six to nine, and is illustrated with paintings by Adam Gustavson. At the end of the book, Robertson conducts a question and answer session with his father, which is intended to encourage the book's young readers to interview their own parents to learn more from them. Rock and Roll Highway received favorable reviews from Publishers Weekly, who compared it to \\"iconic compositions that might have been pulled from dusty album covers,\\" and from The American Library Association's Booklist, who called it \\"insightful\\". The book received a mixed review from School Library Journal, who called the book a \\"well-illustrated and nicely told story,\\" but were concerned that \\"the details aren't likely to resonate with the intended audience.\\" Robertson plans to write a third book about his Native American heritage. The book will highlight eight to ten influential Native American tribal chiefs. =Composer, musician, and studio engineer= Robertson's primary line of work is in composing music for television. He owns and operates a music library called \\"We the People\\", which services approximately 45 different television shows. Robertson has worked extensively providing background music for Access Hollywood and Access Hollywood Live. His work has been featured in television series such as Fresh Off the Boat, Wicked Tuna, Preachers' Daughters, Married to Jonas, and others. Robertson has composed the soundtracks for the feature films The Anna Nicole Smith Story (2007) and Walk of Shame (2014), as well as for the Matthew Cooke- directed documentary Survivors Guide to Prison (2018). Robertson has also assisted on a number of his father's musical projects. In 1994, Robertson played drums on Robbie Robertson's soundtrack to the Barry Levinson film Jimmy Hollywood. That same year, Robertson played drums again on parts of the elder Robertson's album Music for The Native Americans. In 2011, Robertson appeared on the elder Robinson's album How to Become Clairvoyant, this time providing effects. In 2013, Robertson was enlisted to assist in the release of The Band box set Live at the Academy of Music 1971 (2013), an expanded presentation of the source material that the live album Rock of Ages (1972) is taken from. Robertson worked on the stereo mixes of the complete New Year's Eve show that appears on discs 3 and 4 of the set alongside mixing engineer Jon Castelli. It was Robertson's idea to preserve and even highlight the imperfections and personal moments that fans of bootleg recordings enjoy, instead of mixing them out. Robertson also sourced the previously unpublished photos that were used to illustrate the album's release. Robertson has been longtime friends with Daniel Davies, sometime member of the rock bands Year Long Disaster and CKY and son of The Kinks guitarist Dave Davies. The two have built a recording studio, and have worked together in several musical collaborations. The pair co-wrote a song for the 2008 movie The Coverup, as well as another song for the soundtrack to the horror-thriller The Vatican Tapes (2015). The latter song, entitled \\"Rebel Shake\\", was performed on the Vatican Tapes soundtrack by Robertson's and Davies' rock band The Bootleggers. Robertson's and Davies' cover version of alternative rock band The Pixies' song \\"Wave of Mutilation\\" was featured in the soundtrack to the Syfy film Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (also 2015). Later the same year, they scored the entirety of the Eli Morgan Gesner- directed film Condemned over the course of a three-week period. The film soundtrack album was praised by Something Else! as \\"inventive – to say nothing of bone-chilling.\\" References External links  Category:Living people Category:American children's writers Category:Children's non-fiction writers Category:American film score composers Category:Male film score composers Category:1974 births ","title":"Sebastian Robertson"},{"id":"48969211","text":"Twenty-Four Elders appear in the Book of Revelation (4:4) of the Christian Bible. Saint John described the scene, :before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal... round about... were four beasts full of eyes... The four and twenty elders fall down before him... and worship him that liveth for ever and ever.The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne: Description. Tate. Retrieved on November 05, 2008.  Hall of initiation  The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne, c. 1803–5. William Blake, Tate. 354 x 293 mm. In the centre of a huge hall is placed a throne: round about the Throne are four and twenty seats on which sit four and twenty Elders, robed in white and wearing crowns of gold. In this Assembly is introduced the Lamb that is to be initiated. In front of the Throne are four remarkable beasts (living creatures): one of them is like a lion, another resembles an eagle, the third has the appearance of a calf, and the fourth has the face of a man. These beasts have six wings each, and are full of eyes all over; and they rest not night and day, but keep on blessing the One on the Throne.  Interpretation  The word \\"Elder\\" in the majority of places where it is used in the Scriptures means the representative head of a city, family, tribe or nation, so the \\"Four and Twenty Elders\\" are representative of the redeemed human race. But why 24 Elders? The Twenty-four is the number of the Priestly Courses as given in 1. Chron. 24:1-19. When David distributed the Priests into \\"Courses\\" he found there were 24 Heads of the Priestly families, and these 24 Heads he made representative of The wholesome priesthood. As the \\"Elders\\" are representative of both the Old and New Testament Saints, and the Old Testament Saints are represented by the Twelve Tribes of Israel, and the New Testament Saints' by the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, they together make up 24 representative characters. Although somewhat problematic is that John's own presence in the scene as himself and in conversation with one of the 24 elders, makes for some double accounting by this interpretation. This distinction is clearly brought out in the description of the New Jerusalem, where the 12 Foundation Stones are named after the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, and the 12 Gates after the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Alternatively the 24 Elders may refer to the dualistic 24 celestial archetypes that are divided into two as 12 and 12 archetypes each sharing each others' respective dual quarters of an archetype element, shared in pairs of two. Rev. 21:10-14.

The asteroid only has a 10-day observation arc which makes long-term predictions of its position less certain. It was observed for three days as it approached Earth in the night sky starting with the sixth of October, 2013. Then it became unobservable by being between the Earth and the Sun,Small Asteroid to Pass Close to Earth March 8 then not recovered due to its small size and dimness. Precovery images by Pan-STARRS from 29 September 2013 were announced on 11 February 2016 that extended the observation arc to 10 days. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 11 February 2016, so there is no risk of impact from this object for the next hundred years or more. The asteroid was last observed on 9 October 2013.  2016 approach  The asteroid has a poorly constrained orbit, has not been observed since 2013, and often makes approaches to Earth. One such approach occurred sometime from 6 to 10 March 2016 with an uncertainty in the time of closest approach of ±2 days. While the nominal (best-fit) orbit suggested that it would pass from the Earth on March 8, it was calculated to pass as close as (0.07 LD) or as far away as . There was no risk of an Earth impact in 2016. JPL's graphic representation of 's orbit showed it was approaching Earth from the sunward side for an approach near the eighth of March with a chance of being detected by telescopes as it flew by. It was not expected to be more than 100 degrees from the Sun until March 9 and was expected to have an apparent magnitude of roughly 20.3. The asteroid was not recovered during the 2016 approach. During the March 2016 passage the uncertainty region for the asteroid covered as much as a 45 degree region of the sky. Possible impacts was listed on the Sentry Risk Table. The asteroid is 21-52 meters (69-171 ft) across, making it approximately twice as large as the Chelyabinsk meteor. However, it is not listed as a potentially hazardous asteroid because it is less than 100 meters (330 ft) in diameter. With an insignificant 1-day observation arc, it was listed on the Sentry Risk Table with a 1 in 20 million chance it could impact Earth on 5 March 2016, but that threat was quickly ruled out. With a short 3-day observation arc, it was listed on the Sentry Risk Table with a 1 in 300 million chance it could impact Earth on 28 September 2017. The nominal (best-fit) solution shows that should be around 1.5 AU from Earth on 28 September 2017. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 11 February 2016 when precovery images gave it a 10-day observation arc. If it were ever to impact Earth, it would likely create a large fireball in the sky and possibly an impact crater 100-575 meters (328-1,886 ft) across, assuming an impact angle of less than 45 degrees.

Early life and education Päetow started working at age 11, with several productions of the British Council Theatre Group in São Paulo, including plays by William Shakespeare, Federico Garcia Lorca, Nelson Rodrigues, and also musicals by Cole Porter with guest director Nancy Diuguid. Later, he entered the Conservatory for Dramatic Arts (located inside the School of Communications and Arts) and acted in Peter Weiss' Marat/Sade, Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie, Arnold Wesker's The Kitchen, Bertolt Brecht's The Baden-Baden Lesson on Consent. As a child, he also developed cinephilia, attending international film festivals where, after seven years, he was allowed to work as an interpreter for the jury members Abbas Kiarostami, Artavazd Peleshyan, Béla Tarr and Oja Kodar. At age 19, he audited a master's degree course on Pier Paolo Pasolini. Career Between 1996 and 2001, Päetow became a central player for CPT (Centre for Theatre Research). During this period, he created the experimental Prêt-à-Porter. For this specific project, he directed, wrote and starred in five plays: Passengers, Under the Bridge, No Concert, Hours of Punishment and Wings of the Shadow. His documents were also published later in book form, along with essays by Renato Janine Ribeiro and Olgária Matos, among others. In 1998, he worked as assistant director to Daniela Thomas on Anton Chekhov's The Seagull, starring Fernanda Montenegro. In 1999, he worked on The Trojan Fragments which received the Theatre Shell Award and the Art Critics' Association Prize. This production had its world-premiere at the Istanbul International Theatre Festival and was also presented at the second Theatre Olympics in Shizuoka, where Päetow represented Brazil on the International Committee, with Tadashi Suzuki, Robert Wilson, Yuri Lyubimov, Nuria Espert and Theodoros Terzopoulos. At this meeting, they discussed the performing arts of the next century. In 2000, he debuted as an opera director with Henry Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. Thanks to arrangements between CPT and CICT (International Centre for Theatre Creation), Päetow was then allowed to watch the final rehearsals for Peter Brook's Hamlet, at the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, with Adrian Lester. This year spent in Paris also enabled conversations with Cristiana Reali for a future collaboration on his, still unproduced, new play Washed-up Doc, and with Claire Denis and Chantal Akerman, during her retrospective at the Studio des Ursulines, aimed at further developing his Prêt-à-Porter's transfer from stage to screen. Before moving to Berlin, he took part in Jean Babilée's open masterclass at the Ballet de l'Opéra national de Paris. The following year, he reconnected with Sasha Waltz, with whom he had trained five years before, during her workshops at FID (São Paulo International Dance Festival). In 2003, Päetow played the lead in the first Brazilian production of Sarah Kane's 4.48 Psychosis, which ran nonstop until April 2004. After this, he presented, at the Volksbühne, the marathon of five plays Rebellion in the Backlands, staged by Zé Celso. In 2006, he created his first solo, entitled Plays, based on the lecture written by Gertrude Stein, to whom he also devoted a three-day event examining her life and works. In the same year, he performed the title role in Georg Büchner's Leonce and Lena, directed by Gabriel Villela, nominated as best actor by the Art Critics' Association. In 2007, Päetow directed his adaptation of Clarice Lispector's novel Água Viva. Then, commissioned by the Satyrianas Festival, he wrote the play Heaven in Heat, which was presented under the pseudonym Zita Woulpe, an anagram of his name. In 2008, he starred in two productions: Cascando and Words & Music by Samuel Beckett. In 2009, he directed Music-Hall by Jean-Luc Lagarce, which he also translated and created the set/lighting designs, thus receiving the Theatre Shell Award. In 2010, he created his second solo, the endless Abracadabra, nominated for the Shell Awards. In 2011, Päetow premiered his third solo, Ex-Machines. Back to Berlin, he developed a partnership with two musical ensembles, Klank and Trio Nexus, in order to create his play Der Hausierer, freely based on the novel The Peddler by Peter Handke. This launched his project Taeter, aimed at empowering anonymous voices and performed at undisclosed venues. The next year, he directed two dance pieces: Occurrences and Or Memory Reinvented, both recipients of the São Paulo City Hall Dance Sponsorship. In 2014, he presented a new solo, Lazarus, his adaptation of Hilda Hilst's homonymous short story. Then, he coordinated an artistic residency inside the ruins of a historic movie theater, where he presented open rehearsals for W, his next creation. In the same year, Päetow's previous plays were published in a three-volume box set. He would also start his second opera direction with Four Saints in Three Acts, libretto by Gertrude Stein. In 2015, invited by Felipe Hirsch, he took part in Puzzle, performing the poetry of Haroldo de Campos, Paulo Leminski and Gregório de Matos.

He is renowned as the first to discover the largest-known cave on Earth, Sơn Đoòng. Biography During the 1990s, Hồ Khanh was working as an illegal logger in Bố Trạch. During a jungle expedition to extract agarwood in 1991, Hồ Khanh reportedly discovered the huge enormous cave entrance, with a wide river flowing out of it. Without any rope or gear, Khanh did not venture further into the cave. Khanh later gave up his logging job and returned to farming with his family, but never gave up on the hope that one day he would find the cave again. In 2009, a group of researchers from the British Cave Research Association, on a trip to find new caves in the Phong Nha – Ke Bang region, having heard about his discovery, came to ask Khanh for help. Khanh agreed to guide the team to find the legendary cave. On their first expedition, the group found 11 previously unrecorded caves, two caves were named after Khanh and his daughter, Thai Hoa. After two more unfruitful expeditions, the cavers finally gave in and left, asking Khanh to contact them if he found it again.

WAY-200070 has been found to enhance serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system, and produces antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in animals. It has been proposed as a potential novel antidepressant/anxiolytic agent. WAY-200070 has also been found to produce antidiabetic effects in animals, and may also be beneficial for the treatment of certain inflammatory conditions. Due to its selectivity for ERβ, WAY-200070 is inactive in various assays of classic estrogen action, such as uterotrophic and osteopenia. Moreover, WAY-200070 does not affect luteinizing hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone or inhibit ovulation, indicating that it does not suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and as ERα and not ERβ is implicated in breast development, would not be expected to cause growth of the breasts at doses that are selective for activation of ERβ. In fact, ERβ activation may actually suppress breast growth, and in accordance with this, WAY-200070 was shown to augment the efficacy of tamoxifen in in vitro models of breast cancer. As such, WAY-200070 and other selective ERβ agonists might prove to be safe and tolerable for medical use in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women and in individuals of either sex.

It was built in 1919 by Melrose and Fenwick. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 December 1997.  History  The Sarina War Memorial was erected for the ANZAC Day (25 April) ceremonies of 1919 and was produced by Melrose and Fenwick, monumental masons of Townsville. Funds for the memorial were raised by public subscription. The memorial honours the local men of Sarina and the surrounding district who served in the First World War. The memorial was unveiled on 2 October 1920 by Mrs Lucy Ada Heron, mother of Private Leslie Lionel Heron, killed in action on 7 August 1916. The town of Sarina is located south of Mackay and was originally established as a pastoral holding. In the early 1880s, the area was thrown open for selection as sugar cane fields and flourished following the construction of the Plane Creek Sugar Mill in 1896. A supporting infrastructure of schools, theatres and halls was established, as well as residences for both workers and management. The town and mill serviced the southern part of the region and by the 1930s Sarina was the second largest town in the region. It continues to exist as a secondary centre to Mackay. Up until the early twentieth century, there were few statues or monuments in Queensland. However, as a result of the First World War (1914–1918), memorials were erected in almost every Queensland town. Such public expression of both grief for the dead and pride in the nation has not been generated by previous or subsequent wars. The First World War had an immense impact on the Australian population. Of those who went to war, almost one in five did not return. It was common for families to lose more than one son and for small communities to lose a whole generation of men. In 1916 the British Government prohibited the exhumation and return of bodies. This, coupled with the impracticality of visiting distant graves ensured war memorials became an expression of public mourning, revered as cenotaphs (literally meaning 'empty tomb') by those who erected them. Placed at prominent locations, they became symbols of remembrance and were considered to be as sacred as grave sites. As such, materials, design principles and symbols suggesting permanence, reverence and commemoration were important elements. Queenslanders were at the forefront of sustaining public expression. In 1916 they were the first state to establish ANZAC Day as a day of remembrance, encouraging other states to join them in making April 25 a day of national commemoration. It was expected that this tradition would be continued by future generations and that the memorials themselves would be honoured and respected. However it is apparent from the evidence of vandalism and alterations to memorials throughout the state that this has not always been the case. The memorials are important, not only in terms of what they represent, but also for what they record. In addition to listing the local men who served and fell in the First World War, many memorials also display details regarding unveiling ceremonies and fund- raising committees, making them invaluable as social and historical documents. They are even more valuable when it is considered that all other documentary records of those who served in the First World War are listed either alphabetically or by military units, making it virtually impossible to determine the original locality of a specific serviceman. The memorials are therefore the only readily accessible records of the origins of the men who served and fell. Although there are many different types of memorials in Queensland, the digger statue is the most common. It was the most popular choice of communities responsible for erecting the memorials, embodying the ANZAC spirit and representing the qualities of the ideal Australian: loyalty, courage, youth, innocence and masculinity The digger was a phenomenon peculiar to Queensland, perhaps due to the fact that other states had followed Britain's lead and established Advisory Boards made up of architects and artists, prior to the erection of war memorials The digger statue was not highly regarded by artists and architects who were involved in the design of relatively few Queensland memorials. Most statues were constructed by local masonry firms, although some were by artists or imported. They varied slightly in design, presumably to suit the needs of the communities who commissioned them. Melrose and Fenwick, the makers of the Sarina memorial, were a monumental masonry firm established in Townsville in They were a large firm with branches throughout Northern Queensland, and provided many war memorials to that area. They enjoyed continued success into the late 20th century, with the business closing in the early 1980s.  Description  The First World War Memorial is situated in a central median strip facing west. The memorial comprises a pedestal surmounted by a digger statue and is surrounded by two fences. The first fence is located on the pad on which the memorial sits and comprises picked stone bollards, square in plan, and linked by metal rails. Another fence of short circular metal posts linked by a metal chain is located beyond this, forming a protective boundary around the memorial. The memorial itself sits on a stepped base of five tiers which vary in size, the last two having chamfered tops Surmounting this is the pedestal itself, comprising a plinth capped with cyma recta mouldings and a dado. Both the plinth and the dado have marble plaques attached with lists of the fallen on the dado, and commemorative verses on the plinth. The dado is capped by a substantial cornice of cyma recta mouldings, on top of which stands the digger statue. The soldier statue stands with his head slightly bowed and hands crossed over a rifle which is in the reversed positioned and resting on his left boot. A tree stump is located behind the statue for support.  Heritage listing  Sarina War Memorial was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 December 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The monuments manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period. The memorial at Sarina demonstrates the principal characteristics of a commemorative structure erected as an enduring record of a major historical event. This is achieved through the appropriate use of various symbolic elements including the digger statue, lists of the fallen and commemorative phrases. As a digger statue it is representative of the most popular form of memorial in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The memorial and its setting are a landmark within Sarina and contribute to the aesthetic qualities of the streetscape. The memorial is of aesthetic significance for its high degree of workmanship and design. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has a strong and continuing association with the community as evidence of the impact of a major historic event and as the focal point for the remembrance of that event. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It also has special association with the Townsville monumental masons, Melrose and Fenwick.

Following in 1949 is St. Alexander, in Warren. Ambrose J. Murphy had begun the church in 1933, but only built the basement. Here, Mosher combined several Italian and Spanish precedents for his design, for a Mediterranean feel. The following year he built Sacred Heart, at East Providence, in the Byzantine Revival style. His last revivalist work was built in 1952, in the form of St. Lucy's in Middletown.Newport (RI) Daily News 30 July 1951: 5. It was a small, simple Gothic Revival church, similar in style to the older St. Luke's, though this time executed in standard brick and concrete. With the addition of Joseph Mosher, Jr., the office took a much more modernist turn. The first of these churches was Ascension, an episcopal parish in Cranston. Built in 1955, this church has a more conservative approach to modernism, discarding the traditional ornament but maintaining the traditional facade hierarchy. Next was Christ the King, at Centreville in West Warwick. The old church, burned in 1954, was built in 1932-33 and designed by Fontaine, possibly with Mosher's assistance.Historic and Architectural Resources of West Warwick, Rhode Island: A Preliminary Report. 1987. The design of this church ignores tradition almost completely, maintaining only a tall, steep roof. Built almost concurrently with Christ the King was St. Pius, in Westerly. This church was very similar to Ascension, but executed in stone. =Religious schools= Mosher designed a number of buildings for parochial schools throughout the region. In 1951 Mosher designed St. Augustine's School in Providence, a severe Jacobethan Revival building, though it exemplifies the asymmetry of mid-20th century design. In 1958 Mosher & Son designed the Immaculate Conception School in New Bedford. It is devoid of ornament, with the exception of a stylized panel above the main entrance on Davis Street.Anchor 4 Sept. 1958. That same year they designed Raymond Hall, the second dormitory built on the Providence College campus. At the time, the new building was noted as containing the first air-conditioned college dining hall in New England.\\"Ground Broken for New Dorm\\". Cowl 16 April 1958. In 1959 they designed St. Philip School in Greenville, a single-story version of the New Bedford school.Engineering News- Record 1959: 145. Another Fontaine project Mosher had control over was the original St. Antoine Hospice in North Smithfield, a project of Woonsocket's Precious Blood Church. Design began in 1937, and construction in 1939. Mosher also supervised construction of this now-demolished, Art Deco project.Architectural Forum 1944: 177. =Secular work= In the 1950s and 60s Mosher & Son were hired to design two schools in Providence. First of these was the old Vocational Technical School of Rhode Island, of 1955.American Vocational Journal 1956: 31. Now demolished, this was a spread-out International Style campus, in a dense neighborhood north of downtown. Second was the Harry Kizirian Elementary School on Camden Avenue, a long and low brick school.Engineering News-Record 1960: 65. It may be noted for its entrance canopy, a simpler version of the one that may be seen on Veterans Memorial High School in Warwick. A few years later, Mosher Associates designed the Smithfield High School, opened in 1966.\\"A look back at Smithfield High School in 1966\\". Valley Breeze. 20 April 2016. This was designed as a group of intersecting planes, with a central courtyard.

Format In the 2003–04 Cypriot Cup, participated all the teams of the Cypriot First Division, the Cypriot Second Division, the Cypriot Third Division and 12 of the 14 teams of the Cypriot Fourth Division. The competition consisted of seven rounds. In the first and in the second round each tie was played as a single leg and was held at the home ground of the one of the two teams, according to the draw results. Each tie winner was qualifying to the next round. If a match was drawn, extra time was following. If extra time was drawn, there was a replay at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. If the rematch was also drawn, then extra time was following and if the match remained drawn after extra time the winner was decided by penalty shoot-out. The third round was played in a two-legged format, each team playing a home and an away match against their opponent. The team which scored more goals on aggregate, was qualifying to the next round. If the two teams scored the same number of goals on aggregate, then the team which scored more goals away from home was advancing to the next round. If both teams had scored the same number of home and away goals, then extra time was following after the end of the second leg match. If during the extra thirty minutes both teams had managed to score, but they had scored the same number of goals, then the team who scored the away goals was advancing to the next round (i.e. the team which was playing away).

Annis is best known for his work for Stampede Wrestling and his ownership and handling of the Calgary gym at which many of the wrestlers trained. Annis is married to Georgia Hart, the daughter of wrestler Stu and wrestling promoter Helen Hart. Early life Annis was born in Boston in 1947. He earned a degree in marine engineering at the Kings Point military academy. He has also served a tour in Vietnam, he was a pilot. Career =Bodybuilding= Annis started bodybuilding at the age of 15. He competed mostly in Hawaii, which was also where he opened his first gym. =Stampede Wrestling= Annis wrestled sporadically for Stampede Wrestling. He had singles matches against wrestlers such as Kerry Brown, Mike Hammer, Cuban Assassin, Vladimir Krupoff, Gama Singh, Johnny Smith, Adolph Barbee, Makhan Singh, Karl Moffat and Drago Thomas among others. Annis participated in several tag teams together with Mr. Hito, Con Kovidis, Rick Patterson, George Skaaland and brothers-in-law Keith and Owen Hart, respectively. During his time wrestling for Stampede Wrestling he also challenged for the Stampede Wrestling International Tag Team Championship with George Skaaland and participated in a Battle Royal in 1986. Annis' favorite catchphrases were exclaiming \\"Ahhh Christ!\\" and \\"What’s good for the goose is good for the gander!\\" Annis was the only one of Stu Hart's sons-in- law not to be stretched by him in the Hart family dungeon. =B.J's Gym= Annis also owned the gym located at 604 7 Ave. S.E. in Calgary where many of the wrestlers of Stampede Wrestling trained, such as Dynamite Kid, The British Bulldog and the McGuire twins, called B.J's Gym. The gym opened in 1972 and stretches 12,500 square-foot and contained with cardio equipment, weights and a juice bar. Bret Hart trained weekly at B.J's gym while recovering from his stroke. The gym closed in 2011 and Annis has stated that he has no interest in opening a new one, instead enjoying retirement with his family and possibly buying a new house. In November 2011, his daughter Angie Annis staged an art exhibition at the gymnasium prior to the establishment closing its doors. Much of the outer walls of the gym were filled with graffiti, often featuring hearts, as a reference to the Hart family. Wrestling related Annis appeared for WWF in 1997 at the PPV In Your House 16: Canadian Stampede, he and his brother-in-law Wayne were punched and thrown over the guard rails by Stone Cold Steve Austin.Wrestling Observer Newsletter, July 14, 1997 Annis and his son Edward have held free presentations in Calgary to show the dangers of pro wrestling moves if performed incorrectly, and make people understand that everything that people see in the ring is carefully choreographed. Annis did this mostly because of worry that young children would try to imitate the movies they saw on TV and end up injuring themselves or others. In 2013 Annis participated in promoting a Next Generation Wrestling show in which parts of the profit went to the For the Love of Children Society of Alberta charity. Personal life Annis is married to Georgia Hart, seventh child of pro wrestling patriarch Stu Hart, and the sister of Smith, Bruce, Keith, Wayne, Dean, Ellie, Bret, Alison, Ross, Diana and Owen Hart. Annis and Hart did not reveal their marriage to Hart's family for several months after the fact, which caused volatile reception from the Hart family. Annis had with his wife four children, Edward, better known under his ring name Teddy Hart, Annie, Angela and Matthew Annis. Matthew wished to become a pro wrestler like his brother but died in 1996 at the age of thirteen. Annis has a grandson, Bradley Matthew Annis, from his son Ted and his ex-girlfriend Kim. In the late 1970s, he urged his brother-in-law, Keith Hart, to try out for the Calgary firefighter department. Hart passed a test and was accepted into the Calgary firefighter department. As a result, Hart largely reduced his wrestling commitments. Brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith has stated that due to the fact that Annis's son had died of a staph infection he recognized an infection in both of Smith's legs and informed him that he needed to get antibiotics right away. Annis lived in the East Village in Calgary from 1972 to 2012.

New Year's Eve celebrations were cancelled following intelligence reports of planned attacks and several arrests in Brussels, while in Munich, rail service was suspended as suspected attack plots were uncovered. In other cities, security was increased amid heightened fears in the wake of the Paris attacks. There were unprecedented security measures in several major European cities, including Paris, London and Moscow. New Year's attack plots =Brussels= Belgian police arrested two men on 27 and 28 December and charged them with involvement in an ISIL-related plan to attack New Year's celebrations in Brussels, reportedly having discussed attacking the Grand Place. Four others were arrested during raids and questioned but subsequently released. Public New Year's Eve celebrations and fireworks were cancelled in Brussels due to the heightened terror threat. No charges were pressed for planning an attack, but the two men were convicted of being members of a terrorist organization and sentenced to prison. =Ankara= Turkish police seized bomb-making equipment, a suicide vest and other equipment during a raid of a house in Ankara on 30 December, and detained two ISIL militants on charges of plotting a New Year's attack. A main target was reported to be the Kizilay Square where large crowds gather to celebrate New Year's Eve. =Munich train stations plot= In Munich, ISIL terrorists reportedly planned attacks on two train stations on New Year's Eve. German police stated that they thwarted the plots after they received a \\"very concrete tip\\" around 7:40 p.m. on New Year's Eve from intelligence sources in the United States and France. According to Bavarian interior minister Joachim Herrmann, between five and seven suicide bombers planned to blow themselves up at locations that included two train stations. A 550-strong police manhunt ensued after the possible suspects. The investigation was dropped in February 2016 due to \\"lack of clues\\" amid a failure to uncover leads on the seven names given in the warning. =Rochester, New York= Emanuel Lutchman, age 25, was arrested in Rochester, New York by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force on December 30 and charged with offering to provide material support to a terrorist group. He had specifically planned an attack on the Merchants Grill restaurant. He told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he had also planned on killing his wife. On August 11, 2016, Lutchman pleaded guilty to planning the attack. On January 26, 2017, he was given the maximum sentence of twenty years in prison. =Other plots= Turkish police later revealed that they had informed other countries after finding evidence on a laptop retrieved during the Ankara raid of an EU-wide plot against Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom and Turkey by a group of thirteen prepared suicide bombers who had left the ISIL headquarters in Raqqa. Austrian police heightened security measures and investigated suspects in Vienna before New Year's Eve, without finding \\"concrete further results\\".

The film, which serves as a re-imagining of the earlier Darna films, is directed by Jerrold Tarog and stars Jane de Leon in the title role. According to Tarog, the film will introduce a unique origin story that deviates from the source comic. Production on Darna was first announced in 2015, with Erik Matti originally on board as the director and Liza Soberano as the lead actress. Creative differences between Matti and Star Cinema led to his departure, however, and Soberano would later follow suit due to an injury acquired from a TV shoot. Tarog replaced Matti in October 2018, and De Leon was cast in July 2019. Despite having begun filming in January 2020, ABS-CBN later postponed production indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CastJane De Leon as Darna / Narda * Paulo Avelino Production =Development= Erik Matti signed to direct a new film version of Darna in 2014, with Star Cinema and Matti's Reality Entertainment co-producing the project. Matti stated that the film is aimed \\"to revive not just the people who Darna but also with the people who will know Darna for the first time.\\" Producing a unique storyline posed a challenge to the director, as he did not want to be accused of copying from other big superhero movies such as those produced by Marvel Studios. Matti envisioned Darna as a coming-of-age story that is serious in tone (similar to that of The Dark Knight Trilogy) but with gore aplenty. A teaser trailer for Darna was shown during the 2015 Metro Manila Film Festival, whose visual effects were provided by Mothership VFX, the same company that worked on some of Matti's earlier films. According to Matti, the teaser was released ahead of the then-upcoming 2016 election as a ruse to make audiences think that Matti's next film was \\"politics-related\\". Around this time, the lead actress for the role of Darna had yet to be revealed. Sources reported that Matti had begun principal photography on the film in March 2018, starting with the \\"simpler scenes\\". On October 4, 2018, however, ABS-CBN released a press statement announcing that Matti had parted ways with the network as well as Star Cinema \\"due to creative differences\\", and that the studio was closing in on a new director. On October 5, 2018, Jerrold Tarog came on board to replace Matti. In December 2018, Tarog revealed that he had begun working on a new script and costume for the film, the latter he said would be \\"more practical\\". Tarog has said he would retain Matti's vision of making the film a coming-of- age story while also creating a more nuanced origin story that deviates from the previous Darna films and their source comic, which he felt \\"rushes Darna's origins\\". He also added that his version will eschew the \\"campy\\" portrayal of most Filipino superheroes in favor of telling a nuanced and introspective story where the actions of the superhero have consequences in the real world. =Casting= Angel Locsin, who played Darna in the 2005 TV series, agreed to reprise her role when approached by Matti. Locsin was forced out of the project following a back injury in October 2015, however, much to the consternation of Matti. To revitalize the project, Matti uploaded a teaser photo of a hooded woman to Instagram, indicating that production on Darna had not stalled despite Locsin's departure. Several actresses had auditioned to replace Locsin, including Liza Soberano, KC Concepcion, Jessy Mendiola, Nadine Lustre, Sarah Lahbati, and Sarah Geronimo. Soberano replaced Locsin by May 2017. In April 2019, however, ABS-CBN released a press statement announcing that Soberano had left the project due to a finger bone injury she acquired during production for the network's 2018 TV series Bagani, and that the studio had begun casting on a new actress. On July 17, 2019, Jane De Leon was chosen unanimously from a pool of over 300 actresses who auditioned. On February 6, 2020, Leo Dominguez, Paulo Avelino's manager, confirmed that Avelino has been cast in the film. Tarog later confirmed Avelino's casting during a fundraiser. =Filming= Filming started on January 19, 2020. On August 21, however, ABS- CBN officially postponed production on the film due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a week after the network announced that it had \\"scrapped\\" the project \\"because of the film's big budget () and the coronavirus pandemic\\". The film was scheduled (and will be one of the first) to be shot at ABS-CBN's new sound stages in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan.

Born at Cape Riche in 1851, he was the eldest son of the pioneer Andrew Moir, who was from Markinch in Fifeshire, Scotland and had settled in the region in the 1840s. The Moir family lived in a cottage in the neighbouring allotment to George Cheyne with two of John's brothers working at Cheyne's Cape Riche farm. The Moir family acquired the Cheyne's property in 1858, including the homestead. The homestead and out-buildings were constructed between 1850 and 1850. A billiards room was built by John Moir with the assistance of Aboriginal people, with a blacksmith shop built at around the same time. Much of the furniture was fashioned from driftwood found on the nearby beaches. The station was used as supply depot for the sandalwood, whaling and sealing industries that were flourishing in the area through the 1870s to the 1900s. Moir was married in 1881 and remained at Cape Riche where he had taken a half share of the property on the death of his father. Moir and his son Neil extended their land-holding along Cheynes Beach in 1920 when they acquired another of land. Cape Riche Station was still held by the family with Moir's other sons having set up sheep stations further to the east near the Salt River. The Moirs used the sheep for meat production to supply the goldfields around Norseman. Moir died on 31 May 1938 at Albany Hospital at age 87, and was later buried at Cape Riche.

The organism normally lives in a tube on the seabed, but it becomes bioluminescent when it rises to the surface of the sea during the breeding period. Description Odontosyllis phosphorea is a small worm some long and in diameter when fully grown. Its elongated body is composed of many segments, each bearing a pair of parapodia. With these appendages it can crawl, burrow and swim, but it normally lives in a parchment-like tube it creates on a rock or other hard surface on the seabed. The head has two pairs of eyes, a nuchal hood which covers the back of the prostomium, and a ring of small curved teeth inside the pharynx. The parapodia in the central part of the body are slender and tapering. The upper surface of the worm is dark with yellowish transverse bands. Distribution and habitat This fireworm occurs on the west coast of North America from British Columbia to California, with a separate population off the coast of Panama in Central America. The species typically lives among seaweed growing on rocks and among seagrasses such as Zostera. It can be found on the seabed from the intertidal zone down to the continental shelf. Ecology Odontosyllis phosphorea feeds mainly on bacteria, microalgae and planktonic particles. It swallows this prey whole by everting its pharynx around the food item. It is itself eaten by fish, crabs and birds, being particularly vulnerable during its reproductive phase when it rises to the surface. One means of defence that it exhibits at these times is that it can shed its bioluminescent tail which may serve as a decoy while the worm returns to the seabed. Reproduction is seasonal in O. phosphorea, its timing related to the phases of the moon. Spawning takes place between June and October, at night at two-weekly intervals coinciding with neap tides. Shortly after sunset, worms begin to rise to the surface. Males usually appear first, the hind part of their body emitting a blue-green light, and periodically discharging a lingering secretion of luminous matter into the water. Females appear soon afterwards, emitting flashes of light, and swimming in small circles on the water surface. Both the body of the female and the secretions it produces are luminous and sometimes a male gyrates on the surface with a female. The display ceases within half an hour of its commencement. Water samples taken in the vicinity of males and females and their luminous secretions contain spermatozoa and eggs respectively. This breeding activity contrasts with the closely related Bermuda fireworm (Odontosyllis enopla) which is largely non-seasonal in its breeding behaviour but very specific in its lunar periodicity and timing, rising to the surface to spawn 55 minutes after sunset, on a night just after the full moon.

He is frequently identified as \\"Moreau the elder\\" (\\"Moreau l’Aîné\\") in order to avoid confusion with his precocious younger brother, the artist Jean-Michel Moreau (1741–1814) who is sometimes identified as \\"Moreau the younger\\" (\\"Moreau le Jeune\\"). Life Moreau was born in Paris. He was a pupil of Pierre-Antoine Demachy. Like Demachy, Moreau would focus on paintings of buildings and the countryside in and around Paris. He painted generally in gouache. Moreau's work was first exhibited in 1760 at the \\"Exposition de la Jeunesse\\". He was accepted into the Académie de Saint-Luc, but failed to gain admission to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1787 and again in 1788, possibly because the academy did not share Moreau's preference for landscapes. He worked as an artist for the Count of Artois as a result of which for several years Moreau lived in the Louvre, which at the time was undergoing a protracted transition towards its subsequent status as a public museum and gallery. While living here he continued to produce romanticised images of ruins until the outbreak of the revolution. Following the outbreak of revolution the Louvre finally reopened as a public museum, formally in 1793, and Moreau continued to work there on conservation and restoration.

Their cohabitation with the Slavs, who settled in the region during the Early Middle Ages, also influenced the Romanians' local administration, as it is demonstrated by the title knez of the Romanians' leaders. However, no firm territorial structures developed before the Kingdom of Hungary incorporated Crișana, Banat, Transylvania and other regions inhabited by the Romanians. The territorial units of the Romanians were mentioned as terrae (\\"lands\\"), kneziatus (\\"a territory under a knez's rule\\"), provinciae, sedes (\\"seats\\") in medieval royal charters, but most commonly as districtus Valachorum (\\"district of the Romanians\\"). According to a concurring scholarly theory, the Romanians' districts came into existence through organized migration in the 13th-15th centuries. The knezes who organized the settlement of the pastoralist Vlachs in the mountainous regions became the hereditary leaders of the newly established villages. The knezes were responsible for the collection of the \\"fiftieth\\", which was an in kind tax (two ewes for every hundred sheep), specific to the Vlach communities. In exchange, they had a share in the tax income and they were entitled to own mills in their districts.  Administration  The local administration of the districts is known from documents issued in the second half of the 14th century. The districts, with their own assemblies and officials, had a strong corporate character. For instance, in 1360, the property rights of local knezes to two villages was confirmed at the assembly of \\"all the knezes and men of other status\\" in the Hațeg district. The assembly was presided by the castellan of the royal castle of Hațeg, and the ruling was made by a jury, made up of twelve knezes, six priests and six communers.  List of Romanian districts  = Districts in Banat = Ruins of the royal castle of Severin (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania): several Romanian districts in Banat were administered by the Bans of Severin  Almăj  The Almăj district was located along the upper course of the Nera River between the Semenic Mountains and the Anina Mountains. Royal charters and other documents from the 15th and 16th centuries show that at least fourteen villages (including Rudăria, Gârliște, Prilipeț, Prigor, Lăpușnicu Mare and Bozovici) were situated in the district. In a letter written on 21 August 1430, Nicolaus of Radawitz, the local commander of the Teutonic Knights, who was also Ban of Severin, referred to the knezes and nobles of Almăj, implying that the district had already come to existence. According to the letter, the knezes and nobles refused to accept the Ban's judgement in their conflict with Emeric Himfy. Almăj district (or pertinencis Halmas) was first mentioned when its representatives (Ioan of Săliște, Blasiu of Gârliște and Ioan, Dragomir's son) were present at the joint meeting of seven Romanian districts in 1452.  Bârzava  The Bârzava (or Borzafeu) district was located along the uppermost course of the Bârzava River. At least thirteen villages (including Câlnic, Vasiova and Bratova) were situated in the district, according to documents from the 14th and 15th centuries. The district was first mentioned in 1370 in a royal charter referring to one Peter's village \\"in pertinencibus Borzafeu\\".  Caraș  The Caraș (or Crasofeu) district was located between the Dognecea Mountains and the Anina Mountains at the hedwaters of the river Karaš. A charter mentioned the domains attached to the royal fortress of Carașova (\\"castro Crasofeu\\") in 1358. Documents from the 14th-16th centuries show that at least seventeen villages were located in the district (including Goruia and Agadici).  Comiat  The Comiat (or Comyath) district was situated along the upper course of the Pogăniș River. It was first mentioned as provincia Comyath in a charter, issued on 13 March 1369, describing the boundaries of a neighboring domain. At least fifteen villages were located in the district (including Delinești, Ohabița and Apadia). The \\"nobles and knezes\\" of the district attended at a meeting which was presided by the Ban of Severin in 1391. Between 1435 and 1437, Sigismund of Luxemburg, King of Hungary, pledged the district to John Hunyadi. The local inhabitants paid the debt and the pledge was cancelled in 1457, showing that the local Romanians were willing to protect their autonomy.  Cuiești  The Cuiești (or Kuesd) district was located along the Bârzava River in the western slopes of the Dognecea Mountains. The district was first mentioned in a royal charter of grant, which was issued on 4 July 1349. = Districts in Transylvania =  Făgăraș  = Districts in Crișana = = Maramureș =  References   Sources   * Category:Medieval Kingdom of Hungary Category:Medieval Transylvania ","title":"Romanian district"},{"id":"48970984","text":"Adrian Young (10 March 1943 – 12 August 2020) was an Australian rules footballer who played one game for the St Kilda Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

It was built before the 1960s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2010.  History  The Leap cane lift is situated near the locality of the same name in a rural area west of the city of Mackay. Mackay is the regional centre of one of Queensland's main sugar cane growing areas. One of the top two sugar producing regions in the state, it produces about a third of the sugar in Queensland. Sugar cane is a major crop in Queensland; the state produces most of the nation's sugar. The cane lifts formed part of the process of transporting bundled whole stalks of harvested sugar cane from the farms to the mill. They were rendered obsolete by the universal adoption of \\"chopper\\" harvesters from the 1960s. Sugar cane was first introduced to Australia in 1788 with the arrival of the First Fleet. In 1821, Port Macquarie under the command of Captain Allman became Australia's first cane-growing area. In Queensland, the successful cultivation of sugar cane was established in 1864 at Redland Bay by Captain Louis Hope who erected Queensland's first sugar- crushing mill on the banks of Hilliard's Creek (now Ormiston) about south-east of Brisbane. Cane growing was tried at Bowen in the Whitsunday Region in 1864 but continued there only until 1869, when it became clear that the climate was too dry. In the Pioneer Valley the first grower in the Mackay region was John Spiller. He arrived in Mackay in 1865 as a would-be squatter without capital but with cane brought from Java which he planted on the north bank of the Pioneer River. In June 1867 he produced the first sugar in the region. The incipient cane growing industry was given impetus in 1864 with the enactment of the Sugar and Coffee Regulations, introduced by the government to encourage northern settlement. This enabled lessees to obtain plots of up to 1,280 acres (about 518ha) at a reasonable cost. Spiller and John Crees selected two blocks that became the Pioneer Plantation and built a primitive mill. T H Fitzgerald began a commercial plantation, Alexandra, in 1866 and with J Ewen Davidson set up a steam-powered mill that produced 110 tons (about 100 tonnes) of sugar in 1868. With these facilities a sugar boom began: small growers brought their cane for crushing to the Alexandra mill and acreage under cane expanded rapidly. Cane growers pushed back the graziers and by 1870 five mills were established. By 1872 Mackay mills produced 40 per cent of the total Queensland sugar production and 37 per cent of its rum. Seventeen mills were established along the Pioneer River before 1875, most in 1872 and 1873. Another 12 including Farleigh, Habana, Homebush, and Marian were established between 1881 and 1885, then North Eton and Racecourse in 1888, Plane Creek began at Sarina in 1896 and in 1906 Cattle Creek Mill at Finch Hatton started operations. Where crops were near the main railway line, cut cane was transported from field to mill via rail wagons. However, in cases where the crops and mills were remote from the railway, many mills established extensive tram networks for transporting harvested cane. The railway and tram networks continue to be used together with road transport. From at least as early as the 1890s, cane lifts at tram or railway sidings were used to transfer bundles of cane onto rail or tram wagons. Cane was initially harvested as whole stalks by hand and, later, by wholestalk mechanical harvesters. The cane was cut close to the ground and then the top foliage was cut off. It was transported to the mill as whole stalks. A frequent practise was to lay temporary tramlines into the field so that tram wagons could be loaded with cut cane close to where the harvesting took place. Where this practise was not followed, the cane was loaded onto a horse-drawn wagon or motorised vehicle. This was done by hand until the introduction of mechanised loaders in the mid-20th century. The wagon or vehicle transported the cane to the nearest siding where the bundles of cane were transferred onto a tram or rail wagon using the cane lifts. Many lifts were on private property, others on railway land at sidings. In many cases sugar mills paid for the construction of the lifts and cane farmers repaid the money at a predetermined cost per ton of cane sent to the mill. The lifts took different forms. F W Bolton, the manager of Farleigh Mill, is credited with introducing the \\"traverser\\" type by 1891. This consisted of an overhead travelling winch which traversed a horizontal beam supported by two posts. The cane was laid flat on a sling in a dray which was driven under the winch. The winch was used to hoist the bundle of cane which was traversed about two metres and lowered into a tramway wagon parked next to the dray. The lift was praised at the time for greatly reducing loading times and enabling the cane to be packed more densely. Apparently this type of lift was widely adopted but there are no known examples extant in the Mackay area. A similar configuration, possibly a modification of the traverser type, comprised two posts supporting a horizontal beam with a fixed pulley. These were predominantly used with tram wagons. As with the traverser the tram track passed under the horizontal beam. The wagon or truck containing the cane stalks was driven along the tram tracks to a position beneath the horizontal beam. The bundle of cane was hoisted, then the truck was driven out and its position taken by the tram wagon into which the cane was then lowered. A third or \\"derrick\\" type consisted of a boom fixed by a pivoting coupling to the bottom of a mast. It was held in a diagonal attitude to the mast by a hinged horizontal beam extending from the top of the mast to the end of the boom. The boom swung in an arc and the lifting hook was lowered from the end of the horizontal beam. Derrick type lifts were in use by 1893. They were used mostly to load cane into main line railway wagons. Albert John Wellman Fudge, a carpenter, is credited by some with inventing the derrick type lift. Fudge was a British immigrant who moved to Mackay in the 1890s. It is claimed that Fudge built over one hundred cane lifts for most district mills. His work was said to have been carried on by Harry Penny until the introduction of chopper harvesters. A variety of methods were used to power the hoist. It was common to use a horse hitched to a pole fixed to a rotating drum. This system was later adapted for use with a motor. From World War II, trucks were also used. Power was transferred via a set of rollers positioned in the ground so that they would engage with the wheels of the truck carrying the cane. The Leap cane lift is associated with the extensive tramway built to serve Farleigh Sugar Mill. The section of tramway from Farleigh to The Leap was built during Bolton's tenure as manager. Bolton announced the proposed construction on 9 February 1893 at a meeting of local growers at The Leap hotel. At this meeting, he promised to erect traverser type cane lifts at the end of the line. The extant lift is configured in a similar way to a traverser type, comprising a horizontal beam supported by two posts. However, the pulley is fixed, not traversing. The hoist winch is extant and it may have been powered by an electric motor. Cane lifts became redundant after the widespread introduction of chopper mechanical harvesters. Mechanical harvesting was attempted with little real success from the late 19th century. The development of mechanical harvesters accelerated from World War II. The first harvesters cut the cane as whole stalks. This meant that the labour-intensive task of bundling whole cane stalks and loading them continued. From the early 1950s, mechanical loaders alleviated this problem to some extent. The introduction of chopper harvesters solved the loading problem. These harvesters chop the cane stalks into short lengths or billets. The billets are ejected from the harvester directly into bins towed by motor vehicle alongside the harvester. The bins are towed to the rail siding where they are transferred onto tram or rail wagons. Alternatively, the billets are tipped into bins on the wagons. By the mid-1960s, chopper harvesters had almost completely superseded wholestalk harvesters. The extant cane lifts probably all predate this time and some could date to the late 19th century.  Description  The Leap cane lift is in the road reserve on the north side of the Bruce Highway about north west of Mackay. It stands between a ditch adjacent to the southern side and a tramline a short distance to the north. Standing between high, it comprises two upright timber poles supporting a horizontal cross piece. The cross piece comprises double wooden beams fastened either side of the top of each upright. Diagonal wooden braces are fixed to each end of the cross piece. Pulley wheels are fixed to the top of the cross piece so that the wheels turn between the two beams. Two wheels are fitted to the centre of the cross piece and a single wheel at the southern end. Steel cable runs through the pulley wheels. A hook is suspended at the end of the cable. The other end of the cable is attached to a geared steel winch near the southern leg of the lift. A long handle extending from the side may be for a brake or a clutch mechanism. A stake next to the southern leg has an electrical insulator fitted to it. The lift is located in an area where there are extensive fields of sugar cane. The road reserve which forms the setting of the lift comprises a wide strip of mown grass. There is a patch of dense bush located to the east of the lift.  Heritage listing  The Leap Cane Lift was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Leap cane lift is one of a group of lifts in the Mackay region, one of Queensland's oldest and most productive sugar cane growing areas. Historically, sugar has been one of the State's most important agricultural commodities. The lifts are important in demonstrating the evolution of the industry in that they provide evidence of how harvested cane was transported before the introduction of mechanical chopper harvesters. Sugar cane was originally harvested and transported to mills as whole stalks. The lifts were used to hoist bundles of stalks into tram or train wagons. They became redundant after the universal adoption of chopper harvesters from the 1960s. Cane lifts were used at The Leap from the 1890s. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Leap cane lift is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. The lifts took two basic forms: a derrick with a swinging boom, and a horizontal beam supported by two upright posts. The lift at The Leap is a highly intact example of the latter type and includes pulley wheels, cable, hook and winch. Its location near a cane tramway reflects the predominate use of this type of lift for loading tram wagons. The derrick type was used predominately for loading main line railway wagons.

It is an erect shrub with narrow, flattened leaves and hairy pink flowers which are also distinctly flattened. Description Eremophila complanata is an erect, wispy shrub usually growing to about high and wide with sticky branches due to the presence of resin. The leaves are arranged alternately and are well-spaced along the branches. They are linear to narrow elliptic in shape, mostly long and wide, dark green, sticky and glossy . The flowers appear in groups of 3 to 6 in leaf axils on flattened stalks long. There are 5 slightly overlapping, egg-shaped, pointed, hairy, green, shiny sepals, long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is a shade of pink to purple on the upper surface and white or pale pink below. The outside of the tube and the petal lobes are hairy but the inside surface of the lobes is glabrous while the inside of the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs in August to September and is followed by fruits which are an oval shape, compressed, glabrous and about long.Kings Park, Perth Taxonomy and naming Eremophila complanata was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The type specimen was collected by Chinnock in the Chiddarcooping Nature Reserve near Mukinbudin. The specific epithet (complanata) is a Latin word meaning \\"flattened\\". Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs in the Chiddarcooping Nature Reserve in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region where it grows in sandy soil near granite boulders. Conservation status Eremophila complanata is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and from one or a few locations. Use in horticulture This eremophila is an attractive addition to gardens because of its glossy leaves and massed display of bright pink flowers in spring. It is easy to propagate from firm tip cuttings taken from December to March and grows in a range of soils in a sunny or semi-shaded position. It is drought tolerant and mostly frost resistant but can be damaged by strong winds, suggesting that it should be planted amongst other shrubs.

Early life Robert Bagner Hayling was born in Tallahassee, Florida, to Charles C. Hayling, Sr., an academic who had a 33-year career at Florida A&M; University, and Cleo Bagner Hayling. He and his three siblings all attended Florida A&M;, in addition to receiving graduate education. In 1951, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Air Force, serving for four years, before moving to Nashville, Tennessee, to study dentistry. He received a Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from Meharry Medical College School of Dentistry in 1960, where he first became involved in civil rights by participating in marches and lunch counter sit-ins. Career He began his dental practice in St. Augustine becoming the first African- American dentist to be elected to the local, regional, and national components of the American Dental Association. He actively embraced the growing cause of civil rights, becoming the adult advisor to the Youth Council of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He led the group in protests against plans to celebrate St. Augustine's 400th birthday as the nation's oldest European settlement on an all-white basis. When Vice President Lyndon Johnson came to the city in 1963 to dedicate the first of the restored buildings on St. George Street, it was to be followed by a banquet for whites only at the city's famous Ponce de Leon Hotel. In tense negotiations, a small number of blacks were invited in return for a promise not to picket the event. However, an agreement to have city officials listen to the concerns of the black community was not honored, leaving Hayling skeptical of promises from Washington politicians. Hayling encouraged members of the youth council to participate in lunch counter sit-ins, which led to a group of them, known as The \\"St. Augustine Four\\" spending six months in jail and reform school. Parents of the students were promised a reprieve if they signed documents stating that Hayling had \\"contributed to the delinquency of minors\\" and if they agreed that their children would not participate in further civil rights activities. They all refused. Hayling and three companions (James Jackson, Clyde Jenkins, and James Hauser) were kidnapped and taken to a Ku Klux Klan rally in September 1963, where they were seriously beaten and narrowly escaped death. They were then charged with assaulting the Ku Klux Klan. As he gained a reputation for militance, Hayling was threatened with the revocation of the group's charter by NAACP Executive Secretary Roy Wilkins during a phone conversation. Hayling replied, \\"I will mail you your charter\\" and vowed to continue his activities without the support of the NAACP. During a conference in Orlando, Hayling met Martin Luther King, Jr., through Rev. Charles Kenzie Steele and became President of the Florida Branch of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He invited King to St Augustine in the spring of 1964, which was chosen as the battle ground for forcing the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Hayling issued a call to college students throughout the United States to come St. Augustine for spring break, not to go to the beach but to take part in the demonstrations. Mary Parkman Peabody, the mother of sitting Massachusetts Governor Endicott Peabody came with three other prominent Boston women at Easter 1964 to aid of the activists. Peabody and Hayling were arrested for trying food at the segregated Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge Restaurant. Photographs of Peabody being arrested made international news and let the world know what was happening in St. Augustine. Hayling's dental practice in St. Augustine was adversely affected by his civil rights leadership, and in 1965, he moved south along the Florida Coast to Cocoa, Florida. There were many reasons underlying his decision - especially as the Brevard County area was rapidly expanding with an influx of new residents because of the Apollo Space Program. He could help find good positions for other St. Augustine activists. Perhaps most significantly, Hayling could help organize civil rights activities in the county. His office in the Elks Lodge in Cocoa became the home for the ACLU of Brevard County. In December 1968, he hosted the annual chapter meeting and fundraiser, inviting his SCLC colleague Hosea Williams as the speaker. Dr. Robert Hayling address the attendees of the 7 Dec 1968 ACLU of Brevard County annual meeting in Cocoa, Florida, and introducing the speaker, the Rev. Hosea Williams. The event, coupled with Hayling's leadership, and with the assistance of local attorney Stanley Wolfman and Cape Canaveral activist Anthony M. Rutkowski, helped make the County Chapter one of the most active in the State as it undertook several noted civil right cases. In the 1970s, Dr. Hayling moved to Fort Lauderdale with his family, and he practiced dentistry there until his retirement. Later life In 2003, the street on which his home had been shot up in 1964 was renamed Dr. R. B. Hayling Place. In later years, he was given the two highest awards of the city of St. Augustine: the De Aviles Award and the Order of La Florida, making him the most honored citizen in St. Augustine's history. He returned frequently to St. Augustine: to participate in the groundbreaking for a museum at Fort Mose, to dedicate the monument in the downtown plaza to the Foot Soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement, and to cut the ribbon for the opening of the first civil rights museum in Florida on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. He was senior adviser to ACCORD, an organization founded in 2002 to honor the participants in the St. Augustine movement, and he participated in the creation of a Freedom Trail of historic sites of the movement. In 2014, he was inducted into the Florida Civil Rights Hall of Fame, along with A. Philip Randolph and James Weldon Johnson. A plaque honoring Hayling is on the wall, just outside the governor's office in the Florida state capitol building in Tallahassee. During the induction ceremony, Hayling noted that as a youngster, he used to mow the lawn at the Capitol. Legacy His early and steadfast leadership in the cause of civil rights in St. Augustine has been recognized in many ways. He was a 2012 Recipient of the Florida A&M; University Distinguished Alumni Award; received a Doctor of Humane Letters from Florida Memorial University and that school's Nathan W. Collier Meritorious Service Award \\"recognizing his courage, vision, fortitude, and service on behalf of mankind;\\" and was honored at the Florida Dental Association's convention in 2015. After his death, a memorial tribute was held in the rotunda of the state capitol building. Hayling has been written about in many books of civil rights history: by Taylor Branch, David Colburn, Deric Gilliard, Andrew Young, Ralph Abernathy, Dan Warren, and others. Before his death, he was the outstanding surviving grassroots leader of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, and he is frequently hailed as \\"the father of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\\" References Category:1929 births Category:2015 deaths Category:People from Tallahassee, Florida Category:American civil rights activists Category:African-American dentists Category:American dentists Category:People from St. Augustine, Florida Category:People from Cocoa Beach, Florida ","title":"Robert Hayling"},{"id":"48971265","text":"José Inácio Candido de Loyola, popularly known as Fanchu Loyola (born Orlim, Salcete, Goa, 11 March 1891, died Portugal 1973), was, in the words of Charles Borges, \\"Goa’s foremost nationalist\\".Goa’s Foremost Nationalist José Inácio Candido de Loyola: The Man and his Writings, ed. by Charles Borges, trans. by Lino Leitão (New Delhi: Concept Publishing, 2000).

When the Jornal da India, for example, was suspended in 1913 by then Governor-General of Portuguese India, Francisco Manuel Couceiro da Costa, Loyola published an open letter to the Governor-General criticising the inhibition of his freedom of speech entitled Cara Politíca and proceeded to found the new Rebate. In 1926, Loyola was the strategist behind the election of Prazeres da Costa to the Superior Council of Colonies. Among his writings and speeches, he became particularly noted for his speech \\"Basta\\" (\\"enough is enough\\"), a pro- democracy and anti-colonial speech given on 25 November 1932. In the 1930s, Loyola moved to Bombay, where he edited Portugal e Colonias. While inspector of village communities, in 1927, he undertook agricultural experiments in Carambolim, and wrote extensively on the possibilities for Goa's economic development.Carmo D'Souza, 'J. I.

Later career =Leadership in technology innovation= Upon retiring from the USAF in August 1983, Druffel became a Vice President at Rational, a corporation developing an innovative approach to integrated software development support environments. Rational introduced dedicated hardware support for seamless integration of supporting tools. He helped refine the strategy and successfully introduce the product to the software engineering community, including international customers.IBM to acquire Rational in a big move into software The Software Engineering Institute contract was awarded to Carnegie Mellon University in 1984, while Druffel was at Rational. In 1986, Angel G. Jordan, the provost at CMU, asked Druffel to take over as Director. He spent the next ten years recruiting leaders in the field, and focusing the effort on bringing an engineering discipline to software development. Under his leadership, the SEI engaged the software engineering community to mature the practice.

Considered the most influential Turkish-born artist of the post war-era, Dogancay's oeuvre is categorized into fourteen distinct series in which he predominantly used collage and fumage. While Dogançay spent most of his artistic career in New York City he always remained closely connected to his native Turkey.Sotheby's WHISPERING WALL II, retrieved 10 January 2016 In addition, Dogancay created a photographic archive called Walls Of The World (1975-2012), which encompasses about 30,000 slides of walls in approximately 500 cities in over 100 countries. Creative Periods (Series) The Dogancay Museum in Istanbul, Turkey dedicated to the artistic legacy of Burhan Doğançay, offers a stunning visual survey of the evolution of his oeuvre, from his early figurative paintings to his wall-inspired art. ; General Urban Walls (1963-2012) Throughout his artistic life, Dogançay has been fascinated by urban walls, which he admires for their beauty, spontaneity, directness and temporal relevance. The paintings on view here - seemingly literal renditions of urban walls - are an early attempt to record both their explicit historical evidence and inherent beauty. ; Doors (1965-2010) Doors, a functional part of buildings are an integral part of walls. Therefore, they constitute a major focus of attention for Doğançay and occupy an important place in his artistic career. ;Detours (1966-1995) The early Detours works were part and parcel of the General Urban Walls Series, but in the 1990s Detours emerged as a distinctive, freestanding group of its own. Inspired by those wooden barriers or fences that are prominently erected to announce an alternate route in the road with the word ‘Detour’ and arrows to indicate the direction to follow, the later paintings are less restrained and tend to be more elaborate. They are all distinguished by what appear to be horizontally placed planks or boards, created by acrylic, mixed media with collage, and most often with wooden panels mounted on canvas. ; New York Subway Walls (1967 – 2002) The New York City Subway Walls series started with Walls of New York City and grew during Doğançay’s extensive travels which inspired him to paint walls that reflect certain characters about a particular city’s walls. This series includes works that were inspired by New York’s subway walls as early as 1967 and some thirty years later before and while New York’s subway stations underwent a major restoration. ; Cones (1972-1990) Cones are a frequently appearing phenomenon on walls as posters often curl up under the influence of the elements and human touch. Most paintings from this series incorporate collage, Dogançay’s medium of preference and fumage, a blackening effect achieved with a burning candle. ; Breakthroughs (1972 – 1977) The Breakthrough series originated in the early seventies. They are predominantly red and show unambiguously two layers of paper, with the top one curling or “breaking through” or away from the bottom layer. The added shadows cast by the top layer give these paintings a three dimensional depth. This series was also a real breakthrough for Dogançay in his exploration of walls and is the precursor to the Ribbons and Cones series. ; Ribbons (1972 – 1989) The Ribbons series emerged in the early 1970s and was a noticeable departure from Dogançay’s earlier wall-textured and collage works. They mark a transition from realistic renditions of weather beaten, grimy urban walls to a more refined and seemingly more abstract approach. Dogançay attempts to play with light and shadow in these deceptively orderly and disciplined works. From the background, layers of torn shreds of paper (ribbons) project from the wall and cast shadows that form calligraphic shapes. The Ribbons series also forms the basis for Dogançay’s shadow sculptures and Aubusson tapestries of which one sample is being showcased at the museum entrance ; Housepainter Walls' (1982-1991) Doğançay was inspired to paint the Housepainter series by walls he saw in Turkey and Poland where housepainters had painted test patches alongside the paint’s cost per square meter. ; Grego’s Walls (1988 – 2012) While walking in New York’s SoHo one day, Doğançay came across a multicolored brick wall, which had the name ‘Grego’ written on it. Wondering why bricks aren’t multicolored in reality, Dogançay was moved to bring color and joy to simple bricks. The name Grego appears in the vast majority of these works and almost became an alter ego for Dogançay, enabling him to demonstrate through artwork how walls speak of issues and address passers-by. ; Formula I (1990 – 1991) Works from the Formula I series were inspired in Monaco during the Formula One car races. During the races, the advertisements on the walls are often covered with black plastic so as to eliminate any distractions to the drivers. All the paintings from this series incorporate black plastic as their main feature. ; Double Realism (1990-2009) Works from the Double Realism series incorporate three major elements; actual objects found on walls, light and shadow. In these pictures, it is not immediately apparent whether the shadows are real or painted. ; Alexander's Walls (1995 – 2000) Alexander’s Walls series originated in New York in 1995. Their inspiration was provided by the once popular Alexander's department store in mid-Manhattan. When the department store went out of business, its exterior was boarded up, covered with posters, and subsequently covered with black paper and black paint. The paper eventually showed signs of wear and tear. To Doğançay, the bright colors showing through the rips, tears and holes in the black ground looked like flowers in a splendid garden. ; Blue Walls of New York (1998 – 2004) This series is essentially a continuation of the New York Subway Walls series. It was inspired in 1998 when the New York subway started to undergo a major restoration. The blue painted construction fences which were erected on subway platforms and on some streets of Manhattan provided the inspiration for this series, which also incorporates stickers and graffiti. ; Framed Walls' (2008-2012) These mature collages fill the areas of their canvas tightly from edge to edge and are Dogançay’s final series. Their distinctive feature is the juxtaposition of framed portraits that contrast with the chaotic profusion of comments and images that surround them.

In a brief racing career he won two of his four races between September 2000 and June 2001. After finishing second in a minor race on his racecourse debut he was moved up in class to record an upset victory in the Group One Racing Post Trophy in October. In the following spring he returned from absence of more than six months to establish himself as a major contender for The Derby with a win in the Dante Stakes. He ran poorly in the Derby and his racing career was subsequently ended by injury. He has been a success as a breeding stallion siring various event horses who are now coming through with successful results. Background Dilshaan is a bay horse with no white markings bred in the United Kingdom by Saeed Manana. He was sired by Darshaan who won the Prix du Jockey Club for the Aga Khan in 1984 before becoming a successful breeding stallion. The best of his other offspring included Dalakhani, Mark of Esteem and Kotashaan. Dilshaan's dam Avila showed little ability as a racehorse, failing to win in two races as a three-year-old in 1992. Avila's grandmother Sweet Mimosa won the Prix de Diane and was a full- sister to both Levmoss and Le Moss. In October 1999 the yearling was offered for sale at Tattersalls and was bought for 190,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Charlie Gordon-Watson. He entered the ownership of Saeed Suhail and was sent into training with Michael Stoute at Newmarket. Racing career =2000: two-year-old season= Dilshaan made his debut in a Novice race (for horses with no more than one previous win) over seven furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 13 September 2000. Ridden by the veteran Pat Eddery in a five- runner field he started 7/2 third choice in the betting behind Attache and Gleaming Blade, both of whom had already won maiden races. He was slightly hampered when Gleaming Blade hung to the left in the last quarter mile but recovered to finish second, a length and a half behind Attache. Despite his defeat, the colt was then moved up sharply in class for the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse on 21 October. He was ridden by Johnny Murtagh and started a 14/1 outsider in a field of ten juvenile colts. The Aidan O'Brien-trained Freud was made favourite, whilst the other contenders included Tamburlaine, Grandera, CD Europe (Coventry Stakes), Darwin, Bonnard (runner-up in the Futurity Stakes) and Dayglow Dancer (runner-up in the Prix de Condé). Dilshaan started slowly and Murtagh restrained him at the rear of the field before switching to the outside and beginning to make progress in the straight. Tamburlaine opened up a clear advantage in the last quarter mile, but Dilshaan continued to make ground, gained the advantage 100 yards from the finish and drew away to win by two and a half lengths. Bonnard was three quarters of a length behind Tamburlaine in third, five lengths clear of Darwin in fourth. Stoute responded to the colt's win by saying \\"I certainly wasn't confident he'd win but he was entitled to run well. He's done it really nicely and is a horse with a lot of scope. He's an interesting prospect and will need to go further than a mile next season\\". =2001: three-year-old season= Dilshaan began his second season in the Dante Stakes (a major trial race for the Epsom Derby) over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse on 16 May. He was made the 9/4 favourite against five opponents including Celtic Silence (Chesham Stakes), Olden Times (Feilden Stakes), Storming Home and Rosi's Boy (Newmarket Stakes). Ridden by Kieren Fallon he tracked the leaders as Celtic Silence set the pace before moving up to make his challenge two furlongs out. Dilshaan took the lead approaching the final furlong and stayed on well in the closing stages to win by half a length and a neck from Celtic Silence and Storming Home. The colt's success meant that Michael Stoute had two leading contenders for the Derby, having won the 2000 Guineas with Golan. The trainer commented \\"It was a good solid performance... I am delighted he has won and I feel he will make further progress... He's a very placid, likeable colt\\". Fallon said of the winner \\"I've always liked this fellow. The other morning I rode him in work and he was impressive. I thought he would come home alone here. He's gone to the front and done nothing... he was idling\\". The leading bookmakers responded by making him third favourite in the ante-post betting market for the Derby. In the 2001 Epsom Derby on 9 June Dilshaan, ridden by Murtagh started the 5/1 fourth favourite behind Galileo, Golan and the Lingfield Derby Trial winner Perfect Sunday. After turning into the straight in fifth place he made no further progress and finished seventh of the twelve runners behind Galileo. Dilshaan sustained a joint injury shortly after the Derby and missed the rest of the season. He remained in training as a four-year-old but suffered a recurrence of his previous injury and his retirement was announced in July 2002. Stud record Dilshaan was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion. He was based at the Tara Stud in County Meath before moving to the Park House Stud in County Carlow in 2011. He has sired several minor winners but has made little impact.

Ban Vinai primarily housed highland people, especially Hmong, who fled communist rule in Laos. Ban Vinai had a maximum population of about 45,000 Hmong and other highland people. Many of the highland Lao were resettled in the United States and other countries. Many others lived in the camp for years which came to resemble a crowded and large Hmong village. The Royal Thai Government closed the camp in 1992, forced some of the inhabitants to return to Laos and removed the rest of them to other refugee camps. Origins In May 1975, soldiers of the communist Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese Army captured Long Tieng, the headquarters of Hmong General Vang Pao and his 30,000 man CIA-supported army which had fought against the communists for nearly 15 years. Vang Pao and other Hmong leaders were evacuated to Thailand by the CIA's Jerry Daniels, and American civilian pilots. They took refuge in Nam Phong Military Camp. Vang Pao and a few others were soon permitted to come to the United States. In the wake of the evacuation, tens of thousands of Hmong, mostly former soldiers and their families, fled Laos by foot during the next few years, crossing the Mekong River into Thailand. While the fate of the Hmong remained uncertain, on August 8, 1975 Colonel Xay Dang Xiong (died 3-15-18) and his 80 volunteers were commissioned by the Interior Ministry of Thailand to clear a small forest in Pak Chom district to build the temporary refuge for asylum seekers. The team named the area Vinai to depict their loyalty and orderly manner. By late October, about 4,000 occupants mostly families of the initial were transferred from Nam Phong Military Camp to Ban Vinai. An official record stated that Ban Vinai was created in December 1975 to house the influx, hosting an initial population of 12,000 refugees. The CIA reportedly contributed several million dollars to build and run the camp. Description The site of Ban Vinai is located in northeastern Thailand in Pak Chom District of Loei province, about south of the Mekong River and the border with Laos. The camp covered about and was crowded with makeshift shacks built by the refugees themselves, plus administration buildings, dormitories, warehouses, health care centers, and other facilities. Ban Vinai had the appearance of an overgrown Hmong village, albeit seriously overcrowded.\\"Hmong Children: A Changing World in Ban Vinai\\", Cultural Survival, 10:4 (Winter 1986); \\"The Hmong: An Introduction to their History and Culture\\" (June 2004), Country Profile No. 18, Center for Applied Linguistics, Washington, D.C.. pp. 20-21 The population of Ban Vinai remained around 12,000 until 1979 when it climbed rapidly as a result of an increased flow of Hmong from Laos. By 1985, the population reached a peak of about 45, 000 people. Ninety-five percent were Hmong, but other ethnic groups represented included the Htin (Phai people), Yao (Mien), Lu, Khmu, Lao Theung, Tai Dam, Musor (Lahu), Haw (Hani), and lowland Lao. The camp commander was a Thai, chosen by the provincial government and the Thai Ministry of Interior which oversaw the camp. Originally, (between 1976 and 1979) the camp was divided into five sectors, each with a refugee leader who together formed the Refugee Committee. In 1979, when the refugee camp at Nong Khai was closed by the Thai government, sectors 6th, 7th, and 8th were added to create more space for those refugees coming from Nong Khai camp. Sector 9th was known to the refugee camps in the Ban Vinai as the eternal sectors for those who died in the camp. Later in the mid 1980s when the refugee camp at Nom Yau was closed, sector 9th was created by building on top of the dead. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), with donations from the United States and other countries, funded most assistance to the refugees, including food, housing, education, and health. More than a dozen international charitable non-governmental organizations worked in the camp implementing programs and running facilities on behalf of UNHCR, other donors, and the refugees. Resettlement, repatriation, and closure of the camp Initially, all the refugees in Ban Vinai were granted temporary asylum in Thailand with the expectation that they would either soon return to Laos or be resettled in a third country. Thailand refused to grant Hmong the right to remain in Thailand permanently. However, in the 1980s, many refugees refused to return to Laos and did not seek resettlement to the United States or other countries. They demanded instead that the Lao government guarantee their safe return to Laos and autonomy. Some of the reluctance of the Hmong to resettle was fear of the challenges of moving to an industrial society. In Ban Vinai, the Hmong were able to maintain a semblance of their traditional culture and society. Reluctance was also based on the reported influence of Vang Pao and other leaders urging them to remain in Thailand as a prelude for a return to Laos and the overthrow of the communist government. Some of the Hmong used Ban Vinai as a base for resistance to the government of Laos. The reluctance to resettle began to change in 1985. A younger generation of Hmong was willing to adopt new customs and lifestyles and the Thai government was pressuring refugees to accept resettlement or to be forcibly repatriated to Laos. By 1986, the average length of time residents had lived in the camp was nearly seven years. The government of Thailand initiated a program called \\"humane deterrence\\" to make life more difficult for refugees and to discourage additional refugees from coming to Thailand. In 1983, Thailand closed Ban Vinai to new arrivals, although several thousand Hmong were able to slip into the camp during the next several years. In 1985, the Thai began to \\"push back\\" Hmong and other Lao attempting to cross the border into Thailand and began forcible repatriation of Hmong from Ban Vinai to Laos.Robinson, Court (1998), Terms or Refuge: The Indochinese Exoduds and the International Response, London: Zed books, pp. 116-119 Human rights organizations opposed the forced repatriation and cited evidence in 1987 that returnees were arrested upon their return to Laos. To placate the Thai government and reduce the forced repatriations and \\"push backs\\" of Hmong refugees, the U.S. government doubled its quota for resettlement of Lao, including Hmong, from 4,000 to 8,000 annually in early 1988.Robinson, p. 120 After several years of increased resettlement of Hmong abroad, declining numbers of new refugees, and repatriations to Laos. Thailand closed Ban Vinai Refugee Camp at the end of 1992. The remaining Hmong and Lao refugees in Thailand were distributed to other camps and refugee centers, notably Wat Tham Krabok.\\"The Hmong: An Introduction to their History and Culture\\" (June 2004), Country Profile No. 18, Center for Applied Linguistics, Washington, D.C., p. 21 References Category:Former refugee camps in Thailand Category:Hmong diaspora Category:Laotian Civil War Category:Laos–Thailand relations ","title":"Ban Vinai Refugee Camp"},{"id":"48971567","title":"List of Dutch Top 40 number-one singles of 2016"},{"id":"48971572","text":"A Huacaya alpaca near Arequipa in Peru Huacaya is the one of the two breeds that make up the species Vicugna pacos, commonly known as the alpaca. The other breed is the Suri. It lives on the Altiplano plateau in the Andes at up to 4,000 m above sea level. Its natural range encompasses four South American countries.  Phenotype characteristics  Both breeds are easily identifiable by their phenotypic characteristics. There are no differences in weight, or pup at birth (7.5 to 8 kg) or the adult specimens, weighing about 70 kg in males and 65 kg in females. Alpaca skeleton (Museum of Osteology) Animals of the Huacaya breed have a rounded and bulky appearance. Huacaya fiber grows perpendicular to the body of the alpaca, and is bulky, smooth and dense. Its curls in its sponge-like fibre are shorter and duller compared with Suri, with an absence of wool grease that is characteristic of Corriedale sheep. Suri fiber instead lies parallel to the body in long hanging well-defined locks which grow towards the ground. The fibre is silkier and more lustrous than that of the Huacaya, as well as being longer. Both breeds possess a vast array of coat colors, totalling 22 different varieties. The Huacaya alpaca is found in the Andes 4,000 m above sea level. Average males weigh 70kg and females weigh 65kg. they have a rounded and bulky appearance. Many of the alpacas in Chile are Huacayas. Peru has the world’s highest population of alpacas and 93% of that is the Huacayan type. Their wool is used to make scarves, vests, and sweaters. It is said that their meat is very high in protein even though it is not hunted. It makes up the species Vicugna pacos.  Population  Huacayas far outnumber the Suri population. In Chile, all alpacas are of the Huacaya type, and there is a negligible amount of Suri specimens in Bolivia at the northern border. Peru, which contains the majority of the world's alpaca, has 93% Huacaya as estimated by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Thus of the 3.7 million animals worldwide, more than 90% are thought to be of the Huayaca breed.  Products  = Fibre = Their wool is made up of between 150-170 threads / mm².Maccagno, Luis.

At 25 μm thick, their wool is 1.5 μm thinner that of the Suri, and considerably whiter, on average. Suri wool is marginally stronger Some of the products that can be made with fine Huacaya fiber include: * Ponchos * Scarves * Vests * Sweaters * Bedspreads = Meat = While Vicugna pacos were never bred for meat, it is a useful by-product in that their meat is perfectly edible and very high in protein. The carcass weight varies at a round 50% of live weight and 23 kilogrammes. Huacaya are thought to produce more meat than the Suri.Huarachi, David. Manual cría de camélidos sudamericanos.

He is seen as one of the Big Three of Flemish kleinkunst, along with Wannes Van de Velde and Willem Vermandere. Vanuytsel is most famous for his debut album, \\"De Zotte Morgen\\" (\\"The Mad Morning\\"), which became a bestseller and sold more than 100.000 copies. The title track \\"De Zotte Morgen\\" and the single \\"Houten Kop\\" (\\"Hangover\\", literally \\"Wooden Head\\") from the same album are his most well known songs. Apart from being a musician Vanuytsel was also an architect. Biography Vanuytsel was born in Mol, Belgium. He began composing and singing while he studied at his high school in Hoogstraten and continued doing so when he studied architecture at the St. Lucas Institute in Brussels. He changed his first name into his artist's name \\"Zjef\\", inspired by the then popular progressive spelling in the Dutch-speaking countries. In 1970 he debuted with the album \\"De Zotte Morgen\\", which sold more than 100.000 copies in Flanders and the Netherlands. Several songs from this album, including \\"De Zotte Morgen\\", \\"Houten Kop\\", \\"Hop Marlène\\" (\\"Come on, Marlène\\") and \\"Ik Weet Wel, Mijn Lief\\" (\\"I Do Know, My Love\\") are still classics in Dutch language music. Vanuytsel combined a knack for melody and poetic lyrics with traditional folk music and pop music influences. Recurring themes are melancholy about things that pass by, doubt, but also warmth, compassion and comfort. He was influenced by Boudewijn de Groot, Jacques Brel and Bob Dylan and wrote from an autobiographical standpoint. The song \\"Stil in de Kempen\\" (\\"Silence in de Kempen\\") was written as a tribute to the death of his parents. Throughout the 1970s Vanuytsel released three albums, \\"Er is geen weg terug\\" (1973) (\\"There is no way back\\") (1973), \\"De Zanger\\" (\\"The Singer\\") (1976) and \\"De Stilte van het Land\\" (1978) (\\"The Silence of the Country\\"), which all sold relatively well. Many songs from these albums are still regarded as classics today, such as \\"De massa\\" (\\"The masses\\"), \\"Tussen Antwerpen en Rotterdam\\" (\\"Between Antwerp and Rotterdam\\") and \\"Laat alleen mijn goede vrienden over\\" (\\"Only leave me with my good friends\\"). In the 1980s Vanuytsel's popularity waned. \\"Tederheid\\" (\\"Tenderness\\") (1983) became his final record for a long time and he concentrated back on his job as an architect. Among other buildings he designed the city halls of Huldenberg and Bertem and worked on the Nero café in Hoeilaart, the cultural center Den Egger in Scherpenheuvel and the civil center De Markten in Brussels. In interviews he claimed he felt overworked and wanted to concentrate more on his family. In 2007 Vanuytsel released a new album, \\"Ouwe Makkers\\" (\\"Old Buddies\\") (2007), and the following year he began touring again in Flanders. He was the main act during the Nekka- nacht in the Sportpaleis in Antwerp. He also gave one concert in Goirle in the Netherlands. Ill health troubled him often. Near the end of 2008 he had cancel a tour because of an operation. In 2014 Vanuytsel began touring again, but cancer problems cancelled this event permanently.

Gabriel Gonda, written by JR Ralls, and based on the Chick tract of the same name. The film had its world premiere at GenCon on August 14, 2014 and was also released on VOD through the film's official website. Synopsis The film opens with a group of sinister robed figures discussing how they are encouraging darkness to overtake the world through such factors as tarot cards, homosexuality, and role-playing games. One member states that all they need are a few more people to be converted in order for an entity known as the Dark One to take over the world. The film then cuts to Debbie and her childhood friend Marcie, who are discussing all of the fun they will have at their new school. They attend a freshman orientation class where they meet Mike, who encourages them to join an organization. On their way out they come across the RPG (role-playing game) club. Mike warns them against joining the group, as he sees them and RPGs in general as addictive and dangerous. The college has been trying to kick them off campus, but cannot due to their popularity. The two girls decide to attend a wild party and proselytize, but are quickly overwhelmed and urged to drink and party. Halfway through their party, the music is cut off and the party's leader announces that the group will now take part in a RPG. They are dared to take part in the games by Mistress Frost. Debbie is reluctant to take part in the RPG at first, but Marcie takes part eagerly. During the game, Marcie assumes the identity of Black Leaf, a thief, while Debbie plays as Elfstar, a cleric. During gameplay, the two are forced to kill a game character that begs for their life, which disturbs Debbie, but only momentarily as they are too exhilarated by the game to think twice. Afterwards, Debbie comments that she felt real magic while casting spells in the game, which she liked. As the term progresses both girls end up sacrificing school for the RPG group and before long Debbie begins failing her classes. She is told that she must pass one of her next tests or she'll flunk the class, which would force her to move home. At the next gathering, Debbie reaches level eight and is approached by Mistress Frost, who inducts her into the art of witchcraft. With her new powers, she easily passes her classes by controlling her professor's mind. Eager to reach level eight herself, Marcie asks for a more extreme game in order to level up faster. Mistress Frost eagerly introduces them to LARPing, but warns them that if they break character they will be forever banished from the RPG group. Before the game gets truly started, Mistress Frost is contacted by the robed figures, who tell her that one of the two girls must commit suicide in order to help the Dark One rise. During the game, Marcie's character ends up dying after she gets shot by a poison dart. This devastates Marcie, but Debbie is unable to offer any support without breaking character. As a result Marcie returns back to their dorm room alone, where she commits suicide. When Debbie informs Mistress Frost of Marcie's death, the woman is dismissive. This shocks Debbie, especially after she learns that Marcie was only used in order to summon Cthulhu via the Necronomicon during the LARP game – and that she herself was instrumental in summoning the deity. Debbie initially tries to venture into the college's steam tunnels to defeat him, only to find that this makes the entities stronger. Just as she is about to be trapped by the demons, she asks God to help her, which enables her to escape. Back in her dorm she's approached by Mike, who invites her to come to a religious meeting as only Jesus can fight evil. At the meeting she repents and takes part in the destruction of RPG and occult materials (which includes books by C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien), which foils the robed figures' plans to raise Cthulhu.

R. Ralls came up with the idea of filming an adaptation of Dark Dungeons while in college, but plans never came to fruition. After winning $1,000 in a 2013 lottery Ralls once again considered making the film and contacted Jack Chick for permission to create an adaptation, which was granted. Additional funding for the film was raised through a successful Kickstarter campaign, which also managed to bring the proposed film to the attention of the production company Zombie Orpheus Entertainment.  Reception  Critical reception for Dark Dungeons has been positive, with most critics interpreting the film as a satire of its source material. Wired remarked that Dark Dungeons was not filmed as an outright parody, which they felt strengthened the movie as the source material was \\"made by people who believe that Cthulhu is real and coming for your soul. You can't satirize something so far out of touch with reality.\\" Comic Bastards made a similar statement in their favorable review for the film, stating that \\"Everyone plays it competently and straight and that's why it works so well.\\" References External links  Dark Dungeons comic at Chick.com Category:2014 short films Category:American short films Category:American films Category:Films based on American comics Category:Cthulhu Mythos films ","title":"Dark Dungeons (film)"},{"id":"48971716","text":"Greenmount Homestead is a heritage-listed homestead at Greenmount Road, Walkerston, Mackay Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by William Sykes and built in 1915 by Arthur Carter & Co. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 September 1993.  History  Albert Alfred Cook, 1908 Greenmount Homestead was erected in 1915 for Albert and Vida Cook. Albert Alfred Cook was the son of Kennedy district pioneer John Cook, who took up Balnagowan Station on the northern side of the Pioneer River in 1862. Greenmount Station, on the southern side of the Pioneer River, was taken up in 1861 by John Mackay, the first European settler in the district. In 1864 Mackay forfeited ownership of the lease, and the property passed through a number of owners and resumptions until acquired in 1914 by Vida Althea Cook. Despite having erected a new homestead at Balnagowan in 1908, which was extended in 1912, the Cooks chose to make their home at Greenmount. In 1914-15 Mackay architect William Sykes prepared the designs for Greenmount Homestead, modifying substantially Albert Cook's rough plans for modelling the new building on the second Balnagowan. The house was erected in July–December 1915 by local Walkerston contractors Arthur Carter & Co., on land overlooking the Cook family company's Pleystowe sugar mill. The fireplace and mantelpiece from the second Balnagowan were removed to Greenmount. Most of the outbuildings and structures associated with the running of the homestead were erected in 1915: the cattle dip and yards, house well, tank stand, gas house, and septic tank; the motor buggy house at Balnagowan was dismantled and re-erected at Greenmount as a workman's hut; similarly, another motor house and box shed from Balnagowan became a garage at Greenmount. Early in 1916 a motor house was constructed using timber and iron from Balnagowan, a wash house was erected, and the Balnagowan bush house was removed to Greenmount. This was replaced in 1928, and re-built in 1988. In mid-1918 a dray shed was erected from storm- damaged structures at Balnagowan; the passage connecting the bathroom to the main house was enclosed, as was the kitchen verandah on the southern side; and a schoolroom, constructed of timber and iron from dismantled Balnagowan buildings, was erected between the garage and gas house on the southern side of the house. This was removed in 1954 to a ridge near the cattle yards and used as married quarters. An electricity generator was installed in 1925, and in the following year a workshop and skillion were erected. The house has been altered little since the 1920s. In the 1950s the western verandah and part of the front verandah were glazed and a bathroom added, and flywire screens were placed on the remaining verandahs. The roof and guttering were replaced in 1988. At Greenmount , the Cooks established one of Queensland's first Aberdeen-Angus studs. This breed had been introduced in Australia , but by the 1880s, numbered little more than 1,000 head in Queensland, which was then the largest beef producer in the Australian colonies. In the 1910s, Queensland cattle breeders were reassessing the beef and milk production values of the Aberdeen-Angus, and Albert Cook was amongst this vanguard. Following Albert's death in 1948 his son Thomas took over the management of Greenmount, and in the 1950s introduced Brahmans and Brahman crossbreeds to the Greenmount stud. Following Thomas Cook's death in 1981, the homestead on , together with three generations of the Cook family's furniture and effects, was given by his widow to the Pioneer Shire Council (now the Mackay Regional Council), which leases the property to the Mackay Historical Society as a museum. The grounds, maintained by the society as the Tom and Dorothy Cook Memorial Park, include a fig tree (Ficus sp.) believed to have been planted by John Mackay in 1862. Several small timber buildings have been moved onto the site since its lease to the Mackay Historical Society: the old Walkerston railway station , and two former single men's barracks from the Marian sugar mill, in 1991. These do not form part of the listing in the Queensland Heritage Register.  Description  Greenmount Homestead, consisting of the main house and various outbuildings, is situated on an easterly slope with a ridge to the southwest. The site, one of the few elevated sites in the area, overlooks canefields and contains a formal garden to the north, a dam to the east and mature trees. The main house is a single-storeyed timber building with a corrugated iron gambrel roof with projecting gables. The building is encircled by verandahs with lower skillion roofs which connect a kitchen house on the southwest and an office on the southeast, both with corrugated iron hipped roofs. The building has timber stumps with timber slab and woven sheet infill. The north elevation is symmetrical with a central projecting gabled entry porch with twin side stair, recessed seat and timber louvres. The gable has shingle cladding and a lower awning supported by deep, curved timber brackets. The verandahs have crossbraced railing, timber posts and brackets and raked, lined ceilings. The verandahs have been enclosed, with the south and east having sash and casement windows, and the remaining verandahs having flywire. The kitchen house and office buildings are clad in corrugated iron and have metal window hoods. French doors with fanlights open onto the verandahs, and the recessed main entry has a timber panelled door with leadlight glass inserts, sidelights and fanlight. An etched glass panel in the door has the inscription GREENMOUNT. The floorplan consists of bedrooms to the east and west, a drawing room on the north with a large bay window and a large dining room on the south. An ensuite has been built on the west verandah. Internally, the building has ornate pressed metal ceilings, single skin tongue and groove timber walls, timber batten arches, sash windows and fanlights above internal doors. The building houses original furniture, fittings and artefacts which belonged to the Cook family. The formal garden to the north of the building comprises a circular drive and lawn enclosed by hedges and palms. A fernery is located to the west of the building. An avenue of mango (Mangifera indica) trees, lining the original driveway, is located to the south of the building and continues onto the adjoining property. Large figs (Ficus sp.) are located around the site which is currently accessed from the northwest. Outbuildings include; hipped roofed, corrugated iron clad blacksmith's workshop, laundry/outside shower and a lighting plant shed to the south, sulky shed and garage to the southeast; a skillion roofed, corrugated iron clad staff shed with an ant bed floor to the south; a gabled roof, asbestos cement sheeted seed house to the west; and the timber and iron Balnagowan kitchen/schoolhouse and a cattle dip which are on an adjoining property to the southwest. Other structures include a kennel, chicken coop and tank stands. These buildings also contain much of the original machinery and fixtures. Buildings and machinery recently moved to the site, and not part of the original homestead complex, include two small timber buildings, a gabled roof timber railway station located to the northeast and various farming machinery.  Heritage listing  Greenmount Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 September 1993 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Greenmount Homestead at Walkerston demonstrates a now uncommon aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage, as the main house and its associated outbuildings and structures, and the formal garden, furniture and personal effects, form a cohesive and intact grouping which together demonstrate a way of life no longer common. The house, together with the large group of associated outbuildings and structures and the formal garden, and the physical arrangement of these elements, are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an early 20th century Queensland homestead complex. The place is important in exhibiting a range of aesthetic characteristics valued by the local community, in particular the landmark contribution of the buildings and grounds, through form, scale and siting; the quality and intactness of the interiors, including early fixtures and furnishings; and the landscaping, including the substantially intact formal garden. It has a strong association with the local community, which perceives the place as an historically significant element in the Mackay/Walkerston cultural landscape. It has a special association with the Cook family and their contribution to the development of the Mackay region and to the growth of the sugar and cattle breeding industries in Queensland over more than 120 years.

The corridor extends primarily along the length of the two boulevards through \\"mainland\\" Queens, a distance of between Elmhurst and the Jamaica Bay shore in Howard Beach. The Q52 and Q53 buses, which provide Select Bus Service along the corridor, continue south across Jamaica Bay to the Rockaway peninsula, one of the few public transit options between the peninsula and the rest of the city. The Q11 and Q21 were formerly privately operated by Green Bus Lines, and the Q53 was formerly operated by Triboro Coach, under subsidized franchises with the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT). The Q11 and Q21 started service along the corridor in 1918 and 1923, respectively. These routes came under the control of Green Bus Lines in the 1930s when the borough's bus system was divided into four lettered \\"zones\\", with \\"Zone C\\" including Woodhaven, Richmond Hill, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, and the Rockaways. An additional route along the corridor, the Q53, was added in 1950, to replace the Long Island Rail Road's Rockaway Beach Branch service to the Rockaways, which was shut down due to a trestle fire. This service was operated by Triboro Coach. In 2006, all three routes had their operations taken over by the MTA Bus Company brand of MTA Regional Bus Operations. The Q53 originally was a premium fare service, with a long nonstop segment from Rego Park to Broad Channel, as it was a replacement service for rail. Soon after the MTA's takeover of the route, it was converted to be a limited-stop service, with six stops along the corridor. Subsequently, the Q21 was extended up Woodhaven Boulevard, and its southern terminus in the Rockaways was switched. Increased ridership resulted in the creation of the Q21 Limited; this was soon replaced by the Q52 Limited, which replaced Q21 service south of Howard Beach. Since 2008, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay corridor has undergone studies for Select Bus Service (SBS) implementation, which has converted the Q52 and Q53 into bus rapid transit routes. However, the project was delayed by controversy over proposed changes to the corridor, including left-turn bans and the proposed installation of bus lanes in the corridor's median. The first phase of the project began service on November 12, 2017. Route description Looking south down Woodhaven Boulevard, with a Q52 SBS bus (left), and new bus lanes and median bus stops used for Select Bus Service The Q11, Q21, Q52, and Q53 all share a route along most of Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards, between Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst and Pitkin Avenue in Ozone Park. The Q11 and Q21 provide local service, while the Q52 and Q53 provide limited-stop service and extend into the Rockaways, an isolated peninsula in the south-west of Long Island which is popular as a summer retreat. The Q11 and Q21 originally corresponded to the northern (Woodhaven) and southern (Cross Bay) portions of the Boulevard respectively, while the Q53 originally made no stops along the corridor. The corridor parallels the former Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, whose northern half remains inactive and whose southern half was reactivated for rapid transit service as the IND Rockaway Line of the New York City Subway. Service on the line to the Rockaways across Jamaica Bay was halted due to the 1950 fire on the Jamaica Bay trestle, and the LIRR sold the line to New York City due to its bankruptcy. The LIRR maintained service on the northern half of the line until 1962 while the NYCTA began operating subway service on the southern half in 1956. Except for the Q53, all buses along the corridor end northbound service at Queens and Woodhaven Boulevards, at the Woodhaven Boulevard subway station of the IND Queens Boulevard Line and at the foot of Queens Center mall. Buses reenter service in a dedicated bus stop area on Hoffman Drive adjacent to the south side of Queens Boulevard. The Q53 serves these stops on its through service to or from Woodside. =Q11= The Q11 begins at Queens Boulevard, and runs down the entire length of Woodhaven Boulevard and a short portion of Cross Bay Boulevard to Pitkin Avenue. The route then turns east along Pitkin, then south along several local streets through the eastern portion of Howard Beach, running near Aqueduct Racetrack and the Howard Beach–JFK Airport station of the subway and AirTrain JFK. At 160th Avenue, the route splits into two branches; a western branch to Old Howard Beach and an eastern branch to Hamilton Beach (the two neighborhoods are separated by Hawtree Creek). Both terminate near the southern coast of their respective neighborhoods at 165th Avenue. Select weekday rush hour trips short-turn at Pitkin Avenue. During late night hours, all Q11 trips terminate at Pitkin Avenue; prior to 2010, 24-hour service had been provided to Old Howard Beach and Hamilton Beach. The original Q11 route served both Old Howard Beach and Hamilton Beach as a single branch. After running to 165th Avenue in Old Howard Beach, it crossed a bridge over Hawtree Creek, which has since been removed, then ran north in Hamilton Beach to 102nd Street and Russell Street. =Q21= The Q21 begins at Queens Boulevard, and provides local service along the entire length of Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards in \\"mainland\\" Queens. Between Conduit Avenue and 157th Avenue near the Belt Parkway, the Q21 turns west and runs on several local streets to provide service to the neighborhood of Lindenwood; the routing is labeled as \\"via Lindenwood\\". The route terminates near the Jamaica Bay shore at 164th Avenue in Howard Beach. The Q21 runs less frequently than the Q11, and does not operate overnight. Before being transferred from Green Bus Lines to the MTA Bus Company (MTA), the Q21's northern terminus was at Liberty Avenue, and the route provided service between \\"mainland\\" Queens and the Rockaways via the Q53 routing, terminating at the current Flight 587 memorial at the Rockaway Beach Boardwalk. In 2008, the route was extended north along Woodhaven Boulevard. In January 2012, the Q21 was rerouted to Arverne and a limited-stop branch was added. This limited-stop service became the Q52 in July 2012, and the Q21 was subsequently truncated to Howard Beach. On weekday afternoons during the school year, select Q21 buses operate \\"school tripper\\" service from Rockaway Park. These trips begin at Beach 104th Street at the Scholars' Academy (I.S. 323) and across from Beach Channel Educational Campus, and operate along the former Q21 route through the Rockaways and Broad Channel. This service was provided by the Q52 until it was converted into Select Bus Service in 2017 (see below). The Q21 previously had an additional branch called the Q21A, which provided service between Brooklyn and the Rockaways. This route began at the New Lots Avenue subway station in the New Lots subsection of East New York, Brooklyn. It ran east along Linden Boulevard, then south along Cross Bay Boulevard to the Rockaways. Unlike the Q21, the Q21A traveled east to Far Rockaway at the Mott Avenue subway station, a total distance of . The route initially used Beach Channel Drive east of the Cross Bay Bridge, later using Rockaway Beach Boulevard/Edgemere Avenue (adjacent to the Rockaway Freeway). A second branch, the Q21B, ran from New Lots Avenue non-stop to Beach 98th Street at the Rockaways' Playland amusement park. It then made stops in Rockaway Park and Neponsit before terminating at the beaches of Jacob Riis Park on the western portion of the peninsula. This route only operated during the summer months of 1936. =Q52 SBS= The Q21 Limited service was split off into a separate route, the Q52, in July 2012. It begins at Queens Boulevard and runs down the entire length of Woodhaven and Cross Bay Bouevards through \\"mainland\\" Queens, making limited stops. It then crosses the Joseph P. Addabbo Memorial Bridge onto the island of Broad Channel within the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, where it makes several stops. It then crosses the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge onto the Rockaway peninsula in the neighborhood of Hammels, where it turns east onto Rockaway Beach Boulevard. The Q52 continues down the boulevard, turning left on Beach 62nd Street, right on Arverne Boulevard, and left on Beach 54th Street, terminating at Beach Channel Drive in Edgemere. Elmhurst-bound buses originating from that stop would use Beach Channel Drive before turning left on Beach 59th Street, right on Rockaway Beach Boulevard, and via its normal route through Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards. Prior to April 2017, southbound Q52s terminated at Beach 69th Street in Arverne, reentering service two blocks east at the Beach 67th Street station. This route, along with the Q53, was converted to a Select Bus Service route on November 12, 2017. The route makes fewer stops than the limited-stop service, uses articulated buses, and travels on the corridor's bus lanes for a large section of its route, speeding travel times. As part of the conversion, it has been proposed to extend the Q52 east to Far Rockaway, along a similar route to the former Q21A. =Q53 SBS= A Q53 bus at Eliot Avenue near Queens Boulevard in 2007. The Q53 SBS is the longest of the four routes, running a distance of . It begins in Woodside, at the 61st Street subway station of the IRT Flushing Line and the Woodside LIRR station. The route then runs east along Roosevelt Avenue and Broadway, before joining the other three routes at Woodhaven Boulevard and Queens Boulevard and following the Q52's Select Bus Service-stop service pattern through mainland Queens and Broad Channel. After crossing Jamaica Bay and entering the Rockaway peninsula, the Q53 turns west on Rockaway Beach Boulevard and terminates at the Beach 116th Street subway station of the IND Rockaway Line in Rockaway Park. Created as a replacement for Rockaway Beach Branch service in the 1950s, the Q53 was originally labeled an express service. It made stops at the Woodside LIRR station, Roosevelt Avenue/74th Street subway station, Grand Avenue station, and 63rd Drive subway station (near the former Rego Park LIRR station) before running non-stop to Broad Channel and the Rockaways. Under the MTA, limited- stop service along Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevard was added in 2006, with service in Elmhurst added in 2009, and overnight service was added in 2013. The Q53, originally being operated by Triboro Coach operated from the LaGuardia Depot in East Elmhurst. However, after its takeover by the MTA, it was transferred to College Point Depot, a former Queens Surface Corporation facility due to construction at the LaGuardia Depot. It returned to LaGuardia Depot, in exchange for the Q23 on January 8, 2017. Select Bus Service stops = Express bus service= A QM15 in Midtown Manhattan. In addition to local and limited-stop service, four bus routes () provide express bus service to Manhattan via the Woodhaven and Cross Bay corridor. The QM16 and QM17 provide service to the Rockaway Peninsula and Broad Channel, beginning in Neponsit (west) and Far Rockaway (east) respectively. They then make stops along Cross Bay Boulevard into Howard Beach, before running non-stop to Manhattan north of the Belt Parkway. The QM15 begins at Cross Bay Boulevard and 157th Avenue (with select runs beginning in eastern Howard Beach near Aqueduct Racetrack), and runs the Lindenwood route of the Q21 before making stops along the rest of the corridor. The BM5, which originates in Starrett City, Brooklyn, also serves the corridor north of Conduit Avenue. All four routes proceed onto the Long Island Expressway at the interchange near Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst. = Other bus routes= The follows the Q21's route via Cross Bay Boulevard and Lindenwood between 164th Avenue and Rockaway Boulevard. It then proceeds east on Rockaway Boulevard and several local streets towards the 165th Street Bus Terminal in Downtown Jamaica, which is the terminus for many routes formerly operated by Green Bus Lines, also known as Green Lines. History = Early years: Q11 and Q21 routes = MCI Classic bus (now retired) on the Q11 laying over near Queens Center. The Q11 began service in 1918 under Liberty Bus Transportation, also known as New York City Department of Plant & Structures Route 64, between Woodhaven and Howard/Hamilton Beach. The Q21 began service in 1923. In 1926, it became a route of the Queens Auto Traction Corporation, running between Jamaica Avenue, at the Woodhaven Boulevard station of the BMT Jamaica Line, and Beach 95th Street, at the foot of the bridge from Broad Channel. By the early 1930s, the Q21 became a franchise of Green Bus Lines, and was extended to Rockaway Park. In 1934, the Q21A franchise between East New York and the Rockaways was awarded to Green Lines. On June 15, 1936, the Q21B began service between Brooklyn and Riis Park. That year, Green Lines took over the operations of Liberty Bus, and the borough's bus system was divided into four lettered \\"zones\\", with each zone being served exclusively by one bus company. Green Lines was awarded the rights to all of \\"Zone C\\" in southern Queens, which included Woodhaven, Richmond Hill, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, and the Rockaways. Following the summer season, the Q21B continued operating until November 1936 when it was discontinued due to lack of profitability. The Q11 began operations under Green Lines on November 15, 1936. By January 1937, residents of the western Rockaways (at the time called the \\"West End\\") petitioned Green Lines for several extensions of service. This included the restoration of the Q21B route, and the extension of the normal Q21 route west from Beach 116th Street to Beach 149th Street via Newport Avenue. When the Marine Parkway Bridge between Brooklyn and the western Rockaways was opened in June 1937, the Q21B was replaced with the .New York Times, Rockaway Bus Line Extends Service , July 3, 1937, page 17 In 1948, Green Lines applied for an extension of the Q21A to the Euclid Avenue subway station which opened that November; this was rejected by the New York City Board of Transportation in December. However, the rerouting to Euclid Avenue station did occur, and the route ran along Pitkin Avenue between Euclid Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard until its discontinuation. = Addition of Q53, extension of Q21, and MTA Bus takeover = On May 8, 1950, a major fire occurred on the wooden trestle of the LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch over Jamaica Bay, ending direct rail service to the Rockaway peninsula. On June 25, Triboro Coach, which was owned by Green Lines' shareholders, began operating replacement bus service from the Woodside LIRR station to Rockaway Park on a temporary grant from the city. The Q53 officially began service on June 28, 1956, two days after IND Rockaway Line service commenced on the parallel Rockaway Beach Branch. It later gained popularity as a route from mainland Queens to Rockaway Beach and Rockaways' Playland during summer months, as did the Q21 and Q21A. On January 9, 2006, the MTA Bus Company took over the operations of the Green Lines routes as part of the city's takeover of all the remaining privately operated bus routes. On February 20, 2006, the city took over the operations of Triboro Coach. Shortly after the takeover, in April 2006, the Q53 nonstop express was converted to a standard limited-stop service, with the MTA adding six stops along Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards. In January 2007, the Q53 was routed away from the 63rd Drive subway station, running the entire length of Woodhaven and Cross Bay Boulevards. On August 31, 2008, the Q21 was extended north along Woodhaven Boulevard. These service changes led to an increase in ridership along the corridor. Due to the shift in ridership patterns, late night service on the Q11 after midnight was truncated to Pitkin Avenue on September 12, 2010. Q21 service was also adjusted to run for longer during the evenings. = Split of Q21 and Q52 = A Q52 Limited entering service at Hoffman Drive in 2016 On January 8, 2012, the Q21 was rerouted from Rockaway Park to Arverne near the Beach 67th Street station, to serve the growing \\"Arverne by the Sea\\" urban renewal development. A limited-stop branch of the Q21 was also created, running during weekday rush hours and bypassing the Lindenwood section of the route. On July 1 of that year, several major changes took place along the corridor. The Q21 limited branch was converted into the Q52 Limited and expanded to seven days a week, while the Q21 local was truncated to Howard Beach. Overnight service on the Q11 to Hamilton Beach after 10:00 PM was eliminated. In addition, two additional limited stops for the Q52 and Q53 were added along Cross Bay Boulevard in Howard Beach, closing a gap in service previously filled by the Q21. For a short period of time after Hurricane Sandy in late 2012 and 2013, additional service was provided on the Q52 route.Several articulated buses, utilized on the , were temporarily transferred for use on the Q52 route. Some articulated buses were still running on the Q52 . In addition, the Q11, Q21, and Q52 fleet was transferred to JFK Depot after Far Rockaway Depot was damaged, but the route used buses with the JFK Depot sticker. On September 8, 2013, overnight service was added to the Q53 due to increasing ridership on the route. On April 9, 2017, the Q52 was extended from Beach 69th Street and Rockaway Beach Boulevard to Beach 54th Street and Beach Channel Drive in Edgemere to better serve housing in both Arverne and Edgemere. =Select Bus Service=  Planning  In 2004, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay corridor was one of twelve Queens bus corridors studied under the city's bus rapid transit (BRT) study, which was meant to determine the feasibility of having dedicated lanes and rebuilt stops to speed up service on BRT corridors. Beginning on January 4, 2008, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted an 18-month study on Woodhaven Boulevard as part of the city's Congested Corridors Project to improve congested and dangerous roadways. One of the short-term recommendations of the study was to implement bus rapid transit along the corridor. In June 2010, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay corridor was added to the list of potential corridors for Phase II of Select Bus Service (SBS), the MTA's brand of BRT service.  Construction  Preliminary designs began in 2013 and were released in March 2014. The first dedicated MTA bus lanes were installed in August 2015, on the north end of Woodhaven Boulevard between Dry Harbor Road and Metropolitan Avenue. At this time, the Q52 and Q53 SBS routes were scheduled to begin service in fall 2017, with the remaining bus lanes and street improvements to be implemented in stages afterwards. In September 2017, the NYCDOT announced that the segment of Woodhaven Boulevard between Union Turnpike and 81st Road would also get dedicated bus lanes. As part of that segment's bus lane implementation, the NYCDOT would remove the medians separating service-road and main-road traffic in each direction, as well as expand the median separating the two directions of traffic.  Implementation  SBS was implementated on the corridor on November 12, 2017. In the Rockaways and in Broad Channel, due to less dense land uses, and due to lower utilization of stops, several existing Q52 and Q53 stops were consolidated or discontinued. Q22 local service continued to serve the stops in the Rockaways, while the low volume stops at Cross Bay Boulevard and 5th Road were discontinued. A new stop at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 84th Street replaced stops at Beach 81st Street and Beach 86th Street on the Q52. In Broad Channel two stops were relocated: the northbound stop at Cross Bay Boulevard and East 9th Road was moved north to Noel Road to be symmetrical with the southbound stop, and the southbound stop at West 15th Road was moved south to West 17th Road to be symmetrical with the northbound stop, and to be adjacent to a crosswalk. Stops on Woodhaven Boulevard were modified as well: the stop at Atlantic Avenue was moved north to 91st Avenue, allowing Q52 and Q53 service to travel on the overpass over Atlantic Avenue using the bus lane, as opposed to using the slow service road. Two SBS stops were added–at 101st Avenue and Woodhaven Boulevard, and at Pitkin Avenue and Cross Bay Boulevard–to provide transfers to the Q8 and Q11, respectively. Stations on Woodhaven Boulevard at Jamaica Avenue, 91st Avenue and 101st Avenue, and at Cross Bay Boulevard at Liberty Avenue (northbound) and Rockaway Boulevard (southbound) are new stations that were built in the median by the NYCDOT. Q11 and Q21 service on Woodhaven Boulevard were modified in conjunction with the implementation of SBS. The bus stops at 63rd Avenue and 64th Road in both directions, and the northbound stop at 67th Drive were discontinued in order to even out the spacing of bus stops. The southbound stop at 68th Avenue was moved to Yellowstone Boulevard to be near a crosswalk, the Park Lane South stops was moved to 85th Road, and the southbound Doxey Place stop was moved to Gold Road.  Opposition  The implementation of SBS on the Woodhaven/Cross Bay corridor has been supported by transit advocates and bus riders, particularly those in the Rockaways. However, many residents of the communities north of the Rockaways, particularly car users and business owners, have opposed the Select Bus Service project. Much of the opposition has been due to the implementation of bus lanes down the center of the boulevard, which could cause increased traffic congestion. The plan in April 2015 would have prohibited left-turns at twelve intersections. In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican representing Ozone Park, came out against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 in an effort to accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at the green light to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane. In popular culture The 1977 song \\"Rockaway Beach\\" by Forest Hills- based band the Ramones references the bus ride to the Rockaways on the Q53.

History  Today's University of Applied Sciences has its origins in previous tertiary education institutions. The present-day School of Engineering and Computer Science arose from the “Staatlichen Ingenieurschule Osnabrück” (Osnabrück State Engineering School), which was founded in 1962. The School of Agricultural Sciences and Landscape Architecture has its roots in the “Höhere Landbauschule” (an agricultural college) in Quakenbrück which was founded in 1936. This institution moved to Osnabrück on 1952 and was renamed the “Ingenieurschule für Landbau” (Agricultural Engineering School) in 1964, later being incorporated into the Fachhochschule Osnabrück. The modern- day Institute of Music arose from the “Städtischen Konservatorium Osnabrück” (Osnabrück Public Music Academy) which was founded in 1919; in 1996 it became a part of the Fachhochschule. In 1971 the “Fachhochschule Osnabrück” was founded as an amalgamation of the various predecessor institutions; the economics department was established at this time. In 1987 the Fachhochschule established the Federal Republic’s first ever professorship of nursing science, whose inaugural holder was Ruth Schröck.Hackmann, M., Development of nursing research in Germany in the European context, in: International Journal of Nursing Practice 2000, 222, 224. From 1995 to 2000, the Fachhochschule was one of the model higher education institutions featured in the initiative “Modellvorhaben für eine Erprobung der globalen Steuerung von Hochschulhaushalten in Niedersachsen” (Model Projects for a Trial of Global Management of University Budgets in Lower Saxony), whose results have since been integrated into legislation concerning higher education in the state.Maul, K-H., Wissensbilanzen als Teil des handelsrechtlichen Jahresabschlusses – Wissensbilanzen dargestellt am Beispiel des Jahresabschlusses von Hochschulen -, in: DStR 2000, 2009, 2011. The university's transfer over to the foundation set up in its name (“Stiftung Fachhochschule Osnabrück”) in 2003 brought about various organizational changes, such as the establishment of a foundation council (chaired by Helga Schuchardt). By 2006, the new foundation of the Fachhochschule had become one of the largest public law foundations in Germany by expenditure.Falk, H. Nachhaltigkeitsstrategien für Stiftungen, in: Ulshöfer, G., and Bonnet, G. (eds.): Corporate Social Responsibility auf dem Finanzmarkt (1st edition, 2009), VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden, , p. 204. The new building on the Caprivi Campus in Westerberg was dedicated in 2004; the School of Business Management and Social Sciences has been using the barracks grounds since 1998.Darum!Osnabrück: Studieren in einer Kaserne? Die Caprivi-Kaserne bereits wird seit 1998 als Campus der Hochschule genutzt. (accessed 14 June 2015) The signage system on the Caprivi Campus was designed by Andreas Uebele. That year also saw the start of the German Network for Quality Development in Care, whose offices are located at the Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences and whose role is to develop care and national expert standards in this sector.Bieback, K-J., Keine Vergütungsvereinbarungen in der Pflege mehr? – Probleme der Qualitätssicherung im SGB XI, in: NZS 2004, p. 337 & 342. When Lower Saxony's new Higher Education Act came into force in September 2010, the “Fachhochschule Osnabrück” was renamed the “Hochschule Osnabrück”.hs- osnabrueck.de: Fragen und Antworten zur Namensumstellung Fachhochschule Osnabrück >> Hochschule Osnabrück (accessed 27 September 2010) In addition, the winter semester of 2010/11 saw the number of students at the University of Applied Sciences surpass 10,000.noz.de: Die magische Zahl ist erreicht (accessed 29 September 2010) Today's School of Engineering and Computer Science (in German Ingenieurwissenschaften und Informatik, abbreviated to IuI) arose from the earlier schools of engineering, electrical engineering and computer science as well as materials and processes. The School of Business Management and Social Sciences (in German Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaften, abbreviated to WiSo) arose from the previous school of economics, the Institute for Public Management, the Institute for Public Administration (offering professional qualifications for higher service) and the Institute for Healthcare Professionals. The School of Agricultural Sciences and Landscape Architecture arose from the two individual schools offering those subjects. In 2001, the School of Management, Culture and Technology was established as part of a new organisational superstructure at the Lingen site; it arose from the former schools for Communication and Society, Management and Technology and also the Department for Dual Courses (a cooperative venture with the Emsland Vocational Academy). The new Lingen campus was opened in October 2012, following the extension of halls 1 and 2 of the former repair workshop in Lingen. During the winter semester of 2011/12, WiSo introduced its new Applied Economics (BA) course – the first of its kind in Germany. In February 2012, the cooperative research college “FamiLE – Familiengesundheit im Lebensverlauf” (Family Health in the Course of Life) was founded in conjunction with the University of Witten/Herdecke. On 19 April 2013, the groundbreaking for the extension of the University of Applied Science (and the University of Osnabrück) into Westerberg took place. Lower Saxony's Ministry of Education and Culture invested approximately 23 million Euros in the lecture theatre; for the entire new campus, roughly 80 million Euros worth of further investment is expected.

At present the university has 12 main research areas: * Forschungszentrum Energiewirtschaft Energierecht (Research Centre for the Energy Industry and Energy Law) * KOMOBAR – Decision Strategies and Communicative Structures for Cooperative Mobile Work Machines in Agriculture * Mobile Communications * Applied Research Focus – Automated Systems * Intelligent Sensor Systems * Precision Farming als Instrument der interdisziplinären potenzialorientierten Landnutzung (Precision Farming as an Instrument for Interdisciplinary, Potential-Oriented Land Use) * Optimisation of Business Processes in the Logistics Chain * Patient- and Client-oriented Concepts for the Systemisation of Nursing Practice * Development and Implementation of Expert Standards in Care * Reproductive Health for Women and Families * Konzeptionierung und Einführung einer praxisintegrierenden elektronischen Lernbasis (Conception and Introduction of Practice-Integrated, Electronic Learning Methods) * SafeConnect From 2012 to 2016, the Volkswagen Foundation has agreed to give Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences around 1 million euros to assist with the soil science research project “Rüwola”, in cooperation with the HAWK University of Hildesheim/Holzminden/Göttingen. In December 2011, eight research applications from the University of Applied Sciences for grants from the European Regional Development Fund (with a total value of roughly 1 million euros) were approved. Through cooperative initiatives such as the „FamiLe – Familiengesundheit im Lebensverlauf“ research college, students are given the opportunity to undertake doctoral studies following the completion of their courses. The Waldhof test operation of the School of Agricultural Sciences and Landscape Architecture, based in Wallenhorst, is the home of Competence Center ISOBUS e.V., a registered association promoting technological development, quicker practical farming and also the international implementation of ISOBUS, an agricultural communication system.  International collaborations  UAS7 Most of the university's schools offer courses with a European or international basis, along with a year abroad at one of the institution's many partner universities. In cooperation with Buckinghamshire New University in the United Kingdom, the School of Business Management and Social Sciences offers an MBA programme. It is a three-year part-time course with attendance periods and enables students to acquire understanding of management and leadership abilities. Lecturers for this course consist of academics from partner universities along with business experts. Graduates will receive a double diploma: one which awards them the title of Master of Business Administration from both Bucks New and Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences. The British partner university is located in High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences also collaborates with universities in China; alongside Hefei University, an international study course in logistics management (called “LOGinCHINA”) is offered – this is based on Osnabrück's Business Administration and Management (B.A.) course. Along with Münster's university of applied sciences and the Saxion Hogeschool in Enschede, Netherlands, an MBA course in International Supply Chain Management is offered. In cooperation with Beijing Normal University, the Danube University Krems and the University of Tempere, an Erasmus+ Joint master's degree (Master in Research and Innovation in Higher Education) was introduced in 2012. The university is one of seven members of the German university federation “Alliance for Excellence” (UAS7).  Study conditions  Racecar IR08 of the university team at the Formula Student Germany competition, 2008 “Plus-Bus” fleet (Maxi-Trains) provided by Osnabrücker Stadtwerke, (Osnabrück Municipal Utilities), 2011 In contrast to other universities (including applied science universities), the ratio of lecturers to students is very good at Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences. Its campus has many green areas. There are numerous older buildings on the site; however many have been (and are presently being) renovated. The Terrassenfest music festival – also popular beyond the student body – takes place in April and May every year. In the 2005 CHE rankings, the Business Law course was rated among the best; in the 2007 CHE Bachelors rankings, two courses offered by the School of Business Management and Social Sciences also achieved high rankings. Osnabrück University of Applied Sciences takes part in the Formula Student Germany racing competition, sending an interdisciplinary team (named the “Ignition Racing Team”) made up of around 41 students from the Schools of Engineering and Computer Science and Business Management and Social Sciences.

Filming took place in August and September 2006 at various locations including Haste, the University of Osnabrück and also at a student residence. The Caprivi campus of the School of Business Msnagement and Social Sciences is also featured in the 2008 made-for-TV film “Vertraute Angst” (Familiar Fear) from ARD, in which it is used as the setting for a psychiatric clinic. In 2007, filming of the 2008 documentary drama “Remarque – Sein Weg zum Ruhm” (Remarque – His Path to Fame) took place at the Caprivi campus; it revolves around the author Erich Maria Remarque, who underwent military training at the Caprivi barracks in Osnabrück.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2007.  History  The small timber former State Butcher's shop, built in 1922 in Walkerston, just west of Mackay, stands on the north side of Dutton Street, and is one of the last of the old shops remaining in the town. The City of Mackay is named for John Mackay, who entered the valley of the Pioneer River in 1860 and established a pastoral run there the following year. In 1862 a settlement was begun on the south bank of the river and by 1863, Mackay had been surveyed and the first lots of land sold. It was gazetted as a port of entry and a customs house was opened. The town prospered as a port and as a commercial and administrative centre, drawing business from nearby pastoral holdings and the sugar plantations being developed along the river. The 1880s saw an expansion in population as the Queensland economy enjoyed a boom and people poured into the colony. The sugar industry was also booming and Mackay continued to develop as an important regional centre. Walkerston started in the 1860s as a staging centre for teamsters between Mackay and Nebo, and most of the land around Walkerston was selected in the 1860s. F.H. Wilson set up a boiling-down works in 1867, and a number of buildings were present by the time Walkerston received a Post Office in 1876. In this year Walkerston had a population of 200, compared to Mackay's 2000. A brickyard was also established around this time, and a Provisional School was opened in 1874. Walkerston had two names until 1881: \\"Alsatia\\" applied to the area east of Bold Street; and \\"Walkerston\\" applied to the area west of Bold Street. The development of Walkerston was aided by the Pioneer Valley railway line, which reached Mirani in 1885. The presence of seven sugar mills nearby (Alexandra, Pleystowe, Cassada, Branscombe, Lorne, Palms, and Palmyra), built between 1868-1883, also boosted Walkerston's economy during the 1880s. Three State butcher shops were opened in Mackay during 1922, and Walkerston received its own State butcher shop in the same year. In 1915 T. J. Ryan's Labor government won office in wartime Queensland on the strength of promises to improve living standards - principally by addressing the problems of high commodity prices, price-fixing and the emergence of monopolies. The Labor party in general and Ryan and his Treasurer, Ted Theodore, in particular, advocated public ownership of key economic activities, in competition with private enterprise, but at fair prices. They argued that by operating at a reduced profit margin the cost of goods and services provided by State-run enterprises would be reduced, and that the flow-on effect would be to reduce and stabilise prices for similar goods and services provided by the private sector. In the period 1915-1925 the Queensland Government instituted or acquired a diversity of business enterprises, including a State Insurance Office, a Public Curator's Office, the Golden Casket State Lottery, sawmills and joinery works, mining and fishing ventures (including a string of State Fish Shops), a hotel, a sugar mill, cold stores, plant nurseries, cattle stations and a network of butcher's shops, the process being formalised with the passing of the State Enterprises Act of 1918. These activities were part of a broader, pragmatic Labor platform, which advocated State intervention in the private sector to protect individuals against capitalist exploitation, not as a means of involving workers in the control of production, or of raising wage levels. Labor politicians regarded State enterprise as \\"State capitalism\\" rather than \\"State socialism\\". In 1915 cattle-raising was one of the principal economic activities of Queensland. Believing that all Queenslanders should have access to meat at fair prices, and needing to maintain a regular supply of cheap meat to the Allied fighting forces, the Ryan government introduced a State-wide system of State-owned butcher's shops which proved to be among the more successful of the numerous State enterprises. The first State butcher's shop was opened in Roma Street, Brisbane, on 12 November 1915, and soon other shops were established in Brisbane suburbs and in regional centres such as Rockhampton, Gympie, Townsville, Charters Towers, and Mount Morgan, following the railway lines via which frozen meat was distributed to the State butcheries. From 1915 to 1929, 90 State butcher's shops operated in Queensland for various periods, mostly in leased or purchased premises. In fairness to established butcheries, when the State intended to open a butcher's shop in a town or suburb, inspections were made of existing butcheries, to assess the possibility of State acquisition. The peak number of shops operating at any one time was 72, in 1922-23. Only seven purpose-built butcher's shops appear to have been constructed in Queensland, each built to an individual design. The first purpose-built State butchery was included within the brick Central State Fish Market, South Brisbane (1917–18). Another purpose-built State butchery, also made of brick, was opened in Roma (Roma State Butcher's Shop) in September 1919 after an expenditure of just over £4,000. The Booval State Butchery, built of timber, opened in July 1920, after expenditure of £600; and the Ayr State Butchery opened in July 1921. The latter was constructed of brick and wood, with a cost of just over £2,000. The design included a shop, breaking down room, cold store, engine room, change room, store, fuel shed and a condenser house. The remaining three purpose-built State butcheries opened in 1922. The Mackay State Butchery, built of timber and fibre-cement, opened in May 1922, with a construction cost of just over £2,600. The Mackay (South Side) State Butchery in George Street was also built of timber and fibre cement, and opened during August 1922, with a construction cost of £327. The timber Walkerston State Butchery opened during November 1922, with a construction cost of about £536. Cold stores and additions were erected at various butcher's shops, but no other purpose-designed shop was constructed. Initially the State butcher's shops were supplied with frozen meat from meatworks companies, but from 1921 they purchased their own stock, which they killed at their own slaughter-yards, ensuring that the State butcher's shops were supplied always with fresh meat at very competitive prices. Despite benefits such as the provision of employment, assistance to small farmers and small business, and the provision of cheaper meat to thousands, the State Enterprises scheme as a whole proved an economic failure. Some State enterprises had been purchased at an inflated price; others were located in unsuitable areas or were badly managed; others suffered the effects of economic recession, or of the mid-1920s drought. Following the passing of the Profiteering Prevention Act of 1920, other mechanisms were in place for controlling prices. By 1926, Labor premier William McCormack had declared publicly his intention of disposing of unprofitable State Enterprises, although little action was taken at the time. Some of the State butcher shops were disposed of in the period 1926-1928, and when Labor was defeated at the 1929 election, the in-coming Country/Progressive/Nationalist coalition government disposed of most of the remaining State Enterprises, including the 39 remaining State butcher's shops, which ceased trading as of 30 June 1929. In their 14 years of operation, the State butcher's shops sold over £5 million worth of meat and had made an overall profit to the Treasury of £185,000, but when interest and other charges were factored in, they lost about £6,000. However, this pales by comparison with the combined £2 million loss sustained by the State stations and the State-acquired Chillagoe railway, mines and smelter. The Walkerston State Butcher shop was built on land previously owned by Annie and William Barwise (publicans at the nearby Duke of Edinburgh Hotel). Title for 19.87 perches of this land was registered to The Commissioner for Trade on 6 November 1922 (the Memorandum of Conveyance had been produced on 3 August 1922). On 12 September 1922 a letter from the Commissioner of the Queensland State Trade Office, W.H. Austin, to the Under Secretary and Director of Public Works, had requested further work on the State Butchery at Walkerston ('now nearing completion'), through the District Foreman of Works at Rockhampton. The works requested were: a paling fence on the front alignment, with post and wire fencing on other three sides; a stable building of timber with an iron roof, containing two stalls with slip rails in front, a feed room (with wooden floor and door), and open space for one cart; and a hardwood cover for the well. An ice chest was also supplied by the Department of Public Works by 4 December 1922. Title for the land was transferred to Albert A. Cook, John H. Baker, and Kenneth W. Baker in February 1925, and was then transferred to Albert A. Cook and John H. Baker in May 1928. Although the local history \\"Sugar from the Scrub\\" claims that the shop was not used as a butcher 's shop after 1928, its subsequent owners were butchers, and it may have continued trading as such. During its more recent history the Walkerston shop has been used as a pizza shop, and later sold dance supplies. A skillion section clad in fibre cement sheeting has been added to the rear of the shop at some stage, resulting in the boarding over of a rear sash window. A carport is attached to the rear skillion addition, and a more recent carport structure has also been added to the west side of the shop, connecting with the neighbouring modern building. In 2016, the building is used as the Walkerston branch of Grays Chiropractic. No equipment related to butchery remains in the shop, although a large fig tree to the rear of the property, near High Street, has metal railings embedded in its branches, possibly used for butchering carcasses. There are also two small concrete vats sitting at the northwest rear corner of the property, purpose unknown.  Description  The former Walkerston State Butcher shop is a small timber building on the north side of Dutton Street, and its street awning, supported by timber posts, projects over the footpath. The front section of the original building has exposed timber framing, whereas the rear section is clad in weatherboards. A later rear extension is clad in both fibre cement sheeting and corrugated iron. The front facade of the shop has a central doorway, with a large timber-framed four-panel window to the right of the door. The western side of the shop also has a timber double-door entrance. A metal window hood is located above the sash window at the end of the western wing of the rear section of the shop. The original shop has a T shape, with the head of the T to the rear. The corrugated iron gabled roof thus has wider eaves towards the front of the building than it does to the rear. The gables have been vented at each apex by wedging the weatherboarding slightly open. The skillion roofed street awning has a timber valance, and the rear extension also has a skillion roof. An open skillion carport extends further to the rear behind the enclosed addition. Internally, the shop has an open area to the front, measuring about square, with a mansard-profile timber ceiling. Between the top of the side walls and the ceiling, sheets of perforated material have been set between the timber framing to provide ventilation. A doorway at the rear of this space leads into a kitchen, with modern fittings, which occupies the eastern rear wing of the building. A doorway to the left leads from the kitchen into the western rear wing, now used as a small storeroom. Both wings have sash windows that have been sealed. The west wing also has a rear-facing sash window that has been sealed after the addition of the rear extension. Both wings have mansard- profile timber ceilings. A doorway from the kitchen leads into the rear skillion addition. The rear addition appears to have had a serving window that has been sealed, facing the rear yard, to the west of the carport. The interior of the kitchen and the rear addition are clad in plasterboard sheeting, but the remainder of the interior of the shop has vertical timber boarding. To the northeast of the rear of the shop is a raised concrete slab, which may cover an old well. Further to the rear of the shop is a large fig tree, which has two ingrown steel rails on its northern side, one vertical and set in the ground, the other set at a diagonal down into the tree. Two small rectangular open-top concrete vats stand in the northwest corner of the allotment. A recent flat-roofed carport structure connects the front of the western side of the shop to the neighbouring building, and is not historically significant.  Heritage listing  The former Walkerston State Butcher's Shop was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former State Butcher's Shop at Walkerston, erected in 1922, is a result of the political and economic experiment embodied by the State Enterprises Act of 1918. Between 1915 and 1925 successive Queensland Labor governments established various State enterprises, with the network of State butcher's shops being among the more successful of these experiments. The highly co-coordinated, statewide system of State butcheries provided cheaper meat to thousands of Queensland families between 1915 and 1929. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The timber Walkerston shop was one of only seven purpose-designed State butcher's shops constructed 1917-1922 - most of the State butcher's shops operated from leased or purchased premises. The only other known surviving State butcher, at Roma, is a larger, brick building. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of a modest example of a purpose-designed State butcher's shop of its era. The large front window, the street awning, and ventilation at the top of the walls also reflect the design of butcher shops of the period. The large roof overhang above the front section also appears to be an attempt to reduce the temperature within the shop. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As one of the last of the old shops in Walkerston, it makes an important contribution to the built character of the town.

Biography Hans Frangenheim was the second son of Margarethe (nee Steinmetz) and Paul Frangenheim, Director of Surgery at the University of Cologne. When his father died in 1930, Frangenheim was sent to a boarding school in Switzerland until 1938. Early in World War II Frangenheim did military service with the Luftwaffe. In 1942 he started his medical studies at the Universities of Münster, Bonn, and Cologne. After the war he assisted in an American military hospital. From 1946 to 1950 Frangenheim worked in Surgery at the University of Cologne and at the Pathology Institute of the University of Bonn. In 1950 he started his training in gynecology at the Women’s Clinic at Wuppertal under the directorship of Karl Julius Anselmino and advanced to become Oberarzt in 1954. In 1966 he became Director of Gynecology at the City Hospital of Konstanz and in 1983 he was named Professor at the Freiburg University. He retired in 1985 and died in 2001. Pioneer in laparoscopy In 1951, Frangenheim observed an internist performing a liver laparoscopy using a method developed by Heinz Kalk. Frangenheim later recalled” I realized that this could mean a new aid for gynecology and began looking into the literature.” Frangenheim improved instrumentation and started to perform laparoscopic procedure on a regular basis by 1952. In 1955 Frangenheim visited Raoul Palmer in Paris another pioneer in laparoscopy applying it for the investigation of infertility. In 1958 Frangenheim reported his experience when few gynecologist were using the abdominal approach to investigate the pelvis. More popular was at that time the approach pioneered by Albert Decker using culdoscopy. Frangenheim developed an improved insufflator to facilitate the installation of CO2 into the abdomen. He started to teach numerous interested colleagues at the Wuppertal hospital, among them Patrick Steptoe. Frangenheim published the first book about gynecologic laparoscopy in 1959. He pointed out that it was superior to culdoscopy and useful for investigations of infertility and ectopic pregnancy. In 1964 Frangenheim presented the use of “cold light” whereby the light was transmitted through fiberoptics to the laparoscope. Illumination was much better and Frangenheim predicted that this would replace traditional illumination that had the light bulb incorporated at the tip of the instrument. Frangenheim not only used laparoscopy for diagnostic indications but also started to do operative interventions. Along with Palmer Frangenheim introduced a laparoscopic method to block the fallopian tubes for sterilization.

He made his professional debut in February 1915 with a win over Jim Welsh. He fought 29 times in 1915, winning 23. His first fight of 1916 was a loss to Jimmy Wilde, and he was also beaten in April, and again in July, by Joe Symonds.Roberts, James B. & Skutt, Alexander G. (2006) The Boxing Register: International Boxing Hall of Fame Official Record Book, McBooks Press, , p. 243 He had a run of success later in the year, beating Bill Ladbury twice, before five straight defeats to Johnny Hughes, Digger Stanley, Joe Fox, Wilde, and Tancy Lee. He beat Hughes on points in November. In 1917 he was called up under the Derby Scheme and served as a private in the Army Service Corps until being medically discharged again in November 1918. In 1917 he beat Sid Smith, Nat Brooks, and Freddie Jacks, but lost to Mike Honeyman, Louis Ruddick (twice), and Joe Conn. A good run in the latter half of 1918, including a win over Curley Walker despite being a stone lighter, led to his meeting Symonds in November at the National Sporting Club, for the British bantamweight title vacated by Fox. The fight went the full 20 rounds, with Noble taking the decision to become British champion. In April 1919 Noble successfully challenged for Eugène Criqui's European title at the Holborn Stadium, stopping the defending champion in the 19th round.\\"Bantam Entente: Criqui Suffers For France\\", Poverty Bay Herald, Volume XLVI, Issue 14896, 28 April 1919, p. 9.

Laurie, Limited, p. 79\\"Ross Wins British Bantam Title\\", The New York Times, 1 July 1919 A month later he faced former European champion Charles Ledoux in Paris, losing the European title via a tenth round knockout, with Noble protesting that he had got up before the count ended. Noble spent most of 1920 fighting in the United States and Canada, where he faced Georges Papin, Jacks, and Al Shubert among over a dozen contests, most notably a win over Johnny Murray at Madison Square Garden in October that saw him win the World featherweight belt.Morrison, Ian (1988) Boxing: The Records, Guinness, , p. 59 He spent 1921 fighting in Australia, with little success apart from a win over Victorian champion Bert Spargo. Between 1922 and 1926 he had a second spell in the US and Canada, losing most of his fights. On his return to England he lost his first three fights, to Johnny Curley and twice to Battling van Dijk, and retired from the ring. He returned in 1930, beating a handful of inexperienced boxers, before retiring for good in 1932, although he later boxed in exhibition bouts. His career earnings from boxing were stated at £100,000. He went on to market his own brand of bath oils which he sold by mail order, and worked as a street trader. In 1940 he was awarded £200 damages against the Daily Sketch and Sunday Graphic Ltd. after an article published in the Daily Sketch wrongly suggested that Noble should have served at the front during the war and may have bribed his superiors to be allowed to box.

D. Searle & Company in the 1950s but was never marketed. It was the first synthetic antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor to have been identified and tested in humans. The drug was found to lack appreciable oral bioavailability and to be of low potency when administered parenterally, but it nonetheless produced a mild diuretic effect in patients with congestive heart failure. SC-8109, the 19-nor (19-demethyl) analogue, was developed and found to have improved oral bioavailability and potency, but still had low potency. Spironolactone (SC-9420; Aldactone) followed and had both good oral bioavailability and potency, and was the first synthetic antimineralocorticoid to be marketed. It has about 46-fold higher oral potency than SC-5233. SC-5233 is the propionic acid lactone of testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one) and is also known 3-(3-oxo-17β-hydroxyandrost-4-en-17α-yl)propionic acid γ-lactone or as 17α-(2-carboxyethyl)testosterone γ-lactone.

Environment  Malpaso slopes host woods and heaths with relevant samples of Canary Islands juniper (Juniperus cedrus), some of them said to be more than one thousand years old. The most important animal from a conservationist point of view is El Hierro giant lizard (in Spanish lagarto Salmor), an endangered species of reptile.

It was released on January 1, 2016. The music had originally been recorded in July 2013 for a split release that never materialised.  Musical style and writing  The music critic Greg Majewski noted the importance of the EP's recording date of July 2013. \\"The three songs which comprise its 23 minutes act as a virtual bridge between the thematic repetition of 2012’s Years Past Matter and Ygg Huur’s brisker, compact approach. Present-day Krallice – while still retaining the same lineup – is a different beast than its pre-hiatus incarnation; shorter, to-the-point, but no less volatile. As such, Hyperion stands as a document of a band mid-transition, testing the extent of the newfound abilities gained from its members’ extracurricular activities in Gorguts (Marston), the resuscitated Behold the Arctopus (Marston again), death metal bass-drum duo Geryon (McMaster and Weinstein) and the evolving weirdness Mick Barr continues to unleash upon willing ears.\\" The lyrics frequently refer to astral objects, solar bodies and mythological figures.  Critical reception  Hyperion was received positively by music critics. Critics praised the depth and complexity of the compositions as well as the musical growth displayed on it. Pitchfork described the album as \\"a succinct, explosive encapsulation of the Brooklyn black metal band's evolution and progression during the last decade. This band keeps improving incrementally, avoiding major statements of reinvention or re-emergence in favor of doggedly refining what it is they’ve done from the very start.\\" They highlighted the second track for particular praise, describing it as the band's \\"new compositional apex\\" and as \\"one of the most thrilling, difficult two-minute clips of the band’s career. After you notice it, you have to hear it again and again, standing back to marvel at the sheer audacity of the moment.\\" Spin magazine's Colin Joyce wrote that the EP \\"marked another subtle transformation for the Brooklyn quartet. Previously content to craft assemblages of nothing but jagged edges, they sand away the instrumental excess on this three-track, sub-30-minute release, so that even a ten-minute cavalcade of French-braided guitar workouts called “Assuming Memory” feels economical. represents a new highpoint in sheer density for guitarists Mick Barr and Colin Marston’s six- stringed entanglement, but it doesn’t happen at the expense of the effusive torrents of energy that make the band so life-affirming in the first place. They’re adding more layers to an already complicated formula, but doing so with a sleight of hand.\\"  Track listing   Personnel  Colin Marston - guitar, production * Mick Barr - vocals, guitar * Nicholas McMaster - bass guitar, vocals * Lev Weinstein - drums  References  Category:2016 albums Category:Krallice albums ","title":"Hyperion (EP)"},{"id":"48972139","text":"Roger Luckhurst is a British writer and academic.

Six people are reported to have died on August 13, 1995 on K2, largely related to bad weather, especially reported high winds. Scott Fischer was climbing Broad Peak at the time, and suggested that a contributing factor was combination of brutal cold and winds. An American team had gained a permit to climb K2 in the summer of 1995. K2 is regarded as a significantly more difficult and dangerous climb than Mount Everest. By August 13, 1995, the remnants of the U.S. team and Alison Hargreaves had joined forces with a New Zealand and Canadian team at Camp 4, around above sea level, and at least 12 hours from the summit. Later that day, having joined with a Spanish team of mountaineers above Camp 4, New Zealander Peter Hillary, son of Everest pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary, decided to turn back, noting that the weather that had been fine for the previous four days appeared to be changing. At 6:45 p.m., in fine conditions, Alison Hargreaves and Spaniard Javier Olivar reached the summit, followed by American Rob Slater, Spaniards Javier Escartín and Lorenzo Ortíz, and New Zealander Bruce Grant. All six died in a violent storm while returning from the summit. Canadian Jeff Lakes, who had turned back below the summit earlier, managed to reach one of the lower camps but died from the effects of exposure. The next day, two Spanish climbers, Pepe Garces and Lorenzo Ortas (not Lorenzo Ortíz, who was killed in the storm), who had survived the storm at Camp 4, were descending the mountain suffering from frostbite and exhaustion. Before reaching Camp 3 they found a bloodstained anorak, a climbing boot, and a harness. They recognized the equipment as belonging to Hargreaves. From Camp 3 they could also see a body in the distance. They did not approach the body, so it was not positively identified, but they had little doubt it was Hargreaves and concluded she had been blown off the mountain during the storm.

These bases are particularly well adapted to decomposing signals that have different behavior in different frequency intervals. If f has properties that vary in time, it is then more appropriate to decompose f in a block basis that segments the time axis in intervals with sizes that are adapted to the signal structures.  Block Bases  Block orthonormal bases are obtained by dividing the time axis in consecutive intervals [ a_p,a_{p+1}] with \\\\lim_{p \\\\to -\\\\infty}a_p=-\\\\infty and \\\\lim_{p \\\\to \\\\infty}a_p=\\\\infty. The size l_p =a_{p+1}-a_p of each interval is arbitrary. Let g=1_{[0,1]}. An interval is covered by the dilated rectangular window g_p(t)=1_{[a_p,a_{p+1}]}(t)=g({t-a_p \\\\over l_p}). Theorem 1. constructs a block orthogonal basis of L^2(\\\\mathbb{R}) from a single orthonormal basis of L^2[0,1]. = Theorem 1. = if \\\\\\\\{e_k\\\\\\\\}_{k\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} is an orthonormal basis of L^2[0,1], then \\\\\\\\{g_{p,k}(t)=g_p(t)\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{l_p}}e_k(\\\\frac{t-a_p}{l_p})\\\\\\\\}_{(p,k)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} is a block orthonormal basis of L^2(\\\\mathbb{R})  Proof  One can verify that the dilated and translated family \\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{l_p}}e_k(\\\\frac{t-a_p}{l_p})\\\\\\\\}_{(p,k)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} is an orthonormal basis of L^2[ a_p,a_{p+1}]. If p eq q, then \\\\langle g_{p,k},g_{q,k}\\\\rangle =0 since their supports do not overlap. Thus, the family \\\\\\\\{g_{p,k}(t)=g_p(t)\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{l_p}}e_k(\\\\frac{t-a_p}{l_p})\\\\\\\\}_{(p,k)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} is orthonormal. To expand a signal f in this family, it is decomposed as a sum of separate blocks f(t)=\\\\sum_{p=-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}f(t)g_p(t), and each block f(t)g_p(t) is decomposed in the basis \\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{l_p}}e_k(\\\\frac{t-a_p}{l_p})\\\\\\\\}_{(p,k)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} = Block Fourier Basis = A block basis is constructed with the Fourier basis of L^2[0,1]: \\\\\\\\{e_k(t)=exp(i2k\\\\pi t)\\\\\\\\}_{k\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} The time support of each block Fourier vector g_{p,k} is [ a_p,a_{p+1}] of size l_p. The Fourier transform of g = 1_{[0,1]} is \\\\hat{g}(w)=\\\\frac{\\\\sin(w/2)}{w/2}exp(\\\\frac{iw}{2}) and \\\\hat{g}_{p,k}(w)=\\\\sqrt{l_p}\\\\hat{g}(l_pw-2k\\\\pi)exp(\\\\frac{-i2\\\\pi ka_p}{l_P}). It is centered at 2k\\\\pi l_p^{-1} and has a slow asymptotic decay proportional to l_p^-1\\\\left\\\\vert w \\\\right\\\\vert^{-1}. Because of this poor frequency localization, even though a signal f is smooth, its decomposition in a block Fourier basis may include large high-frequency coefficients. This can also be interpreted as an effect of periodization. = Discrete Block Bases = For all p \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}, suppose that a_p \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}. Discrete block bases are built with discrete rectangular windows having supports on intervals [ a_p,a_{p-1}]: g_p[n]=1_{[a_p,a_{p+1}-1]}(n). Since dilations are not defined in a discrete framework,bases of intervals of varying sizes from a single basis cannot generally be derived. Thus, Theorem 2 supposes an orthonormal basis of \\\\mathbb{C}^l for any l>0 can be constructed. The proof is:  Theorem 2.  Suppose that \\\\\\\\{e_{k,l}\\\\\\\\}_{0\\\\leqslant k is an orthogonal basis of \\\\mathbb{C}^l for any l>0. The family \\\\\\\\{g_{p,k}[n]=g_p[n]e_{k,l_p}[n-a_p]\\\\\\\\}_{0\\\\leqslant k is a block orthonormal basis of l^2(\\\\mathbb{Z}). A discrete block basis is constructed with discrete Fourier bases \\\\\\\\{e_{k,l[n]}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{l}}exp(\\\\frac{i2\\\\pi kn}{l})\\\\\\\\}_{0\\\\leqslant k The resulting block Fourier vectors g_{p,k} have sharp transitions at the window border, and thus are not well localized in frequency. As in the continuous case, the decomposition of smooth signals f may produce large-amplitude, high-frequency coefficients because of border effects. = Block Bases of Images = General block bases of images are constructed by partitioning the plane \\\\mathbb{R}^2 into rectangles \\\\\\\\{[a_p,b_p]\\\\times [c_p,d_p]\\\\\\\\}_{p\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} of arbitrary length l_p = b_p-a_p and width w_p=d_p-c_p. Let \\\\\\\\{e_k\\\\\\\\}_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}} be an orthonormal basis of L^2[0,1] and g = 1_{[0,1]}.

The girls visit Mama P’s shop to get the ingredients for recipes. Mama P reveals that she knows what the ingredients are and the girls conclude that Mama P knows about the magic because she appears to have extensive knowledge of magical ingredients.

Furthermore, they discover that Kelly's odd neighbor Ms. Silvers also has a connection to magic. The girls realize that they are the protectors of the magical cookbook and that there were many others before them, three of whom were Mama P, Ms. Silvers and Grandma Becky. Among all this, Kelly has one main goal: to find the magical recipe that will fix her grandmother's mysterious illness. As the girls work together, they find out that Kelly's grandma Becky is under a curse, and so is Mama P.(whose curse does not let her leave Saffron Falls) and Ms. Silvers (whose curse does not let her play the piano in public). =Season 2 (Part 1)= After Kelly, Hannah, and Darbie free the town of Mama P's curse and also break Grandma Quinn, and Ms. Silvers' curse, enabling grandma to talk again and Ms. Silvers to play piano in public. Along with this, they realize that they broke every curse, which means they brought back Chuck Hankins, a teenage boy from the ’60s who had suddenly disappeared because of The OC's (Original Cooks): Gina Silvers, Ida Perez (Mama P.), and Rebecca Quinn (Grandma Quinn). When searching through old city records at the library, the girls find a picture of a high school class from 1865. They recognize Chuck in it, with his name as Charles Peizer. The girls realize that Chuck is much older than the OC's and has disappeared once before but has stayed the same age. It is revealed that Charles Peizer and his sister Rose Peizer were once the protectors of the cookbook. The OC's research more into Chuck's picture and find out that the Peizers were the richest family during that time and the West Peizer Park in Saffron Falls was a part of their estate. Chuck casts a spell to render an invisible trailer. Through an invisibility spell and a super strength spell, the girls are able to see and enter the trailer. There they discover that Chuck has another cookbook that is stealing recipes from their cookbook. They are able to steal it and discover that Mama P's Morbium Seed was stolen by Chuck. Later the original cooks put a spell on him by making him stay in Lavender Heights forever, thus stopping him from taking the cookbook and stealing the magical ingredients. However, Chuck casts another spell on Jake using Mama P's Morbium Seed and takes over Jake's body. As Jake, Chuck learns the plans to further stop him and has access to the magic spices. Chuck puts a spell on Hannah and tries to swap her for Rose, but Kelly and Darbie save her, and in the process, break Chuck's Immortality Spell, also breaking Rose's and frees her from the book. Chuck and Rose go back in time and live out their lives, with Rose living to be 82. West Peizer Park becomes Rose Peizer Park. =Season 2 (Part 2)= The book and spices are stolen from Kelly's backpack. Kelly, Hannah, and Darbie meet a previous protector from the '90s. With Jake's help, they are able to get the book back. A mysterious, but beautifully carved box, sits in Grandma Becky's antique shop, with the same fork, knife, and spoon symbol on it as the cookbook. One by one, everyone's memories of magic are being erased. Kelly, Hannah, and Darbie become suspicious on Mr.Morris, Hannah's teacher at Fox Canyon for erasing everyone's memories of magic but it wasn't him, it was Caroline, who got transformed into Jill, Mrs. Quinn's campaign manager, and was trying to erase their memories of magic. The trio managed to escape from Caroline's spell and keep their memories of magic. =Season 3 (Part 1) = Mama P's has been bought by a coffee chain. Kelly, Hannah, and Darbie become suspicious of the manager Erin. They soon notice clues of someone who knows that magic is real, even after all memories of magic have been erased. This someone stole their newly harvested Night Blooming spices, and is therefore dubbed the \\"Night Bandit.\\" The girls meet Darbie's friend, Piper, and they introduce her to magic. The four of them work together to find the Night Bandit and put a stop to their crimes. It turns out that Kelly is actually the Night Bandit and she was poisoned by the spell that brought back the garden in the previous season. In the final episode, the spell on her is broken, but the girls needed to save Grandma Becky after she disappears. They go back in time and save her, thus also creating a new spice named Parquinnien (hannah PARker kent, kelly QUINN, darbie o’ brIEN; see caps letters). The cookbook moves on to Zoe, Erin's daughter and one of the new protectors. =Season 3 (Part 2)= The cookbook has moved on to the new protectors: Zoe (Erin's daughter), Ish (Zoe's neighbor) and Leo (Zoe's stepbrother). With the help of Kelly, Darbie, and Hannah, the new trio are convinced that magic exists and able to go through troubling times together. = Just Add Magic: Mystery City (2020) = In the spinoff series, new protectors Zoe (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport), Ish (Jenna Qureshi), and Leo (Tyler Sanders) are set to solve their first mystery. Zoe, wanting to learn more about her father who had died when she was two years old, uncovers a book at the library that had been associated with him. The book tells a story from the late 1800s, narrated from the point of view of Ian Maddox, who was then a protector along with brothers Clint and Folsom Wesson. The Wesson brothers grew power-hungry, and created a magical sourdough starter that would help them get large quantities of gold, but the downside of the spell was that it caused mass destruction. With Chuck Peizer's assistance, Ian Maddox traveled to the future to hide the starter from the Wesson brothers. Zoe, Ish, and Leo find themselves in a race against the Wessons' descendants to find the sourdough starter. Their goal is to find three coins that will help them discover where the starter is, and then to destroy it once and for all—if the Wessons don't get to it first. Towards the end, with the help of Kelly, Darbie and Hannah, the trio becomes successful in saving the world from all the destruction that could have been caused, and the magic leaves the book, and gets distributed throughout.
