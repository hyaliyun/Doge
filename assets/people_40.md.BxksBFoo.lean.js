The money represented the bulk of the K Foundation's funds, earned by Drummond and Cauty as The KLF, one of the United Kingdom's most successful pop groups of the early 1990s. The incineration was recorded on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator Gimpo. In August 1995, the film‚ÄîWatch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid‚Äîwas toured around the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging each audience in debate about the burning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning for a period of 23 years, but Drummond spoke about the burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he admitted that he regretted burning the money. The self-imposed moratorium officially ended on 23 August 2017, 23 years after the burning, when Cauty and Drummond hosted a debate asking \\"Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?\\" during their \\"Welcome to the Dark Ages\\" event. Collaborator Chris Brook edited and compiled a book, K Foundation Burn A Million Quid, which was published by Ellipsis Books in 1997. It compiles stills from the film, accounts of events and viewer reactions, and an image of the brick that was manufactured from the fire's ashes. A film consisting of a three-minute shot of the brick - \\"This Brick\\" - was shown at London's Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty's performance as 2K in the same year. Background As The KLF, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991. They had also enjoyed considerable success with their album The White Room and a number one hit single ‚Äì \\"Doctorin' the Tardis\\" ‚Äì as The Timelords. In February 1992, The KLF staged an incendiary performance at the BRIT Awards, and retired from the music industry shortly thereafter in typically enigmatic fashion. By their own account, neither Drummond nor Cauty kept any of the money they made as The KLF; it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions. Cauty told an Australian Big Issue writer in 2003 that all the money they made as The KLF was spent, and that the royalties they accrued post-retirement amounted to approximately one million pounds: Initially The KLF's earnings were to be distributed by way of a fund for struggling artists managed by the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty's new post- KLF art project, but, said Drummond, \\"We realised that struggling artists are meant to struggle, that's the whole point.\\" Includes a full transcript of an interview by John Dower and Dave Greer with Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty and other guests on the \\"Everything You Know Is Wrong\\" show, Subcity Radio, Glasgow, 3 November 1995. Instead the duo decided to create art with the money. Nailed to the Wall was the first piece of art produced by the Foundation, and the major piece in their planned art exhibition, Money: A Major Body of Cash. Consisting of one million pounds in cash nailed to a pine frame, the piece was presented to the press on 23 November 1993 during the buildup to the Foundation's announcement of the \\"winner\\" of their \\"worst artist of the year award\\", the K Foundation art award. Decision and burning During the first half of 1994, the K Foundation attempted to interest galleries in staging Money: A Major Body of Cash, but even old friend Jayne Casey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. The Tate, in Liverpool, wanted to be part of the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly\\", leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. \\"Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do.\\" Cauty: \\"We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare.\\" The journey from deciding to burn the money to deciding how to burn the money to actually burning the money was a long one. Jim Reid, a freelance journalist and the only independent witness to the burning, reported the various schemes the K Foundation considered. The first was offering Nailed to the Wall to the Tate Gallery as the \\"1995 K Foundation Bequest to the Nation.\\" The condition was that the gallery must agree to display the piece for at least 10 years. If they refused, the money would be burnt. A second idea was to hire Bankside Power Station, \\"the future site of the Tate Gallery extension and an imposing building downstream from the South Bank\\", as a bonfire venue. In typical KLF 'guerrilla communication' style, \\"posters were to appear on 15 August bearing the legend 'The 1995 K Foundation Bequest to the Nation', under which would have been an image of Nailed to the Wall on an easel and two flame-throwers lying on the floor. On 24 August a new poster would go up, exactly the same as the first except that this time the work would be burnt.\\" The Boathouse on the Ardfin Estate where the K Foundation burnt ¬£1 million The K Foundation's final solution for their one-million-pound \\"problem\\" was rather less showbiz, but dramatic nonetheless, the Foundation having decided that making a public spectacle of the event would lessen its impact. On 22 August, Reid, Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo touched down at Islay Airport in the Inner Hebrides and took a ferry to the island of Jura, previously the scene of a wicker man burning ceremony by The KLF. Early in the morning of 23 August 1994, in an abandoned boathouse on Jura, Drummond and Cauty incinerated the money. The burning was witnessed by Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the act for The Observer, and it was filmed on a Hi-8 video camera by collaborator Gimpo. As the burning began Reid said he felt guilt and shock. These feelings, he reported, quickly turned to boredom. The money took well over an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed ¬£50 notes into the fire. According to Drummond, only about ¬£900,000 of the money was actually burnt, with the remainder flying straight up the chimney. Two days later, according to Reid, Jimmy Cauty destroyed all film and photographic evidence of the burning. Ten months later, Gimpo revealed to them that he had secretly kept a copy. Film Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid starts with a short description of the event, and then consists of Drummond and Cauty throwing ¬£50 notes onto the fire. Burning the entire amount takes around 67 minutes. NME wrote: In November 1995, the BBC aired an edition of the Omnibus documentary series about The K Foundation entitled A Foundation Course in Art (usually mislabelled as The K Foundation Burn a Million Quid online). Amongst the footage broadcast were scenes from Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid. Thomas Sutcliffe, reviewing the programme in The Independent, wrote: A still of the film from the book K Foundation Burn a Million Quid =Screening tour= The first public screening of Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid was on Jura on 23 August 1995 ‚Äì exactly one year after the burning. \\"We feel we should face them and answer their questions\\" said one of the duo. The words are attributed to the duo in general and not specifically attributed to Drummond or Cauty. Two weeks later an advert appeared in The Guardian, announcing a world tour of the film over the next 12 months at \\"relevant locations\\". The second screening was at In the City music industry convention on 5 September in Manchester. After the film was shown, Drummond and Cauty held a question-and-answer session with the theme \\"Is It Rock'n'Roll?\\". A week later, the pair travelled as guests of alternative radio station B92 to Belgrade, where the post-screening discussion was titled \\"Is it a crime against humanity?\\" An unauthorised screening at the BBC Television Centre was curtailed and Drummond and Cauty were escorted from the building. On the weekend of 3 November 1995, the film was screened at several locations in Glasgow, including at football matches involving Celtic and Rangers; a planned screening at Barlinnie prison was cancelled after the Scottish Prison Service withdrew permission. Glasgow's artistic community broadly seemed to welcome the screenings. A further public screening on Glasgow Green on 5 November was announced by various newspapers, but there is no record of the showing having ever occurred. The K Foundation disappeared from Glasgow; they later issued a statement that on 5 November 1995 they had signed a \\"contract\\" on the side of a Nissan Bluebird - which had then been pushed over the cliffs at Cape Wrath in northern Scotland  agreeing to wind up the K Foundation and not to speak about the money burning for a period of 23 years. Despite the K Foundation's reported moratorium, further national screenings of the film organised by Chris Brook took place as planned. At each screening, Drummond and Cauty announced they would not answer questions after the film; instead, they would ask questions of the audience. These screenings were held in Bradford, Hull, Liverpool, Cheltenham Ladies College, Eton College, Bristol, Aberystwyth, Glastonbury Tor and Brick Lane, London. The Brick Lane screening ‚Äì on 8 December 1995 ‚Äì had been previewed in NME, and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned for a car park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, to the basement of the nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The NME preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of the film. End of the moratorium Drummond and Cauty ended their self-imposed moratorium on 23 August 2017, 23 years after the burning. \\"Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?\\" was debated during \\"Welcome to the Dark Ages\\", a three-day festival celebrating the launch of their novel 2023: A Trilogy. Burning as a theme Ellipsis' K Foundation-style advert promoting the book K Foundation Burn A Million Quid Ritualistic burnings had already been a recurring aspect of Drummond and Cauty's work. In 1987, the duo disposed of copies of their copyright-breaching debut album‚ÄîThe Justified Ancients of Mu Mu's 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)‚Äîby burning them in a Swedish field. This event was pictured on the back sleeve of their second album, Who Killed The JAMs?, and celebrated in the song \\"Burn the Bastards\\". During the 1991 summer solstice, they burnt a wicker man on Jura, as chronicled in the KLF movie The Rites of Mu. As the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty threatened to burn the K Foundation art award prize money (Gimpo was fumbling with matches and lighter fluid when, at the last moment, Rachel Whiteread accepted the prize). In the seventh K Foundation press advert they asked \\"What would you do with a million pounds? Burn it?\\" Reaction and analysis Jim Reid's piece appeared in The Observer on 25 September 1994. This is \\"one of the most peculiar stories of the year\\", he cautioned readers. \\"Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine is going to have trouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth.\\" \\"It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames\\", he added. \\"I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this.\\" The Daily Express ran the story on 1 October 1994. They reported that charred ¬£50 notes were being found by islanders, who did not doubt the burning had really taken place. Drummond and Cauty had been seen eating in a hotel bar on Jura before leaving with two suitcases, the newspaper reported. The Times followed with essentially the same story on 4 October 1994, adding that the burning \\"[had] left many on the island bewildered, incredulous and angry\\". ¬£1,500 had been handed in by a local fisherman to Islay police: \\"Sergeant Lachlan Maclean checked the money with both banks on Islay and with Customs and Excise, who pronounced it genuine. 'I telephoned Mr Drummond in London and told him the money had been found. I asked him if it was his. He said he would get in touch with his partner, Mr Cauty. So far he has not telephoned back. The media returned to the story in earnest in October and November 1995, previewing and then reviewing Foundation Course in Art, and reporting on the K Foundation's tour screening Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid. An October 1995 feature quoted Kevin Hull, the BBC documentary maker responsible for the Omnibus item, saying he had found \\"the boys rather depressed, and almost in a state of shock\\". \\"Every day I wake up and I think 'Oh God, I've burnt a million quid and everyone thinks it's wrong, Cauty told him. A piece in The Times on 5 November 1995, coinciding with the Glasgow screenings, reported that the K Foundation had no solid reason for burning the money or view of what, if anything, the act represented, but concluded \\"The K Foundation may not have changed or challenged much but they have certainly provoked thousands to question and analyse the power of money and the responsibilities of those who possess it. And what could be more artistic than that?\\" In the same issue, the newspaper's K Foundation art award witness, Robert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation's award, million-pound artwork and the burning were all \\"entertaining, and satirically quite sharp\\", but \\"the art world has chosen not to think [of it as art].... The general view remains that the K Foundation's preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere, simply isn't very original. Although they didn't blow their entire life's savings along the way, other artists, notably Yves Klein and Chris Burden, have been here before.\\" The Guardian TV reviewer was sceptical. \\"Snag is, the K men have always dealt in myth and sown a trail of confusion, so nobody quite believes they really burned the money. And if they did, they must be nuts.\\" =Later reaction= In the following years, the burning was mentioned regularly in the press, with Drummond and Cauty often relegated to a cultural status of \\"the men who burnt a million quid\\". A February 2000 article in The Observer newspaper again insisted that the duo really had burnt one million pounds. \\"It wasn't a stunt. They really did it. If you want to rile Bill Drummond, you call him a hoaxer. 'I knew it was real,' a long-time friend and associate of his group The KLF tells me, 'because afterwards, Jimmy and Bill looked so harrowed and haunted. And to be honest, they've never really been the same since. A 2004 listener poll by BBC Radio 6 Music saw The KLF/K Foundation placed second after The Who in a list of \\"rock excesses\\". Drummond's former proteg√© Julian Cope was unimpressed, claiming that Drummond still owed him money. \\"He burned a million pounds which was not all his, and some of it was mine. People should pay off their creditors before they pull intellectual dry-wank stunts like that.\\" Legacy On 17 September 1997, a new film, This Brick, was premiered. The film consisted of one three-minute shot of a brick made from the ashes of the money burnt at Jura. It was shown at the Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty's performance as 2K. On 27 September 1997, K Foundation Burn A Million Quid (, paperback) was published. The book, by Chris Brook and Gimpo, contains stills from the film and transcriptions of various Q&A; sessions from the tour. It also includes a timeline of K Foundation activity and sundry essays including one from Alan Moore. Publisher Ellipsis promoted the book with an advert modelled on those of the K Foundation ‚Äì \\"Why did Ellipsis publish K Foundation Burn A Million Quid?\\" they asked. Initially, Drummond was unrepentant, telling The Observer in 2000 that he couldn't imagine ever feeling regret unless his child was ill and only \\"an expensive clinic\\" could cure him. By 2004, however, he had admitted to the BBC the difficulty of explaining his decision. \\"It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier. I wish I could explain why I did it so people would understand.\\" Notes References External links * Category:1995 films Category:British non-fiction books Category:Culture jamming Category:Performance art Category:The KLF Category:Money Category:Fire Category:Jura, Scotland ","title":"K Foundation Burn a Million Quid"},{"id":"75160","text":"Lubin () is a town in Lower Silesian Voivodeship in south-western Poland. From 1975-1998 it belonged to the former Legnica Voivodeship. Lubin is the administrative seat of Lubin County, and also of the rural district called Gmina Lubin, although it is not part of the territory of the latter, as the town forms a separate urban gmina. As of 2018, the town had a total population of 72,581. Geography Lubin is situated on the Zimnica river in the Lower Silesian historical region, about northwest of Wroc≈Çaw and north of Legnica. The town is one of the major industrial locations in Lower Silesia, with the headquarters of the third-largest Polish corporation, the KGHM Polska Mied≈∫ mining company.  History  = Early Medieval History= The area of Lubin lies midway between the main settlements of two West Slavic ≈ölƒô≈ºanie tribes, the Dziadoszanie and the Trzebowianie, whose lands were both subdued by King Mieszko I of Poland about 990. It is unclear which of the two tribes, if either, founded the town. One legend states that the town derives its name from Luba, a young man credited with slaying a giant bear that had been terrifying the inhabitants. A papal bull dated to circa 1155 mentions Lubin as one of 13 Silesian castellanies. According to legend the Polish voivode Piotr W≈Çostowic of Dunin (1080‚Äì1153) had a fieldstone church built on the hill in the west of Lubin, where about 1230 a castellany and a village arose that until today is called the Old Town (). The settlement in the Duchy of G≈Çog√≥w was first mentioned under the Old Polish name of Lubin in a 1267 deed by Pope Clement IV as a fiefdom of Trzebnica Abbey. = Founding of the town = Ruins of the Piast Castle The New Town of what is today Lubin was probably founded in the 1280s under the rule of Duke Przemko of ≈öcinawa by German settlers, maybe descending from Lower Lorraine or Franconia, in the course of the Ostsiedlung. It obtained its city rights about 1295. In 1329 Duke John of ≈öcinawa paid homage to King John of Bohemia, who upon the death of John's brother Duke Przemko II of G≈Çog√≥w in 1331 invaded the lands, which were incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia and shared the political fortunes of the Silesian crown land. Gothic Castle Chapel, built in the 14th century From 1348 Lubin Castle served as the residence of the Piast duke Louis I the Fair and his descendants. In the quarrel with his elder brother Duke Wenceslaus I of Legnica a 1359 judgement by Emperor Charles IV allotted Lubin along with Krzeczyn Wielki, Krzeczyn Ma≈Çy, Osiek and Pieszk√≥w to Louis. About 1353 he had a manuscript on the life of Saint Hedwig of Andechs drawn up, later called Schlackenwerth (Ostrov) Codex, which today is kept at the J. Paul Getty Museum. In the late 15th century the Lubin parish church was rebuilt in its present-day Gothic style, its high altar was moved to Wroc≈Çaw Cathedral in 1951. Under the rule of Duke George I of Brieg (d. 1521) and his widow Anna of Pomerania, the reformer Caspar Schwenckfeld, born in nearby Osiek, made the town a centre of the Protestant Reformation in Lower Silesia. With Bohemian Silesia, Lubin in 1526 fell under suzerainty of the Habsburg Monarchy. It was devastated several times during the Thirty Years' War. Lubin remained part of the Piast-ruled Duchy of Legnica until 1675, when it was incorporated to the Habsburg-ruled Bohemia. Conquered in the Silesian Wars by King Frederick II of Prussia in the mid-18th Century, the town became a part of Prussia and later, in 1871, Germany. In 1871, after creation of the German Empire, it was connected by rail to Legnica (Liegnitz) and G≈Çog√≥w (Glogau). In reports on their parishes at the end of the 18th century, local pastors wrote about native Poles, who spoke a local dialect of the Polish language. The native Polish population was subjected to planned Germanisation, which lasted until the 1930s. Street leading to the market square During World War II about 70% of the town's buildings were destroyed. In 1945 between the days of 8‚Äì10 February Red Army soldiers mass-murdered 150 German pensioners in an old- people's home and 500 psychiatric hospital patients in Lubin.Lubin's history As a result of border changes promulgated at the 1945 Potsdam Conference, the town, lying east of the Oder-Neisse line, became a part of the Republic of Poland. The totality of the town's population, being German, was either expelled, or prohibited from returning home by the new Polish Authorities. In 1982 the town saw significant demonstrations against the martial law declared by the Communist regime, which were put down by its death squads, resulting in the murder of three people.Defiance in the Streets - TIME Education * Uczelnia Zawodowa Zag≈Çƒôbia Miedziowego * I Liceum Og√≥lnokszta≈ÇcƒÖce im.

Workshop of Rubens In Greek mythology, Cadmus (; Kadmos), was the founder and first king of Thebes.Alden, John B. (1883) The Greek Anthology, pp. 160‚Äì162. Cadmus was the first Greek hero and, alongside Perseus and Bellerophon, the greatest hero and slayer of monsters before the days of Heracles.Kerenyi, Karl, 1959. The Heroes of the Greeks (London: Thames and Hudson) p. 75. Commonly stated to be a Phoenician prince, son of king Agenor and queen Telephassa of Tyre and the brother of Phoenix, Cilix and Europa, he was originally sent by his royal parents to seek out and escort his sister Europa back to Tyre after she was abducted from the shores of Phoenicia by Zeus.A modern application of genealogy would make him the paternal grandfather of Dionysus, through his daughter by Harmonia, Semele. Plutarch once admitted that he would rather be assisted by Lamprias, his own grandfather, than by Dionysus' grandfather, i.e. Cadmus. (Symposiacs, Book IX, question II ) In early accounts, Cadmus and Europa were instead the children of Phoenix.Scholia on Homer, Iliad B, 494, p. 80, 43 ed. Bekk. as cited in Hellanicus' Boeotica Cadmus founded the Greek city of Thebes, the acropolis of which was originally named Cadmeia in his honour. Cadmus' homeland was the subject of significant disagreement among ancient authors. Apollodorus identifies it as Phoenicia, but Tyre, Sidon, and even Thebes in Egypt are referenced in different accounts. His parentage is sometimes modified to suit, e.g. claims of Theban origin name his mother as one of the daughters of Nilus, one of the Potamoi and deity of the Nile river. Overview Cadmus was credited by the ancient Greeks (such as HerodotusHerodotus' Histories, Book V, 58. 484 ‚Äì 425 BC, one of the first Greek historians, but one who also wove standard myths and legends through his work) with introducing the original Phoenician alphabet to the Greeks, who adapted it to form their Greek alphabet. Herodotus estimates that Cadmus lived sixteen hundred years before his time, which would be around 2000 BC.Herodotus. Histories, Book II, 2.145.4. Herodotus had seen and described the Cadmean writing in the temple of Apollo at Thebes engraved on certain tripods. He estimated those tripods to date back to the time of Laius the great-grandson of Cadmus.Herodotus. Histories, Book V.59.1 On one of the tripods there was this inscription in Cadmean writing, which, as he attested, resembled Ionian letters: (\\"Amphitryon dedicated me [don't forget] the spoils of [the battle of] Teleboae.\\"). Although Greeks like Herodotus dated Cadmus's role in the founding myth of Thebes to well before the Trojan War (or, in modern terms, during the Aegean Bronze Age), this chronology conflicts with most of what is now known or thought to be known about the origins and spread of both the Phoenician and Greek alphabets. The earliest Greek inscriptions match Phoenician letter forms from the late 9th or 8th centuries BC‚Äîin any case, the Phoenician alphabet properly speaking was not developed until around 1050 BC (or after the Bronze Age collapse). The Homeric picture of the Mycenaean age betrays extremely little awareness of writing, possibly reflecting the loss during the Dark Age of the earlier Linear B script. Indeed, the only Homeric reference to writingThere are several examples of written letters, such as in Nestor's narrative concerning Bellerophon and the \\"Bellerophontic letter\\", another description of a letter presumably sent to Palamedes from Priam but in fact written by Odysseus (Hyginus. Fabulae, 105), as well as the letters described by Plutarch in Parallel Lives, Theseus, which were presented to Ariadne, presumably sent from Theseus. Plutarch goes on to describe how Theseus erected a pillar on the Isthmus of Corinth, which bears an inscription of two lines. was in the phrase \\"Œ≥œÅŒ¨ŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ŒªœÖŒ≥œÅŒ¨\\", gr√°mmata lygr√°, literally \\"baneful drawings\\", when referring to the Bellerophontic letter. Linear B tablets have been found in abundance at Thebes, which might lead one to speculate that the legend of Cadmus as bringer of the alphabet could reflect earlier traditions about the origins of Linear B writing in Greece (as Frederick Ahl speculated in 1967F. M. Ahl. \\"Cadmus and the Palm- Leaf Tablets\\". American Journal of Philology 88.2, Apr. 1967, pp. 188‚Äì194.). But such a suggestion, however attractive, is by no means a certain conclusion in light of currently available evidence. The connection between the name of Cadmus and the historical origins of either the Linear B script or the later Phoenician alphabet, if any, remains elusive. However, in modern-day Lebanon, Cadmus is still revered and celebrated as the \\"carrier of the letter\\" to the world. According to Greek myth, Cadmus's descendants ruled at Thebes on and off for several generations, including the time of the Trojan War. Etymology The etymology of Cadmus' name remains uncertain.LSJ s.v. ŒöŒ¨Œ¥ŒºŒøœÇ. Possible connected words include the Semitic triliteral root qdm () signifies \\"east\\", in Arabic, words derived from the root \\"qdm\\" include the verb ‚Äúqdm‚Äù meaning ‚Äúto come‚Äù as well as words meaning \\"primeval\\" and \\"forth\\" as well as \\"foot\\", (in Hebrew, qedem means \\"east\\",\\"front\\" and \\"ancient\\"(primeval); the verb qadam () means \\"to be in front\\"),Compare: and the Greek kekasmai (<*kekadmai) \\"to shine\\". Therefore, the complete meaning of the name might be: \\"He who excels\\" or \\"from the east\\". Wanderings =Samothrace= Cadmus fighting the dragon. Painting from a krater in the Louvre Museum. Lee Lawrie, Cadmus (1939). Library of Congress John Adams Building, Washington, D.C. After his sister Europa had been carried off by Zeus from the shores of Phoenicia, Cadmus was sent out by his father to find her, and enjoined not to return without her. Unsuccessful in his search‚Äîor unwilling to go against Zeus‚Äîhe came to Samothrace, the island sacred to the \\"Great Gods\\"The Megaloi theoi of the Mysteries of Samothrace. or the Kabeiroi, whose mysteries would be celebrated also at Thebes. Cadmus did not journey alone to Samothrace; he appeared with his mother TelephassaOr known by another lunar name, Argiope, \\"she of the white face\\" (Kerenyi 1959:27). in the company of his nephew (or brother) Thasus, son of Cilix, who gave his name to the island of Thasos nearby. An identically composed trio had other names at Samothrace, according to Diodorus Siculus:Diodorus Siculus, 5.48; Clement of Alexandria, to wit Proreptikos 2.13.3. Electra and her two sons, Dardanos and Eetion or Iasion. There was a fourth figure, Electra's daughter, Harmonia,Harmonia at Thebes was accounted the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite; all these figures appeared in sculptures on the pediment of the Hellenistic main temple in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods at Samothrace, the Hieron; the ancient sources on this family grouping were assembled by N. Lewis, Samothrace. I: The Ancient Literary Sources (New York) 1958:24-36. whom Cadmus took away as a bride, as Zeus had abducted Europa.Kerenyi (1959) notes that Cadmus in some sense found another Europa at Samothrace, according to an obscure scholium on Euripides' Rhesus 29. The wedding was the first celebrated on Earth to which the gods brought gifts, according to DiodorusDiodorus, 5.49.1; when the gods attended the later wedding of Peleus and Thetis, the harmony was shattered by the Apple of Discord. and dined with Cadmus and his bride.The full range of references in Antiquity to this wedding is presented by Matia Rocchi, Kadmos e Harmonia: un matrimonio problemmatico (Rome: Bretschneider) 1989. =Founder of Thebes= Cadmus Asks the Delphic Oracle Where He Can Find his Sister, Europa, Hendrick Goltzius Cadmus came in the course of his wanderings to Delphi, where he consulted the oracle. He was ordered to give up his quest and follow a special cow, with a half moon on her flank, which would meet him, and to build a town on the spot where she should lie down exhausted.http://mythology.stackexchange.com/a/2495/2892/ The cow was given to Cadmus by Pelagon, King of Phocis, and it guided him to Boeotia, where he founded the city of Thebes. Intending to sacrifice the cow to Athena, Cadmus sent some of his companions, Deioleon and Seriphus to the nearby Ismenian spring for water.John Tzetzes. Chiliades, 10.32 line 4 They were slain by the spring's guardian water-dragon (compare the Lernaean Hydra), which was in turn destroyed by Cadmus, the duty of a culture hero of the new order. Cadmus Sowing the Dragon's teeth, by Maxfield Parrish, 1908. He was then instructed by Athena to sow the dragon's teeth in the ground, from which there sprang a race of fierce armed men, called the Spartoi (\\"sown\\"). By throwing a stone among them, Cadmus caused them to fall upon one another until only five survived, who assisted him to build the Cadmeia or citadel of Thebes, and became the founders of the noblest families of that city. The dragon had been sacred to Ares, so the god made Cadmus do penance for eight years by serving him. According to Theban tellings, it was at the expiration of this period that the gods gave him Harmonia (\\"harmony\\", literally \\"putting or assembling together\\", \\"good assembly\\", or \\"good composition\\") as wife.Scholia on Homer, Iliad B, 494, p. 80, 43 ed. Bekk. as cited in Hellanicus' Boeotica At Thebes, Cadmus and Harmonia began a dynasty with a son Polydorus, and four daughters, Agave, Autono√´, Ino and Semele. At the wedding, whether celebrated at Samothrace or at Thebes, all the gods were present; Harmonia received as bridal gifts a peplos worked by Athena and a necklace made by Hephaestus. This necklace, commonly referred to as the Necklace of Harmonia, brought misfortune to all who possessed it. Notwithstanding the divinely ordained nature of his marriage and his kingdom, Cadmus lived to regret both: his family was overtaken by grievous misfortunes, and his city by civil unrest. Cadmus finally abdicated in favor of his grandson Pentheus, and went with Harmonia to Illyria, to fight on the sideApollodorus. Library and Epitome, 3.5.4. of the Enchelii.Pierre Grimal, Pierre, Maxwell-Hyslop, A. R. The Dictionary of Classical Mythology. Blackwell, 1996, , p. 83. Later, as king, he founded the city of Lychnidos and Bouthoe.Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians. Blackwell Publishing, 1992, , p. 99. Nevertheless, Cadmus was deeply troubled by the ill-fortune which clung to him as a result of his having killed the sacred dragon, and one day he remarked that if the gods were so enamoured of the life of a serpent, he might as well wish that life for himself. Immediately he began to grow scales and change in form. Harmonia, seeing the transformation, thereupon begged the gods to share her husband's fate, which they granted (Hyginus). In another telling of the story, the bodies of Cadmus and his wife were changed after their deaths; the serpents watched their tomb while their souls were translated to the fields. In Euripides' The Bacchae, Cadmus is given a prophecy by Dionysus whereby both he and his wife will be turned into snakes for a period before eventually being brought to live among the blest. Samothracian connection In Phoenician, as well as Hebrew, the Semitic root qdm signifies \\"the east\\", the Levantine origin of \\"Kdm\\" himself, according to the Greek mythographers; the equation of Kadmos with the Semitic qdm was traced to a publication of 1646 by R. B. Edwards.Edwards, Kadmos the Phoenician: A Study in Greek Legends and the Mycenaean Age (Amsterdam 1979), noted by Walter Burkert, The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Bronze Age (Harvard University Press) 1992:2, and note), who remarks that the complementary connection of Europa with rb, \\"West\\" was an ancient one, made by Hesychius. The name Kadmos has been thoroughly Hellenised. The fact that Hermes was worshipped in Samothrace under the name of Cadmus or Cadmilus seems to show that the Theban Cadmus was interpreted as an ancestral Theban hero corresponding to the Samothracian. Another Samothracian connection for Cadmus is offered via his wife Harmonia, who is said by Diodorus Siculus to be daughter of Zeus and Electra and of Samothracian birth.Diodorus Siculus 5.48.2 The \\"Wedding of Cadmus and Harmonia\\" is considered as a conceptual symbolic coupling of Eastern (Phoenician) learning with Western (Greek) love of beauty. He died tragicallly by getting killed by Ares the God of war. Genealogy Cadmus was of ultimately divine ancestry, the grandson of the sea god Poseidon and Libya on his father's side, and of Nilus (the River Nile) on his mother's side; overall he was considered a member of the fifth generation of beings following the (mythological) creation of the world: Offspring With Harmonia, he was the father of Semele, Polydorus, Autonoe, Agave and Ino. Their youngest son was Illyrius.Pierre Grimal, Pierre, Maxwell-Hyslop, A. R. The Dictionary of Classical Mythology. Blackwell, 1996, , pp. 83, 230. According to Greek mythology, Cadmus is the ancestor of Illyrians and Theban royalty. Hittite records controversy It has been argued by various scholars, that in a letter from the King of Ahhiyawa to the Hittite King, written in the Hittite language in c. 1250 BC, a specific Cadmus was mentioned as a forefather of the Ahhijawa people. The latter term most probably referred to the Mycenaean world (Achaeans), or at least to a part of it. Nevertheless, this reading about a supposed Cadmus as historical person is rejected by most scholars. Trivia The Syrian city of Al-Qadmus is named after Cadmus.

In later accounts he is said to be one of the judges of the dead.  Family  Rhadamanthus was the son of Zeus and Europa and brother to Sarpedon and Minos (also a king and later a judge of the dead). Together with his brother, Rhadamanthus was raised by Asterion, their stepfather. He had two sons, Gortys (associated with Gortyn, Crete) and Erythrus (founder of Erythrae). Other sources (e.g. Plutarch, Theseus 20) credit Rhadamanthys rather than Dionysus as the husband of Ariadne, and the father of Oenopion, Staphylus and Thoas. In this account, Ariadne was the daughter of Minos, Rhadamanthys' brother; another Ariadne was the daughter of Minos' grandson and namesake, who features in the Theseus legend, and was rescued by Dionysus.  Mythology  =Legislation= Although he was frequently considered one of the judges of the dead in the underworld, he was known for few legislative activities. There is a reference to a law of Rhadamanthus ordering the Cretans to swear oaths by animalsPorphyry, De Abstinentia III.16.6, on which see Jean Bouffartigue, Porphyre, De l'abstinence, (Paris) 1979, p. 171 n. 2. and to another law of Rhadamanthus saying if a person defends themselves against another who initiated violence then they should suffer no penalty.Apollodorus Library of Greek Mythology, II.4 =Exile from Crete= Driven out of Crete by Minos, who was jealous of his popularity, he fled to Boeotia, where he wedded Alcmene, widow of Amphitryon and mother of Heracles. Also, according to some traditions, he was a tutor to Heracles.John Davidson, Rhadamanthys and the Family of Herakles. L'antiquit√© classique, 1999, Vol 68, pp. 247-252 This is also mentioned by Tzetzes, a medieval historian. In general, the particular sphere of activity of Rhadamanthus tends to be the Aegean islands, apart from Crete itself, where Minos was active. He is also often connected by ancient authors with central Greece. = Afterlife = According to later legends (c. 400 BC), on account of his inflexible integrity he was made one of the judges of the dead in the lower world, together with Aeacus and Minos. He was supposed to judge the souls of easterners, Aeacus those of westerners, while Minos had the casting vote (Plato, Gorgias 524A). He is portrayed in Books 4 and 7 of Homer's Odyssey. Virgil (69‚Äì18 BC) makes Rhadamanthus one of the judges and punishers of the unworthy in the Underworld (Tartarus) section of the Aeneid. Homer represents him as dwelling in the Elysian Fields (Odyssey iv. 564), the paradise for the immortal sons of Zeus. Pindar says that he is the right-hand man of Cronus (now ruling Elysium) and was the sole judge of the dead. Lucian depicts Rhadamanthus as presiding over the company of heroes on the Isles of the Blest in True History.

It is situated in the valley of the River Cher, a tributary of the Loire, about 26 km (16 mi) east of Tours and on the right bank of the Cher. The population of permanent residents hovers about 400, , but there is a large influx of tourists during the summer months, because the village adjoins the former royal Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau, one of the most popular tourist destinations in France.

As a result of her good relations with the village, the Chateau was spared the iconoclastic damage suffered by many other monuments during the Revolution. Although no official sources have been found to support this claim, the Ch√¢teau has ever since been referred to and spelled as Chenonceau.

(shortened to Whose Line? or WLIIA) is a short-form improvisational comedy television show created by Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson, and hosted by Clive Anderson. Beginning as a BBC radio programme, it was successfully adapted for television after its acquisition by Channel 4, and aired ten series from 23 September 1988 to 4 February 1999. Whose Line? consists of a panel of four performers who create characters, scenes or songs on the spot in the style of short-form improvisation games, based on topics either prompted from audience suggestions or predetermined by the host. The show's participants consisted of a rotating cast of noted comedians from Britain, Canada and the United States, including Stephen Fry, Paul Merton, Ryan Stiles, John Sessions, Colin Mochrie, Josie Lawrence, Greg Proops, Tony Slattery, Mike McShane, Wayne Brady, and Jim Sweeney. The success of Whose Line? spawned several domestic and international adaptations. An American version aired on ABC between 1998 and 2007 and was revived on The CW in 2013, and is broadcast in multiple countries. Whose Line Is It Anyway? Australia debuted on The Comedy Channel in 2016. Two similarly-themed British comedy programmes, Mock the Week (2005) and Fast and Loose (2011), were created by Patterson.  History  A frame from one of the opening sequences for Whose Line?, used from 1994 to 1998 In 1988, Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson came up with the concept for the show, revolving around games focused on creating improvisational comedy, using a group of performers. As part of their concept, Patterson and Leveson devised the show's title as a comedic riposte to a radio programme that had recently moved to television at the time, What's My Line, merged with the title of a 1972 teleplay (and eventual theatrical play) Whose Life Is It Anyway?. After pitching it to the BBC, the show was given the green light to run as a radio programme on BBC Radio 4 - this early incarnation ran for six episodes, with Clive Anderson as host, and both John Sessions and Stephen Fry as the programme's regulars. During its run, the show's creators decided to adopt the approach used by an earlier BBC radio show, I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again - rather than having the show's credit read out by a traditional BBC Radio announcer, the performers in each episode were tasked with doing this themselves, but in an amusing, comedic style. Following the end of the radio series, Patterson and Leveson began discussions with the BBC on creating a televised adaption of their concept. However, the broadcaster was hesitant on making the move and delayed making a decision until after further debate on the matter, leading to Channel 4, who eagerly liked the idea, making an offer during this time that the pair accepted. Believing the adaptation of the radio show would become a hit, the first series of Whose Line was arranged to feature a total of thirteen episodes, which is uncommon in the UK as most TV series in their first year often begin with just six episodes. The move to television came with an immediate problem - although the adaptation was aimed at maintaining the same regular cast as the radio show alongside a rotation of guest performers, Fry had begun to dislike performing improvisational comedy and opted to pull out of the show before filming began, leaving Sessions, convinced by him, to remain as a regular performer for the first series. Whose Line was a success, effectively helping with the careers of its regular performers, Paul Merton, Josie Lawrence, and Tony Slattery, and was boosted by the introduction of Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, and Greg Proops, reaching its peak by the end of the sixth series. The latter halves of the third and fourth series were filmed in New York, while the tenth series was filmed entirely at the Raleigh Studios in Hollywood. By the end of the tenth series, having run for 136 episodes between 1988 and 1999, Channel 4 decided to axe the programme following the eventual slump in the show's viewing figures. Repeats of Whose Line continued following its cancellation, though with episodes edited and reformatted as a result. The format itself was later picked up by ABC, after Stiles introduced Whose Line to Drew Carey, who subsequently pitched an American version of the same name to the TV network with great success. On 6 March 2011, over twelve years after the series finale, a special edition of the show was recorded for \\"24 Hour Panel People\\", a marathon of UK panel shows, in aid of Comic Relief. The recording was broadcast live on the Comic Relief website at about 9:30am, while the edited compilation shows for the event were shown between 13‚Äì17 March on BBC Three. Alongside Anderson hosting the show, the format was adjusted to feature five performers, and featured performances by Humphrey Ker, Josie Lawrence, Neil Mullarkey, Tony Slattery and David Walliams. In 2017, a stage-version of the show appeared at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with some members of the original cast. The initial shows were a sell-out and extra dates and shows were put on. Sell-out runs followed at the London Palladium and The Royal Albert Hall. In April 2019, it was announced that the stage-version of the show would be returning to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, with Tony Slattery returning as one of the original cast members.  Format  Most television episodes of Whose Line Is It Anyway? featured four performers (with an exception of six in a 1989 Christmas special) who sit in a line of chairs at the back of the stage. The host sat at a desk facing the large performance area in front of the performers. The host introduced each performer with a joke or pun, usually all related on a common theme or topic. The show is made up of games that are scored by the host, who declared arbitrary point values after the game, often citing a humorous reason for his decision. The points are purely decorative, served no practical purpose, and were often awarded to audience members or other arbitrary third persons. The style of the games are varied (see Games, below). Some feature all four performers, while others feature fewer. The performers who are not involved in a game remain in their seats at the back of the stage. Humorous banter between the host and the performers between games is also sometimes featured. At the conclusion of each episode, a winner or several winners are chosen arbitrarily by the host. The \\"prize\\" for winning the show is to read the credits in a certain style, chosen by the host, as they scrolled. Episodes were culled down from longer recording sessions with the best game performances chosen to compile into one or more episodes. Each series includes one or two compilation shows of unaired games from different taping sessions in that series. = Games = The number and type of games played vary from episode to episode, and whilst some games such as \\"Questions Only\\" and \\"Hoedown\\" became more common over time, others such as \\"Authors\\" and \\"Remote Control\\" faded from use. New games were created throughout the show's run. Some games, such as \\"Tag,\\" are based on traditional improv games, while others are uniquely created for the series. Most games consist of a single long skit performed by the chosen performers, but some, such as \\"World's Worst\\" and \\"Scenes from a Hat,\\" are played as a rapid-fire series of short skits. While all games are designed to test the performer's improvisational skill, some also test other skills, such as singing or doing impressions. Whose Line? features a number of musical games, which feature one or more of the show's resident musicians playing live backing music. Occasionally, pre-recorded music is also used. While they were good sports about it, many of the performers despised the musical games. In one episode, Stephen Fry is asked to perform a rap, and starts to do so halfheartedly, but gives up after a few words, and Ryan Stiles would frequently inject insults into the Hoedown whenever he is forced to sing it, usually pointed at the host or the Hoedown itself. Colin Mochrie would generally speak his lines instead of singing them for musical games. Some games require suggestions or topics. Depending on the game, these may be solicited directly from the studio audience during the taping, or written down by the audience and/or production staff in advance and then randomly drawn for the performers' use. The host uses a buzzer to signal the end of a game, or of individual sections in the rapid-fire games. Episodes Performers  The original BBC Radio 4 broadcasts consists of host Clive Anderson along with two guests and the two regular contestants, Stephen Fry and John Sessions. Clive Anderson stayed on as host when the show moved to television, with John Sessions resuming his role as the only regular in the first series. He subsequently became a rotating regular in the second and third series. However he appears only twice in the third series, these being his final appearances. Stephen Fry appears only occasionally on the television series. Ryan Stiles and Colin Mochrie first appear in the second and third series respectively; they each gradually increase the frequency of their appearances to the point that both appear in every episode from the eighth series on. Stiles is the most prolific performer on the show, having appeared in 92 of the series' 136 episodes (including compilations). Wayne Brady, who became a regular on the US version, appears in the final UK series for five episodes, including compilations. Many of the show's performers, including Paul Merton, Josie Lawrence and Sandi Toksvig, were regulars with The Comedy Store Players, an improvisational group based at London's Comedy Store. Other regular performers from the British version include a variety of British, American, and Canadian comedians such as Greg Proops, Tony Slattery, Mike McShane, Stephen Frost, Brad Sherwood, Chip Esten and Jim Sweeney. The series also occasionally features celebrities in the fourth chair, such as Peter Cook, George Wendt, and Jonathan Pryce. On the original BBC Radio series, the music was provided by Colin Sell, but when the show migrated to television, Richard Vranch (also of The Comedy Store Players) became the resident musician until the last series of the British show, playing electric guitar and piano and other instruments. For the tenth series in Hollywood, Laura Hall took over, playing mainly keyboards, and went on to be the in-house musician for the American series.  DVD release  The first release of the UK show, featuring the first two series, was released on DVD in America on 27 March 2007 by A&E; Home Entertainment, and in the UK on 25 January 2008 by Channel 4. The UK edition is edited to remove references to the ad breaks. Also, British episodes were released on VHS (in the UK only) in the mid-1990s. Additionally, a play-at-home book was printed in 1989, related to the British series. Almost all of the UK versions (135 of 136 episodes) of Whose Line Is It Anyway? are available for free to those living in the UK on All 4.

Bos can be divided into four subgenera: Bos, Bibos, Novibos, and Poephagus, but including these last three divisions within the genus Bos without including Bison in the genus is believed to be paraphyletic by many workers on the classification of the genus since the 1980s. The genus has five extant species. However, this may rise to eight if the domesticated varieties are counted as separate species, and ten if the closely related genus Bison is also included.Groves, C. P., 1981.

(online edition ) Most modern breeds of domesticated cattle are believed to have originated from the extinct aurochs.Briggs, H.M. and Briggs, D.M. (1980). Modern Breeds of Livestock. Macmillan Publishing Description The species are grazers, with large teeth to break up the plant material they ingest. They are ruminants, having a four-chambered stomach that allows them to break down plant material. Distribution There are about 1.3 billion domestic cattle alive today, making them one of the world's most numerous mammals. Members of this genus are currently found in Africa, Asia, eastern and western Europe, parts of North America, South America and also in Oceania. Their habitats vary greatly depending on the particular species; they can be found in prairies, rain forests, wetlands, savannah and temperate forests. Ecology Most Bos species have a lifespan of 18‚Äì25 years in the wild, with up to 36 being recorded in captivity. They have a 9‚Äì11 month gestation, depending on the species and birth one or, rarely, two young in the spring. Most species travel in small herds ranging in size from ten to thirty members. Within most herds, there is one bull (male) for all the cows (female). Dominance is important in the herds; calves will usually inherit their mother's position in the hierarchy. They are generally diurnal, resting in the hot part of the day and being active morning and afternoon. In areas where humans have encroached on the territory of a herd, they may turn nocturnal. Some species are also migratory, moving with food and water availability. Taxonomy In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature resolved a long-standing dispute about the naming of those species (or pairs of species) of Bos that contain both wild and domesticated forms. The commission \\"conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms\\", confirming Bos primigenius for the aurochs and Bos gaurus for the gaur. If domesticated cattle and gayal are considered separate species, they are to be named Bos taurus and Bos frontalis; however, if they are considered part of the same species as their wild relatives, the common species are to be named Bos primigenius and Bos gaurus.International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. 2003.

It lies between the Eastern Scheldt in the north and the Western Scheldt in the south and is roughly the shape of a rhombus. The two sides facing the North Sea consist of dunes and the rest of its coastline is made up of dykes. Middelburg, the provincial capital, lies at Walcheren's center. Vlissingen, to the south, is the main harbour and the third municipality is Veere. Originally, Walcheren was an island, but polders and the Oosterscheldekering across the Eastern Scheldt have connected it to the (former) island of Zuid-Beveland, which in turn has been connected to the North Brabant mainland. History =Early history= As early as Roman times, the island functioned as a point of departure for ships going to Britain; it had a temple of the goddess Nehalennia who was popular with those who braved the waters of the North Sea. The Romans called it \\"Wallacra\\", a term most likely associated with Walhaz, the name Germans used for Romans. Walcheren became the seat of the Danish Viking Harald (fl. 841-842), who conquered what would become the Netherlands together with his brother Rorik (fl. 842-873) (or Rurik) in the ninth century. One fringe theory has it that Ahmad ibn Rustah (fl. 10th century) described Walcheren when reporting on the seat of the Rus' Khaganate. Another fringe theory mentions Walcheren as the seat of Hades, described by Homer. Geography of the Odyssey according to I. Wilkens =Treaty of Dover= Under the Secret Treaty of Dover, concluded in 1670 between Charles II of England and Louis XIV of France, England was supposed to get possession of Walcheren as well as the isle of Cadzand, as the reward for helping France in the then impending war against the Dutch Republic. In the event, the Dutch resistance - much stronger than anticipated - managed to repulse the French-English attack, and the treaty was not implemented. =Napoleonic Wars= Starting on 30 July 1809, a British armed force of 39,000 men landed on Walcheren, the Walcheren Campaign, with a view to assisting the Austrians in their war against Napoleon, and attacking the French fleet moored at Flushing (Vlissingen). The expedition turned into a disaster ‚Äì although Flushing surrendered the Austrians had already been decisively defeated at the Battle of Wagram in early July and were suing for peace. Meanwhile, the French fleet had moved to Antwerp, and the British lost over 4,000 men to a disease called \\"Walcheren Fever\\", thought to be a combination of malaria and typhus, as well as to enemy action. The French suffered some 4000 dead, wounded and captured. With the strategic reasons for the campaign gone and the worsening conditions, the British force was withdrawn in December. =World War II= Strategically situated at the mouth of the River Scheldt, Walcheren was the key that allowed use of the deep-water port of Antwerp, located further upstream on the right bank of the southern estuary of the river. It was fought over during World War II in 1940 between Dutch and German troops in the Battle of the Netherlands, and again in 1944 in the Battle of Walcheren Causeway, the fourth and final stage of the Battle of the Scheldt. On 3 October 1944 the RAF bombed the sea wall at Westkapelle causing the Inundation of Walcheren. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division cleared South Beveland to the east and approached the island on 31 October 1944. The plan was to cross the Sloe Channel, but leading troops of the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade found that assault boats were useless in the deep mud of the channel. The only route open was the 40 metre wide Walcheren Causeway, a mile-long land bridge from South Beveland to the island. The Canadian Black Watch sent a company across on the evening of 31 October, but was stopped. The Calgary Highlanders sent two companies over in succession, the second attack opening up a bridgehead on the island. The Highlanders were eventually thrown back, having lost 64 killed and wounded. Le R√©giment de Maisonneuve relieved them on the causeway, followed by the 1st Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders of the British 52nd Infantry Division. Meanwhile, on 1 November 1944, British Commandos landed in the village of Westkapelle in order to silence the German coastal batteries looking out over the Scheldt. The amphibious assault (Operation Infatuate) proved a success and by 8 November, all German resistance on the island had ceased. Topography 550px Topographic map of Walcheren, 2010-2011.

Folk etymology connects it with \\"cape.\\" According to Pinoteau, the name \\"Capet\\" was first attributed to the dynasty by Ralph de Diceto writing in London in 1200, maybe because of the position of the early kings as lay abbots of St Martin of Tours, where part of the \\"cappa\\" of the saint was allegedly conserved. Other suggested etymologies derive it from terms for chief, mocker or big head. His father's byname is presumed to have been retrospective, meaning Hugh the Elder, this Hugh being Hugh the Younger, Capet being a 12th-century addition.

Through his mother, Hugh was the nephew of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor; Henry I, Duke of Bavaria; Bruno the Great, Archbishop of Cologne; and finally, Gerberga of Saxony, Queen of France. Gerberga was the wife of Louis IV, King of France and mother of Lothair of France and Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine. His paternal family, the Robertians, were powerful landowners in the √éle-de-France.Jim Bradbury, The Capetians: Kings of France, 987‚Äì1328, (London: Hambledon Continuum, 2007), p. 69 His grandfather had been King Robert I. King Odo was his granduncle and Emma of France, the wife of King Rudolph, was his aunt.Pierre Rich√©, The Carolingians; A Family Who Forged Europe, trans. Michael Idomir Allen (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), p. 371 Hugh's paternal grandmother Beatrice of Vermandois was a patrilineal descendant of Charlemagne.Pierre Rich√©, The Carolingians; A Family Who Forged Europe, trans. Michael Idomir Allen (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), pp. 371, 375 Rise of the Robertians After the end of the ninth century, the descendants of Robert the Strong became indispensable in carrying out royal policies. As Carolingian power failed, the great nobles of West Francia began to assert that the monarchy was elective, not hereditary, and twice chose Robertians (Odo I (888‚Äì898) and Robert I (922‚Äì923)) as kings, instead of Carolingians. Robert I, Hugh the Great's father, was succeeded as King of the Franks by his son-in-law, Rudolph of Burgundy. When Rudolph died in 936, Hugh the Great had to decide whether he ought to claim the throne for himself. To claim the throne would require him to risk an election, which he would have to contest with the powerful Herbert II, Count of Vermandois, father of Hugh, Archbishop of Reims, and allied to Henry the Fowler, King of Germany; and with Hugh the Black, Duke of Burgundy, brother of the late king. To block his rivals,James, pp 183‚Äì184; Theis, pp 65‚Äì66. Hugh the Great brought Louis d'Outremer, the dispossessed son of Charles the Simple, from his exile at the court of Athelstan of England to become king as Louis IV.Fanning, Steven; Bachrach, Bernard S. (eds & trans.) The Annals of Flodoard of Reims, 916‚Äì966 (New York; Ontario, Can: University of Toronto Press, 2011), p. 28 This maneuver allowed Hugh to become the most powerful person in France in the first half of the tenth century. Once in power, Louis IV granted him the title of dux Francorum (\\"Duke of the Franks\\"). Louis also (perhaps under pressure) officially declared Hugh \\"the second after us in all our kingdoms\\". Hugh also gained power when Herbert II of Vermandois died in 943, because Herbert's powerful principality was then divided among his four sons. Hugh the Great came to dominate a wide swath of central France, from Orl√©ans and Senlis to Auxerre and Sens, while the king was rather confined to the area northeast of Paris (Compi√®gne, Laon, Soissons). French monarchy in the 10th century denier of Hugh Capet when he was Duke of France, calling him \\"duke by the grace of God\\" (Dux Dei Gratia). Minted at Paris (Parisi Civita) The realm in which Hugh grew up, and of which he would one day be king, bore little resemblance to modern France. Hugh's predecessors did not call themselves kings of France, and that title was not used by his successors until the time of his descendant Philip II. Kings ruled as rex Francorum (\\"King of the Franks\\"), the title remaining in use until 1190 (but note the use of FRANCORUM REX by Louis XII in 1499, by Francis I in 1515, and by Henry II about 1550, and on French coins up to the eighteenth century.) The lands they ruled comprised only a small part of the former Carolingian Empire. The eastern Frankish lands, the Holy Roman Empire, were ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, represented by Hugh's first cousin Otto II and then by Otto's son, Otto III. The lands south of the river Loire had largely ceased to be part of the West Francia kingdom in the years after Charles the Simple was deposed in 922. Both the Duchy of Normandy and the Duchy of Burgundy were largely independent, and Brittany entirely soalthough from 956 Burgundy was ruled by Hugh's brothers Otto and Henry.James, pp. iii, 182‚Äì183; Gauvard, pp. 163‚Äì168; Rich√©, pp. 285 ff. France under Ottonian influence In 956, when his father Hugh the Great died, Hugh, the eldest son, was then about fifteen years old and had two younger brothers. Otto I, King of Germany, intended to bring western Francia under his control, which was possible since he was the maternal uncle of Hugh Capet and Lothair of France, the new king of the Franks, who succeeded Louis IV in 954, at the age of 13. In 954, Otto I appointed his brother Bruno, Archbishop of Cologne and Duke of Lorraine, as guardian of Lothair and regent of the kingdom of France. In 956, Otto gave him the same role over Hugh and the Robertian principality. With these young princes under his control, Otto aimed to maintain the balance between Robertians, Carolingians, and Ottonians. In 960, Lothair agreed to grant to Hugh the legacy of his father, the margraviate of Neustria and the title of Duke of the Franks. But in return, Hugh had to accept the new independence gained by the counts of Neustria during Hugh's minority. Hugh's brother, Otto received only the duchy of Burgundy (by marriage). Andrew W. Lewis has sought to show that Hugh the Great had prepared a succession policy to ensure his eldest son much of his legacy, as did all the great families of that time. The West was dominated by Otto I, who had defeated the Magyars in 955, and in 962 assumed the restored imperial title. The new emperor increased his power over Western Francia with special attention to certain bishoprics on his border; although elected by Lothair, Adalberon, Archbishop of Reims, had imperial sympathies. Disappointed, King Lothair relied on other dioceses (Langres, Chalons, Noyon) and on Arnulf I, Count of Flanders. Duke of the Franks In 956, Hugh inherited his father's estates, in theory making him one of the most powerful nobles in the much- reduced kingdom of West Francia.Pierre Rich√©, The Carolingians; A Family Who Forged Europe, trans. Michael Idomir Allen (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), p. 264 As he was not yet an adult, his mother acted as his guardian,Jules Michelet, History of France, Vol. I, trans. G. H. Smith (New York: D. Appleton, 1882), p. 146 and young Hugh's neighbours took advantage. Theobald I of Blois, a former vassal of Hugh's father, took the counties of Chartres and Ch√¢teaudun. Further south, on the border of the kingdom, Fulk II of Anjou, another former client of Hugh the Great, carved out a principality at Hugh's expense and that of the Bretons.Theis, pp. 69‚Äì70. The royal diplomas of the 960s show that the nobles were faithful not only to the Duke of the Franks, as in the days of Hugh the Great, but also to King Lothair. Indeed, some in the royal armies fought against the Duchy of Normandy on behalf of Lothair. Finally, even Hugh's position as second man in the kingdom seemed to slip. Two charters of the Montier-en-Der Abbey (968 and 980) refer to Herbert III, Count of Vermandois, while Count of Chateau-Thierry, Vitry and lay abbot of Saint-M√©dard of Soissons, bearing the title of \\"Count of the Franks\\" and even \\"count of the palace\\" in a charter of Lothair. For his part, Lothair also lost power with the ascendance of the Ottonian monarchy. It waned by participating in the gathering of relatives and vassals of Otto I in 965. However, from the death of the emperor in 973, Lothair wanted to revive the policy of his grandfather to recover Lorraine, \\"cradle of Carolingians\\". Otto's son and successor, Otto II, appointed his cousin, Charles, brother of Lothair, as Duke of Lower Lorraine, to the king's fury, who was at enmity with his brother. During the summer of 978, he decided to take action. In August 978, accompanied by the nobles of the kingdom, Lothair surprised and plundered Aachen, residence of Otto II, forcing the imperial family to flee. After occupying Aachen for five days, Lothair returned to France after symbolically disgracing the city. In September 978, Otto II retaliated against Lothair by invading France with the aid of Charles. He met with little resistance on French territory, devastating the land around Rheims, Soissons, and Laon. Otto II then had Charles crowned as King of France by Theodoric I, Bishop of Metz. Lothair then fled to the French capital of Paris where he was besieged by Otto II and Charles. Sickness among his troops brought on by winter, and a French relief army under Hugh Capet, forced Otto II and Charles to lift the siege on November 30 and return to Germany. On the journey back to Germany, Otto's rearguard, unable to cross the Aisne in flood at Soissons, was completely wiped out, \\"and more died by that wave than by the sword.\\" This victory allowed Hugh Capet to regain his position as the first noble of the Frankish kingdom. Archbishop of Reims Until the end of the tenth century, Reims was the most important of the archiepiscopal seats of France. Situated in Carolingian lands, the archbishop claimed the primacy of Gaul and the privilege to crown kings and direct their chancery. Therefore, the Archbishop of Reims traditionally had supported the ruling family and had long been central to the royal policy. But the episcopal city was headed by Adalberon of Rheims, nephew of Adalberon of Metz (a faithful prelate to the Carolingians), elected by the King Lothair in 969, but who had family ties to the Ottonians. The Archbishop was assisted by one of the most advanced minds of his time, the schoolmaster and future Pope, Gerbert of Aurillac. Adalberon and Gerbert worked for the restoration of a single dominant empire in Europe. King Lothair, 13 years old, was under the tutelage of his uncle Otto I. But upon reaching his majority, he became independent, which defeated their plans to bring the whole of Europe under a single crown. Therefore, they turned their support from Lothair to Hugh Capet. Indeed, for the Ottonian to make France a vassal state of the empire, it was imperative that the Frankish king was not of the Carolingian race, and not powerful enough to break the Ottonian tutelage. Hugh Capet was for them the ideal candidate, especially since he actively supported monastic reform in the abbeys while other contenders continued to distribute church revenues to their own partisans. Such conduct could only appeal to Reims, who was very close to the Cluniac movement. Failure of Lothair With the support of Adalberon of Reims, Hugh became the new leader of the kingdom. In a letter Gerbert of Aurillac wrote to Archbishop Adalberon that \\"Lothair is king of France in name alone; Hugh is, however, not in name but in effect and deed.\\" In 979, Lothair sought to ensure his succession by associating his eldest son with the throne. Hugh Capet supported him and summoned the great nobles of the kingdom. The ceremony took place at Compi√®gne, in the presence of the king, of Arnulf (an illegitimate son of the king), and of Archbishop Adalberon, under Hugh's blessing. The congregation acclaimed Louis V, following the Carolingian custom, and the archbishop anointed the new king of the Franks. The following year, Lothair, seeing the growing power of Hugh, decided to reconcile with the Emperor Otto II by agreeing to renounce Lorraine. But Hugh did not want the king and the emperor reconciled, so he quickly took the fortress of Montreuil, and then went to Rome. There he met the emperor and the pope, with his confidants Bouchard of Vend√¥me and Arnulf of Orl√©ans. Tension mounted between Lothair and Hugh. The king married his 15-year-old son Louis to Adelaide of Anjou, who was then more than 40 years old. She brought with her Auvergne and the county of Toulouse, enough to pincer the Robertian territories from the south. However, the marriage failed and the couple separated two years later. At the death of Otto II in 983, Lothair took advantage of the minority of Otto III and, after making an alliance with the Duke of Bavaria, decided to attack Lorraine. Hugh was careful not to join this expedition. When the king took Verdun and imprisoned Godfrey (brother of the Archbishop of Reims), Adalberon and Gerbert sought the aid of the duke of the Franks. But the king's enterprises came to naught when he died in March 986. Election France under Hugh Capet Louis V, following Louis IV and Lothair, declared that he would take the counsels of the duke of the Franks for his policies. It seems the new king wished to launch an offensive against Reims and Laon because of their rapprochement with the empire. Sources are vague on Hugh's role at this time, but it would be his interest to limit the king's excessive pretensions. Louis summoned the archbishop of Reims at his palace at Compi√®gne to answer for his actions. But while hunting in the forest of Senlis, the king was killed in a riding accident on 21 or 22 May 987. In May 987, chroniclers, including Richerus and Gerbert of Aurillac, wrote that in Senlis \\"died the race of Charles\\". However, even if Louis died childless, there remained a Carolingian who could ascend the throne: Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, brother of Lothair, uncle of Louis V, first cousin of Hugh Capet through their mothers. This was nothing extraordinary; it was not the first time that a Robertian would be competing with a Carolingian. In the time of Hugh the Great, the Robertians found it expedient to support the claim of a Carolingian. By 987, however, times had changed. For ten years, Hugh Capet had been openly competing against his king, and appeared to have subjected the great vassals. And his opponent Charles of Lorraine was accused of all evils: he wanted to usurp the crown (978), had allied himself with the emperor against his brother, and had defamed Queen Emma of Italy, his brother's wife. The archbishop of Reims convened the greatest lords of France at Senlis and denounced Charles of Lorraine for not maintaining his dignity, having made himself a vassal of the emperor Otto II and marrying a woman from a lower class of nobility. Then he promoted the candidacy of Hugh Capet: > Crown the Duke. He is most illustrious by his exploits, his nobility, his > forces. The throne is not acquired by hereditary right; no one should be > raised to it unless distinguished not only for nobility of birth, but for > the goodness of his soul.Harriet Harvey Wood, The Battle of Hastings: The > Fall of Anglo-Saxon England, Atlantic, 2008, p. 46 Hugh was elected and crowned rex Francorum at Noyon in Picardy on 3 July 987, by the prelate of Reims, the first of the Capetian house. Immediately after his coronation, Hugh began to push for the coronation of his son Robert. The archbishop, wary of establishing hereditary kingship in the Capetian line, answered that two kings cannot be created in the same year. Hugh claimed, however, that he was planning an expedition against the Moorish armies harassing Borrel II, Count of Barcelona (a vassal of the French crown), and that the stability of the country necessitated two kings should he die while on expedition.Lewis, 908. Ralph Glaber, however, attributes Hugh's request to his old age and inability to control the nobility.Lewis, 914. Modern scholarship has largely imputed to Hugh the motive of establishing a dynasty against the pretension of electoral power on the part of the aristocracy, but this is not the typical view of contemporaries and even some modern scholars have been less skeptical of Hugh's \\"plan\\" to campaign in Spain. Robert was eventually crowned on 25 December that same year. Charles of Lorraine Charles of Lorraine, the Carolingian heir, contested the succession. He drew support from the Count of Vermandois, a cadet of the Carolingian dynasty; and from the Count of Flanders, loyal to the Carolingian cause. Charles took Laon, the seat of Carolingian royalty. Hugh Capet and his son Robert besieged the city twice, but were compelled to withdraw each time. Hugh decided to make an alliance with Theopano (regent for her son Otto III), but she never replied. When Adalberon, Archbishop of Reims, died, the archbishopric was contested by his right-hand man, Gerbert of Aurillac, and Arnulf, illegitimate son of King Lothair of France (and nephew of Charles of Lorraine). Choosing Arnulf to replace Adalberon seemed a great gamble, but Hugh made it anyway, and chose him as archbishop instead of Gerbert, in order to appease Carolingian sympathizers and the local populace. Following the customs of those times, he was made to invoke a curse upon himself if he should break his oath of fidelity to Hugh. Arnulf was duly installed, and was confirmed by the pope. Yet to Arnulf the ties of blood with his uncle Charles was the stronger than the oath he had given Hugh. Gathering the nobles in his castle, Arnulf sent one of his agents and opened the gates of the city to Charles. Arnulf acted as if terrified, and took the nobles with him to a tower, which he had emptied out of supplies beforehand. Thus was the city of Reims compelled to surrender; to keep up appearances, Arnulf and Charles denounced each other, until Arnulf swore fealty to Charles. Great was the predicament of Hugh, and he began doubting whether he could win the contest by force. Adalberon, bishop of Laon, whom Charles expelled when he took the city, had sought the protection of Hugh Capet. The bishop made overtures to Arnulf and Charles, to mediate a peace between them and Hugh Capet. Adalberon was received by Charles favorably, but was made to swear oaths that would bring curses upon himself if broken. Adalberon swore to them all, \\"I will observe my oaths, and if not, may I die the death of Judas.\\" That night the bishop seized Charles and Arnulf in their sleep, and delivered them to Hugh. Charles was imprisoned in Orl√©ans until his death. His sons, born in prison, were released. Reaction in the south This betrayal, which occurs in the very movement of the Peace of God (the council of Charroux, 989), strongly strikes the imagination in the southern half of the kingdom: Adalberon is totally discredited in these provinces and the image of Hugh Capet is tarnished. The ruthless war against Charles of Lorraine in Laon and Reims (988‚Äì991), known by the story of Richerus of Reims and the letters of Gerbert, made the king hostile in the eyes of some of the churchmen. For a long time it was stated that the southern subjects had consistently rejected the first Capetian. Recently, studies have issued nuances. It seems that the rejection is political (the capture of Charles of Lorraine) rather than dynastic. The Duke of Aquitaine refuses to submit to his king, \\"condemning the crime of the Franks [the capture of Charles]\\" and the Bishop of Laon is compared to Judas the \\"traitor\\". Finally, they make peace on the banks of the Loire. This remark is even more explicit in the city of Limoges. Acts say that until 988, Hugh and his son Robert were recognized by the date of their reign \\"regnante Ugo rege anno II et Rotberto filio suo anno primo\\" (\\"signed the second year of the reign of King Hugh and the first of his son Robert\\"). But a few months later, the charters are not dated by their reigns: it seems that the change is due to the knowledge of the capture of Charles of Lorraine and the betrayal of Adalberon, bishop of Laon. Once made aware, the southern cities would have rejected the legitimacy of Hugh and Robert. Dispute with the papacy After the loss of Reims by the betrayal of Arnulf, Hugh demanded his deposition by Pope John XV. But the pope was then embroiled in a conflict with the Roman aristocracy. After the capture of Charles and Arnulf, Hugh resorted to a domestic tribunal, and convoked a synod at Reims in June 991. There, Gerbert testified against Arnulf, which led to the archbishop's deposition and Gerbert being chosen as replacement. Pope John XV rejected this procedure and wished to convene a new council in Aachen, but the French bishops refused and confirmed their decision in Chelles (winter 993‚Äì994). The pope then called them to Rome, but they protested that the unsettled conditions en route and in Rome made that impossible. The Pope then sent a legate with instructions to call a council of French and German bishops at Mousson, where only the German bishops appeared, the French being stopped on the way by Hugh and Robert. Gerbert, supported by other bishops, advocates for the independence of the churches vis-√†-vis Rome (which is controlled by the German emperors). Through the exertions of the legate, the deposition of Arnulf was finally pronounced illegal. To avoid excommunication of the bishops who sat in the council of St. Basle, and thus a schism, Gerbert decided to let go. He abandoned the archdiocese and went to Italy. After Hugh's death, Arnulf was released from his imprisonment and soon restored to all his dignities. Under the auspices of the emperor, Gerbert eventually succeeded to the papacy as Pope Sylvester II, the first French pope. Extent of power Denier of Hugh Capet for Beauvais Hugh Capet possessed minor properties near Chartres and Angers. Between Paris and Orl√©ans he possessed towns and estates amounting to approximately . His authority ended there, and if he dared travel outside his small area, he risked being captured and held for ransom, though his life would be largely safe. Indeed, there was a plot in 993, masterminded by Adalberon, Bishop of Laon and Odo I of Blois, to deliver Hugh Capet into the custody of Otto III. The plot failed, but the fact that no one was punished illustrates how tenuous his hold on power was. Beyond his power base, in the rest of France, there were still as many codes of law as there were fiefdoms. The \\"country\\" operated with 150 different forms of currency and at least a dozen languages. Uniting all this into one cohesive unit was a formidable task and a constant struggle between those who wore the crown of France and its feudal lords. Therefore, Hugh Capet's reign was marked by numerous power struggles with the vassals on the borders of the Seine and the Loire. While Hugh Capet's military power was limited and he had to seek military aid from Richard I of Normandy, his unanimous election as king gave him great moral authority and influence. Ad√©mar de Chabannes records, probably apocryphally, that during an argument with the Count of Auvergne, Hugh demanded of him: \\"Who made you count?\\" The count riposted: \\"Who made you king?\\". Richard Landes, \\"L'accession des Cap√©tiens: une reconsid√©ration selon les sources aquitaines\\", in Religion et culture autour de l'an Mil. Royaume cap√©tien et Lotharingie: actes du Colloque Hugues Capet, 987-1987, la France de l'an mil, Auxerre, 26 et 27 juin 1987 ; Metz, 11 et 12 septembre 1987, Paris: Picard, 1990, , pp. 153-154. Legacy Hugh Capet died on 14 October 996 in Paris, and was interred in the Saint Denis Basilica. His son Robert continued to reign. Most historians regard the beginnings of modern France as having initiated with the coronation of Hugh Capet. This is because, as Count of Paris, he made the city his power centre. The monarch began a long process of exerting control of the rest of the country from there. He is regarded as the founder of the Capetian dynasty. The direct Capetians, or the House of Capet, ruled France from 987 to 1328; thereafter, the Kingdom was ruled by cadet branches of the dynasty. All French kings through Louis Philippe, and all royals since then, have belonged to the dynasty. Furthermore, cadet branches of the House continue to reign in Spain and Luxembourg. All monarchs of the Kingdom of France from Hugh Capet to Philip II of France were titled 'King of the Franks'. Philip II was the first to use the title 'King of France'. Marriage and issue Hugh Capet married Adelaide, daughter of William Towhead, Count of Poitou. Their children are as follows: * Gisela, or Gisele, who married Hugh I, Count of Ponthieu * Hedwig, or Hathui, who married Reginar IV, Count of Hainaut * Robert II, who became king after the death of his father A number of other daughters are less reliably attested.Thus Gauvard, p. 531. Prophecy Apparition of Saint Valery to Hugh Capet According to tradition, sometime in 981, Hugh Capet recovered the relics of St. Valery, which had been stolen by the Flemings, and restored it to the proper resting place. The saint appeared to the duke in a dream, and said: \\"For what you have done, you and your descendants shall be kings to the seventh generation\\". When he became king, Hugh refused to wear the insignia of royalty, hoping that it would extend his descendants' reign by one generation. By the literal interpretation, Capetian kingship would thus have ended with Philip Augustus, the seventh king of his line. Figuratively, seven meant completeness, and would mean that the Capetians would be kings for ever. In fact, Capetian kingship lasted until 1848 in France, although the current King of Spain and Grand Duke of Luxembourg are Capetians. Hugh Capet in literature Hugh Capet is encountered in the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri (c.1265-1321); the poet places him on the fifth terrace of Mount Purgatory (Purgatorio, Canto XX) among sinners performing penitence for avarice.

Houdon is famous for his portrait busts and statues of philosophers, inventors and political figures of the Enlightenment. Houdon's subjects included Denis Diderot (1771), Benjamin Franklin (1778-1809), Jean- Jacques Rousseau (1778), Voltaire (1781), Moli√®re (1781), George Washington (1785‚Äì1788), Thomas Jefferson (1789), Louis XVI (1790), Robert Fulton, (1803‚Äì04), and Napol√©on Bonaparte (1806). Biography Jean-Antoine Houdon at work in his atelier, 1804, by Louis-L√©opold Boilly, Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris. He was born in Versailles, on 25 March 1741. In 1752, he entered the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture, where he studied with Ren√©-Michel Slodtz, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, and Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. From 1761 to 1764, he studied at the √âcole royale des √©l√®ves prot√©g√©s. Houdon won the Prix de Rome in 1761, but was not greatly influenced by ancient and Renaissance art in Rome. His stay in the city is marked by two characteristic and important productions: the superb √©corch√© (1767), an anatomical model which has served as a guide to all artists since his day, and the statue of Saint Bruno in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome. After ten years stay in Italy, Houdon returned to Paris. He submitted Morpheus to the Salon of 1771. He developed his practise of portrait busts. He became a member of the Acad√©mie de peinture et de sculpture in 1771, and a professor in 1778. In 1778, he modeled Voltaire, producing a portrait bust with wig for the Com√©die- Fran√ßaise; one for the Palace of Versailles, and one for Catherine the Great. In 1778, he joined the masonic lodge Les Neuf S≈ìurs, where he later met Benjamin Franklin, and John Paul Jones. For Salon of 1781, he submitted a Diana which was refused without drapery. Houdon's portrait sculpture of Washington was the result of a specific invitation by Benjamin Franklin to cross the Atlantic in 1785, specifically to visit Mount Vernon, so that Washington could model for him. Washington sat for wet clay life models and a plaster life mask. These models served for many commissions of Washington, including the standing figure commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly, for the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond. Numerous variations of the Washington bust were produced, portraying him variously as a general in uniform, in the classical manner showing chest musculature, and as Roman Consul Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus clad in a toga. A cast of the latter is located in the Vermont State House. In the 1780s Houdon produced two semi-nude sculptures, Winter and Bather. Perceived as bourgeois for his connections to the court of Louis XVI, he fell out of favour during the French Revolution, although he escaped imprisonment. Houdon returned to favor during the French Consulate and Empire, being taken on as one of the original artistic team for what became the Column of the Grande Arm√©e at Wimille. He was made a Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur, on 17 December 1804. Houdon died in Paris on 15 July 1828, and was interred at the Cimeti√®re du Montparnasse. Family On 1 July 1786, he married Marie-Ange-Cecile Langlois; they had three daughters: Sabine, Anne-Ange, and Claudine. Legacy and influence American Bank Note CoIssue of 1890 Houdon's sculptures were used as models for the engravings used on various U.S. postage stamps of the late 19th and early 20th centuries which depict Washington in profile.Smithsonian National Postal Museum Gallery File:Bust of the Marquis de Miromesnil, 1775 CE.

F√©lix Mayol (18 November 1872 ‚Äì 26 October 1941) was a French singer and entertainer. Career Mayol was born in Toulon, France. His parents were both amateur singers and actors, who arranged for Felix to make his debut stage at six years of age. In 1895 he went to Paris and the Montparnasse Quarter where he began a career in entertainment that spanned more than forty years. He adopted a camp and effeminate manner on stage as part of his theatrical persona.Michael Freedland, Maurice Chevalier, Morrow, 1981, p.28. He sang the famous song \\"Viens poupoule, viens poupoule, viens...\\", and performed many songs by Th√©odore Botrel. In the early years of the 20th century some of Mayol's performances were captured by an early form of talking picture. He would record his voice, then the motion picture camera would film him as he lip-synced to the record. Several of his Phonosc√®nes exist. Other activities The teenage Maurice Chevalier took a risk by impersonating Mayol in small-time cafe entertainments,Hugh MacDiarmid, Selected essays of Hugh MacDiarmid, University of California Pres, 1970, p.106. Mayol recognised the young man's talent and gave him his blessing. It led Chevalier to the Casino de Paris and the Folies Berg√®re. Shortly after World War I, he purchased a plot of land in Toulon and donated it to the local sports club, RC Toulonnais, for the building of a stadium. The facility, named Stade Mayol in his honor, remains in use today (after several renovations) as the home ground for the Toulon rugby team. Personal life Mayol never married, and many stories circulated of his homosexual liaisons, including an attempt to seduce Maurice Chevalier. His brother Charles Mayol founded a music publishing company to print his works.

Early life Louise Marie Damien was born on 5 December 1889 to Marie Jos√©phine Louise (n√©e Claude) and Nicolas Damien on rue Jeanne d‚ÄôArc in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. Her father was a police sergeant in Lorraine and she was raised in a family of eight siblings. Running away from home after being sent to a reform school, Damien arrived in Paris when she was fifteen. Career Damien initially worked as a model and actress playing bit parts with the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet, but by 1909 was performing as a dancer, using the stage name Marise Damia, with Max Dearly in London. After returning from London, she was encouraged to sing by the impresario Robert Hollard, who used the stage name \\"Roberty\\". Hollard was the husband of the singer, Fr√©hel, at the time and his affair with Damia ended his stormy marriage. Her singing debut occurred in 1911 at the P√©pini√®re and was followed by a performance at the Alhambra, which was arranged by Harry Fragson. He also arranged for her to perform at the Alcazar d'√ât√©, where she worked with Maurice Chevalier. When Fragson was murdered by his father, Damia left France in 1913 and went to the United States. Performing on Broadway until 1916, she returned to France and during the remainder of the war sang on the war front. Felix Mayol and Loie Fuller After being seen by F√©lix Mayol, one of the leading male singing stars at the time, he hired her to perform at his concerts. Despite this, her career evolved slowly, taking second billing for a number of years but with help in her stage presentation from the American dancer, Loie Fuller, she eventually became a singing star. At the beginning of World War I she opened Le Concert Damia, in Montmartre, where she became the first star ever to have a single spotlight trained on her face, bare arms and hands. From this point in her career she became the most important exponent of the chanson r√©aliste genre until √âdith Piaf came along in 1936. Her nickname was \\"la trag√©dienne de la chanson\\", and amongst her big hits were \\"Les go√©lands\\", \\"Johnny Palmer\\", \\"C'est mon gigolo\\" and \\"Tu ne sais pas aimer\\"‚Äîthe latter song became a theme for French sufferers of AIDS. Eileen Gray Around 1922, Damia became the lover of the architect Eileen Gray, who was a member of a circle of lesbians which included Fuller and her lover Gab Sor√®re, Natalie Barney and Romaine Brooks. Upon Fuller's death in 1928, Damia and Sor√®re became lovers. Films In 1927, she appeared in the film, Napol√©on directed by Abel Gance with early silent film stars Antonin Artaud, Philippe H√©riat, Annabella, and Suzanne Bianchetti. Her other film successes included \\"Sola\\" and \\"Notre Dame De Paris\\", alongside Anthony Quinn. Damia had enduring appeal that stretched to audiences as far away as Japan where she toured in 1953. Farewell tour A few years later she did a farewell tour, ending her more than forty-year career in a double bill with Marie Dubasin front of a full house at the Paris Olympia. Her actual swansong, however, was singing \\"Les Croix\\" on \\"La joie de vivre d'Edith Piaf\\", in 1956. When asked in 1974 by the Anglo-French biographer David Bret to divulge the secret of her long life and fabulous voice, Damia replied, \\"Three packs of Gitanes a day!\\" Death Damia died on 30 January 1978 at La Celle-Saint-Cloud, a western suburb of Paris, and was interred in the Cimeti√®re de Pantin. Today, she is considered to be the third greatest singer of chansons r√©alistes, after Edith Piaf and Barbara.

She flourished in, and helped define, the liberated culture of Paris in the 1920s.  Early life  Alice Prin was born in Ch√¢tillon-sur-Seine, C√¥te d'Or. An illegitimate child, she was raised in abject poverty by her grandmother. At age twelve, she was sent to live with her mother in Paris in order to find work. She first worked in shops and bakeries, but by the age of fourteen, she was posing nude for sculptors, which created discord with her mother. Kiki de Montparnasse, a 1928 bronze by Pablo Gargallo (1881‚Äì1934) ‚Äì Mus√©e de Louvre  Notoriety begins  Adopting a single name, \\"Kiki\\", she became a fixture in the Montparnasse social scene and a popular artist's model, posing for dozens of artists, including Sanyu, Chaim Soutine, Julian Mandel, Tsuguharu Foujita, Constant Detr√©, Francis Picabia, Jean Cocteau, Arno Breker, Alexander Calder, Per Krohg, Hermine David, Pablo Gargallo, Mayo, and Tono Salazar. Mo√Øse Kisling painted a portrait of Kiki titled Nu assis, one of his best known. Her companion for most of the 1920s was Man Ray, who made hundreds of portraits of her. She can be considered his muse at this time, she is the subject of some of his best-known images, including the notable surrealist image Le violon d'IngresLe violon d'Ingres, Getty Museum and Noire et blanche.Noire et blanche, Getty Museum She appeared in nine short and often experimental films, including Fernand L√©ger's Ballet m√©canique without any credit.  Artwork and autobiography  A painter in her own right, in 1927 Prin had a sold-out exhibition of her paintings at the Galerie au Sacre du Printemps in Paris. Signing her work with her chosen single name, Kiki, she usually noted the year. Her drawings and paintings comprise portraits, self-portraits, social activities, fanciful animals, and dreamy landscapes composed in a light, slightly uneven, expressionist style that is a reflection of her easy-going manner and boundless optimism.\\"Kiki of Montparnasse\\" , Zabrieski Gallery Alice Prin around 1920 Her autobiography was published in 1929 as Kiki's Memoirs, with Ernest Hemingway and Tsuguharu Foujita providing introductions. In 1930 the book was translated by Samuel Putnam and published in Manhattan by Black Manikin Press, but it was immediately banned by the United States government. A copy of the first US edition was held in the section for banned books in the New York Public Library through the 1970s. However, the book had been reprinted under the title The Education of a Young Model throughout the 1950s and 1960s (e.g., a 1954 edition by Bridgehead has the Hemingway Introduction and photos and illustrations by Mahlon Blaine). These editions were mainly put out by Samuel Roth. Taking advantage that the banning of the book meant it did not receive copyright protection in the U.S., Roth put out a series of supposedly copyrighted editions (which were never registered with the Library of Congress) which altered the text and added illustrations - line drawings and photographs - which were not by Prin. Editions published in and after 1955 include an extra 10 chapters supposedly written by Prin 23 years after the original book, including a visit to New York where she meets with Samuel Roth and Ernest Hemingway; none of this was true. The original autobiography finally saw a new translation and publication in 1996. Her music hall performances in black hose and garters included crowd-pleasing risqu√© songs, which were uninhibited, yet inoffensive. For a few years during the 1930s, she owned the Montparnasse cabaret L'Oasis, which was later renamed \\"Chez Kiki.\\" A symbol of bohemian and creative Paris and of the possibility of being a woman and finding an artistic place, at the age of twenty-eight she was declared the Queen of Montparnasse. Even during difficult times, she maintained her positive attitude, saying \\"all I need is an onion, a bit of bread, and a bottle of red [wine]; and I will always find somebody to offer me that.\\" She left Paris to avoid the occupying German army during World War II, which entered the city in June 1940. She did not return to live in the city immediately after the war.  Death and legacy  Prin died in 1953 after collapsing outside her flat in Montparnasse, at the age of fifty-one, apparently of complications of alcoholism or drug dependence. A large crowd of artists and fans attended her Paris funeral and followed the procession to her interment in the Cimeti√®re parisien de Thiais. Her tomb identifies her as \\"Kiki, 1901‚Äì1953, singer, actress, painter, Queen of Montparnasse.\\" Tsuguharu Foujita has said that, with Kiki, the glorious days of Montparnasse were buried forever. Long after her death, Prin remains the embodiment of the outspokenness, audacity, and creativity that marked that period of life in Montparnasse. She represents a strong artistic force in her own right as a woman. In 1989, biographers Billy Kl√ºver and Julie Martin called her \\"one of the century's first truly independent women.\\"Billy Kl√ºver and Julie Martin, Kiki's Paris, Abrams, 1989 In her honor, a daylily has been named Kiki de Montparnasse. Kiki was featured in a three-page obituary in Life magazine in the 29 June 1953 edition.

Written pseudonymously by \\"A Square\\", the book used the fictional two- dimensional world of Flatland to comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture, but the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions. Several films have been made from the story, including the feature film Flatland (2007). Other efforts have been short or experimental films, including one narrated by Dudley Moore and the short films Flatland: The Movie (2007) and Flatland 2: Sphereland (2012).  Plot  Illustration of a simple house in Flatland. The story describes a two-dimensional world occupied by geometric figures, whereof women are simple line-segments, while men are polygons with various numbers of sides. The narrator is a square, a member of the caste of gentlemen and professionals, who guides the readers through some of the implications of life in two dimensions. The first half of the story goes through the practicalities of existing in a two-dimensional universe as well as a history leading up to the year 1999 on the eve of the 3rd Millennium. On New Year's Eve, the Square dreams about a visit to a one- dimensional world (Lineland) inhabited by \\"lustrous points\\". These points are unable to see the Square as anything other than a set of points on a line. Thus, the Square attempts to convince the realm's monarch of a second dimension; but is unable to do so. In the end, the monarch of Lineland tries to kill A Square rather than tolerate his nonsense any further. Following this vision, he is himself visited by a three-dimensional sphere. Similar to the \\"points\\" in Lineland, the Square is unable to see the sphere as anything other than a circle. The Sphere then levitates up and down through the Flatland, allowing Square to see the circle expand and retract. The Square is not fully convinced until he sees Spaceland (a tridimensional world) for himself. This Sphere visits Flatland at the turn of each millennium to introduce a new apostle to the idea of a third dimension in the hope of eventually educating the population of Flatland. From the safety of Spaceland, they are able to observe the leaders of Flatland secretly acknowledging the existence of the sphere and prescribing the silencing on. After this proclamation is made, many witnesses are massacred or imprisoned (according to caste), including the Square's brother. After the Square's mind is opened to new dimensions, he tries to convince the Sphere of the theoretical possibility of the existence of a fourth and higher spatial dimensions; but the Sphere returns his student to Flatland in disgrace. The Square then has a dream in which the Sphere visits him again, this time to introduce him to Pointland, whereof the point (sole inhabitant, monarch, and universe in one) perceives any communication as a thought originating in his own mind (cf. Solipsism): The last sketch in the book. The Square recognises the identity of the ignorance of the monarchs of Pointland and Lineland with his own (and the Sphere's) previous ignorance of the existence of higher dimensions. Once returned to Flatland, the Square cannot convince anyone of Spaceland's existence, especially after official decrees are announced that anyone preaching the existence of three dimensions will be imprisoned (or executed, depending on caste). Eventually the Square himself is imprisoned for just this reason, with only occasional contact with his brother who is imprisoned in the same facility. He does not manage to convince his brother, even after all they have both seen. Seven years after being imprisoned, A Square writes out the book Flatland in the form of a memoir, hoping to keep it as posterity for a future generation that can see beyond their two-dimensional existence. Social elements Men are portrayed as polygons whose social status is determined by their regularity and the number of their sides, with a Circle considered the \\"perfect\\" shape. On the other hand, women consist only of lines and are required by law to sound a \\"peace-cry\\" as they walk, lest they be mistaken face-to-face for a point. The Square evinces accounts of cases where women have accidentally or deliberately stabbed men to death, as evidence of the need for separate doors for women and men in buildings. In the world of Flatland, classes are distinguished by the \\"Art of Hearing\\", the \\"Art of Feeling\\", and the \\"Art of Sight Recognition\\". Classes can be distinguished by the sound of one's voice, but the lower classes have more developed vocal organs, enabling them to feign the voice of a Polygon or even a Circle. Feeling, practised by the lower classes and women, determines the configuration of a person by feeling one of its angles. The \\"Art of Sight Recognition\\", practised by the upper classes, is aided by \\"Fog\\", which allows an observer to determine the depth of an object. With this, polygons with sharp angles relative to the observer will fade more rapidly than polygons with more gradual angles. Colour of any kind is banned in Flatland after Isosceles workers painted themselves to impersonate noble Polygons. The Square describes these events, and the ensuing class war at length. The population of Flatland can \\"evolve\\" through the \\"Law of Nature\\", which states: \\"a male child shall have one more side than his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule) one step in the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a Square is a Pentagon, the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on\\". This rule is not the case when dealing with isosceles triangles (Soldiers and Workmen) with only two congruent sides. The smallest angle of an Isosceles Triangle gains thirty arc minutes (half a degree) each generation. Additionally, the rule does not seem to apply to many-sided Polygons. For example, the sons of several hundred-sided Polygons will often develop fifty or more sides more than their parents. Furthermore, the angle of an Isosceles Triangle or the number of sides of a (regular) Polygon may be altered during life by deeds or surgical adjustments. An equilateral triangle is a member of the craftsman class. Squares and Pentagons are the \\"gentlemen\\" class, as doctors, lawyers, and other professions. Hexagons are the lowest rank of nobility, all the way up to (near) Circles, who make up the priest class. The higher-order Polygons have much less of a chance of producing sons, preventing Flatland from being overcrowded with noblemen. Apart from isosceles triangles, only regular Polygons are considered until chapter seven of the book when the issue of irregularity, or physical deformity is brought up. In a two dimensional world a regular polygon can be identified by a single angle and/or vertex. To maintain social cohesion, irregularity is to be abhorred, with moral irregularity and criminality cited, \\"by some\\" (in the book), as inevitable additional deformities, a sentiment with which the Square concurs. If the error of deviation is above a stated amount, the irregular Polygon faces euthanasia; if below, he becomes the lowest rank of civil servant. An irregular Polygon is not destroyed at birth, but allowed to develop to see if the irregularity can be \\"cured\\" or reduced. If the deformity remains, the irregular is \\"painlessly and mercifully consumed.\\" As a social satire In Flatland Abbott describes a society rigidly divided into classes. Social ascent is the main aspiration of its inhabitants, apparently granted to everyone but strictly controlled by the top of the hierarchy. Freedom is despised and the laws are cruel. Innovators are imprisoned or suppressed. Members of lower classes who are intellectually valuable, and potential leaders of riots, are either killed or promoted to the higher classes. Every attempt for change is considered dangerous and harmful. This world is not prepared to receive \\"revelations from another world\\". The satirical part is mainly concentrated in the first part of the book, \\"This World\\", which describes Flatland. The main points of interest are the Victorian concept of women's roles in the society and in the class-based hierarchy of men. Abbott has been accused of misogyny due to his portrait of women in Flatland. In his Preface to the Second and Revised Edition, 1884, he answers such critics by emphasizing that the description of women was satirizing the viewpoints held, stating that the Square: Critical reception Although Flatland was not ignored when it was published, it did not obtain a great success. In the entry on Edwin Abbott in the Dictionary of National Biography, Flatland was not even mentioned. The book was discovered again after Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity was published, which brought to prominence the concept of a fourth dimension. Flatland was mentioned in a letter entitled \\"Euclid, Newton and Einstein\\" published in Nature on 12 February 1920. In this letter Abbott is depicted, in a sense, as a prophet due to his intuition of the importance of time to explain certain phenomena: The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography subsequently revised his biography, and as of 2020 it states that [Abbott] \\"is most remembered as the author of Flatland: a Romance of Many Dimensions\\". Adaptations and parodies Numerous imitations or sequels to Flatland have been created. Examples include: =In film= *Flatland (1965), an animated short film based on the novella, was directed by Eric Martin and based on an idea by John Hubley. *Flatlandia (1982), an Italian animated short film, directed by Michele Emmer. *Flatland (2007), a 98-minute animated independent feature film version directed by Ladd Ehlinger Jr, updates the satire from Victorian England to the modern-day United States. *Flatland: The Movie (2007), by Dano Johnson and Jeffrey Travis, is a 34-minute animated educational film. Its sequel was Flatland 2: Sphereland (2012), inspired by the novel Sphereland by Dionys Burger.GeekDad.com Review of Flatland: The Movie and Flatland 2: Sphereland =In literature= Books and short stories inspired by Flatland include: *An Episode on Flatland: Or How a Plain Folk Discovered the Third Dimension by Charles Howard Hinton (1907) *The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Lower Mathematics by Norton Juster (1963) *Sphereland by Dionys Burger (1965) *The Incredible Umbrella by Marvin Kaye (1980) *\\"Message Found in a Copy of Flatland\\" by Rudy Rucker (1983) *The Planiverse by A.

Sagan recreates the thought experiment as a set-up to discussing the possibilities of higher dimensions of the physical universe in both the book and television series Cosmos, whereas Hawking notes the peculiarity of life in two-dimensional space, as any inhabitants would necessarily be unable to digest their own food. Flatland features in The Big Bang Theory episode \\"The Psychic Vortex\\", when Sheldon Cooper declares it one of his favourite imaginary places to visit. On the series The Orville, episode \\"New Dimensions\\", Captain Ed Mercer references Flatland and its theme of social hierarchy in response to both the discovery of a two-dimensional anomaly in space, as well as his and another colleague's questionable promotions through the ranks. In David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest, it is briefly mentioned that students from the Enfield Tennis Academy could be seen studying and highlighting copies of Flatland on the bus.

This execution method, conceived in 1881 by a Buffalo, New York dentist named Alfred P. Southwick, was developed throughout the 1880s as a supposed humane alternative to hanging, and first used in 1890. This execution method has been used in the United States and, for several decades, Philippines: The Death Penalty: Criminality, Justice and Human Rights in the Philippines. While death was originally theorized to result from damage to the brain, it was eventually shown in 1899 that it primarily results from ventricular fibrillation and eventual cardiac arrest. Once the person (usually with head and leg shaved) was attached to the chair, various cycles (changes in voltage and duration) of alternating current would be passed through the individual's body in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs. The first, more powerful jolt of electric current is intended to cause immediate unconsciousness,The Effects of Electric Shock on the Body ventricular fibrillation, and eventual cardiac arrest. The second, less powerful jolt is intended to cause fatal damage to the vital organs. Although the electric chair has long been a symbol of the death penalty in the United States, its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection, which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution. While some states still maintain electrocution as a legal method of execution, today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner, except in Tennessee, where it may be used without input from the prisoner if the drugs for lethal injection are not available.Tennessee electric chair use could spur legal challenges As of 2014, electrocution is an optional form of execution in the states of Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, and Virginia, all of which allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method. In the state of Kentucky, the electric chair has been retired, except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31, 1998, and who choose electrocution; inmates who do not choose electrocution and inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are executed by lethal injection. Electrocution is also authorized in Kentucky in the event that lethal injection is found unconstitutional by a court. The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution. On February 8, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" under the state's constitution. This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska, the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution. Invention In the late 1870s to early 1880s, the spread of arc lighting, a type of brilliant outdoor street lighting that required high voltages in the range of 3000‚Äì6000 volts, was followed by one story after another in newspapers about how the high voltages used were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead without leaving a mark.Randall E. Stross, The Wizard of Menlo Park: How Thomas Alva Edison Invented the Modern World, Crown/Archetype ‚Äì 2007, page 171-173 One of these accidents, in Buffalo, New York, on August 7, 1881, led to the inception of the electric chair.Craig Brandon The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History page 12 That evening a drunken dock worker named George Lemuel Smith, looking for the thrill of a tingling sensation he had noticed when grabbing the guard rail in a Brush Electric Company arc lighting power house, managed to sneak his way back into the plant at night and grabbed the brush and ground of a large electric dynamo.Mike Winchell, The Electric War: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Light the World, Henry Holt and Company - 2019, page 10 He died instantly. The coroner who investigated the case brought it up that year at a local Buffalo scientific society. Another member attending that lecture, Alfred P. Southwick, a dentist who had a technical background, thought some application could be found for the curious phenomenon.Craig Brandon, The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History page 14 Southwick joined physician George E. Fell and the head of the Buffalo ASPCA in a series of experiments electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs. They ran trials with the dog in water and out of water, and varied the electrode type and placement until they came up with a repeatable method to euthanize animals using electricity.Craig Brandon The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History page 21 Southwick went on in the early 1880s to advocate that this method be used as a more humane replacement for hanging in capital cases, coming to national attention when he published his ideas in scientific journals in 1882 and 1883. He worked out calculations based on the dog experiments, trying to develop a scaled-up method that would work on humans. Early on in his designs he adopted a modified version of the dental chair as a way to restrain the condemned, a device that from then on would be called the electric chair.Craig Brandon The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History page 24 =The Gerry Commission= After a series of botched hangings in the United States, there was mounting criticism of that form of capital punishment and the death penalty in general. In 1886, newly elected New York State governor David B. Hill set up a three-member death penalty commission, which was chaired by the human rights advocate and reformer Elbridge Thomas Gerry and included New York lawyer and politician Matthew Hale and Southwick, to investigate a more humane means of execution.David Marc. \\"Southwick, Alfred Porter\\", American National Biography Online ‚Äì 2000Richard Moran, Executioner's Current: Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and the Invention of the Electric Chair, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group - 2007, page 74 A June 30, 1888 Scientific American illustration of what the electric chair suggested by the Gerry Commission might look like. The commission members surveyed the history of execution and sent out a fact-finding questionnaire to government officials, lawyers, and medical experts all around the state asking for their opinion.Craig Brandon, The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History, page 54 A slight majority of respondents recommended hanging over electrocution, with a few instead recommending the abolition of capital punishment. The commission also contacted electrical experts, including Thomson-Houston Electric Company's Elihu Thomson (who recommended high voltage AC connected to the head and the spine) and the inventor Thomas Edison (who also recommended AC, as well as using a Westinghouse generator).Anthony Galvin, Old Sparky: The Electric Chair and the History of the Death Penalty, Skyhorse Publishing ‚Äì 2015, pages 30‚Äì45Craig Brandon, The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History, pages 57‚Äì58Jill Jonnes, Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House ‚Äì 2004, page 420 They also attended electrocutions of dogs by George Fell who had worked with Southwick in the early 1880s experiments. Fell was conducting further experiments, electrocuting anesthetized dissected dogs trying to discern exactly how electricity killed a subject.Richard Moran, Executioner's Current: Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and the Invention of the Electric Chair, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group ‚Äì 2007, page 4 In 1888, the Commission recommended electrocution using Southwick's electric chair idea with metal conductors attached to the condemned person's head and feet. They further recommended that executions be handled by the state instead of the individual counties with three electric chairs set up at Auburn, Clinton, and Sing Sing prisons. A bill following these recommendations passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Hill on June 4, 1888, set to go into effect on January 1, 1889. =The Medico-Legal commission= The bill itself contained no details on the type or amount of electricity that should be used and the New York Medico- Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of determining these factors. In September 1888, a committee was formed and recommended 3000 volts, although the type of electricity, direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC), was not determined, and since tests up to that point had been done on animals smaller than a human (dogs), some members were unsure that the lethality of AC had been conclusively proven.Richard Moran, Executioner's Current: Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and the Invention of the Electric Chair, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group ‚Äì 2007, page 102 Harold Brown demonstrating the killing power of AC to the New York Medico-Legal Society by electrocuting a horse at Thomas Edison's West Orange laboratory. At this point the state's efforts to design the electric chair became intermixed with what has come to be known as the war of the currents, a competition between Thomas Edison's direct current power system and George Westinghouse's alternating current based system. The two companies had been competing commercially since 1886 and a series of events had turned it into an all-out media war in 1888. The committee head, neurologist Frederick Peterson, enlisted the services of Harold P. Brown as a consultant. Brown had been on his own crusade against alternating current after the shoddy installation of pole-mounted AC arc lighting lines in New York City had caused several deaths in early 1888. Peterson had been an assistant at Brown's July 1888 public electrocution of dogs with AC at Columbia College, an attempt by Brown to prove AC was more deadly than DC. Technical assistance in these demonstrations was provided by Thomas Edison's West Orange laboratory and there grew to be some form of collusion between Edison Electric and Brown.Craig Brandon, The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History, McFarland ‚Äì 1999, pages 70 and 261Jill Jonnes, Empires Of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House ‚Äì 2004, page 166W. Bernard Carlson, Innovation as a Social Process: Elihu Thomson and the Rise of General Electric, Cambridge University Press ‚Äì 2003, page 285 Back at West Orange on December 5, 1888 Brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society including Elbridge Gerry who was also chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC.Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing USA ‚Äì 2009, pages 152‚Äì155 Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society recommended the use of 1000‚Äì1500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities. Westinghouse criticized these tests as a skewed self-serving demonstration designed to be a direct attack on alternating current and accused Brown of being in the employ of Edison.Craig Brandon The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History page 82 At the request of death penalty commission chairman Gerry, Medico-Legal Society members; electrotherapy expert Alphonse David Rockwell, Carlos Frederick MacDonald, and Columbia College professor Louis H. Laudy, were given the task of working out the details of electrode placement.Terry S. Reynolds, Theodore Bernstein, Edison and \\"The Chair\\", Technology and Society Magazine, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (Volume 8, Issue 1) March 1989, pages 19 ‚Äì 28Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing USA ‚Äì 2009, pages 225Sarah Davis., A \\"Bungled\\" Execution and a Doctor's Guilt: The Horrifying Debut of the Electric Chair, December 4, 2014 They again turned to Brown to supply the technical assistance. Brown asked Edison Electric Light to supply equipment for the tests and treasurer Francis S. Hastings (who seemed to be one of the primary movers at the company trying to portray Westinghouse as a peddler of death dealing AC current) tried to obtain a Westinghouse AC generator for the test but found none could be acquired. They ended up using Edison's West Orange laboratory for the animal tests they conducted in mid-March 1889. Superintendent of Prisons Austin E. Lathrop asked Brown to design the chair, but Brown turned down the offer. Dr. George Fell drew up the final designs for a simple oak chair and went against the Medico-Legal Society recommendations, changing the position of the electrodes to the head and the middle of the back. Brown did take on the job of finding the generators needed to power the chair. He managed to surreptitiously acquire three Westinghouse AC generators that were being decommissioned with the help of Edison and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, a move that made sure that Westinghouse's equipment would be associated with the first execution.Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing ‚Äì 2005, pages 190‚Äì195 The electric chair was built by Edwin F. Davis, the first \\"state electrician\\" (executioner) for the State of New York.Stuart Banner, The Death Penalty: an American history, Harvard University Press ‚Äì 2009, pages 194‚Äì195 First execution The execution of William Kemmler, August 6, 1890 The first person in line to die under New York's new electrocution law was Joseph Chapleau, convicted for beating his neighbor to death with a sled stake, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.Carl Sifakis, The Encyclopedia of American Prisons, Infobase Publishing ‚Äì 2014, page 39 The next person scheduled to be executed was William Kemmler, convicted of murdering his wife with a hatchet. An appeal on Kemmler's behalf was made to the New York Court of Appeals on the grounds that use of electricity as a means of execution constituted a \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" and was thus contrary to the constitutions of the United States and the state of New York.\\"Electric Executions: The New York Court of Appeals Passes on the Question: The Famous Kemmler Case Decided\\", Lawrence Daily Record, Jan. 1, 1890, pg. 1. On December 30, 1889, the writ of habeas corpus sworn out on Kemmler's behalf was denied by the court, with Judge Dwight writing in a lengthy ruling: > We have no doubt that if the Legislature of this State should undertake to > proscribe for any offense against its laws the punishment of burning at the > stake, breaking at the wheel, etc., it would be the duty of the courts to > pronounce upon such attempt the condemnation of the Constitution. The > question now to be answered is whether the legislative act here assailed is > subject to the same condemnation. Certainly, it is not so on its face, for, > although the mode of death described is conceded to be unusual, there is no > common knowledge or consent that it is cruel; it is a question of fact > whether an electric current of sufficient intensity and skillfully applied > will produce death without unnecessary suffering.Justice Dwight, quoted in > \\"Electric Executions\\", Lawrence Daily Record, Jan. 1, 1890; pg. 1. Kemmler was executed in New York's Auburn Prison on August 6, 1890; the \\"state electrician\\" was Edwin F. Davis. The first 17-second passage of 1,000 volts AC of current through Kemmler caused unconsciousness, but failed to stop his heart and breathing. The attending physicians, Edward Charles Spitzka and Carlos F. MacDonald, came forward to examine Kemmler. After confirming Kemmler was still alive, Spitzka reportedly called out, \\"Have the current turned on again, quick, no delay.\\" The generator needed time to re-charge, however. In the second attempt, Kemmler received a 2,000 volt AC shock. Blood vessels under the skin ruptured and bled, and the areas around the electrodes singed. The entire execution took about eight minutes. George Westinghouse later commented that, \\"They would have done better using an axe\\",AC/DC: The Savage Tale of the First Standards War; By Tom McNichol and a witnessing reporter claimed that it was \\"an awful spectacle, far worse than hanging\\". Adoption The electric chair was adopted by Ohio (1897), Massachusetts (1900), New Jersey (1906) and Virginia (1908), and soon became the prevalent method of execution in the United States, replacing hanging. Twenty six US States, the District of Columbia, the Federal government, and the US Military either had death by electrocution on the books or actively executed criminals using the method. The electric chair remained the most prominent execution method until the mid-1980s when lethal injection became widely accepted for conducting judicial executions. Other countries appear to have contemplated using the method, sometimes for special reasons. The Philippines also adopted the electric chair from 1926 to 1987. A well-publicized triple execution took place there in May 1972, when Jaime Jose, Basilio Pineda and Edgardo Aquino were electrocuted for the 1967 abduction and gang-rape of the young actress Maggie de la Riva. The last electric chair execution in the Philippines was in 1976 and was later replaced with lethal injection when executions resumed in that country. Ethiopia had, according to some sources, attempted to adopt the electric chair as a method of executing criminals. The emperor Menelek II is said to have acquired three electric chairs in 1896 at the behest of a missionaryPierre Van Paassen, Days of Our Years (London: Heinemann, 1939) p.315, but could not make the devices work as his nation did not have a reliable source of electric power available at that time. Two of the chairs were either used as garden furnitureModesto Bee [CA], 15 October 1970 or given to friendsSun-News (Las Cruces, NM), 7 June 1974 and Menelek II is said to have used the third electric chair as a throne.David Wallechinsky et al, The Book of Lists (London: Corgi, 1977) p.463. United Kingdom The United Kingdom considered replacing hanging with the electric chair (as well as considering the gas chamber, shooting, the guillotine and lethal injection) during the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, the findings of which were published in 1953. The Commission concluded that the electric chair had no particular advantages over hanging. Present-day use The last judicial electrocution in the USA prior to the Furman v Georgia took place in Oklahoma in 1966. The electric chair was used quite frequently in post-Gregg v Georgia executions during the 1980s but its use in the United States gradually declined in the 1990s due to the widespread adoption of lethal injection as the preferred method of execution. A number of states still allow the condemned person to choose between electrocution and lethal injection, with the most recent U.S. electrocution taking place in February 2020 in Tennessee.

In a botched execution at Clinton Prison in Dannemora, New York, on October 1, 1903, three brothers ‚Äì Willis, Frederick, and Burton Van Wormer, condemned for murdering their uncle on December 24, 1901 ‚Äì were electrocuted one after the other over the course of about 15 minutes and pronounced dead.Anonymous, \\"1903: Willis, Frederick, and Burton van Wormer,\\" executedtoday.com, October 1, 2011 Retrieved April 4, 2019 But after their bodies were laid out in the prison's autopsy room Frederick's body was seen to move, and the prison doctor determined that his heart was still beating. He was returned to the electric chair and the executioner was called back to re-electrocute him, but he died before any more shocks could be administered. The electrocution of housewife Ruth Snyder at Sing Sing on the evening of January 12, 1928, for the March 1927 murder of her husband was photographed for a front-page story on New York Daily News the following morning. News photographer Tom Howard had smuggled a camera into the death chamber and photographed her in the electric chair as the current was turned on. It remains one of the best-known examples of photojournalism.Time-Life Books, 1969, p. 185 A record was set on July 13, 1928, when seven men were executed consecutively in the electric chair at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville, Kentucky.

On August 8, 1942, six German agents convicted of espionage and attempted sabotage in the Quirin case for their role in Operation Pastorius during World War II were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia Jail in Washington, D.C. On June 16, 1944, an African-American teenager, 14-year-old George Stinney, became the youngest person ever executed in the electric chair when he was electrocuted at the Central Correctional Institution in Columbia, South Carolina. His conviction was overturned in 2014 after a circuit court judge vacated his sentence on the grounds that Stinney did not receive a fair trial. The judge determined that Stinney's legal counsel was inadequate, thus violating his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were electrocuted on June 19, 1953, after being convicted of espionage for sharing secrets related to the atomic bomb with the Soviet Union. Julius died after the usual three shocks, but Ethel's heart was still beating when she was unstrapped from the electric chair after these three shocks, so she was strapped in again and shocked twice more, finally completing her execution. James French was executed on August 10, 1966, the last person electrocuted until 1979. French was the first person executed in Oklahoma since Richard Dare was electrocuted June 1, 1963, and the only person executed in 1966. On May 25, 1979, John Spenkelink became the first person to be electrocuted after the Gregg v. Georgia decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1976. He was the first person to be executed in the United States in this manner since 1966. Serial murderer and rapist Ted Bundy was executed in the same electric chair in Florida on January 24, 1989. The last person to be executed by electric chair without the choice of an alternative method was Lynda Lyon Block on May 10, 2002, in Alabama. Decline The use of the electric chair has declined as legislators sought what they believed to be more humane methods of execution. Lethal injection became the most widely used method, aided by media reports of botched electrocutions in the early 1980s. The electric chair has been criticized because of several instances in which the subjects were killed only after being subjected to multiple electric shocks. This led to a call for ending of the practice, as being a \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\". Trying to address such concerns, Nebraska introduced a new electrocution protocol in 2004, which called for administration of a 15-second-long application of electric current at a potential of 2,450 volts; after a 15-minute wait, an official then checks for signs of life. In April 2007, new concerns raised regarding the 2004 protocol resulted in the ushering in of the current Nebraska protocol, calling for a 20-second-long application of electric current at a potential of 2,450 volts. Prior to the 2004 protocol change, an initial eight-second application of current at 2,450 volts was administered, followed by a one-second pause, then a 22-second application at 480 volts. After a 20-second break, the cycle was repeated three more times. In 1946, the electric chair failed to kill Willie Francis, who reportedly shrieked, \\"Take it off! Let me breathe!\\", after the current was applied. It turned out that the portable electric chair had been improperly set up by an intoxicated prison guard and inmate.Gilbert King, The Two Executions Of Willie Francis, Wednesday, July 19, 2006, washingtonpost.com A case was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court (Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber),U.S. Supreme Court case, Francis v. Resweber: with lawyers for the condemned arguing that although Francis did not die, he had, in fact, been executed. The argument was rejected on the basis that re- execution did not violate the double jeopardy clause of the 5th Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Francis was returned to the electric chair and successfully executed in 1947. Recorded incidents of botched electrocutions were prevalent after the national moratorium ended January 17, 1977; two in Alabama, three in Florida, one in Georgia, one in Indiana, and three in Virginia. All five states now have lethal injection as the default method if a choice is not made. As of 2015, the only places in the world that still reserve the electric chair as an option for execution are the U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia. Arkansas and Oklahoma laws provide for its use should lethal injection ever be held to be unconstitutional. Inmates in the other states must select either it or lethal injection. In Kentucky, only inmates sentenced before a certain date can choose to be executed by electric chair. Electrocution is also authorized in Kentucky in the event that lethal injection is found unconstitutional by a court. Tennessee was among the states that provided inmates with a choice of the electric chair or lethal injection; in May 2014, however, the state passed a law allowing the use of the electric chair if lethal injection drugs were unavailable or made unconstitutional. In the U.S. state of Florida, on July 8, 1999, Allen Lee Davis, convicted of murder, was executed in the Florida electric chair \\"Old Sparky\\". Davis' face was bloodied, and photographs were taken, which were later posted on the Internet. An investigation concluded that Davis had begun bleeding before the electricity was applied and that the chair had functioned as intended. Florida's Supreme Court ruled that the chair did not constitute \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\".http://www.dc.state.fl.us/oth/deathrow/drorder.html The 1997 execution of Pedro Medina in Florida created controversy when flames burst from the inmate's head. An autopsy found that Medina had died instantly when the first surge of electricity had destroyed his brain and brain stem. A judge ruled that the incident arose from \\"unintentional human error\\" rather than any faults in the \\"apparatus, equipment, and electrical circuitry\\" of Florida's electric chair. Lethal injection has been the primary method of execution in Florida since 2000. On February 15, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court declared execution by electrocution to be \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" prohibited by the Nebraska Constitution.

Since their resettlement in 1939, Baltic Germans have markedly declined as a geographically determined ethnic group. The largest groups of present-day descendants of the Baltic Germans live in Germany and Canada. It is estimated that several thousand still reside in Latvia and Estonia. For centuries Baltic Germans and the Baltic nobility constituted a ruling class over non-German serfs. The emerging Baltic-German middle class was mostly urban and professional. In the 12th and 13th centuries Catholic Germans, both traders and crusaders (see ), began settling in the eastern Baltic territories. After the 13th-century Livonian Crusade, they assumed control of government, politics, economics, education and culture of these lands, ruling for more than 700 years until 1918 ‚Äî usually in alliance with Polish, Swedish or Russian overlords. With the decline of Latin, German became the language of all official documents, commerce, education and government. At first the majority of German settlers lived in small cities and military castles. Their elite formed the Baltic nobility, acquiring large rural estates and comprising the social, commercial, political and cultural elite of Livonia for several centuries. After 1710 many of these men increasingly took high positions in the military, political and civilian life of the Russian Empire, particularly in Saint Petersburg. Baltic Germans held citizenship in the Russian Empire until Estonia and Latvia achieved independence in 1918. They then held Estonian or Latvian citizenship until the occupation and later annexation of these areas by the Soviet Union in 1939‚Äì1940. The Baltic German population never surpassed more than 10% of the total population. In 1881 there were 180,000 Baltic Germans in Russia's Baltic provinces, but by 1914 this number had declined to 162,000. In 1881 there were approximately 46,700 Germans in Estonia (5.3% of the population).Baltic Germans in Estonia, Estonian Institute einst.ee According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897, there were 120,191 Germans in Latvia, or 6.2% of the population. Baltic German history and presence in the Baltics came to an end in late 1939, following the signing of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and the subsequent Nazi‚ÄìSoviet population transfers. Nazi Germany resettled almost all the Baltic Germans under the program into the newly formed of and Danzig-West Prussia (on the territory of the occupied Second Polish Republic). In 1945, most ethnic Germans were expelled from these lands by the Soviet army. Resettlement was planned for the territory remaining to Germany under terms of the border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference, i.e. west of the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line, or elsewhere in the world. Ethnic Germans from East Prussia and Lithuania are sometimes incorrectly considered Baltic Germans for reasons of cultural, linguistic, and historical affinities. But the Germans of East Prussia held Prussian, and after 1871, German citizenship, because the territory they lived in was part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Ethnic composition Baltic Germans were not a purely German ethnic group. The early crusaders, tradesmen and craftsmen often married local women, as there were no German women available. Some noble families, such as the Lievens, claimed descent through such women from native chieftains. Many of the German Livonian-Order soldiers died during the Livonian War of 1558‚Äì1583. New German arrivals came to the area. During this time the Low German (Plattdeutsch) of the original settlers was gradually replaced by the High German (Hochdeutsch) of the new settlers. In the course of their 700-year history, Baltic German families had ethnic German roots, but also intermarried extensively with Estonians, Livonians and Latvians, as well as with other Northern or Central European peoples, such as Danes, Swedes, Irish, English, Scots, Poles, Hungarians and Dutch. In cases where intermarriage occurred, members of the other ethnic groups frequently assimilated into German culture, adopting German language, customs, and family names. They were then considered Germans, leading to the ethnogenesis of the Baltic Germans. The families of Barclay de Tolly and of George Armitstead (1847-1912), who had emigrated from the British Isles, married into and became part of the Baltic-German community.Deutschbalten, im 19.Jh. entstandene Bez. f√úr die dt.

Territories Baltic German settlements in the Baltic area consisted of the following territories: *Estland (; ), roughly the northern half of present-day Estonia; major towns: Reval (Tallinn), Narwa (Narva), Wesenberg (Rakvere), Weissenstein (Paide), Hapsal (Haapsalu), Arensburg (Kuressaare). *Livland (; ; ), roughly the southern half of present- day Estonia and the northern and eastern part of today's Latvia (Vidzeme); major towns: Riga, Wenden (Cƒìsis), Wolmar (Valmiera), Walk (Valga and Valka), Dorpat (Tartu), Pernau (P√§rnu), Fellin (Viljandi). *Kurland (; also ; ), roughly the western half of present-day Latvia (Kurzeme and Zemgale); major towns: Mitau (Jelgava), Windau (Ventspils), Libau (LiepƒÅja). *√ñsel (the island of Saaremaa) belonging to present-day Estonia; major town: Arensburg (Kuressaare). Conquering the Baltics Map of Terra Mariana in 1260. Citizens (upper panel) and commoners (lower panel) in medieval Livonia, 16th century Small numbers of Ethnic Germans began to settle in the area in the late 12th century when traders and Christian missionaries began to visit the coastal lands inhabited by tribes who spoke Finnic and Baltic languages. Systematic conquest and settlement of these lands was completed during the Northern Crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries which resulted in creation of the Terra Mariana confederation, under the protection of Roman Popes and Holy Roman Empire. After the heavy defeat in the 1236 Battle of Saule the Livonian Brothers of the Sword became a part of the Teutonic Order. During the next three centuries German-speaking soldiers, clergymen, merchants and craftsmen constituted the majority of the quickly growing urban population, as the native inhabitants usually were prohibited from settling there. Membership in the Hanseatic League and active trade links with Russia and Europe increased wealth of Baltic German traders. Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish rule Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish lands in the Baltics As the military power of the Teutonic Knights weakened during the 15th century wars with the Kingdom of Poland, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Grand Duchy of Moscow, the Livonian branch in the north began to pursue its own policies. When the Prussian branch of the Order secularized in 1525 and became a Polish vassal state as the Duchy of Prussia, the Livonian branch remained independent while searching for a similar way to secularize. Livonia became mostly Protestant during the Reformation. In 1558, the Tsardom of Russia began the Livonian War against Terra Mariana which soon involved the Kingdoms of Poland, Sweden, and Denmark and lasted for 20 years. In 1561, Terra Mariana ceased to exist and was divided among Denmark (which took the island of √ñsel), Sweden (which took northern Estonia) and Poland, which annexed the newly created Duchy of Livonia, and granted the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a vassal state of Poland-Lithuania, to the last Master of the Livonian Order Gotthard Kettler. The secularized land was divided among the remaining knights who formed the basis of Baltic nobility. The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia existed as a German-speaking country until 1795, while the northern part of Duchy of Livonia was conquered by Sweden which controlled parts of Estonia between 1561 and 1710 and Swedish Livonia between 1621 and 1710, having signed an agreement with the local Baltic German nobles not to undermine their political rights and autonomy. The Academia Gustaviana (now University of Tartu) was founded in 1632 by King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden. It remained the only institution of higher education in the former Livonian territories and became the intellectual focus of the Baltic Germans. At the end of the 17th century Sweden introduced the land reduction in its Baltic provinces and properties held by German nobility became the property of the Crown. That effectively turned serfs into free peasants, but it would be overturned when Russia conquered these territories in 1710 and restored the rights of German landowners under the Treaty of Nystad. Russia's Baltic governorates (1710‚Äì1917) Russian Baltic governorates Duke's RundƒÅle Palace The many manors in Estonia and Latvia testify to the former splendor of the Baltic German landowning class. Pictured: V√§√§na manor, Estonia. Me≈æotne Palace in Latvia Between 1710 and 1795, following Russia's success in the Great Northern War and the three Partitions of Poland, the areas inhabited by Baltic Germans eventually became Baltic governorates of Russian Empire: Courland Governorate, Governorate of Livonia and Governorate of Estonia. =Autonomy= The Baltic provinces remained autonomous and were self-governed by the local Baltic nobility. Until the imperial reforms of 1880s local government was in the hands of the landtag of each province, in which only members of the matriculated Baltic nobility held membership and cities were ruled by German burgomasters. Between 1710 and approximately 1880 Baltic German ruling class enjoyed great autonomy from the Imperial government and achieved great political influence in the Imperial court. Starting from the 18th century Baltic German nobility increasingly assumed leading posts in the Russian imperial government, after all, Russia was ruled by a German dynasty of Holstein-Gottorp, and Baltic Germans provided a well-educated, Westernized elite. Germans, other than the local estate-owners, mainly lived in the cities, such as Riga, Reval, Dorpat, Pernau and Mitau. As late as the mid-19th century the population of many of these cities still had a German majority, with Estonian, Latvian or Jewish minorities. By 1867 Riga's population was 42.9% German. Until the late 19th century most of the professional and learned classes in the region, the literati, were Germans. German political and cultural autonomy ceased in the 1880s, when Russification replaced German administration and schooling with the usage of Russian. After 1885 provincial governors usually were Russians. =Rise of native peoples= Years of peace under Russian rule brought increasing prosperity and many new manor houses were built in country estates, but economic exploitation worsened the situation of the native population. For examples, see List of palaces and manor houses in Latvia and List of palaces and manor houses in Estonia. The native Latvian and Estonian population enjoyed fewer rights under the Baltic German nobility compared to the farmers in Germany, Sweden, or Poland. In contrast to the Baltic Germans, Estonians and Latvians had restricted civil rights and resided mostly in rural areas as serfs, tradesmen, or as servants in manors and urban homes. They had no rights to leave their masters and no last names. This was in keeping with the social scheme of things in Russian Empire, and lasted until the 19th century, when emancipation from serfdom brought those inhabitants increased civil freedoms and some political rights. In 1804 Livonian peasant law was introduced by Imperial government, aimed at improving conditions for serfs. Serfdom was abolished in all Baltic provinces between 1816 and 1820, about half a century earlier than in Russia proper. For some time there was no outward tension between the German speakers and indigenous residents. If earlier any Latvian or Estonian who managed to rise above his class was expected to Germanize and to forget his roots, by the middle of 19th century German urban classes began to feel increasing competition from the natives, who after the First Latvian National Awakening and Estonian national awakening produced their own middle class and moved to German and Jewish dominated towns and cities in increasing numbers. The Revolution of 1905 led to attacks against the Baltic German landowners, the burning of manors, and the torture and even killing of members of the nobility. During the 1905 Revolution groups of rebels burned over 400 manor houses and German owned buildings and killed 82 Germans. In response Cossack punitive expeditions aided by German nobles and officers burned down hundreds of farms, arrested and deported thousands and summarily executed at least 2,000 people. Reaction to 1905 Revolution included a scheme by Karl Baron von Manteuffel-Szoege and Silvio Broedrich-Kurmahlen to pacify the countryside by settling up to 20,000 ethnic German farmers, mostly from Volhynia, in Courland. World War I World War I brought the end of the alliance of the Baltic Germans and the Russian Tsarist government. German heritage made them to be seen as the enemy by Russians. They were seen also as traitors by the German Empire if they remained loyal to Russia. Their loyalty to the state was questioned and rumors of a German fifth column increased together with the defeats of the Imperial army led by Baltic German general Paul von Rennenkampf. All German schools and societies were closed in the Estonian Governorate and Germans were ordered to leave the Courland Governorate for inner Russia. Courland was conquered by Germany in 1915 and included into the military Ober Ost administration. After the Russian surrender at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1917, the German Empire occupied the remaining Baltic provinces. The Ober Ost military administration began plans for German colonization of Courland. On April 20, 1917, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern front announced that 1/3 or arable land there should be reserved for settlement by German war veterans. This was approved by Courland's German nobility on September 22, 1917. =United Baltic Duchy= Livonian and Estonian nobles on January 28, 1918, delivered a note of independence to Soviet representatives in Stockholm, announcing their intent to break away from Russia under the rights granted to them by the Treaty of Nystad of 1721. In response Bolsheviks, who controlled Estonia, arrested 567 leading Germans and deported them to Russia. After signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk they were allowed to return. Under German-Soviet treaties, Germany gained control over Courland, Riga, Saaremaa (√ñsel), Livonia and Estonia. In spring of 1918, Baltic Germans announced the restoration of the independent Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and pursued plans for uniting it with the Kingdom of Prussia. On April 12, 1918, Baltic German representatives from all Baltic provinces met in Riga and called on the German Emperor to annex the Baltic lands. Later, instead of outright annexation, a plan for a United Baltic Duchy ruled by Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg was developed. Its regency council met on November 9, 1918, but collapsed together with the German Empire. Independent Baltic states The Baltic Germans' rule and class privileges came to the end with the demise of the Russian Empire (due to the Bolshevik revolution of October 1917) and the independence of Estonia and Latvia in 1918‚Äì1919. Baltic Germans greatly suffered under Bolshevik regimes in Estonia and Latvia. While short-lived, they pursued Red Terror against Germans, often killing them purely because of their nationality. After the collapse of the German Empire, Baltic Germans in Estonia began forming volunteer units to defend against the Bolshevik threat. On November 27, 1918 this was authorized by the Estonian government, and the Volunteer Baltic Battalion (Freiwilligen Baltenbataillon) was formed under the command of Colonel Constantin von Weiss (de). During the Estonian and Latvian independence wars of 1918‚Äì1920, many Baltic Germans signed voluntarily into the newly formed Estonian and Latvian armies to help secure the independence of these countries from Russia. These Baltic German military units became known as the Baltische Landeswehr in Latvia and Baltenregiment (de) in Estonia. The State archives of Estonia and Latvia keep individual military records of each person who fought in this war. Baltische Landeswehr units took Riga on May 22, 1919 which was followed by White Terror in which up to 2,000 people, mostly Latvians, were shot as suspected Bolshevik supporters. Baltic German outlying estates were frequent targets of local Bolsheviks (as portrayed in the film, Coup de Gr√¢ce) and the combination of local Bolsheviks and nationalists following independence brought about land nationalisations and a displacement of Baltic Germans from positions of authority. Baltic Germans of the Livonian Governorate found themselves in two new countries, both of which introduced sweeping agrarian reforms aimed at the large land owners, an absolute majority of whom were Germans. As a result of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent Russian Civil War, many Baltic Germans fled to Germany. After 1919, many Baltic Germans felt obliged to depart the newly independent states for Germany, but many stayed as ordinary citizens.Hiden, John, The Baltic States and Weimar Ostpolitik, Cambridge University Press, 1987, In 1925 there were 70,964 Germans in Latvia (3.6%) and 62,144 in 1935 (3.2% of population). Riga remained by far the largest German center with 38,523 Germans residing there in 1935, while Tallinn then had 6,575 Germans. While the German landed class soon lost most of their lands after the agrarian reforms, they continued to work in their professions and to lead their companies. German cultural autonomy was respected.http://www.estonica.org/en/Cultural_autonomy_of_national_minorities_and_cultural_self- government_in_the_Republic_of_Estonia/ The Committee of the German Baltic Parties in Latvia and Deutsch-baltische Partei in Estland in Estonia participated in elections and won seats. At the same time, as both young states built their institutions this often reduced the status of their minorities. In Latvia, children of mixed marriages were registered as Latvians while in Estonia they took the nationality of their fathers, who increasingly were Estonians. This quickly reduced the number of German children. German place names were eliminated from public use. German congregations lost their churches. Tallinn Cathedral was given to an Estonian congregation in 1927. After the 1923 referendum St. James's Cathedral in Riga was lost and Riga Cathedral taken away after another referendum in 1931. =Agrarian reforms= At the start of independence Baltic Germans owned 58% of land in Estonia and 48% in Latvia. Radical agrarian reforms were implemented in both countries to break German power and to distribute land to the veterans of independence wars and landless peasants. This largely destroyed the landed class of German noble families and their economic base. On October 10, 1919 the Estonian parliament expropriated 1,065 estates (96.6% of all estates). March 1, 1926 law set the compensation to the former owners of arable land at about 3% of its market value and no compensation at all for the forests. This almost instantly bankrupted the German noble class, even if they were allowed to keep some 50 ha of their lands. On September 16, 1920 the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia nationalized 1,300 estates with 3.7 million hectares of land. Former German owners were allowed to keep 50 ha of land and farm equipment. In 1924, the Saeima decided that no compensation would be paid to former owners. In 1929, the Saeima voted that veterans of the Baltische Landeswehr could not receive any land. =Estonia= In Estonia, there was only one German party, which from 1926 was led by Axel de Vries (de), editor of Revaler Bote. Their leading parliamentarian was Werner Hasselblatt (1890‚Äì1958). Germans never received ministerial posts in governments. The three largest minorities Germans, Swedes and Russians sometimes formed election coalitions. The Deutsch-baltische Partei in Estland was established to defend the interests of German landowners, who wanted to receive compensation for their nationalized lands and properties. After land nationalization they received no compensation, but could keep plots up to 50 ha which could not support their manor houses. Germans were banned from governmental and military positions. Many Germans sold their properties and emigrated to Scandinavia or Western Europe. Most of the grand manor houses were taken over by schools, hospitals, local administration and museums. Estonia's Baltic German population was smaller than Latvia's, so as Estonians continued to fill professional positions such as law and medicine, there was less of a leadership role for the Baltic Germans. Baron Wilhelm Wrangell, leader of the Baltic German cultural association between 1933 and 1938 was included in the Estonian Council of State after 1937 as a token representative of minorities. The last leader of Baltic German Cultural administration was Hellmuth Weiss. On February 12, 1925 Estonia adapted the Cultural Autonomy and national Minorities act which provided for some cultural autonomy of Germans. Despite this, German community in Estonia continued to decline as the majority of young people chose to emigrate. By 1934 there were 16.346 Baltic Germans in Estonia, 1.5% of the total population. Estonia allowed German schools in German language, they were overseen by the Gesellschaft Deutsche Schulhilfe, which was part of the Union of German Societies in Estonia. After adoption of the Minority law of February 5, 1925 the Baltic German Cultural Council was created on November 1, 1925. In 1928, German schools were attended by 3,456 pupils. =Latvia= Building of the Large Guild in Riga, 1918 In Latvia, Baltic Germans remained a politically active and organized ethnic group, although they lost some influence after the 1934 Latvian coup d'√©tat. A couple of times Germans received ministerial posts in coalition governments. Commander of Latvia's Navy between 1919 and 1931 was Admiral Archibald Count von Keyserling. Six, later seven, German parties existed and formed a coalition in the Saeima. The leading politicians were Baron Wilhelm Friedrich Karl von Fircks, leader of the Baltic-German People's Party and Paul Schiemann, editor in chief of the Rigasche Rundschau newspaper and leader of the Baltic-German Democratic Party. Increased activity of National Socialist supporters in the German community led to the resignation of Schiemann from the Rigasche Rundschau in 1933. Minority cultural affairs were overseen by the Ministry of Culture and the German section was led by pastor Karl Keller (1868‚Äì1939) and later by Dr. Wolfgang Wachtsmuth. In 1923, there were 12.168 pupils in German schools. The Herder Institute, a private German university with three faculties (Theology, Jurisprudence and Political Science and Philosophy) was established. In 1926, the German community introduced voluntary self-taxation, asking all Germans to contribute up to 3% of their monthly income to community activities. In 1928, the Baltic German National Community was established as the central representative body of Baltic Germans in Latvia. Educational autonomy of Germans was severely limited in 1931‚Äì1933, when the Minister of Education Atis ƒ∂eni≈Ü≈° introduced a policy of latvianization in minority schools. On July 18, 1934 the autonomous German schools were brought under complete control of the Ministry of Education. After the May 15, 1934 coup all associations and independent business organizations had to shut down, this affected the German community especially hard, as they lost their ancient communal centers ‚Äì guilds, and all of their property was nationalized. Then followed a wave of takeovers of Jewish, Russian and German businesses ‚Äì banks, factories and trading companies were purchased by state owned banks at set rates in order to reduce minority control over businesses.

One of the main conditions posed by Hitler to Stalin in August 1939 was the prior transfer of all ethnic Germans living in Estonia and Latvia to areas under German military control. These became known as the Nazi‚ÄìSoviet population transfers. Stalin proceeded to set up Soviet military bases in Estonia and Latvia in late 1939. In a speech to Reichstag on October 6, 1939 with was broadcast live on radio, Hitler announced that German minorities should be resettled in the Reich (Back home to Reich, heim ins Reich). Resettlement was overseen by Himmler who created a new Reich Commisariat for the Strengthening of Germandom for this purpose. Treaties were signed with Estonia and Latvia in 1939 and 1940 concerning the emigration of Baltic Germans and the liquidation of their educational, cultural, and religious institutions. Nazi Germany succeeded in getting the Baltic Germans to abandon their homes and homeland in haste. Due to the imposition of wartime rationing, Germans were banned from taking along any valuables, objects of historic value, fuels and even food. Massive sell- off of household items and small businesses followed. Larger properties, real estate and businesses were sold over a longer period of time by a special German commission to local governments. *Some 13,700 Baltic Germans were resettled from Estonia by early 1940. *Around 51,000 Baltic Germans were resettled from Latvia by early 1940. The Estonian and Latvian governments published books containing alphabetical lists of the names of resettled Baltic German adults together with their birthdate, birthplace and last address in the Baltics.Eestist saksamaale √ºmberasunute nimestik/Verzeichnis der aus Estland nach Deutschland Umgesiedelten, Oskar Angelus, Tallinn 1939; \\"Izceƒºoju≈°o vƒÅcu tautƒ´bas pilso≈Üu saraksts\\" : \\"The list of resettled citizens of German ethnicity\\".1940 Baltic Germans left by ships from the port cities of Estonia and Latvia to ports of Gotenhafen and Stettin and then were transported to Posen and Lodz in Reichsgau Wartheland (sometimes called Warthegau) and other Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany. The \\"new\\" homes and farms they were given to live in had been owned and inhabited by Poles and Jews just a few months earlier who were executed or deported eastwards when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. The new arrivals fulfilled Nazi plans for ethnic Germanization of these lands. =Spring 1941 resettlement= In early 1941, the Nazi German government arranged another resettlement for all those who had refused to leave in 1939 or 1940. The action was called the Nachumsiedlung. This time around no compensation was offered for any property or belongings left behind and this group of resettlers were treated with intense suspicion or considered traitors because they had refused Hitler's first call to leave the Baltics in 1939. Most of these arrivals were first settled in filtration camps. Unknown to the general public, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union was only 2 to 4 months away, and this was Hitler's last chance to transfer these people in peacetime conditions. By this time, the remaining Baltic Germans in Estonia and Latvia found themselves in a vastly different situation than in 1939. Their countries were now occupied by the Soviet Union, and intense pressure and intimidation had been put on anyone with a position of privilege or wealth before 1939. Mass arrests and some killings had taken place. Fearing a worsening of the situation, the vast majority of the remaining Baltic Germans decided to leave. About 7,000 resettled from Estonia by late March 1941, and approximately 10,500 resettled from Latvia by late March 1941. No books were published listing those who resettled in 1941; however, the present-day archives of Estonia and Latvia still have the lists of all those who left in this year. =1941‚Äì1944= A very small minority of Baltic Germans refused again to be resettled and remained in the Baltics past March 1941. Some fell victim to the Soviet deportations to Siberian gulags beginning in early June 1941. The names and data of those deported from Estonia from 1941 to 1953 have been published in books. Details are kept at the Museum of Occupations in Estonia. After the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union and the conquering of Latvia and Estonia, a small number of Baltic Germans were allowed to return in order to serve as translators, but requests of many resettled Germans to be allowed to return to their homelands were denied by Himmler's SS. Many German Baltic men were mobilized in the occupied Warthegau and served in the German army. The resettled Germans fled west with the retreating German army in 1944. No precise numbers or lists are available for them. However, several thousand Baltic Germans remained in the Baltics after 1944, but they were subject to widespread discrimination (and possible deportation to Siberia until 1953) by the Soviet authorities ruling Estonia and Latvia. As a result of this, many hid or lied about their Baltic German origins. Most of those who stayed past 1944 were children of mixed ethnic marriages or themselves married to ethnic Estonians, Latvians or Russians and their descendants no longer consider themselves German. =\\"Second resettlement\\" 1945= The Soviet Union's advance into Poland and Germany in late 1944 and early 1945 resulted in the Baltic Germans being evacuated by the German authorities (or simply fleeing) from their \\"new homes\\" to areas even further in the west to escape the advancing Red Army. Most of them settled in West Germany, with some ending up in East Germany. In stark contrast to the resettlements in 1939‚Äì1941, this time around the evacuation in most of the areas was delayed until the last moment, when it was too late to conduct it in an orderly fashion, and practically all of them had to leave most of their belongings behind. Seeing as they had only been living in these \\"new\\" homes for only about five years, this was almost seen as a second forced resettlement for them, albeit under different circumstances. Many Baltic Germans were on board the KdF Ship Wilhelm Gustloff when it was sunk by a Soviet submarine on January 30, 1945. By one estimate,\\"Wilhelm Gustloff: World's Deadliest Sea Disasters\\". Unsolved History, The Discovery Channel. Season 1, Episode 14. (Original air date: March 26, 2003) About 9,400 people on board died, which would make it the largest loss of life in a single ship sinking in history. Additionally, many Baltic Germans died during the sinking of the SS General von Steuben on February 10, 1945. Two books listing the names and personal data of all Baltic Germans who died as a result of the resettlements and wartime conditions between 1939 and 1947 have been published by the Baltic German genealogical society: Deutsch-baltisches Gedenkbuch. Unsere Toten der Jahre 1939‚Äì1947 by Karin von Borb√©ly, Darmstadt, 1991; and Nachtrag zum Deutsch-baltisches Gedenkbuch by Karin von Borb√©ly, Darmstadt, 1995. With Estonia and Latvia falling under Soviet rule after 1944, most Baltic Germans did not return to the Soviet occupied Baltics. =Canada= Many thousands of Baltic Germans emigrated to Canada starting in 1948 with the support of Canadian Governor General The Earl Alexander of Tunis, who had known many Baltic Germans when he had commanded the Baltic German Landeswehr for a short time in 1919. Initially only 12 Germans were allowed to settle in 1948. Based on the good behavior of this group, many thousands of Baltic Germans were soon allowed to immigrate during the following years. A small group of Latvians and Baltic Germans emigrated to Newfoundland as part of then Premier Joseph Smallwood's New Industries Program. Several families in Corner Brook built, operated and worked in the cement and gypsum plants that provided essential material for the creation of Newfoundland's infrastructure after Confederation. Destruction of cultural heritage in the Soviet Baltics (1945‚Äì1989) Some better preserved tombstones in Riga's Great Cemetery. During the 50-year-long occupation of the Baltic states, Soviet occupation authorities governing the Estonian SSR and the Latvian SSR, politically empowered by their victory in World War II, were keen to erase any traces of ethnic German rule in past centuries.Oƒüuzhan, Mehmet, 'Russification policies imposed on the Baltic people by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union', 2012. Numerous statues, monuments, structures or landmarks with German writing were destroyed, vandalized or left to ruin. The largest Baltic German cemeteries in Estonia, Kopli cemetery and M√µigu cemetery, both standing since 1774, were completely destroyed by the Soviet authorities. Great Cemetery of Riga, the largest burial ground of Baltic Germans in Latvia standing since 1773, also had the vast majority of its graves destroyed by the Soviets. 1989 to present The present-day governments of Estonia and Latvia, who regained their independence in 1991, generally take a positive, or sometimes neutral, view towards the contributions of the Baltic Germans in the development of their cities and countries throughout their history. An occasional exception to this comes with some criticism in relation to the major landowners, who controlled most of the rural areas of the Baltics, and the ethnic Estonians and Latvians, until 1918. After Estonia regained independence from the Soviet Union on August 20, 1991, the exiled association of the German Baltic nobility sent an official message to the president-to-be Lennart Meri that no member of the association would claim proprietary rights to their former Estonian lands. This, and the fact that the first German ambassadors to Estonia and Latvia were both Baltic Germans, helped to further reconcile the Baltic Germans with these two countries. Cooperation between Baltic German societies and the governments of Estonia and Latvia has made the restoration of many small Baltic German plaques and landmarks possible, such as monuments to those who fought in the 1918‚Äì1920 War of Independence. Since 1989, many elderly Baltic Germans, or their descendants, have taken holidays to Estonia and Latvia to look for traces of their own past, their ancestral homes, and their family histories. Most of the remaining manor houses have new owners, and operate as hotels that are open to the public. Notable Baltic Germans Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly. Russia postage stamp, 2011 Baltic Germans played leading roles in the society of what are now Estonia and Latvia throughout most of the period from 13th to mid-20th century, with many of them becoming noted scientists, including Maximilian Theodor Buch aswell Karl Ernst von Baer, and explorers. A number of Baltic Germans served as ranking generals in the Russian Imperial Army and Navy, including Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, Adam Johann von Krusenstern, Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden, Paul von Rennenkampf and Franz Eduard von Totleben. Many Baltic Germans (such as Eugen M√ºller and Prince Anatol von Lieven) sided with the Whites and related anti-Bolshevik forces (like the Baltische Landeswehr and the Freikorps movement) during the Russian Civil War.

Starring Brooks, Bill Pullman, John Candy and Rick Moranis, the film also features Daphne Zuniga, Dick Van Patten, George Wyner and the voice of Joan Rivers. In addition to Brooks in a supporting role, the film also features Brooks regulars Dom DeLuise and Rudy De Luca in cameo appearances. The film's setting and characters parody the original Star Wars trilogy, as well as other sci-fi franchises and popular films including Star Trek, Alien, The Wizard of Oz, 2001, and the Planet of the Apes. It was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on June 24, 1987, and was met with a mixed reception. It has since become a cult classic and one of Brooks's most popular films. Plot Planet Spaceball, led by the incompetent President Skroob, has squandered all of its fresh air. Skroob schemes to force King Roland of the neighboring planet Druidia to give them the code to the shield that protects Druidia, allowing them to steal all their air, by kidnapping his daughter Princess Vespa on the day of her arranged marriage to the narcoleptic Prince Valium. Skroob sends the villainous Dark Helmet to complete this task with Spaceball One, an impossibly huge ship helmed by Colonel Sandurz. Before they can arrive, Vespa abandons her wedding and flees the planet in her Mercedes spaceship with her droid of honor, Dot Matrix. Roland contacts mercenary Lone Starr and his mawg (half-man, half-dog) sidekick Barf, offering a lucrative reward to retrieve Vespa before she is captured. Lone Starr readily accepts, as he is in major debt with the gangster Pizza the Hutt. In their Winnebago spaceship, Eagle 5, Lone Starr and Barf are able to reach Vespa before Spaceball One, rescue both her and Dot, then escape. Spaceball One tries to follow at light-speed, but Helmet orders the ship to \\"ludicrous speed\\", causing it to overshoot the escapees by a large distance. Out of fuel, Lone Starr is forced to crash-land on the nearby \\"desert moon of Vega\\". The escapees travel on foot in blazing sun and pass out. They are found by the Dinks, a group of diminutive sparkly brown-clad aliens, and are taken to a cave occupied by a sage named Yogurt. Yogurt introduces Lone Starr to \\"the Schwartz\\", a metaphysical power parodying the Force. Yogurt also introduces the audience to the film's merchandising campaign. Starr and Vespa begin to flirt, but Vespa insists she can only be married to a prince. Helmet and Sandurz break the fourth wall by using a VHS copy of Spaceballs to discover Vespa's location, and Helmet orders Spaceball One to the moon. The Spaceballs capture Vespa and Dot, and return with them to planet Spaceball. Their captors threaten to reverse Vespa's nose job, forcing Roland to give the code to the shield that protects Druidia. Helmet and Sandurz take Spaceball One to Druidia, while Lone Starr and Barf rescue Vespa and Dot from the Spaceballs prison complex. When they arrive at Druidia, Spaceball One transforms into Mega Maid, a Statue of Liberty-like colossal robotic maid with a vacuum cleaner. The vacuum is then turned on, sucking the air off the planet. When the vacuum bag is almost full, Lone Starr uses the Schwartz to reverse the vacuum, blowing the air back onto the planet. Once the air is returned to the planet, Lone Starr and his allies enter Mega Maid and attempt to destroy it. Lone Starr is forced to fight Helmet with lightsaber- like \\"Schwartz rings\\" near the ship's self-destruct button. Lone Starr defeats Helmet, causing him to involuntarily strike the button. Lone Starr and his friends escape the ship, while Skroob, Helmet, and Sandurz fail to reach any escape pods in time, trapping them in the robot's head as the ship explodes. They subsequently crash-land on a nearby planet, much to the chagrin of its Planet of the Apes-like population, and possibly giving a second meaning to that film's ending. With Lone Starr's debt to Pizza nullified by the gangster's untimely death, he returns Vespa to Roland and leaves, taking only enough money to cover his expenses. After a lunch break at a diner, and a strange incident involving an alien and an astronaut similar to the events in Alien, Lone Starr finds a final message from Yogurt, informing him that he is a prince, and thus eligible to marry Vespa. He reaches Druidia in time to stop her wedding to Valium, announces his royal lineage, then marries Vespa.

Various actors and comedians appear in unnamed roles, with Sal Viscuso, Michael Pniewski, Stephen Tobolowsky, Robert Prescott, Tom Dreesen, Rick Ducommun, Rob Paulsen, Tommy Swerdlow and Tim Russ all appearing as soldiers of Dark Helmet. Additional unnamed appearances include Ronny Graham as the wedding minister, Dey Young as a waitress, Jack Riley as a newsman, Ken Olfson as the head usher, Bryan O'Byrne as an organist and Brenda Strong as a nurse. Denise Gallup as Charlene, Dian Gallup as Marlene, Ed Gale, Felix Silla, Tony Cox, Antonio Hoyos, Arturo Gil and John Kennedy Hayden appear as the Dinks (based on the Jawas). Production When Brooks developed Spaceballs, he wanted his parody to be as close to the original as possible. Even though the Yogurt character (Mel Brooks) mentions merchandising in the film, Brooks's deal with George Lucas on parodying Star Wars was that no Spaceballs action figures be made. According to Brooks, \\"[Lucas] said, 'Your [action figures] are going to look like mine.' I said OK.\\" Brooks also had Lucas's company handle the post-production, saying, \\"I was playing ball with the people who could have said no.\\" Lucas later sent Brooks a note saying how much he loved the film, including its story structure, and that he \\"was afraid [he] would bust something from laughing\\". Pullman got the part of Lone Starr when Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft saw him in a play‚Äîhe had never seen Star Wars prior to filming. Brooks had been unsuccessfully trying to sign on big-name actors such as Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks for the film. Pullman said, > I think [Mel] was hurt that they didn't take him up on it ... but then it > attract[ed] two of the big comics at that time: John Candy and Rick Moranis. > Once that was secured, then he said, \\"Heck, I'll get somebody nobody knows!\\" > And I got a chance to do it. Zuniga initially found Brooks's film parodies \\"too crass and not too funny\\", but after working with Brooks, she said, \\"I have this image of Mel as totally wacko and out to lunch. And he is. But he's also really perceptive, real sensitive in ways that make actors respond.\\" Music An official soundtrack was released on Atlantic Records on LP, CD, and cassette, featuring many of the songs heard in the film, as well as three score cues by frequent Brooks collaborator John Morris. The track list is as follows: # \\"Spaceballs Main Title Theme\\" ‚Äì John Morris # \\"My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own\\" ‚Äì Jeffrey Osborne and Kim Carnes; the song was made into a hit in 1990 by Sally Moore (U.S. AC #42). # \\"Heartstrings\\" ‚Äì Berlin # \\"Spaceballs Love Theme\\" (Instrumental) ‚Äì John Morris # \\"The Winnebago Crashes\\"/\\"The Spaceballs Build Mega-Maid\\" ‚Äì John Morris # \\"Spaceballs\\" ‚Äì The Spinners # \\"Hot Together\\" ‚Äì The Pointer Sisters # \\"Good Enough\\" ‚Äì Van Halen # \\"Wanna Be Loved By You\\" ‚Äì Ladyfire # \\"Highway Star\\" ‚Äì Deep Purple # \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" ‚Äì Queen # \\"Raise Your Hands\\" (hidden track) ‚Äì Bon Jovi In 2006, La-La Land Records released Spaceballs - The 19th Anniversary Edition CD of the film's score, with bonus tracks of alternate takes and tracks not used in the film. Release =Box office= The film had an estimated $22.7 million budget, and ultimately grossed $38,119,483 during its run in the United States, taking in $6,613,837 on its opening weekend, finishing behind Dragnet. =Critical reception= A helmet from the film at a convention in Stockholm The film has received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that, as of 2020, 57% of critics have given positive reviews based on 40 reviews with an average rating of 6.39/10. The site's consensus reads; \\"There's fine spoofery and amusing characters in Spaceballs, though it's a far cry from Mel Brooks's peak era.\\" At another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 46%, based on 14 reviews. Many critics agreed that, while it was funny, doing a Star Wars parody ten years after the original film had been released seemed pointless. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and remarked \\"I enjoyed a lot of the movie, but I kept thinking I was at a revival‚Ä¶it should have been made several years ago, before our appetite for Star Wars satires had been completely exhausted.\\" The film won Worst Picture at the 1987 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards. =Home media= Spaceballs was first made available on VHS and LaserDisc in February 1988; they were re-released in the late 1990s. The VHS edition was issued twice; the latter edition was presented in widescreen. Meanwhile, the laserdisc also gained a commentary track with Brooks; this was transferred over to the DVD and Blu-ray releases. The film was first released on DVD on April 25, 2000. This version also contained \\"the making of...\\" documentary and a collectible \\"making-of\\" booklet. The film was then released in the \\"Collectors Edition\\" on May 3, 2005. This edition contained more extras including the documentary and the video conversation about the making of the film with Brooks and Thomas Meehan. On August 7, 2012, the \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\" was released on Blu-ray containing many of the same bonus features as the 2005 DVD release with the addition of a new featurette. Animated series and possible sequel Spaceballs was developed into an animated television show which debuted in September 2008 as Spaceballs: The Animated Series on G4 (US) and Super Channel (Canada). Moranis claimed in a 2013 interview that he and Brooks had discussed a potential sequel, with Moranis pitching the title Spaceballs III: The Search for Spaceballs II. However, he and Brooks were unable to structure a deal that would allow the project to move forward. In February 2015, Brooks said that he would like to make a sequel to be released after the next Star Wars film and hopes that Moranis would reprise his role. This proposed film, Brooks said, may be called Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money. However, in February 2020, Bill Pullman said during an interview with Daily Blast Live, \\"It's up to Mel. Ask him if he has too much money and that's why he doesn't do it.\\" Impact Spaceballs has made an impact on popular culture and been used as a referent and inspiration in other properties. Tesla Motors has used Spaceballs' starship speeds (Light Speed, Ridiculous Speed, Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed) as inspiration for naming their acceleration modes. In homage to Spaceballs, Tesla has Ludicrous Mode for acceleration beyond its Insane Mode, and Plaid Mode, overtop Ludicrous. As part of its merchandising, The Boring Company sold 20,000 \\"flamethrowers\\" in 2018 inspired by the Spaceballs merchandising scene. Props A -scale model of the Winnebago, Eagle 5, was auctioned on December 11, 2018. The model was created by film special effects designer, Grant McCune, who also created models for Star Wars and Star Trek. The model makes an appearance early in the film with the introduction of Barf and Lone Starr. The model, along with other special effects artifacts from then-current films such as Masters of the Universe and Jaws: The Revenge, was displayed at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry in the summer of 1988.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1988-07-22-8801160797-story.html References External links   * Category:1987 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1980s adventure films Category:1980s parody films Category:1980s science fiction comedy films Category:American adventure comedy films Category:American buddy films Category:American science fiction comedy films Category:American space adventure films Category:American parody films Category:American robot films Category:American satirical films Category:Faster-than-light travel in fiction Category:Films about royalty Category:Films about extraterrestrial life Category:Films adapted into television shows Category:Films set on fictional planets Category:Films featuring puppetry Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in Arizona Category:Films shot in Germany Category:Flying cars in fiction Category:Jewish comedy and humor Category:Parody films based on Star Wars Category:Self-reflexive films Category:Teleportation in fiction Category:Films directed by Mel Brooks Category:Films produced by Mel Brooks Category:Films scored by John Morris Category:Films with screenplays by Mel Brooks Category:Films with screenplays by Thomas Meehan (writer) Category:Films set in fictional galaxies Category:Films set in outer space Category:Brooksfilms films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:1987 comedy films ","title":"Spaceballs"},{"id":"75223","text":"Attila (406‚Äì453) was a king of the Huns in the 5th century.

Originally named the \\"Linc\\", suggesting the project's origins at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, it was renamed LINC after the project moved from the Lincoln Laboratory. The LINC was designed by Wesley A. Clark and Charles Molnar. The LINC and other \\"MIT Group\\" machines were designed at MIT and eventually built by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and Spear Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts (later a division of Becton, Dickinson and Company). The LINC sold for more than $40,000 at the time. A typical configuration included an enclosed 6'X20\\" rack; four boxes holding (1) two tape drives, (2) display scope and input knobs, (3) control console and (4) data terminal interface; and a keyboard. The LINC interfaced well with laboratory experiments. Analog inputs and outputs were part of the basic design. It was designed in 1962 by Charles Molnar and Wesley Clark at Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts,presentations at The Computer Museum, Marlborough, in the hands of its successor, The Computer History Museum for NIH researchers. The LINC's design was literally in the public domain, perhaps making it unique in the history of computers. A dozen LINC computers were assembled by their eventual biomedical researchers in a 1963 summer workshop at MIT. Digital Equipment Corporation (starting in 1964) and Spear Inc. of Waltham, MA.E.C.

Gordon Bell writing in Computer Engineering a DEC View of Hardware Systems Designs (c) Copyright originally held by Digital Press, out of print but available at Bell's web sites, pp 176‚Äì177 states that the LINC project began in 1961, with first delivery in March 1962, and the machine was not formally withdrawn until December 1969. A total of 50 were built (all using DEC System Module Blocks and cabinets), most at Lincoln Labs, housing the desktop instruments in four wooden racks. The first LINC included two oscilloscope displays. Twenty-one were sold by DEC at $43,600 (), delivered in the Production Model design. In these, the tall cabinet sitting behind a white Formica-covered table held two somewhat smaller metal boxes holding the same instrumentation, a Tektronix display oscilloscope over the \\"front panel\\" on the user's left, a bay for interfaces over two LINC-Tape drives on the user's right, and a chunky keyboard between them. The standard program development software (an assembler/editor) was designed by Mary Allen Wilkes; the last version was named LAP6 (LINC Assembly Program 6). Architecture The LINC had 2048 12-bit words of memory in two sections. Only the first 1024 words were usable for program execution. The second section of memory could only be used for data. Programs could use a 12-bit accumulator and a one-bit link register. The first sixteen locations in program memory had special functions. Location 0 supported the single-level of subroutine call, automatically being updated with a return address on every jump instruction. The next fifteen locations could used as index registers by one of the addressing modes. A programmable, six-bit relay register was intended for use by external instruments. A later modification to the LINC added a 12-bit Z register to facilitate extended precision arithmetic, and an interrupt was provided forcing execution to location 21 (octal). Alphanumeric input/output devices included a dedicated keyboard, and the ability to display text on the attached bit-mapped CRT. A teleprinter could be connected for printed output. Arithmetic was ones' complement, which meant that there were representations for \\"plus zero\\" and \\"minus zero\\". The original LINC required 8 microseconds for each instruction. =Instruction set= The natural notation used for the LINC was octal. In this section, all numbers are given as base ten unless identified as octal. The LINC instruction set was designed for ease of use with scientific instruments or custom experimental apparatus. * Miscellaneous class, no address - Halt, clear accumulator, enable tape mark write gate, transfer accumulator to relay register, read relay register to accumulator, no operation, complement accumulator * Shift class, no address (all operate on the accumulator and optionally the link bit) - rotate left, rotate right, scale right (replicates sign bit), * Full address class, two word instructions. immediate address given in second 12-bit word of the opcode - add, store and clear accumulator, jump. Only the first 1024 words of memory can be accessed. * Skip class, skips the next instruction, can test for set or clear condition. Conditions are: external logic line (14 input lines could be tested), key struck, one of five sense switches, accumulator positive, link bit zero, or active tape unit in an interblock zone. Later models added skip on bit 0 of the Z register, skip on overflow, and skip on interrupt paused. * Index class - these instructions could either have a second word that was the immediate operand, or that specified the operand address, or that specified one of the registers 01 through 15 (decimal) as holding the address of the operand. The address was incremented. These instructions included load or add to accumulator, add accumulator to memory, add accumulator with carry to memory, multiply (producing a 22 bit signed product), skip if equal, skip and rotate, bit clear, bit set, and bit complement. Another instruction in this group was to display a bit map, to represent a character or other data, on the built-in CRT display screen. * Half-word class - instructions operating on the lower or upper six bits of a word. These included load half, store half, skip if halves are different, * Set - moves data from any memory location to one of the locations 1 through 15. * Sample - reads one of the sixteen 8-bit analog to digital converters and places the signed value in the accumulator. The first eight A/D channels were dedicated to control panel knobs to allow interaction with a running program by the user. The instruction could either hold the computer till a conversion result was ready, or allow more instructions to be executed provided they didn't rely on the contents of the accumulator, which would be overwritten by the A/D conversion value. * Display - draws a pixel on one of the CRT displays at a specified location, optionally indexing a register. * Index and skip - adds one to one of the memory locations 1 through 15, and skips if a 10-bit overflow occurs. * Operate class, used for input/output operations. These included set a bit on one of 14 output lines, read the keyboard, or read the left or right switch bank. * Tape class, with opcodes to position the tape, read or write to the tape, and to check the tape against memory.  Control panel  The LINC control panel was used for single-stepping through programs and for program debugging. Execution could be stopped when the program counter matched a set of switches. Another function allowed execution to be stopped when a particular address was accessed. The single-step and the resume functions could be automatically repeated. The repetition rate could be varied over four orders of magnitude by means of an analog knob and a four-position decade switch, from about one step per second to about half of the full speed. Running a program at one step per second and gradually accelerating it to full speed provided an extremely dramatic way to experience and appreciate the speed of the computer.  LINCtape  A noteworthy feature of the LINC was the LINCtape. It was a fundamental part of the machine design, not an optional peripheral, and the machine's OS relied on it. The LINCtape can be compared to a linear diskette with a slow seek time. The magnetic tape drives on large machines of the day stored large quantities of data, took minutes to spool from end to end, but could not reliably update blocks of data in place. In contrast, the LINCtape was a small, nimble device which stored about 400K, had a fixed formatting track allowing data to be repeatedly read and re-written to the same locations, and took less than a minute to spool from one end to the other. The tape was formatted in fixed-sized blocks, and was used to hold a directory and file system. A single hardware instruction could seek and then read or write multiple tape blocks all in one operation. Filenames were six characters long. The file system allowed for two files‚Äîa source file and an executable binary file to be stored under the same name. In effect it was a 6.1 filename in which the extension was restricted to \\"S\\" or \\"B\\". Since the basic LINC had only 1024 12-bit words of core memory (RAM)and the big, expanded LINC had only 2048‚Äînormal operations depended heavily on swapping to and from LINCtape. (Digital later patented and marketed a similar design under the name DECtape; Digital's patents on DECtape were eventually tested in court and found invalid). LINCtape is also remembered for its reliability, which was higher than that of the diskettes which supplanted it. LINCtape incorporated a very simple form of redundancy‚Äîall data was duplicated in two locations across the tape. LINC users demonstrated this by punching holes in a tape with an ordinary office paper punch. Tape damaged in this way was perfectly readable. The formatting track made operation almost independent of tape speed, which was, in fact, quite variable. There was no capstan; the motion of the tape during reading and writing was directly controlled by the reel motors. There was no fast forward or rewindreading and writing was performed at fast forward and rewind speeds. In some modes of operation, the data transfers were audible over the built-in loudspeaker and produced a very characteristic series of harsh bird-like squawks with varying pitch.  Keyboard  The LINC keyboard, manufactured by company named Soroban Engineering, had a unique locking solenoid. The internal mechanism of each key had a slot that worked with a set of bars to encode the character and another slot that caught a locking bar, which locked all the keys in one mechanical movement of the locking solenoid. When the user pressed a key, the pressed key was locked in its down position, and all the other keys were locked in the up position. When the running program read the keyboard, the lock was released, and the pressed key would pop back up. This could have the effect of slowing down typing and preventing even 2-key rollover. This exotic keyboard was abandoned in favor of Teletype keyboards, such as the Model 35 KSR and Model 37 KSR, in the LINC-8 and PDP-12 follow-on computers.  Knobs  The rotary knobs on the front panel could be used as a dial box. (Photo of LINC-8) The LINC included a set of eight three-turn potentiometers (numbered 0-7) that could be each be read by a computer instruction. The dial box was a convenient user input device at a time before general adoption of the mouse. For example, one knob could control the scaling of a displayed graph, and another might be used as a cursor to display the actual data value at a point.  Text display  The capital letter M as it was displayed in a 4 by 6 character cell on the LINC screen The LINC hardware allowed a 12-bit word to be rapidly and automatically displayed on the screen as a 4-wide by 6-high matrix of pixels, making it possible to display full screens of flicker-free text with a minimum of dedicated hardware. The standard display routines generated 4 by 6 character cells, giving the LINC one of the coarsest character sets ever designed. The display screen was a CRT about 5 inches square which was actually a standard Tektronix oscilloscope with special plug-in amplifiers. The special plug-ins could be replaced with standard oscilloscope plug-ins for use in diagnostic maintenance of the computer. Many LINCs were supplied as kits to be assembled by the end user, so the oscilloscope came in handy. The CRT used a very long- persistence white or yellow phosphor, so that lines and curves drawn point-by- point at a relatively slow speed would remain visible throughout programmed drawing loops that frequently lasted half a second or more. The y-axis displayed both plus and minus zero as different values, unnecessarily reflecting the fact that the LINC used ones' complement arithmetic. Programmers quickly learned to move any negative displayed data up one point to hide the artifact that otherwise tended to appear at y=0. Notoriously, a tight loop that displayed points repetitively in one place on the screen would burn a permanent dark hole in the delicate phosphor in well under a minute; programmers had to be ready to hit the Stop lever fast if a very bright spot suddenly appeared because of a programming mistake.  Teletype output  Printed output on a Teletype Model 33 ASR was controlled by a single pole relay. A subroutine would convert the LINC character codes into ASCII and use timing loops to toggle the relay on and off, generating the correct 8-bit output to control the Teletype printer.  Laboratory interface  The LINC connector module included bays for two plug-in chassis allowing custom interfacing to experimental setups. Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters were built into the computer and each could be accessed by a single machine instruction. Six relays were also available. Variants In addition to the original \\"classic\\" LINC, slight programming variations occurred when using the micro-LINC (Œº-LINC Alt URL) (1965), micro-LINC 300 (Œº-LINC 300) (1968) (integrated circuit [MECL] versions), Alt URL and LINC-8. There were variations in the input/output equipment, access to memory. Later models had a faster clock speed. LINC-8 and PDP-12 computers PDP-12 computer at the First Vintage Computer Festival East While Bell in his book says designing the LINC provided the ideas for DEC's second and third machines, the PDP-4 and the PDP-5. Digital Equipment Corporation would launch the extremely successful PDP-8 before it manufactured the first next-generation LINC-compatible computer, the LINC-8 and a combination PDP-8/I and LINC, combined as the PDP-12. DEC's final 12-bit lab machine, the Lab-8/E, incorporated the LINC instruction set. . The first follow-on, the LINC-8, booted (slowly) to a PDP-8 program called PROGOFOP (PROGram OF OPeration) which interfaced to the separate LINC hardware. The PDP-12 was the last and most popular follow-on to the LINC. It was a capable and improved machine, and was more stable than the LINC-8, but architecturally was still an imperfect hybrid of a LINC and a PDP-8, full of many small technical glitches. (For example, the LINC had an overflow bit which was a small but important part of the LINC's machine state; the PDP-12 had no provision for saving and restoring the state of this bit across PDP-8 interrupts.) MINC-11 computer Digital produced a version of the PDP-11/03 called the MINC-11, housed in a portable cart, and equipable with Digital-designed laboratory I/O modules supporting capabilities such as analog input and output. A programming language, MINC BASIC, included integrated support for the laboratory I/O modules. MINC stood for \\"Modular Instrument Computer.\\" The name undoubtedly was intended to evoke memories of the LINC, but the 16-bit machine had no architectural resemblance to, or compatibility with, the LINC.

It was first published in 1973, and translated into English, and French, the following year. It covers life in what is often known as the Gulag, the Soviet forced labour camp system, through a narrative constructed from various sources including reports, interviews, statements, diaries, legal documents, and Solzhenitsyn's own experience as a Gulag prisoner. In Russian, the term GULAG (–ì–£–õ–ê–ì) is an acronym for Main Directorate of Camps (). Following its publication, the book initially circulated in samizdat underground publication in the Soviet Union until its appearance in the literary journal Novy Mir in 1989, in which a third of the work was published in three issues. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, The Gulag Archipelago has been officially published in Russia. An abridged fiftieth anniversary edition was released on 1 November 2018 with a new foreword by Jordan Peterson.  Structure  Structurally, the text comprises seven sections divided (in most printed editions) into three volumes: parts 1‚Äì2, parts 3‚Äì4, and parts 5‚Äì7. At one level, the Gulag Archipelago traces the history of the system of forced labor camps that existed in the Soviet Union from 1918 to 1956. Solzhenitsyn begins with Vladimir Lenin's original decrees which were made shortly after the October Revolution; they established the legal and practical framework for a series of camps where political prisoners and ordinary criminals would be sentenced to forced labor. The book then describes and discusses the waves of purges and the assembling of show trials in the context of the development of the greater Gulag system; Solzhenitsyn gives particular attention to its purposive legal and bureaucratic development. The narrative ends in 1956 at the time of Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech (\\"On the Personality Cult and its Consequences\\"). Khrushchev gave the speech at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, denouncing Stalin's personality cult, his autocratic power, and the surveillance that pervaded the Stalin era. Although Khrushchev's speech was not published in the Soviet Union for a long time, it was a break with the most atrocious practices of the Gulag system. Despite the efforts by Solzhenitsyn and others to confront the legacy of the Gulag, the realities of the camps remained a taboo subject until the 1980s. Solzhenitsyn was also aware that although many practices had been stopped, the basic structure of the system had survived and it could be revived and expanded by future leaders. While Khrushchev, the Communist Party, and the Soviet Union's supporters in the West viewed the Gulag as a deviation of Stalin, Solzhenitsyn and many among the opposition tended to view it as a systemic fault of Soviet political culture ‚Äì an inevitable outcome of the Bolshevik political project. Parallel to this historical and legal narrative, Solzhenitsyn follows the typical course of a zek (a slang term for an inmate), derived from the widely used abbreviation \\"z/k\\" for zakliuchennyi (\\"prisoner\\") through the Gulag, starting with arrest, show trial, and initial internment; transport to the \\"archipelago\\"; the treatment of prisoners and their general living conditions; slave labor gangs and the technical prison camp system; camp rebellions and strikes (see Kengir uprising); the practice of internal exile following the completion of the original prison sentence; and the ultimate (but not guaranteed) release of the prisoner. Along the way, Solzhenitsyn's examination details the trivial and commonplace events of an average prisoner's life, as well as specific and noteworthy events during the history of the Gulag system, including revolts and uprisings. Solzhenitsyn also states: There had been works about the Soviet prison/camp system before, and its existence had been known to the Western public since the 1930s. However, never before had the general reading public been brought face to face with the horrors of the Gulag in this way. The controversy surrounding this text, in particular, was largely due to the way Solzhenitsyn definitively and painstakingly laid the theoretical, legal, and practical origins of the Gulag system at Lenin's feet, not Stalin's. According to Solzhenitsyn's testimony, Stalin merely amplified a concentration camp system that was already in place. This is significant, as many Western intellectuals viewed the Soviet concentration camp system as a \\"Stalinist aberration\\".  Publication  After the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn's materials in Moscow, during 1965‚Äì1967, the preparatory drafts of The Gulag Archipelago were turned into finished typescript, sometimes in hiding at his friends' homes in the Moscow region and elsewhere. While held at the KGB's Lubyanka Prison in 1945, Solzhenitsyn had befriended Arnold Susi, a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education, who had been taken captive after the Soviet Union occupied Estonia in 1944. Solzhenitsyn entrusted Susi with the original typed and proofread manuscript of the finished work, after copies had been made of it both on paper and on microfilm.Solzhenitsyn, The Oak and the Calf and Invisible Allies Arnold Susi's daughter, Heli Susi, subsequently kept the \\"master copy\\" hidden from the KGB in Estonia until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1973 the KGB seized one of only three existing copies of the text still on Soviet soil. This was achieved after interrogating Elizaveta Voronyanskaya, one of Solzhenitsyn's trusted typistsSolzhenitsyn, Literary Giant Who Defied Soviets Dies at 89 who knew where the typed copy was hidden; within days of her release by the KGB she was found hanged in the stairwell of her apartment; she had apparently either hanged herself or been murdered (3 August 1973).Thomas, 1998, p. 398. Although he had earlier wanted it published in Russia first, after Solzhenitsyn learned of her death, he decided the next month, September, to allow its publication in Paris. The first edition of the work was published (in Russian) by the French publishing house √âditions du Seuil a few days after Christmas 1973;Scammell, Solzhenitsyn, a Biography, 1985 they had received a go-ahead from Solzhenitsyn but had decided to release the work about ten days earlier than he had expected. News of the nature of the work immediately caused a stir, and translations into many other languages followed within the next few months, sometimes produced in a race against time. American Thomas Whitney produced the English version; the English and French translations of Volume I appeared in the spring and summer of 1974. Solzhenitsyn had wanted the manuscript to be published in Russia first, but knew this was impossible under conditions then extant. The work had a profound effect internationally. Not only did it provoke energetic debate in the West; a mere six weeks after the work had left Parisian presses Solzhenitsyn himself was forced into exile. Because possession of the manuscript incurred the risk of a long prison sentence for \\"anti-Soviet activities\\", Solzhenitsyn never worked on the manuscript in complete form. Since he was under constant KGB surveillance, Solzhenitsyn worked on only parts of the manuscript at any one time, so as not to put the full book into jeopardy if he happened to be arrested. For this reason, he secreted the various parts of the work throughout Moscow and the surrounding suburbs, in the care of trusted friends. Sometimes when he was purportedly visiting them on social calls he actually worked on the manuscript in their homes. During much of this time, Solzhenitsyn lived at the dacha of the world-famous cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, and due to the reputation and standing of the musician, despite the elevated scrutiny of the Soviet authorities, Solzhenitsyn was reasonably safe from KGB searches there. Solzhenitsyn did not think this series would be his defining work, as he considered it journalism and history rather than high literature. However, with the possible exception of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, it is his best-known and most popular work, at least in the West. Finished in 1968, The Gulag Archipelago was microfilmed and smuggled out to Solzhenitsyn's main legal representative, Dr Fritz Heeb of Z√ºrich, to await publication (a later paper copy, also smuggled out, was signed by Heinrich B√∂ll at the foot of each page to prove against possible accusations of a falsified work). Solzhenitsyn was aware that there was a wealth of material and perspectives about Gulag to be continued in the future, but he considered the book finished for his part. The royalties and sales income for the book were transferred to the Solzhenitsyn Aid Fund for aid to former camp prisoners, and this fund, which had to work in secret in its native country, managed to transfer substantial amounts of money to those ends in the 1970s and 1980s.  Impact and reception  Beginning in 2009, Russian schools issued the book as required reading. In an exchange with Natalia Solzhenitsyn (Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's second wife) Russian president Vladimir Putin called the book \\"much-needed.\\" while the Russian Ministry of Education said that the book showed \\"vital historical and cultural heritage on the course of 20th-century domestic history.\\" Arseny Roginsky, then head of the human-rights organization Memorial, welcomed Putin's backing for the Solzhenitsyn textbook. Natalia Solzhenitsyn, for her part, created an abridged version for Russian high-school students, including her probing introduction about the unique nature of Solzhenitsyn's \\"experiment in literary investigation\\".\\"Natalia Solzhenitsyn: Returning to ‚ÄòThe Gulag‚Äô\\", The New Criterion, September 2012 Novelist Doris Lessing said that the book \\"brought down an empire\\" while Michael Scammell similarly said that the book was a gesture that \\"amounted to a head-on challenge to the Soviet state, calling its very legitimacy into question and demanding revolutionary change.\\" The philosopher Isaiah Berlin said that, \\"Until the Gulag, the Communists and their allies had persuaded their followers that denunciations of the regime were largely bourgeois propaganda.\\" while the American diplomat George F. Kennan, said that the book was ‚Äúthe most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be levied in modern times.‚Äù\\"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: Speaking truth to power\\", The Economist, 7 August 2008 Tom Butler-Bowdon has described the book as a \\"Solzhenitsyn's monument to the millions tortured and murdered in Soviet Russia between the Bolshevik Revolution and the 1950s.\\" An edition of The Book Show said that the book helped expose the brutality of the Soviet system. Psychologist Jordan Peterson has said that The Gulag Archipelago is the most important book of the twentieth century. Historian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft describes the book as \\"a fine literary masterpiece, a sharp political indictment against the Soviet regime, and has had tremendous importance in raising the issue of Soviet repression in the Russian consciousness.\\" He also said that the book was essentially a \\"literary and political work\\", and \\"never claimed to place the camps in a historical or social-scientific quantitative perspective\\" but that in the case of qualitative estimates, Solzhenitsyn, according to Wheatcroft, gave his high estimate as he wanted to challenge the Soviet authorities to show that \\"that the scale of the camps was less than this.\\" Parallels have been drawn between the book and the treatment of Liao Yiwu, a dissident who, according to the AFP, is dubbed the \\"Chinese Solzhenitsyn.\\" David Aikman has asserted that Yiwu is the first Chinese dissident writer to \\"come up with a very detailed account of prison conditions including torture in China in the same way that [Soviet dissident Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn did in ‚ÄúThe Gulag Archipelago,‚Äù.\\" UCLA historian J. Arch Getty writes of Solzhenitsyn's methodology that \\"Such documentation is methodically unacceptable in other fields of history\\".Getty, A. Origins of the Great Purges. Cambridge, N. Y.: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985, p. 211 Gabor Rittersporn shares Getty's criticism saying \\"he is inclined to give priority to vague reminiscences and hearsay [...] [and] inevitably [leads] towards selective bias\\".Rittersporn, Gabor. Stalinist Simplifications and Soviet Complications, 1933-1953. New York: Harwood Academic Publishers, c1991, p. 231-235 In an interview with German weekly Die Zeit, British historian Orlando Figes asserted that many gulag inmates he interviewed for his research identified so strongly with the book's contents that they became unable to distinguish between their own experiences and what they read: \\"The Gulag Archipelago spoke for a whole nation and was the voice of all those who suffered\\".Held des Westens, Die Zeit, 7 August 2008 Former Communist Party member, dissident and historian, Roy Medvedev has referred to the book as \\"extremely contradictory\\".Medvedev, Roy. On Stalin and Stalinism. New York: Oxford University Press, 1979, p. ix However, in a review for the book he described it as without parallel, saying, \\"I believe there are few who will get up from their desks after reading this book the same as when they opened its first page. In this regard I have nothing with which to compare Solzhenitsyn's book either in Russian or world literature.\\" Mustafa Akyol drew a parallel between the book and the current situation in Xinjiang.

Putnam was known for his willingness to apply equal scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws.King, P.J. One Hundred Philosophers: The Life and Work of the World's Greatest Thinkers. Barron's 2004, p. 170. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his positions. In philosophy of mind, Putnam is known for his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind‚Äìbody problem. In philosophy of language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a thought experiment called Twin Earth.P. Clark-B. Hale (eds.), \\"Reading Putnam\\", Blackwell, Cambridge (Massachusetts): Oxford 1995. In philosophy of mathematics, he and his mentor W. V. O. Quine developed the \\"Quine‚ÄìPutnam indispensability thesis\\", an argument for the reality of mathematical entities,Colyvan, Mark, \\"Indispensability Arguments in the Philosophy of Mathematics\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but \\"quasi- empirical\\".Putnam, H. Philosophy of Mathematics: Selected Readings. Edited with Paul Benacerraf. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1964. 2nd ed., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983. In epistemology, he is known for his critique of the well-known \\"brain in a vat\\" thought experiment. This thought experiment appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, but Putnam challenges its coherence.Putnam, H. (1981): \\"Brains in a vat\\" in Reason, Truth, and History, Cambridge University Press; reprinted in DeRose and Warfield, editors (1999): Skepticism: A Contemporary Reader, Oxford UP. In metaphysics, he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism, but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called \\"internal realism\\",Putnam, H. Realism with a Human Face. Edited by J. F. Conant. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1990. which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career he remained committed to scientific realism, roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are.Putnam, H. 2012. From Quantum Mechanics to Ethics and Back Again. In his (Au.), De Caro, M. and Macarthur D. (Eds.) \\"Philosophy in an Age of Science\\". Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. In the philosophy of perception, Putnam came to endorse direct realism, according to which perceptual experiences directly present one with the external world. In the past, he further held that there are no mental representations, sense data, or other intermediaries that stand between the mind and the world.Putnam, H.. The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body, and World. New York: Columbia University Press, 1999. By 2012, however, he rejected this further commitment in favor of \\"transactionalism\\", a view that accepts both that perceptual experiences are world-involving transactions, and that these transactions are functionally describable (provided that worldly items and intentional states may be referred to in the specification of the function). Such transactions can further involve qualia.Putnam, H. 2012. How to Be a Sophisticated \\"Naive Realist\\". In his (Au.), De Caro, M. and Macarthur D. (Eds.) \\"Philosophy in an Age of Science\\". Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. In his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism, Jewish philosophy, and ethics, engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy, seeking to \\"renew philosophy\\" from what he identified as narrow and inflated concerns.Auxier, R. E., Anderson, D. R., & Hahn, L. E., eds., The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam (Chicago: Open Court, 2015), pp. 93‚Äì94. He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.Auxier, R. E., Anderson, D. R., & Hahn, L. E., eds., The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam (Chicago: Open Court, 2015), pp. 81‚Äì82. At the time of his death, Putnam was Cogan University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University.  Life  Putnam was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1926. His father, Samuel Putnam, was a scholar of Romance languages, columnist, and translator who wrote for the Daily Worker, a publication of the American Communist Party, from 1936 to 1946 (when he became disillusioned with communism).Wolfe, Bertram David. \\"Strange Communists I Have Known\\", Stein and Day, 1965, p. 79. As a result of his father's commitment to communism, Putnam had a secular upbringing, although his mother, Riva, was Jewish. The family lived in France until 1934, when they returned to the United States, settling in Philadelphia. Putnam attended Central High School; there he met Noam Chomsky, who was a year behind him. The two remained friends‚Äîand often intellectual opponents‚Äîfor the rest of Putnam's life.Robert F. Barsky, Noam Chomsky: A Life of Dissent, Ch. 2: Undergraduate Years. \\"A Very Powerful Personality\\", MIT Press, 1997 Putnam studied philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving his B.A. degree and becoming a member of the Philomathean Society, the country's oldest continually existing collegiate literary society.Hickey, L. P., Hilary Putnam (London / New York: Continuum, 2009). He did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University and later at UCLA'S philosophy department, where he received his Ph.D. in 1951 for his dissertation The Meaning of the Concept of Probability in Application to Finite Sequences.Putnam, The Meaning of the Concept of Probability in Application to Finite Sequences (New York: Garland Publishing, 1990). Putnam's dissertation supervisor Hans Reichenbach was a leading figure in logical positivism, the dominant school of philosophy of the day; one of Putnam's most consistent positions has been his rejection of logical positivism as self-defeating. After teaching at Northwestern University (1951‚Äì52), Princeton University (1953‚Äì61), and MIT (1961‚Äì65), Putnam moved to Harvard in 1965. His wife, the philosopher Ruth Anna Putnam, took a teaching position in philosophy at Wellesley College. Hilary and Ruth Anna were married on August 11, 1962. Ruth Anna, descendant of a family with a long scholarly tradition in Gotha (her ancestor was the German classical scholar Christian Friedrich Wilhelm Jacobs),Deutsches Geschlechterbuch, vol. 214, Limburg 2002, p. 267-946 was born in Berlin, Germany,Hortsch, Michael. \\"Dr. Hans Nathan Kohn ‚Äì ein Berliner J√ºdischer Arzt und Forscher am Vorabend des Nationalsozialismus.\\" Berlin Medical, Vol. 4:26‚Äì28 August 2007 in 1927 to anti-Nazi activist parents and, like Putnam, was raised atheist (her mother was Jewish and her father from a Christian background). Putnam was also raised atheist.http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.709318http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/10/004-wrestling- with-an-angel The Putnams, rebelling against the antisemitism they had experienced during their youth, decided to establish a traditional Jewish home for their children. Since they had no experience with the rituals of Judaism, they sought out invitations to other Jews' homes for Seder. They had \\"no idea how to do it [themselves]\\", in the words of Ruth Anna. They therefore began to study Jewish ritual and Hebrew, and became more Jewishly interested, identified, and active. In 1994, Hilary Putnam celebrated a belated Bar Mitzvah service. His wife had a Bat Mitzvah service four years later. Putnam was a popular teacher at Harvard. In keeping with the family tradition, he was politically active. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he was an active supporter of the American Civil Rights Movement and opposition to the Vietnam War. In 1963, he organized one of the first faculty and student committees at MIT against the war. Putnam was disturbed when he learned from David Halberstam's reports that the U.S. was \\"defending\\" South Vietnamese peasants from the Vietcong by poisoning their rice crops. After moving to Harvard in 1965, he organized campus protests and began teaching courses on Marxism. Putnam became an official faculty advisor to the Students for a Democratic Society and in 1968 a member of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. After 1968, his political activities were centered on the PLP. The Harvard administration considered these activities disruptive and attempted to censure Putnam, but two other faculty members criticized the procedures. Putnam permanently severed his ties with the PLP in 1972. In 1997, at a meeting of former draft resistance activists at Boston's Arlington Street Church, Putnam described his involvement with the PLP as a mistake. He said he had been impressed at first with the PLP's commitment to alliance-building and its willingness to attempt to organize from within the armed forces. In 1976, Putnam was elected president of the American Philosophical Association. The next year, he was selected as Walter Beverly Pearson Professor of Mathematical Logic in recognition of his contributions to the philosophy of logic and mathematics. While breaking with his radical past, Putnam never abandoned his belief that academics have a particular social and ethical responsibility toward society. He continued to be forthright and progressive in his political views, as expressed in the articles \\"How Not to Solve Ethical Problems\\" (1983) and \\"Education for Democracy\\" (1993). Putnam was a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. He retired from teaching in June 2000, but as of 2009 continued to give a seminar almost yearly at Tel Aviv University. He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam in 2001.The Spinoza Chair ‚Äì Philosophy ‚Äì University of Amsterdam He was the Cogan University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University and a founding patron of the small liberal arts college Ralston College. His corpus includes five volumes of collected works, seven books, and more than 200 articles. Putnam's renewed interest in Judaism inspired him to publish several books and essays on the topic. With his wife, he co-authored several books and essays on the late-19th-century American pragmatist movement. For his contributions in philosophy and logic, he was awarded the Rolf Schock Prize in 2011 and the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy in 2015. He delivered his last Skype talk, \\"Thought and Language,\\" at an international conference on \\"The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam\\" held at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, on October 3, 2015, organized by his student Sanjit Chakraborty. Putnam died at his home in Arlington, Massachusetts, on March 13, 2016.Weber, B., \\"Hilary Putnam, Giant of Modern Philosophy, Dies at 89\\", The New York Times, March 17, 2016.  Philosophy of mind  = Multiple realizability = An illustration of multiple realizability. M stands for mental and P stands for physical. It can be seen that more than one P can instantiate one M, but not vice versa. Causal relations between states are represented by the arrows (M1 goes to M2, etc.). Putnam's best-known work concerns philosophy of mind. His most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers published in the late 1960s that set out the hypothesis of multiple realizability.Bickle, John \\"Multiple Realizability\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2006 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) In these papers, Putnam argues that, contrary to the famous claim of the type-identity theory, it is not necessarily true that \\"Pain is identical to C-fibre firing.\\" Pain, according to Putnam's papers, may correspond to utterly different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms, and yet they all experience the same mental state of \\"being in pain\\". Putnam cited examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same mental states and properties. The answer to this puzzle had to be that mental states were realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially intelligent robots and other silicon-based life forms. These hypothetical entities, he contended, should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack the same neurochemistry as humans. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an \\"ambitious\\" and \\"highly implausible\\" conjecture which could be disproven with one example of multiple realizability.Putnam, H. (1975) Mind, Language and Reality. Philosophical Papers, vol. 2. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. This argument is sometimes referred to as the \\"likelihood argument\\". Putnam formulated a complementary argument based on what he called \\"functional isomorphism\\". He defined the concept in these terms: \\"Two systems are functionally isomorphic if 'there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations'.\\" In the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the sequential relations among states in the first are exactly mirrored by the sequential relations among states in the other. Therefore, a computer made out of silicon chips and a computer made out of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability. This argument is sometimes referred to as an \\"a priori argument\\". Jerry Fodor, Putnam, and others noted that, along with being an effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general.Fodor, J. (1974) \\"Special Sciences\\" in Synthese, 28, pp. 97‚Äì115Fodor, J. (1980) \\"The Mind-Body Problem\\", Scientific American, 244, pp. 124‚Äì132 Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore seemed to be a better explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level. = Machine state functionalism = The first formulation of such a functionalist theory was put forth by Putnam himself. This formulation, which is now called \\"machine-state functionalism\\", was inspired by analogies noted by Putnam and others between the mind and Turing machines. The point, for functionalism is the nature of the states of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined in terms of its relations to the other states and to the inputs and outputs, and the details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of a Turing machine state. Just as \\"state one\\" simply is the state in which, given a particular input, such-and-such happens, so being in pain is the state which disposes one to cry \\"ouch\\", become distracted, wonder what the cause is, and so forth. = Rejection of functionalism = In the late 1980s, Putnam abandoned his adherence to functionalism and other computational theories of mind. His change of mind was primarily due to the difficulties that computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions with respect to the externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by Putnam's own Twin Earth thought experiment (see Philosophy of language). He also developed a separate argument against functionalism in 1988, based on Fodor's generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, Putnam argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.Putnam, Hilary (1988). Representation and Reality. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. Despite Putnam's rejection of functionalism, it has continued to flourish and has been developed into numerous versions by thinkers as diverse as David Marr, Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, and David Lewis.Marhaba, Sadi. (2004) Funzionalismoin \\"Enciclopedia Garzantina della Filosofia\\" (ed.) Gianni Vattimo. Milan: Garzanti Editori. Functionalism helped lay the foundations for modern cognitive science and is the dominant theory of mind in philosophy today.Levin, Janet, \\"Functionalism\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) By 2012 Putnam accepted a modification of functionalism called \\"liberal functionalism\\". The view holds that \\"what matters for consciousness and for mental properties generally is the right sort of functional capacities and not the particular matter that subserves those capacities\\". The specification of these capacities (1) may refer to what goes on outside the organism's \\"brain\\", (2) may include intentional idioms, and (3) need not describe a capacity to compute something or other.  Philosophy of language  = Semantic externalism = One of Putnam's contributions to philosophy of language is his claim that \\"meaning just ain't in the head\\". His views on meaning, first laid out in Meaning and Reference (1973), then in The Meaning of 'Meaning' (1975), use his \\"Twin Earth\\" thought experiment to illustrate that terms' meanings are determined by factors outside the mind. Twin Earth shows this, according to Putnam, since on Twin Earth everything is identical to Earth, except that its lakes, rivers and oceans are filled with XYZ whereas those of earth are filled with H2O. Consequently, when an earthling, Fredrick, uses the Earth-English word \\"water\\", it has a different meaning from the Twin Earth-English word \\"water\\" when used by his physically identical twin, Frodrick, on Twin Earth. Since Fredrick and Frodrick are physically indistinguishable when they utter their respective words, and since their words have different meanings, meaning cannot be determined solely by what is in their heads.Marvan, T., ed., What Determines Content? The Internalism/Externalism Dispute (Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2006), pp. 70‚Äì75. This led Putnam to adopt a version of semantic externalism with regard to meaning and mental content. The late philosopher of mind and language Donald Davidson, despite his many differences of opinion with Putnam, wrote that semantic externalism constituted an \\"anti- subjectivist revolution\\" in philosophers' way of seeing the world. Since the time of Descartes, philosophers had been concerned with proving knowledge from the basis of subjective experience. Thanks to Saul Kripke, Putnam, Tyler Burge and others, Davidson said, philosophy could now take the objective realm for granted and start questioning the alleged \\"truths\\" of subjective experience.Davidson, D. (2001) Subjective, Intersubjective, Objective. Oxford: Oxford University Press. = Theory of meaning = Along with Kripke, Keith Donnellan, and others, Putnam contributed to what is known as the causal theory of reference. In particular, he maintained in The Meaning of \\"Meaning\\" that the objects referred to by natural kind terms‚Äîsuch as \\"tiger\\", \\"water\\", and \\"tree\\"‚Äîare the principal elements of the meaning of such terms. There is a linguistic division of labor, analogous to Adam Smith's economic division of labor, according to which such terms have their references fixed by the \\"experts\\" in the particular field of science to which the terms belong. So, for example, the reference of the term \\"lion\\" is fixed by the community of zoologists, the reference of the term \\"elm tree\\" is fixed by the community of botanists, and the reference of the term \\"table salt\\" is fixed as \\"NaCl\\" by chemists. These referents are considered rigid designators in the Kripkean sense and are disseminated outward to the linguistic community. Putnam specifies a finite sequence of elements (a vector) for the description of the meaning of every term in the language. Such a vector consists of four components: # the object to which the term refers, e.g., the object individuated by the chemical formula H2O; # a set of typical descriptions of the term, referred to as \\"the stereotype\\", e.g., \\"transparent\\", \\"colorless\\", and \\"hydrating\\"; # the semantic indicators that place the object into a general category, e.g., \\"natural kind\\" and \\"liquid\\"; # the syntactic indicators, e.g., \\"concrete noun\\" and \\"mass noun\\". Such a \\"meaning-vector\\" provides a description of the reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community. It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to that expression or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning. According to Putnam, it is legitimate to speak of a change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term, and not its stereotype, has changed. But since no possible algorithm can determine which aspect‚Äîthe stereotype or the reference‚Äîhas changed in a particular case, it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language. Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions to be considered, Putnam embraced a form of semantic holism.Dell'Utri, Massimo. (2002) Olismo. Quodlibet. Macerata.  Philosophy of mathematics  Putnam made a significant contribution to philosophy of mathematics in the Quine‚ÄìPutnam \\"indispensability argument\\" for mathematical realism.C. S. Hill (ed.), \\"The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam\\", Fayetteville, Arkansas 1992. Stephen Yablo considers this argument one of the most challenging in favor of the existence of abstract mathematical entities, such as numbers and sets. The form of the argument is as follows. # One must have ontological commitments to all entities that are indispensable to the best scientific theories, and to those entities only (commonly referred to as \\"all and only\\"). # Mathematical entities are indispensable to the best scientific theories. Therefore, # One must have ontological commitments to mathematical entities.Putnam, H. Mathematics, Matter and Method. Philosophical Papers, vol. 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. 2nd. ed., 1985. The justification for the first premise is the most controversial. Both Putnam and Quine invoke naturalism to justify the exclusion of all non-scientific entities, and hence to defend the \\"only\\" part of \\"all and only\\". The assertion that \\"all\\" entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by confirmation holism. Since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, there is no justification for excluding any of the entities referred to in well-confirmed theories. This puts the nominalist who wishes to exclude the existence of sets and non-Euclidean geometry but to include the existence of quarks and other undetectable entities of physics, for example, in a difficult position. Putnam holds the view that mathematics, like physics and other empirical sciences, uses both strict logical proofs and \\"quasi-empirical\\" methods. For example, Fermat's last theorem states that for no integer n>2 are there positive integer values of x, y, and z such that x^n+y^n=z^n. Before this was proven for all n>2 in 1995 by Andrew Wiles, it had been proven for many values of n. These proofs inspired further research in the area, and formed a quasi-empirical consensus for the theorem. Even though such knowledge is more conjectural than a strictly proven theorem, it was still used in developing other mathematical ideas.  Mathematics and computer science  Putnam has contributed to scientific fields not directly related to his work in philosophy. As a mathematician, Putnam contributed to the resolution of Hilbert's tenth problem in mathematics. This problem (now known as Matiyasevich's theorem or the MRDP theorem) was settled by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970, with a proof that relied heavily on previous research by Putnam, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis.S. Barry Cooper, Computability theory, p. 98 In computability theory, Putnam investigated the structure of the ramified analytical hierarchy, its connection with the constructible hierarchy and its Turing degrees. He showed that there exist many levels of the constructible hierarchy which do not add any subsets of the integers and later, with his student George Boolos, that the first such \\"non-index\\" is the ordinal \\\\beta_0 of ramified analysis (this is the smallest \\\\beta such that L_\\\\beta is a model of full second-order comprehension), and also, together with a separate paper with Richard Boyd (another of Putnam's students) and Gustav Hensel, how the Davis‚ÄìMostowski‚ÄìKleene hyperarithmetical hierarchy of arithmetical degrees can be naturally extended up to \\\\beta_0. In computer science, Putnam is known for the Davis‚ÄìPutnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), developed with Martin Davis in 1960. The algorithm finds if there is a set of true or false values that satisfies a given Boolean expression so that the entire expression becomes true. In 1962, they further refined the algorithm with the help of George Logemann and Donald W. Loveland. It became known as the DPLL algorithm. This algorithm is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers.  Epistemology  A \\"brain in a vat\\"‚ÄîPutnam uses this thought experiment to argue that skeptical scenarios are impossible. In epistemology, Putnam is known for his \\"brain in a vat\\" thought experiment (a modernized version of Descartes's evil demon hypothesis). The argument is that one cannot coherently suspect that one is a disembodied \\"brain in a vat\\" placed there by some \\"mad scientist\\". This follows from the causal theory of reference. Words always refer to the kinds of things they were coined to refer to, the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, experienced. So, if some person, Mary, is a \\"brain in a vat\\", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the \\"mad scientist\\", then Mary's idea of a \\"brain\\" does not refer to a \\"real\\" brain, since she and her linguistic community have never encountered such a thing. To her a brain is actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a \\"vat\\" does not refer to a \\"real\\" vat. So if, as a brain in a vat, she says, \\"I'm a brain in a vat\\", she is actually saying, \\"I'm a brain-image in a vat- image\\", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally. Putnam has clarified that his real target in this argument was never skepticism, but metaphysical realism.Putnam, H., Realism and Reason. Philosophical Papers, vol. 3. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983.Wright, C. (1992), \\"On Putnam's Proof That We Are Not Brains-in-a-Vat\\", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society 92. Since realism of this kind assumes the existence of a gap between how one conceives the world and the way the world really is, skeptical scenarios such as this one (or Descartes's evil demon) present a formidable challenge. By arguing that such a scenario is impossible, Putnam attempts to show that this notion of a gap between one's concept of the world and the way it is is absurd. One cannot have a \\"God's-eye\\" view of reality. One is limited to one's conceptual schemes, and metaphysical realism is therefore false.Dell'Utri, M. (1990), \\"Choosing Conceptions of Realism: the Case of the Brains in a Vat\\", Mind 99.  Metaphilosophy and ontology  In the late 1970s and the 1980s, stimulated by results from mathematical logic and by some ideas of Quine, Putnam abandoned his long-standing defence of metaphysical realism‚Äîthe view that the categories and structures of the external world are both causally and ontologically independent of the conceptualizations of the human mind. He adopted a rather different view, which he called \\"internal realism\\"Putnam, H. The Many Faces of Realism. La Salle, Ill.: Open Court, 1987. (also \\"pragmatic realism\\").Ernest Sosa, Putnam's Pragmatic Realism\\", The Journal of Philosophy, 90(12), Dec. 1993, pp. 605‚Äì626, esp. 605: \\"Putnam argues against 'metaphysical realism' and in favor of his own 'internal (or pragmatic) realism.'\\" Internal realism was the view that, although the world may be causally independent of the human mind, the structure of the world‚Äîits division into kinds, individuals and categories‚Äîis a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Immanuel Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought. The problem with metaphysical realism, according to Putnam, was that it fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But how is it possible that the world \\"carves up\\" into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two \\"carvings\\" perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed \\"idealized rational acceptability.\\" The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions. Nelson Goodman had formulated a similar notion in Fact, Fiction and Forecast in 1956. In that work, Goodman went as far as to suggest that there is \\"no one world, but many worlds, each created by the human mind.\\"Goodman, N. Fact, Fiction, and Forecast. University of London: Athlone Press, 1954. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard UP, 1955. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965. 3rd. ed. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1973. 4th ed. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard UP, 1983 Putnam rejected this form of social constructivism, but retained the idea that there can be many correct descriptions of reality. No one of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the \\"one, true\\" description of the world. This does not imply relativism, for Putnam, because not all descriptions are equally correct and the ones that are correct are not determined subjectively. Putnam renounced internal realism in his reply to Simon Blackburn in the volume Reading Putnam.Peter Clark and Bob Hale, eds., Reading Putnam. Oxford: Blackwell, 1994. The reasons he gave up his \\"antirealism\\" are stated in the first three of his replies in \\"The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam\\", an issue of the journal Philosophical Topics, where he gives a history of his use(s) of the term \\"internal realism\\", and, at more length, in his The Threefold Cord: Mind, Body and World (1999).See also Philosophical Topics (vol. 20, Number 1, Spring 1992). And Hilary Putnam, \\"When 'Evidence Transcendence' is Not Malign\\", Journal of Philosophy, XCVIII, 11 (Nov. 2001), 594‚Äì600. Although he abandoned internal realism, Putnam still resists the idea that any given thing or system of things can only be described in exactly one complete and correct way. He thus accepts \\"conceptual relativity\\" ‚Äì the view that it may be a matter of choice or convention, e.g., whether mereological sums exist, or whether space- time points are individuals or mere limits. In other words, having abandoned internal realism Putnam came to accept metaphysical realism in simply the broad sense of rejecting all forms of verificationism and all talk of our 'making' the world. Under the influence of C. S. Peirce and William James, Putnam also became convinced that there is no fact‚Äìvalue dichotomy; that is, normative (e.g., ethical and aesthetic) judgments often have a factual basis, while scientific judgments have a normative element.  Neopragmatism and Wittgenstein  At the end of the 1980s, Putnam became increasingly disillusioned with what he perceived as the \\"scientism\\" and the rejection of history that characterize modern analytic philosophy. He rejected internal realism because it assumed a \\"cognitive interface\\" model of the relation between the mind and the world. Putnam claimed that the very notion of truth would have to be abandoned by a consistent eliminative materialist.Feser, E., The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism (South Bend, IN: St. Augustine Press, 2008), p. 234. Under the increasing influence of James and the pragmatists, he adopted a direct realist view of this relation.Putnam, Hilary. Sep. 1994. \\"The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind.\\" The Journal of Philosophy 91(9):445‚Äì518. For a time, under the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein, he adopted a pluralist view of philosophy itself and came to view most philosophical problems as nothing more than conceptual or linguistic confusions created by philosophers by using ordinary language out of its original context. In 2017 a book collecting articles on pragmatism by both Ruth Anna Putnam and Hilary Putnam was published, Pragmatism as a Way of Life: The Lasting Legacy of William James and John Dewey (Harvard UP, 2017, ).Bartlett, T., \\"A Marriage of Minds: Hilary Putnam‚Äôs most surprising philosophical shift began at home\\", The Chronicle of Higher Education, September 10, 2017. Many of Putnam's last works addressed the concerns of ordinary people, particularly social problems.Reed, Edward (1997). \\"Defending Experience: A Philosophy For The Post-Modern World\\" in The Genetic Epistemologist: The Journal of the Jean Piaget Society, Volume 25, Number 3. For example, he wrote about the nature of democracy, social justice and religion. He also discussed J√ºrgen Habermas's ideas, and wrote articles influenced by continental philosophy.  Criticism  Putnam himself may be his own most formidable philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible.Bechtel, William and Mundale, Jennifer. Multiple Realizability Revisited in Philosophy of Science 66: 175‚Äì207. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, to be able to conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species).Kim, Sungsu. Testing Multiple Realizability: A Discussion of Bechtel and Mundale in Philosophy of Science. 69: 606‚Äì610. Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.Kim, Jaegwon. Multiple Realizability and the Metaphysics of Reduction on Philosophy and Phenomenological Research. 52: 1‚Äì26.Lewis, David (1969). \\"Review of Art, Mind, and Religion.\\" Journal of Philosophy, 66: 23‚Äì35.Richardson, Robert (1979). \\"Functionalism and Reductionism.\\" Philosophy of Science, 46: 533‚Äì558.Churchland, Patricia (1986). Neurophilosophy. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. One of the main arguments against functionalism was formulated by Putnam himself: the Twin Earth thought experiment. However, there have been other criticisms. The Chinese room argument by John Searle (1980) is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. The thought experiment is designed to show that it is possible to mimic intelligent action, without any interpretation or understanding, through the use of a purely functional system. In short, Searle describes a situation in which a person who speaks only English is locked in a room with Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around. The person is instructed, by people outside the room, to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. Further, suppose that the people outside the room are Chinese speakers and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols. According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside \\"knows\\" Chinese based on these syntactic processes alone. This thought experiment attempts to show that systems that operate merely on syntactic processes cannot realize any semantics (meaning) or intentionality (aboutness). Thus, Searle attacks the idea that thought can be equated with the following of a set of syntactic rules. Thus, functionalism is an inadequate theory of the mind.Searle, John. (1980). \\"Minds, Brains and Programs\\", Behavioral and Brain Sciences, vol.3. (online) Several other arguments against functionalism have been advanced by Ned Block.Block, Ned. (1980b). \\"Troubles With Functionalism\\", in Block (1980a). Putnam has consistently adhered to the idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we will never be able to master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.Fodor, J. and Lepore, E. Holism: A Shopper's Guide. Blackwell. Oxford. 1992.Dummett, Michael. The Logical Basis of Metaphysics. Harvard University Press. Cambridge (MA). 1978.Penco, Carlo. Olismo e Molecularismo in Olismo ed. Massimo Dell'Utri. Quodlibet. Macerata. 2002. The brain in a vat argument has also been subject to criticism.Steinitz, Y. (1994), \\"Brains in a Vat: Different Perspectives\\", Philosophical Quarterly 44. Crispin Wright argues that Putnam's formulation of the brain-in-a-vat scenario is too narrow to refute global skepticism. The possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism. If a person has lived her entire life outside the vat‚Äîspeaking the English language and interacting normally with the outside world‚Äîprior to her \\"envatment\\" by a mad scientist, when she wakes up inside the vat, her words and thoughts (e.g., \\"tree\\" and \\"grass\\") will still refer to the objects or events in the external world that they referred to before her envatment. In another scenario, a brain in a vat may be hooked up to a supercomputer that randomly generates perceptual experiences. In this case, one's words and thoughts would not refer to anything, and would therefore be devoid of content. Semantics would no longer exist and the argument would be meaningless.Brueckner, A. (1986), \\"Brains in a Vat\\", Journal of Philosophy 83. In philosophy of mathematics, Stephen Yablo has argued that the Quine‚ÄìPutnam indispensability thesis does not demonstrate that mathematical entities are truly indispensable. The argumentation is sophisticated, but the upshot is that one can achieve the same logical results by simply adding to any statement about an abstract object the assumption \\"so- and-so is assumed (or hypothesized) to exist\\". For example, one can take the argument for indispensability described above and adjust it as follows: : 1*. One must have ontological commitments to all and only the [abstract] entities for which, under the assumption that they exist, their existence is indispensable to the best scientific theories. : 2*. Under the assumption that they exist, the existence of mathematical entities is indispensable to the best scientific theories. Therefore, : 3*. Under the assumption that mathematical entities exist, one must have ontological commitments to the existence of mathematical entities. Finally, Putnam's internal realism has been accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism. If this is the case, it is subject to the traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.  Major works and bibliography  Vincent C. M√ºller compiled a detailed bibliography of Putnam's writings (with 16 books and 198 articles), published in 1993 in PhilPapers.

It runs , from Key West, Florida north to Fort Kent, Maine, at the Canadian border, making it the longest north‚Äìsouth road in the United States. US 1 is generally paralleled by Interstate 95 (I-95), though the former is significantly farther west (inland) between Jacksonville, Florida, and Petersburg, Virginia. The highway connects most of the major cities of the East Coast‚Äîincluding Miami, Jacksonville, Raleigh, Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston passing from the Southeastern United States to New England. While US 1 is generally the easternmost of the main north‚Äìsouth U.S. Highways, parts of several others occupy corridors closer to the ocean. When the road system was laid out in the 1920s, US 1 was mostly assigned to the existing Atlantic Highway, which followed the Fall Line between the Piedmont and the Atlantic Coastal Plain north of Augusta, Georgia. At the time, the highways farther east were of lower quality and did not serve the major population centers. In North Carolina and up to Virginia, it parallels I-85. Construction of the Interstate Highway system gradually changed the use and character of US 1, and I-95 became the major north‚Äìsouth East Coast highway by the late 1960s. Route description =Florida= Mile zero in Key West US 1 travels along the east coast of Florida, beginning at 490 Whitehead St. in Key West and passing through Miami, Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton, West Palm Beach, Jupiter, Fort Pierce, Melbourne, Cocoa, Titusville, Daytona Beach, Palm Coast, St. Augustine, and Jacksonville. The southernmost piece through the chain islands of the Florida Keys, about long, is the two-lane Overseas Highway, originally built in the late 1930s after railroad tycoon Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway's Overseas Railroad, which was built 1905-1912 on stone pillars was ruined by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. The rest of US 1 in Florida is generally a four-lane divided highway, despite the existence of the newer I-95 not far away. Famous vacation scenic route Florida State Road A1A is a continuous oceanfront alternate to US 1 that runs along the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean, cut only by assorted unbridged inlets and the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. North of Jacksonville, US 1 turns northwest towards Augusta, Georgia; US 17 becomes the coastal route into Virginia, where US 13 takes over.Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed via ACME Mapper In Florida until the 1990s, US 1 used high- contrast markers (white text on a red background). =Georgia= Downtown Augusta skyline as seen from US 1 in North Augusta near I-520 exit #17 The part of US 1 in Georgia, as it shifts from the coastal alignment in Florida to the Fall Line alignment in South Carolina, is generally very rural, passing through marshes and former plantations between the towns and cities of Folkston, Waycross, Alma, Baxley, Lyons, Swainsboro, and Augusta. The Georgia Department of Transportation has an ongoing plan to widen all of US 1 to four lanes with bypasses which is more than 50 percent complete. =The Carolinas= I-40 east approaching the Raleigh Beltline, which includes US 1. In South Carolina, US 1 generally serves mostly rural areas as it falls west of I-95 while the coastal areas are served by routes east of it. Starting in South Carolina, US 1 is paralleled by Interstate 20 along the Fall Line through Aiken, Lexington, and Columbia to Camden and Lugoff. US 1 functions as a local two-lane road with occasional boulevard stretches. After Camden, US 1 continues northeast away from any Interstate towards Bethune, Patrick, McBee and Cheraw with no bypasses or four-lane sections except around Cheraw through the US 52 and SC 9 multiplexes. After SC 9, it continues northward into North Carolina as a two-lane highway. SCDOT has no plans to widen or bypass any US 1 alignments northeast of Camden to the North Carolina line. Between the South Carolina line and the US 74 bypass, US 1 is a two-lane road but sees a considerable amount of truck and tourist traffic of people cutting through from the US 74/US 220 and I-73/I-74 corridor attempting to reach points south and east. US 1 goes through downtown Rockingham, with a bypass in the future plans. North of the NC 177 junction, it becomes four lanes or greater, becoming a super-street with limited access and then becoming a limited access freeway. US 1 becomes a major artery for the state as it moves north of Rockingham. After Richmond County, it goes into Moore County with two expressway bypasses in Southern Pines, Vass and Cameron. US 1 continues with the Jefferson Davis Highway label through Lee County and Sanford, and on to Cary and Raleigh. US 1 runs concurrently with US 64 through most of Cary, where the freeway recently underwent a major renovation and improvements that added lanes in both directions. North of Raleigh, US 1 (known as Capital Boulevard in northern Wake County) crosses Interstate 540 and then again becomes a four-lane divided arterial to Interstate 85 near Henderson. The North Carolina Department of Transportation has begun a corridor study for this section of US 1. Moreover, NCDOT is planning to finish four-laning US 1 in Richmond County past NC 177 with a Rockingham bypass to the east. There are no plans from SCDOT to widen US 1 from the state line. From Henderson into Virginia, US 1 runs parallel with I-85 as a two-lane local road until the state line, where Virginia hosts a continuous third center lane for alternate passing towards US Highway 58 before South Hill. =Mid-Atlantic Region= 14th Street Bridge, Washington, D.C. :Main articles: U.S. Route 1 in Virginia, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York In the Mid-Atlantic region, US 1 generally serves some of the most populated areas of the east coast. Through Virginia, US 1 is paralleled by Interstates: the remainder of Interstate 85 to Petersburg, Interstate 95 through Richmond and Fredericksburg to Alexandria, and Interstate 395 into Arlington. In much of Virginia, US 1 is called Jefferson Davis Highway by state law, although there are exceptions. South of Petersburg, it is known as Boydton Plank Road. Through some of Fairfax County and Alexandria, it is called Richmond Highway. US 1 crosses the Potomac River with I-395 on the 14th Street Bridges, and splits to follow mainly 14th Street and Rhode Island Avenue through the District of Columbia. US 1 is at the minimum a 3 lane (with alternate passing) from the N.C. line to Petersburg with occasional four lane divided sections. North of Petersburg is a four lane undivided roadway at the minimum to the D.C. line. The route of US 1 from Petersburg to the state line is parallel with the Fall Line. From Petersburg onwards it is parallel with Interstate 95. After exiting the District into Maryland, US 1 follows the Baltimore-Washington Boulevard, the first of several modern highways built along the Baltimore-Washington corridor; I-95 is the newest, after the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. US 1 runs through the University of Maryland at College Park campus in College Park, Maryland. The route bypasses downtown Baltimore on North Avenue and exits the city to the northeast on Belair Road, gradually leaving the I-95 corridor, which passes through Wilmington, Delaware, for a straighter path towards Philadelphia. Around and beyond Bel Air, US 1 is a two-lane road, crossing the Susquehanna River over the top of the Conowingo Dam before entering Pennsylvania. (Routed further north, US 1 bypasses the state of Delaware, unlike I-95.) Roosevelt Boulevard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The two-lane US 1 becomes a four-lane expressway, officially known as the John H. Ware III Memorial Highway, just after crossing into Pennsylvania. This bypass extends around Oxford and Kennett Square, merging into the four-lane divided Baltimore Pike just beyond the latter. At Media, US 1 again becomes a freeway ‚Äì the Media Bypass ‚Äì ending just beyond Interstate 476. After several name changes, the road becomes City Avenue, the western city limits of Philadelphia, at the end of which a short overlap with the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) leads to the Roosevelt Expressway and then the twelve-lane Roosevelt Boulevard partly overlapping US 13\\\\. US 1 again becomes a freeway after leaving the city, bypassing Penndel and Morrisville and crossing the Delaware River into New Jersey on the Trenton‚ÄìMorrisville Toll Bridge. The Pulaski Skyway, in Jersey City, Kearny, and Newark, New Jersey After crossing into New Jersey in Mercer County, US 1 continues on the Trenton Freeway through the state capital of Trenton and Lawrence Township as a four lane freeway. As the freeway ends, the four lane divided highway upgrades to six lanes north of I-295 passing through the Penns Neck section of West Windsor Township. Through Penns Neck is a series of traffic signals. NJDOT is looking to revamp the highway through this area by replacing traffic signals with grade separations. The highway enters Middlesex County through Plainsboro and South Brunswick, where the highest point resides. By Forrestal Village, the highway downgrades from 6 to 4 lanes until after Finnegans Lane in North Brunswick. Northward, it continues through New Brunswick as a short limited-access highway until the CR 529/Plainfield Avenue traffic signal in Edison. Through Edison and Woodbridge, US 1 has a mix of boulevard and limited-access segments and continues to do so after the US 9 juncture in the Avenel section of Woodbridge. The US 1/9 concurrency continues through the rest of the state. The six lane divided highway remains through Rahway in Union County and Elizabeth, until it reaches the Newark Airport, where it becomes a dual carriageway freeway around downtown Newark in Essex County with a 2-2-2-2 configuration. The historic Pulaski Skyway takes US 1/9 into Jersey City, and the route exits the freeway at Tonnele Circle to head north into Bergen County. US 1/9 turns onto US 46 as a limited-access highway, and the three routes run northeast to the George Washington Bridge Plaza, where they merge into I-95. US 46 ends in the middle of the bridge, which crosses the Hudson River into New York, and US 9 exits just beyond onto Broadway in Manhattan, but US 1 stays with I-95 onto the Cross Bronx Expressway, exiting in the Bronx onto Webster Avenue. Two turns take US 1 via Fordham Road to Boston Road, which it follows northeast out of the city, becoming Boston Post Road in Westchester County, never straying far from I-95. From the Bronx to the state line, it is a local road with two lanes in each direction, except in Rye where it has a single lane in each direction. As it enters Greenwich, Connecticut, it continues as a two-lane local road. =New England= :Main articles: U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine In New England, US 1 generally serves large cities in a side street capacity. In Connecticut, US 1 serves the shore of the Long Island Sound parallel to I-95. Beyond New Haven, the highway travels east‚Äìwest, and some signs in the state indicate this rather than the standard north‚Äìsouth. While I-95 in Rhode Island takes a diagonal path to Providence, US 1 continues east along the coast through Westerly to Wakefield, where it turns north and follows Narragansett Bay. Most of this part is a four-lane divided highway, providing access to Route 138 towards Newport. After Route 4 splits as a mostly-freeway connection to I-95, US 1 becomes a lower-speed surface road, passing through Warwick, Providence, and Pawtucket. The route parallels I-95 again through Providence and Pawtucket and into Massachusetts, traveling towards Boston as a four-lane road. When it reaches Dedham, US 1 turns east, overlapping I-95 and I-93 east to Braintree and north through Downtown Boston. The Tobin Bridge and Northeast Expressway take US 1 out of Boston, after which it again parallels I-95 through Newburyport to the New Hampshire state line. Memorial Bridge between New Hampshire and Maine (2016) The monument marking the northern terminus in Fort Kent, ME Monument in Fort Kent dedicated to US Highway 1 The short portion of US 1 in New Hampshire follows the historic Lafayette Road, staying close to I-95, passing through Portsmouth before crossing the Piscataqua River on Memorial Bridge, which was demolished and replaced during 2012‚Äì13, leaving a temporary gap in US 1\\\\. During construction, drivers had to detour to one of two other nearby bridges carrying U.S. Route 1 Bypass or Interstate 95. Within Maine, US 1 begins as a parallel route to I-95 near the Atlantic Ocean. At Portland, I-95 splits off to the north, and I-295 heads northeast paralleling US 1 to Brunswick. There US 1 turns east as a mostly two-lane road along the coast to Calais; much of this portion is advertised as the \\"Coastal Route\\" on signs. North from Calais, US 1 follows the Canada‚ÄìUS border, crossing I-95 in Houlton and eventually turning west and southwest to its \\"north\\" end at the Clair-Fort Kent Bridge in Fort Kent. The short Route 161 extends north on the New Brunswick (Canada) side of the bridge to Route 120, a secondary east‚Äìwest route from Edmundston, New Brunswick west to Quebec Route 289 toward Saint-Alexandre, Quebec. History Marker used for Route 1 in New England (1922) The direct predecessor to US 1 was the Atlantic Highway, an auto trail established in 1911 as the Quebec-Miami International Highway. In 1915 it was renamed the Atlantic Highway, and the northern terminus was changed to Calais, Maine. Due to the overlapping of auto trail designations, portions of the route had other names that remain in common use, such as the Boston Post Road between Boston and New York, the Lincoln Highway between New York and Philadelphia, Baltimore Pike between Philadelphia and Baltimore, and the Dixie Highway in and south of eastern Georgia. North of Augusta, Georgia, the highway generally followed the Eastern U.S. Fall Line, rather than a more easterly route through the swamps of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Brickell Avenue is the name given to the stretch of US 1 in Miami, Florida, just south of the Miami River until the Rickenbacker Causeway. When the New England road marking system was established in 1922, the Atlantic Highway within New England was signed as Route 1, with a Route 24 continuing north to Madawaska; New York extended the number to New York City in 1924 with its own Route 1. Other states adopted their own systems of numbering, and by 1926 all states but Maryland had signed the Atlantic Highway as various routes, usually changing numbers at the state line. In 1925, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways created a preliminary list of interstate routes to be marked by the states, including US 1 along the Atlantic. This highway began at Fort Kent, Maine, and followed the existing Route 24 to Houlton, and Route 15 to Bangor, beyond which it generally followed the Atlantic Highway to Miami. In all states but Georgia that had numbered their state highways, Route 1 followed only one or two numbers across the state.The following routes were used, shown on the 1926 Rand McNally: *Florida: 4 *Georgia: 15, 17, and 24 *South Carolina: 12 and 50 *North Carolina: 50 *Virginia: 31 *Maryland: state highways were not numbered prior to the U.S. Highway system *Pennsylvania: 12 and 1 *New Jersey: 13 and 1 *New York: 1 *New England: 1 and 24, and a small piece of 160 beyond Madawaska, Maine (in the 1925 plan, part of 15 was also used) The only significant deviation from the Atlantic Highway was between Augusta, Georgia, and Jacksonville, Florida, where Route 1 was assigned to a more inland route, rather than following the Atlantic Highway via Savannah. One of the many changes made to the system before the final numbering was adopted in 1926 involved US 1 in Maine. The 1925 plan had assigned US 1 to the shorter inland route (Route 15) between Houlton and Bangor, while US 2 followed the longer coastal route via Calais. In the system as adopted in 1926, US 2 instead took the inland route, while US 1 followed the coast, absorbing all of the former Routes 24 and 1 in New England. Many local and regional relocations, often onto parallel superhighways, were made in the early days of US 1; this included the four-lane divided Route 25 in New Jersey, completed in 1932 with the opening of the Pulaski Skyway, and a bypass of Bangor involving the Waldo- Hancock Bridge, opened in 1931. The Overseas Highway from Miami to Key West was completed in 1938, and soon became a southern extension of US 1. The beginning of U.S. 1 as of March 1951. With the construction of the Interstate Highway System in and after the 1950s, much of US 1 from Houlton to Miami was bypassed by Interstate 95. Between Houlton and Brunswick, Maine, I-95 took a shorter inland route, much of it paralleling US 2 on the alignment proposed for US 1 in 1925. Between Philadelphia and Baltimore, I-95 leaves US 1 to pass through Wilmington. Most notably, I-95 and US 1 follow different corridors between Petersburg, Virginia, and Jacksonville, Florida; while US 1 followed the Fall Line west of the coastal plain, I-95 takes a more direct route through the plain and its swamps. Although some of this part of US 1 was followed by other Interstates‚ÄîI-85 between Petersburg and Henderson, North Carolina, and I-20 between Camden, South Carolina and Augusta, Georgia‚Äîthe rest remains an independent route with four lanes in many places. By the late 1970s, most of I-95 had been completed, replacing US 1 as the main corridor of the east coast and relegating most of it to local road status.

The route closely parallels I-95 for most of its route and has numerous intersections with its parent. *US 401 from Sumter, South Carolina, to Wise, North Carolina, near the Virginia border. For most of the route, it parallels US 1 about to the east, though the two share pavement in Raleigh, North Carolina. *US 501 from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Buena Vista, Virginia. The highway runs southeast-to- northwest, meeting its parent in Aberdeen and Sanford. *US 601 from Tarboro, South Carolina, to Mount Airy, North Carolina. It runs mostly due south-to- north to the west of US 501, meeting the parent route in Camden, South Carolina. *US 701 from Georgetown, South Carolina, to Four Oaks, North Carolina. Furthest east of the US 1 auxiliary routes, it never meets its parent route, but does intersect US 501 in Conway, South Carolina, and terminates at US 301 at its northern end. US 101, despite its number, is not an auxiliary route, but rather considered a primary U.S. Route in its own right as major highway west of the former US 99 on the west coast of the United States. (In the numbering scheme, its first \\"digit\\" is \\"10\\".)

At a total of just over , it is the longest state route in California. SR 1 has several portions designated as either Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), Cabrillo Highway, Shoreline Highway, or Coast Highway. Its southern terminus is at Interstate 5 (I-5) near Dana Point in Orange County and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 101 (US 101) near Leggett in Mendocino County. SR 1 also at times runs concurrently with US 101, most notably through a stretch in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, and across the Golden Gate Bridge. The highway is designated as an All-American Road. In addition to providing a scenic route to numerous attractions along the coast, the route also serves as a major thoroughfare in the Greater Los Angeles Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, and several other coastal urban areas. SR 1 was built piecemeal in various stages, with the first section opening in the Big Sur region in the 1930s. However, portions of the route had several names and numbers over the years as more segments opened. It was not until the 1964 state highway renumbering that the entire route was officially designated as SR 1\\\\. Although SR 1 is a popular route for its scenic beauty, frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused several segments to be either closed for lengthy periods for repairs, or re- routed inland. Route description SR 1 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and through the Los Angeles metro area, Monterey, Santa Cruz, San Francisco metro area, and Leggett is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 1 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, only a few stretches between Los Angeles and San Francisco have officially been designated as a scenic highway, meaning that there are substantial sections of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. The Big Sur section from San Luis Obispo to Carmel is an official National Scenic Byway. The entire route is designated as a Blue Star Memorial Highway to recognize those in the United States armed forces. In Southern California, the California State Legislature has designated the segment between Interstate 5 (I-5) in Dana Point and US 101 near Oxnard as the Pacific Coast Highway (commonly referred to as \\"PCH\\"). Between US 101 at the Las Cruces junction ( south of Buellton) and US 101 in Pismo Beach, and between US 101 in San Luis Obispo and Interstate 280 in San Francisco, the legislature has designated SR 1 as the Cabrillo Highway, after the explorer Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo who sailed along the coast line. The legislature has also designated the route as the Shoreline Highway between the Manzanita Junction near Marin City and Leggett. Smaller segments of the highway have been assigned several other names by the state and municipal governments. The legislature has also relinquished state control of segments within Dana Point, Newport Beach, Santa Monica, and Oxnard; those segments are now maintained by those respective municipalities. In addition to connecting the coastal cities and communities along its path, SR 1 provides access to beaches, parks, and other attractions along the coast, making it a popular route for tourists. The route annually helps bring several billion dollars to the state's tourism industry. For the most part, the route runs parallel to the coastline, or close to it, but does turn several miles inland at various locations to avoid several federally controlled or protected areas such as Vandenberg Air Force Base, Diablo Canyon Power Plant and Point Reyes National Seashore. Segments of SR 1 range from a rural two-lane road to an urban freeway. Because of the former, long distance thru traffic traveling between the coastal metropolitan areas are instead advised to use faster routes such as US 101 or I-5. =Orange County= Southbound PCH in Crystal Cove State Park near Laguna Beach At its southernmost end in Orange County, SR 1 terminates at I-5 in Capistrano Beach in Dana Point. It then travels west into the city center. After leaving Dana Point, Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) becomes simply \\"Coast Highway\\" while at the same time continuing northwest along the coast through Laguna Beach (where it meets the southern terminus of SR 133) and Crystal Cove State Park. SR 1 then enters Newport Beach and passes through several affluent neighborhoods, including Newport Coast and Corona Del Mar, spans the entrance to the Upper Newport Bay, which marks the boundary between East Coast Highway and West Coast Highway, and crosses California State Route 55 near its southern terminus. Upon entering Huntington Beach, SR 1 regains the Pacific Coast Highway designation. It passes Huntington State Beach and the southern terminus of California State Route 39 before reaching Bolsa Chica State Beach and the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. PCH then continues along the coast into Seal Beach, the final city on its journey in Orange County. =Los Angeles and Ventura counties= PCH enters Los Angeles County and the city of Long Beach after crossing the San Gabriel River. SR 1 then continues northwest through the city to its junction with Lakewood Boulevard (State Route 19) and Los Coyotes Diagonal at the Los Alamitos Circle, more than from the coast. From the traffic circle, it continues inland west through Long Beach, including approximately one mile adjacent to the southern boundary of Signal Hill. PCH is marked as such in Long Beach, but originally bore the name of Hathaway Avenue east of the traffic circle and State Street west of there. PCH then passes through the Los Angeles districts of Wilmington and Harbor City. While bypassing the immediate coastline of Palos Verdes, SR 1 continues to head west into the cities of Lomita and Torrance along the route of the former Redondo-Wilmington Boulevard. PCH then turns north through Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach. Upon entering Manhattan Beach, it becomes Sepulveda Boulevard and turns back into PCH designation through El Segundo. At Imperial Highway, it regains the name Sepulveda Boulevard as it descends and passes under two runways of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) via the Sepulveda Boulevard Tunnel. Southbound SR 1 between Santa Monica and LAX After leaving LAX, SR 1 splits from Sepulveda and turns northwest, becoming Lincoln Boulevard and passing through the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Westchester, Playa Vista, and Venice, as well as the unincorporated community of Marina Del Rey. It then enters the city of Santa Monica, where SR 1 turns southwest, merging onto the westernmost segment of the Santa Monica Freeway. Passing through the McClure Tunnel (which also serves as the national western terminus of Interstate 10), SR 1 emerges along the beachfront in Santa Monica and continues along the coast; it is known locally also as Palisades Beach Road and formerly as Roosevelt Highway. Upon leaving Santa Monica, it once again regains the name PCH as it follows the coast, curving west through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles before becoming the main thoroughfare of the city of Malibu while traversing the entire of that city. PCH passing Mugu Rock at Point Mugu SR 1 crosses the county line and continue through the Ventura County portion of the Malibu coast through Leo Carrillo State Park and Point Mugu State Park. After passing through a notch in the promontory that marks Point Mugu, the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains, and the beginning of the Oxnard Plain. The road cut left a very large rock formation at the tip of the point that is called the Mugu Rock. At that point, PCH leaves the coast and heads north, and then northwest as a freeway along the northeastern boundary of Naval Base Ventura County Point Mugu for several miles to an interchange at Rice Avenue, Pleasant Valley Road, and Oxnard Boulevard in Oxnard. The reconstructed interchange at Rice Avenue and Pleasant Valley Road channels traffic north on the surface street, Rice Avenue, towards the interchange with US 101\\\\. The historic route along Oxnard Boulevard was relinquished in 2014. Truck traffic to and from the Port of Hueneme also uses this designated route at the Rice Avenue/Hueneme Road connector to connect with Route 101 at the Rice Avenue Interchange. After traveling through Ventura, SR 1 separates from US 101 to travel the historic beach route along the Rincon coast that was originally opened up by the construction of the Railroad Coastal Route from Emma Wood State Beach to the Mobil Pier Undercrossing near Sea Cliff, where it rejoins US 101 about south of the Santa Barbara County line near La Conchita. =Central Coast= The US 101/SR 1 concurrency (although actual signage mentioning SR 1 through this segment is nonexistent) from the Mobil Pier Undercrossing runs for , passing through the City of Santa Barbara and its neighboring communities along the coast of Santa Barbara County. The route then turns away from the coast at Gaviota, avoiding Point Conception, and heads due north through Gaviota State Park and the Gaviota Tunnel. In Las Cruces, SR 1, now named Cabrillo Highway, splits again from US 101 and heads northwest to the city of Lompoc. It is briefly joined with SR 246 along Lompoc's east-west Ocean Avenue, before turning north as H Street to Harris Grade Road, where it then regains the Cabrillo Highway name. After reaching the main entrance to Vandenberg Air Force Base, SR 1 turns northeast, away from the immediate coastline of the base, to join SR 135\\\\. Route 135 then splits from Route 1 south of Orcutt, and the Cabrillo Highway turns northwest back towards the coast to Guadalupe. It enters San Luis Obispo County, avoiding the immediate coastline of the protected Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes, before passing through Grover Beach and subsequently joining US 101 for the third time at Pismo Beach. The US 101/SR 1 concurrency then avoids the immediate coastline of Avila Beach and Diablo Canyon Power Plant, and instead heads straight inland to San Luis Obispo. SR 1 splits from US 101 at Santa Rosa Street in San Luis Obispo and then resumes as a four lane road as the Cabrillo Highway. It rejoins the coast in Morro Bay, running through that city as a freeway, where it crosses Morro Creek at the site of a prehistoric Chumash settlement dating to the Millingstone Horizon. From there, SR 1 proceeds north to Cayucos until it again becomes a winding, two lane road with occasional passing lanes. It then continues along the coast through Cambria and San Simeon, and past the elephant seal colony at Piedras Blancas Light Station. SR 1 provides access to Hearst Castle in San Simeon in Northern San Luis Obispo County. =Big Sur= Looking south, showing the McWay Rocks, about 16 miles south of Big Sur The Bixby Creek Bridge in Big Sur SR 1 then enters the Big Sur region, crossing San Carp√≥foro Creek just south of the Monterey County line. For about from San Carp√≥foro Creek to Malpaso Creek, the road winds and hugs the cliffs of Big Sur, passing various coastal parks in the area, with no connection to the other side of the Santa Lucia Mountains except for Nacimiento-Fergusson Road. The road briefly leaves the coast for a few miles, passing through a redwood forest in the Big Sur River valley. The Big Sur segment of the highway, built between 1919 and 1937, also crosses a number of now historic bridges, including the scenic Bixby Creek Bridge, a reinforced concrete arch with a span that passes over the Bixby Creek gorge, the Rocky Creek Bridge, and the Big Creek Bridge. =Monterey Bay Area= After crossing the Carmel River, SR 1 turns inland and runs along the eastern boundary of Carmel before becoming a freeway in Monterey. After bypassing the immediate coastline of Pebble Beach and the rest of the Monterey Peninsula, the freeway heads north along the coast of Monterey Bay through Sand City, Seaside, and Marina. At the interchange with SR 156 near Castroville, SR 1 continues north as a two-lane rural road to Moss Landing. SR 1 becomes a freeway once again just before entering into Santa Cruz County. This four-lane freeway continues up the Monterey Bay coast through Watsonville to its interchange with SR 17 in Santa Cruz. (This trumpet interchange is locally known as The Fishhook due to its tight loop ramps that resemble a fishhook when viewed from above). After a short expressway section, it skirts downtown Santa Cruz as four-lane Mission Street, regaining the Cabrillo Highway designation (local/historic name is \\"Coast Road\\") after it leaves the city and continues north-west as a two-lane road (with occasional four-lane sections) up the coast. =San Francisco Bay Area= Scene from SR 1 near Half Moon Bay at Tunitas Creek Beach Entering San Mateo County, SR 1 follows the west coast of the San Francisco Peninsula, passing by the marine mammal colonies at A√±o Nuevo State Park, and the historic Pigeon Point Lighthouse, before reaching Half Moon Bay. Between Half Moon Bay and Pacifica, the highway bypasses a treacherous stretch known as Devil's Slide via the Tom Lantos Tunnels. The Golden Gate Bridge, which SR 1 shares with US 101 SR 1 winds along the Marin County coast SR 1 then becomes a freeway once again at Sharp Park in Pacifica before turning inland to join Interstate 280 in Daly City. Just short of reaching the City and County of San Francisco, SR 1 splits from Interstate 280, where the road becomes Junipero Serra Boulevard. Shortly thereafter, the highway makes a slight left, becoming the six-lane wide 19th Avenue; the San Francisco Municipal Railway's M Ocean View streetcar line runs in the median from this point until a junction to a rail only right-of-way near Rossmoor Drive. SR 1 then turns into Park Presidio Boulevard after it passes through the city's Golden Gate Park. Then after entering the Presidio of San Francisco, it goes through the MacArthur Tunnel before joining US 101 for a fourth time on the approach to the Golden Gate Bridge known as Doyle Drive. After crossing the bridge and entering Marin County, SR 1 then splits from US 101 again near Marin City, where it leaves the city and, as the Shoreline Highway, returns to a winding, two lane road as it passes over the Marin Hills to rejoin the coast at Muir Beach. After passing Stinson Beach and the Bolinas Lagoon, SR 1 avoids the immediate coastline of Point Reyes National Seashore and the rest of the Point Reyes Peninsula, and instead heads towards, and then along, the eastern shore of Tomales Bay. Leaving Tomales Bay, SR 1 heads further inland to intersect with Valley Ford Road just north of the Sonoma County border. It then rejoins the coast in Bodega Bay, where its name changes to Coast Highway past the Sonoma Coast State Beaches. After bridging the Russian River at Jenner, SR 1 continues to wind along the rugged coast to Fort Ross, Salt Point State Parks, and the planned community of Sea Ranch. =Mendocino County= SR 1 crosses Russian Gulch State Park on the Frederick W. Panhorst Bridge SR 1 then crosses the Gualala River and enters Mendocino County. The highway enters the city of Point Arena, in which it becomes Main Street, before following School Street to the northwest and then becoming Shoreline Highway once again. It bridges the Garcia River and then, near Elk, the Navarro River, where it meets SR 128. At the town of Albion, the Albion River is spanned by the Albion River Bridge, the only remaining wooden trestle bridge on the highway. SR 1 then passes through Little River and Van Damme State Park, crosses Big River and passes through Mendocino Headlands State Park and the Victorian community of Mendocino. Continuing north, SR 1 crosses Russian Gulch State Park on the Frederick W. Panhorst Bridge, and passes through the town of Caspar. It passes through a roundabout just south of the intersection with the western terminus of SR 20, where it widens to two lanes, then bridges the Noyo River at Noyo, becomes Main Street of Fort Bragg, and crosses the California Western Railroad. North of Fort Bragg as a two-lane highway again, SR 1 passes MacKerricher State Park and the towns of Cleone and Inglenook before crossing Ten Mile River. After passing Westport-Union Landing State Beach, the road goes through a series of redwood-forested switchbacks before reaching Rockport. North of Rockport, the highway turns away from the Lost Coast to avoid steep and unstable highlands created by Mendocino Triple Junction uplift. The highway follows Cottaneva Creek inland through redwood- forested mountainous terrain before terminating at US 101 just outside Leggett. History SR 1 has become famous worldwide, but the highway was signed as several other routes prior to 1964. When the road was first envisioned in the World War I era, California highways were referred to by either a highway name or a route number. The route numbers were used by state highway planners and the Legislature from 1915 until 1964, but were never posted on highways, referred to by the auto clubs or public, nor used on maps. The SR 1 designation was first assigned in 1939. Various portions of SR 1 have been posted and referred to by various names and numbers over the years. State construction of what became SR 1 started after the state's third highway bond issue passed before 1910. =Segments initially constructed= Bixby Canyon Bridge under construction in 1932 Folsom Prison was paid 35 cents per day to help build the roadway. Eager for a direct coastal route between Ventura and Santa Barbara, civic boosters used locally raised funds to begin building the Rincon Sea Level Road in 1911. The route between the Ventura River and Carpinteria had been an unimproved route along small alluvial fan beaches that skirted coastal bluff rock outcroppings at low tide. Construction of the Southern Pacific Coast Line railroad had created a road flanked by riprap along this area. In order to make this part of the first coastal route for motorists driving from San Francisco to Los Angeles, they paved the road and built wooden causeways where the route flooded from the ocean waves. Local funding ran out, but the newly formed State Highway Commission took over and completed the road in 1913. One of the most difficult routes to build was along the Big Sur coast. The state first approved building Route 56, or the Carmel-San Simeon Highway, to connect Big Sur to the rest of California in 1919. Federal funds were appropriated and in 1921 voters approved additional state funds. San Quentin State Prison set up three temporary prison camps to provide unskilled convict labor to help with road construction. One was set up by Little Sur River, one at Kirk Creek and a third was later established in the south at Anderson Creek. Inmates were paid 35 cents per day and had their prison sentences reduced in return. The route necessitated construction of 33 bridges, the largest of which was the Bixby Creek Bridge. Six more concrete arch bridges were built between Point Sur and Carmel. After 18 years of construction, aided by New Deal funds during the Great Depression, the paved two-lane road was completed and opened on June 17, 1937. The road was initially called the Carmel-San Simeon Highway (Route 56), but was better known as the Roosevelt Highway, honoring the current President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A 1921 law extended Route 56 south over the county road to Cambria. Route 60, from Oxnard via the coast to San Juan Capistrano, was extended from Oxnard to El Rio (midway to Ventura, now the site of the Oxnard Boulevard interchange with US 101), in 1925. At Point Mugu, a path for the highway was cut through the mountains using surplus World War I explosives, thus creating Mugu Rock. The 1921 legislation, in theory, made Route 60 a continuous coastal loop, with both ends at what became US 101 in Oxnard and at Capistrano Beach (since 1964 the southern terminus of SR 1 at Interstate 5 in Orange County). Route 56 was extended further south from Cambria to connect to present-day US 101 in San Luis Obispo in 1931. The route from San Simeon to Carmel (connecting with existing county highways at each end) was one of two sections designated as SR 1\\\\. It and Route 60 were intended as links in a continuous coastal roadway from Oregon to Mexico, (Internet Archive ) A large expansion of the state highway system in 1933 resulted in Route 56 being extended in both directions. To the south, a second section was added, beginning at Pismo Beach on US 101 (Route 2) and heading south through Guadalupe and Lompoc to rejoin US 101 at a junction called Los Cruces (sic), just north of Gaviota Pass. (A short piece near Orcutt and Los Alamos had been part of Route 2, which originally followed present SR 135 from Los Alamos to Santa Maria.) To the north, Route 56 was continued along the coast from Carmel through Santa Cruz to San Francisco. Several discontinuous pieces were added north of San Francisco, one from Route 1 (US 101) north of the Golden Gate to the county line near Valley Ford, another from the Russian River near Jenner (where the new Route 104 ended) to Westport, and a third from Ferndale to Route 1 near Fernbridge. Except for the gaps in Route 56 north of San Francisco, these additions completed the coastal highway, with other sections formed by Routes 1, 2, and 71.: \\"Ferndale to State Highway Route 1 near Fernbridge.\\" \\"Russian River near Jenner to Westport.\\" \\"State Highway near southerly end of Marin Peninsula to the Marin-Sonoma County line via the Coast Route.\\" \\"Santa Cruz to San Francisco via Coast.\\" \\"State Highway Route 56 near Carmel to Santa Cruz.\\" \\"State Highway Route 2 near Las Cruces via Lompoc and Guadalupe to State Highway Route 2 near Pismo.\\": \\"Route 56 is from: (a) Route 2 near Los Cruces via Lompoc and Guadalupe to Route 2 near Pismo. (b) San Luis Obispo to San Francisco along the coast via Cambria, San Simeon, Carmel, and Santa Cruz. (c) State Highway near southerly end of Marin Peninsula to the Marin-Sonoma County line via the Coast Route. (d) Russian River near Jenner to Westport. (e) Ferndale to Route 1 near Fernbridge.\\" \\"Route 60 is from Route 2 near El Rio via Oxnard to Route 2 south of San Juan Capistrano.\\" The section of SR 1 from Santa Monica to Oxnard, via Malibu, went out to contract in 1925 as \\"Coast Boulevard\\", but was designated \\"Theodore Roosevelt Highway\\" when it was dedicated in 1929. Before the completion of its present alignment in 1937, a narrow, winding, steep road known as Pedro Mountain Road connected Montara with Pacifica. That highway was completed in 1914 and provided competition to the Ocean Shore Railroad, which operated between San Francisco and Tunitas Creek from 1907 to 1920. SR 1 also used to run along the coast between Pacifica and Daly City, but this segment was damaged and rendered unusable after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake on March 22, 1957. A small stub remains near Thornton Beach. Route 56 along Big Sur was incorporated into the state highway system and re-designated as SR 1 in 1939. The section of road along the Big Sur Coast was declared the first State Scenic Highway in 1965, and in 1966 the first lady, Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson, led the official designation ceremony at Bixby Creek Bridge. The route was designated as an All American Road by the US Government. =Signs first posted= SR 1 signs first went up after California decided to number its highways, in 1934. The section for Humboldt, Mendocino, Sonoma, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties was posted as SR 1, that section of the road known Route 56 (Las Cruces to Fernbridge). For Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties, Route 60 (San Juan Capistrano to the Oxnard area) became SR 3, and a few SR 3 signs were actually posted. The SR 3 signs were replaced by US 101 Alt. shields by 1936, as the road was built out; this change also allowed the extension of US 66 to end at another U.S. Route, in Santa Monica. The gaps of non-state highway along the northern coast were finally filled in by the Legislature in 1951, though the State Department of Public Works was not required to maintain the newly added portions immediately. A connection from near Rockport to Legislative Route 1 (signed US 101) at Leggett was also added to the Legislative Route 56 definition, as the existing county road north from Rockport to Ferndale had not yet been paved., 1955 The state Legislature in 1963 tossed out the old conflicting Legislative Route Numbers (1964 renumbering), got rid of some famous old U.S. routes, and renumbered many state highways. It abolished US 101A in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties and renumbered it as SR 1\\\\. The Rockport to Leggett connection then became State Route 208. The cover of \\"California Highways\\" magazine in fall 1964 shows state engineers posting the new shield at Point Mugu. The same year, the Legislature by state law named SR 1 \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" in Orange, Los Angeles and Ventura counties, \\"Cabrillo Highway\\" from Santa Barbara north to San Francisco, and \\"Shoreline Highway\\" from Marin County to its northern terminus. Many cities, however, did not change the name of city streets that are part of SR 1, such as Lincoln and Sepulveda boulevards in Los Angeles, Santa Monica and El Segundo; and Junipero Serra and Park Presidio boulevards in San Francisco. Several other cities and communities like Newport Beach and Bodega Bay merely named their respective city streets as \\"Coast Highway\\". =Modern alignments= Signs marking the northern terminus of SR 1 near Leggett; the route was originally proposed to run further north, but these plans were abandoned to avoid the steep and unstable highlands of the Lost Coast region. The freeway portion of SR 1 from Highway 68 in Monterey to Munras Avenue opened in 1956‚Äì1960. The segment from Munras Avenue to the northern border of Sand City and Seaside opened in 1968, and bypasses the original highway alignment of Munras Avenue and Fremont Street in Monterey, and Fremont Boulevard through Seaside. North of Seaside, the freeway was built over the original SR 1 alignment through Fort Ord in 1973. North of Fort Ord, SR 1 now veers to the left of the original alignment and bypasses Marina to the west. This segment including the interchange with SR 156 and the short, 2-lane Castroville Bypass opened in 1976. Originally SR 1 followed the SR 156 alignment to the SR 183 intersection in Castroville, then turned northwest, following the present-day SR 183 through Castroville before rejoining its existing alignment at the northern terminus of the Castroville Bypass. Plans to upgrade SR 1 to a freeway from its southern terminus all the way to Oxnard, including building an offshore causeway from the Santa Monica Pier to Topanga Canyon Boulevard south of Malibu, were ultimately killed by 1971 due to local opposition. In 1980, another section was added northwest of Ventura near Emma Wood State Beach, when several miles of the old two-lane alignment of U.S. Route 101 were posted as SR 1 where the freeway had bypassed it in about 1960. Then in 1988, the segment from Purisima Road in Lompoc to SR 135 was re-routed from Harris Grade Road to the former County Route S20 so it could directly serve Vandenberg Air Force Base. Construction to bridge the gap in the Lost Coast region between Rockport and Ferndale was eventually abandoned. The steepness and related geotechnical challenges of the coastal mountains made this stretch of coastline too costly for highway builders to establish routes through the area. In 1984, SR 1 was then re-routed to replace State Highway 208, connecting Rockport and Leggett, while the segment between Ferndale and Fernbridge was renumbered as State Highway 211. Most of the coastline in the area is now part of Sinkyone Wilderness State Park and the King Range National Conservation Area. The roadway along Devil's Slide, south of Pacifica, became the site of frequent deadly crashes and roadway-closing landslides. Beginning in 1958, Caltrans supported a plan to construct an inland bypass over Montara Mountain as an alternate route, but was eventually opposed by community and environmental groups who supported a tunnel instead. After decades of legal disputes, the Federal Highway Administration ordered Caltrans in 1995 to re- evaluate the proposed tunnel. Then on November 5, 1996, San Mateo County voters approved Measure T to change the county's official preference from the bypass to the tunnel. Ground eventually broke in 2005, and the Tom Lantos Tunnels opened in April 2013. In 2014, two-way traffic was restored along the original PCH segment from Copper Lantern to Blue Lantern streets in the Dana Point city center after 25 years of one-way operation. During that period, only northbound traffic had flowed along this section of PCH while southbound traffic had been diverted onto the parallel Del Prado Avenue. SR 1 has never been planned to extend south into San Diego, or north into Crescent City, where I-5 (which replaced the US 101 designation and signage between Los Angeles and San Diego) and US 101 serve as the coastal highways in those areas, respectively. =As a cycling venue= Cyclists descend SR 1 at Devil's Slide on Stage 2 of the 2012 Tour of California before the segment was bypassed one year later by the Tom Lantos Tunnels For the 1932 Summer Olympics, the segment of the SR 1 between Oxnard and Santa Monica (then known as the Theodore Roosevelt Highway) hosted part of the road cycling events. Portions of SR 1 have also hosted stages of the Tour of California. Maintenance =Landslides= Frequent landslides and erosion along the coast have caused portions of SR 1 to either be closed for long periods of time, or be re-routed entirely. Some of these include: * A segment along the coast between Pacifica and Daly City in what is now Thornton Beach was damaged and rendered unusable after a 5.3 magnitude earthquake on March 22, 1957. SR 1 was then eventually re-routed to turn inland to join Interstate 280. * The Piedras Blancas Realignment Project plans to re-route the road up to further inland to avoid the expected coastal erosion from the Piedras Blancas Light Station to the Arroyo de la Cruz Bridge in San Luis Obispo County. *Big Rock Mesa landslide in Malibu was one of the worst in state history. A total of 250 homes collapsed, cracked or slid off their foundation with 30 homes being condemned. The state agreed to pay forty million dollars as cutting through the hillside to build Pacific Coast Highway was a contributing cause. * The Devil's Slide area has been prone to major landslides. One slide in 1995 caused the road to be closed for five months, while another in 2006 led to a four-month closure. The Tom Lantos Tunnels, named after former U.S. Congressman Tom Lantos, opened in 2013 to bypass the area. * In 2011, major reconstruction was completed between Muir Beach and Stinson Beach, including the addition of a , , but mostly buried, retaining wall. This followed a four- month, $25 million reconstruction that repaired damage from a 2007 landslide. * A March 2011 landslide in the Big Sur region forced Caltrans to close the highway for several months. A section south of Lucia that is also prone to frequent landslides, known as Pitkins Curve and Rain Rocks, was replaced with a bridge and a covered rock shed. * During the winter of 2016‚Äì2017, the Big Sur region received more than of rain. The road was closed or partially closed due to mudslides and landslides in at least six locations. On February 20, Caltrans declared that the Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge just south of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park was damaged beyond repair, closing that segment of SR 1 for eight months, and effectively splitting Big Sur in half. Some businesses, cut off from customers and without access to supplies, were forced to close. For some residents, the only means of getting out was via helicopter. In March, Caltrans demolished the bridge and began construction of the replacement. The rebuilt bridge opened on October 13, 2017 at a cost of $24 million. * Another major slide at Mud Creek closed a stretch of the highway in May 2017. The huge slide at Mud Creek covered about of road with of dirt and rock. The slide was on a section of the road that was already closed due to smaller slides. The scale of the slide was compared to a very large slide during the winter of 1983‚Äì1984 that closed SR 1 for more than a year. A replacement roadway was built over the landslide and opened in July 2018, at a cost of $40 million. =Future projects= Since 1976, widening of SR 1 beyond one lane in each direction has been prohibited in rural areas within the California Coastal Zone, per California Public Resources Code section 30254. In 2014, Caltrans relinquished the portion of SR 1 in Oxnard along Oxnard Boulevard. The plan is then for PCH between Pleasant Valley Road and US 101 to be re-routed from Oxnard Boulevard onto Rice Avenue. That segment of Rice Avenue includes a railroad grade crossing at 5th Avenue that was the site of the February 2015 Oxnard train derailment, which eventually led to one death and 29 injuries. This was the twelfth accident at the crossing in ten years. An overpass has been planned at that site for almost two decades, but funding has not been available in Ventura County for the estimated $35 million grade separation project. In 2015, a $20 million project was proposed to add over 150 safety improvements to the stretch of the highway in Malibu. This follows a string of fatal accidents in the area, including one involving Caitlyn Jenner that claimed another person's life. The Calera Parkway project proposes to widen the non-freeway segment in Pacifica between the Rockaway Beach and Vallemar districts, but faces opposition by local residents and environmentalists. Major intersections In popular culture In 2012, The Beach Boys released a song titled \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\". Described by critics as \\"introspective\\", \\"autumnal\\", and \\"hymnlike\\", the song takes the perspective of an aged person driving down the highway during sunset as he reflects on his advancing years in life, deciding that he is more comfortable living alone.

Long Island extends to the east of the central core of Manhattan. A metropolitan area or metro is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less- populated surrounding territories under the same administrative division, sharing industry, infrastructure and housing.Squires, G. Ed. Urban Sprawl: Causes, Consequences, & Policy Responses. The Urban Institute Press (2002) A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socioeconomically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. Most metropolitan areas are anchored by one core city such as Paris metropolitan area (Paris) and New York metropolitan area (New York City). In some cases metropolitan areas have multiple centers of close to equal importance, such as Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metropolitan area (Dallas and Fort Worth), Islamabad‚ÄìRawalpindi metropolitan area (Islamabad and Rawalpindi), the Rhine- Ruhr in Germany and the Randstad in the Netherlands. In the United States, the concept of the metropolitan statistical area has gained prominence. Metropolitan areas may themselves be part of larger megalopolises. For urban centres outside metropolitan areas, that generate a similar attraction at smaller scale for their region, the concept of the regiopolis and respectively regiopolitan area or regio was introduced by German professors in 2006.Prof. Dr. Iris Reuther (FG Stadt- und Regionalplanung, Universit√§t Kassel): Presentation \\"Regiopole Rostock\\". 11 December 2008, retrieved 13 June 2009 (pdf). In the United States, the term micropolitan statistical area is used.  General definition  A metropolitan area combines an urban agglomeration (the contiguous, built-up area) with zones not necessarily urban in character, but closely bound to the center by employment or other commerce. These outlying zones are sometimes known as a commuter belt, and may extend well beyond the urban zone, to other political entities. For example, Islip, New York on Long Island is considered part of the New York metropolitan area. In practice, the parameters of metropolitan areas, in both official and unofficial usage, are not consistent. Sometimes they are little different from an urban area, and in other cases they cover broad regions that have little relation to a single urban settlement; comparative statistics for metropolitan area should take this into account. The term \\"Metropolitan\\" can also refer to a county-level municipal government structure, with some shared services between a central city and its suburbs, which may or may not include the entirety of a metropolitan area. Population figures given for one metro area can vary by millions. There has been no significant change in the basic concept of metropolitan areas since its adoption in 1950, although significant changes in geographic distributions have occurred since then, and more are expected.Whitehouse.gov Because of the fluidity of the term \\"metropolitan statistical area,\\" the term used colloquially is more often \\"metro service area,\\" \\"metro area,\\" or \\"MSA\\" taken to include not only a city, but also surrounding suburban, exurban and sometimes rural areas, all which it is presumed to influence. A polycentric metropolitan area contains multiple urban agglomerations not connected by continuous development. In defining a metropolitan area, it is sufficient that a city or cities form a nucleus with which other areas have a high degree of integration. See also the many lists of metropolitan areas itemized at .  Australia  The Australian Bureau of Statistics defines Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (GCCSAs) as the areas of functional extent of the seven state capitals and the Australian Capital Territory. GCCSAs replaced \\"Statistical Divisions\\" used until 2011. Brazil In Brazil, metropolitan areas are called \\"metropolitan regions\\". Each State defines its own legislation for the creation, definition and organization of a metropolitan region. The creation of a metropolitan region is not intended for any statistical purpose, although the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics uses them in its reports. Their main purpose is to allow for a better management of public policies of common interest to all cities involved. They don't have political, electoral or jurisdictional power whatsoever, so citizens living in a metropolitan region do not elect representatives for them. Canada Statistics Canada defines a census metropolitan area (CMA) as an area consisting of one or more adjacent municipalities situated around a major urban core. To form a CMA, the metropolitan area must have a population of at least 100,000, at least half within the urban core. To be included in the CMA, adjacent municipalities must have a high degree of integration with the core, as measured by commuter flows derived from census data. China In Chinese, there used to be no clear distinction between \\"megalopolis\\" (, lit. city cluster) and \\"metropolitan area\\" () until National Development and Reform Commission issued Guidelines on the Cultivation and Development of Modern Metropolitan Areas () on Feb 19, 2019, in which a metropolitan area was defined as \\"an urbanized spatial form in a megalopolis dominated by (a) supercity(-ies) or megacity(-ies), or a large metropolis playing a leading part, and within the basic range of 1-hour commute area.\\" European Union The European Union's statistical agency, Eurostat, has created a concept named Larger Urban Zone (LUZ). The LUZ represents an attempt at a harmonised definition of the metropolitan area, and the goal was to have an area from which a significant share of the residents commute into the city, a concept known as the \\"functional urban region\\". France France's national statistics institute, the INSEE, names an urban core and its surrounding area of commuter influence an aire urbaine (official translation: \\"urban area\\"). This statistical method applies to agglomerations of all sizes, but the INSEE sometimes uses the term aire m√©tropolitaine (metropolitan area) to refer to France's largest aires urbaines. Germany In German definition, metropolitan areas are eleven most densely populated areas in the Federal Republic of Germany. They comprise the major German cities and their surrounding catchment areas and form the political, commercial and cultural centres of the country. For urban centres outside metropolitan areas, that generate a similar attraction at smaller scale for their region, the concept of the Regiopolis and respectively regiopolitan area or regio was introduced by German professors in 2006. India In India, a metropolitan city is defined as one with a population more than 2 million. Japan In Japan, a metropolitan area () is a division set separately from administrative areas in order to define wide urban areas used in the Census conducted by the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. * Central City () Those of the greater metropolitan areas are the 23 special wards in the metropolis of Tokyo and other designated cities. Those of the metropolitan areas are cities with a population of more than half of a million, which are not included in the greater metropolitan areas. If the central cities are next to each other, the areas are integrated into one large area. * Surrounding Municipality (, lit. 'surrounding cities, towns and villages') Those are municipalities with ratios of the number of people commuting to the central city over 15 years old being 1.5% or more of the permanent population of and close to the central cities. If a municipality is surrounded by the surrounding municipalities, it will be a surrounding municipality. South Africa The Greater Johannesburg metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan area in South Africa. Its population was over 9.6 million as of the 2011 South Africa Census, in contrast to its urban area, which consisted of approximately 7.9 million inhabitants as of 2011. Conversely, metropolitan municipalities in South Africa are defined as commonly governed areas of a metropolitan area. The largest such metropolitan municipal government entity in South Africa is the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality, which presided over nearly 5 million people as of 2016. However, the Greater Johannesburg metropolitan area houses roughly ten times the population of its core municipal city of Johannesburg, which contained 957,441 people as of the 2011 census. Sweden Sweden defines a metropolitan area as a group of municipalities, based on statistics of commuting between central municipalities and surrounding municipalities and taking into account existing planning cooperation in the country's three geographic regions. They were defined around 1965. In 2005, a number of further municipalities were added to the defined areas. Turkey The word metropolitan describes a major city in Turkey like Istanbul, a city that is dominant to others both financially and socially. There are 30 officially defined \\"state metropolitan areas\\" in Turkey, for governing purposes.Metropolitan municipalities in Turkey United Kingdom The United Kingdom government's Office for National Statistics defines \\"travel to work areas\\" as areas where \\"at least 75% of an area's resident workforce work in the area and at least 75% of the people who work in the area also live in the area\\".Beginners' guide to UK geography - Travel to Work Areas (TTWAs) Office for National Statistics United States As of February 28, 2013, the United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defined 1,098 statistical areas for the metropolitan areas of the United States and Puerto Rico. These 1,098 statistical areas comprise 929 Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs)The United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines a Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) as one or more adjacent counties or county equivalents that have at least one urban core area of at least 10,000 population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties. and 169 Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs).The United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines a Combined Statistical Area (CSA) as an aggregate of adjacent Core Based Statistical Areas that are linked by commuting ties.

Written by Sam Rolfe and Harold Jack Bloom, the film is about a bounty hunter who tries to bring a murderer to justice, and is forced to accept the help of two strangers who are less than trustworthy. The original music score was composed by Bronis≈Çaw Kaper and the cinematography was by William C. Mellor. The Naked Spur was filmed on location in Durango and the San Juan Mountains in Colorado, and Lone Pine, California. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay‚Äîa rare honor for a Western. This was the third Western film collaboration between Anthony Mann and James Stewart. Plot In 1868, in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Howard Kemp offers a grizzled old prospector, Jesse Tate $20$ today for help tracking Ben Vandergroat, wanted for killing a marshal in Abilene, Kansas. Kemp shows him a torn WANTED poster. Tate assumes that Kemp is a sheriff. An avalanche of rocks blocks their path. Kemp fires, provoking another rock slide. Roy Anderson, recently discharged from the 6th Cavalry, is attracted by the shots. Kemp asks to see his discharge: Anderson is \\"morally unstable\\". Anderson scales a cliff face and catches Vandergroat. The outlaw's companion, Lina Patch, jumps in. Kemp and Tate stop the fight. Lina's father, killed robbing a bank in Abilene, was Vandergroat's friend. James Stewart and Millard Mitchell Vandergroat reveals that Kemp is no lawman and that the bottom of the WANTED poster offers $5,000($ today) to whoever brings him in. Tate and Anderson want their shares. Lina believes that Vandergroat is innocent. On the trail, Vandergroat wages a constant psychological campaign to turn his captors against each other by various means, starting with the observation that the reward will be larger divided by two. Scouting a mountain pass, Kemp and Tate spot a dozen Blackfoot far from their normal territory. Anderson confesses that they are after him for raping the chief's daughter. Kemp tells Anderson to ride away, fast, so the rest of them will be safe. The Blackfoot catch up to Kemp's group, and when they all stop, Anderson shoots the chief from hiding. Millard Mitchell and James Stewart During the ensuing battle, Kemp saves Vandergroat and is shot in the leg. Lina helps him to cover. They all ride on. When Kemp passes out, they make camp. Delirious, he thinks that he is leaving to fight in the Civil War and Lina is Mary, his fianc√©e. Strains of Beautiful Dreamer play. Vandergroat explains that Mary sold Kemp's ranch and ran away. He adds that Kemp's one-third share of the reward is not enough to buy his ranch: They should worry. Lina tells Kemp that she is not ‚Äúwith‚Äù Vandergroat romantically. She has only seen him fighting fair and believes his promise of a ranch in California. Later, Vandergroat loosens Kemp's saddle cinch and pushes him over the edge of a steep mountain trail. A tree breaks his fall, and he crawls back up. That night, Vandergroat grins to see Kemp gently pull Lina's blanket over her. They take refuge from a storm in a cave. Vandergroat tells Lina to distract Kemp so that he can escape through the back of the cave. The alternative: He will kill Kemp. The Beautiful Dreamer theme plays as Lina describes her dream of California and Kemp reminisces about his ranch. They kiss. Vandergroat takes his chance. Kemp hauls him back. Anderson wants to kill Vandergroat: The reward is \\"dead or alive\\". Tate stops Anderson but, infuriated, Kemp challenges Vandergroat to a quick draw, which he refuses. Janet Leigh and James Stewart At the river, now running so high they must detour downstream, Anderson lassoes Vandergroat's neck, intending to drag the ‚Äúsack of money‚Äù across. Kemp and Anderson fight. While Kemp and Anderson recover and Lina searches for firewood, Vandergroat offers Tate an irresistible temptation: a gold mine. Vandergroat and Lina ride double; Tate follows, holding a rifle. Vandergroat yells \\"Snake!\\" and in the confusion, grabs the rifle. Vandergroat kills Tate where the body will be seen by the others, Lina finally accepts the truth about him. Vandergroat fires on Kemp and Anderson from the cliff above, but Lina grabs the rifle barrel. While Anderson exchanges gunfire with Vandergroat, Kemp uses one of his spurs as a piton to climb the cliff and outflank Vandergroat. Suspicious, Vandergroat rises to fire at Kemp. Kemp throws the spur into his cheek, and Anderson shoots Vandergroat. The body falls into the river and is entangled in the roots of dead trees lodged on the opposite bank. Anderson lassos a snag and crosses. He wraps the rope around Vandergroat's body but is carried off by a huge floating tree trunk. Kemp drags Vandergroat's body across the river and hoists it onto his horse, in a rage, vowing that he will take him back. Lina says she will go with him, no matter his choice, marry him, and live with him. Weeping, he declares one last time that he is taking him back. The Beautiful Dreamer theme soars. Calming, Kemp asks her if she still wants to try California. He begins to dig the grave, and she makes coffee.

Production Anthony Mann and Janet Leigh The Naked Spur was the third of five Western collaborations between James Stewart and Anthony Mann and also, third of the eight collaborations they did overall. Two previous Westerns included Winchester '73 (1950) and Bend of the River (1952). Stewart was given the lead role of Howard Kemp, an embittered rancher turned bounty hunter. The film is notable for having only five speaking parts. There were a number of parts of a band of Native Americans that were ambushed by Anderson. Robert Ryan, known for his roles as ruthless villains and hard- boiled cops, was cast as Ben Vandergroat, a wild killer with a $5,000 \\"dead or alive\\" bounty on his head for the murder of a Kansas marshal. Ryan would work with Mann again in Men in War (1957) and God's Little Acre (1958). Janet Leigh was cast as Lina Patch, Vandergroat's companion who eventually falls in love with Kemp. Leigh starred alongside Ryan in the film noir Act of Violence (1948), which was directed by Fred Zinnemann. Ralph Meeker was cast as Roy Anderson, a disgraced Army officer. Millard Mitchell, who played Jesse Tate, a grizzled old prospector, died at fifty years of age from lung cancer shortly after this picture. This was his next-to-last movie, followed by Here Come the Girls (released October 1953), starring Bob Hope. The film was filmed in Lone Pine, California, and on location in the San Juan Mountains and Durango in Colorado. According to writer and historian Frederic B. Wildfang, during filming Stewart dedicated a monument in town, marking the area as the \\"Hollywood of the Rockies\\". Production started in late May and ended in June 1952. Reception Robert Ryan and Janet Leigh The film premiered in the first day of February 1953. That same year, two other films directed by Mann and starring Stewart were also released. These were Thunder Bay and The Glenn Miller Story. Empire describes the movie as \\"a masterpiece that‚Äôs too easy to take for granted\\" and \\"the best of an outstanding run of Westerns\\".https://www.empireonline.com/movies/naked-spur/review/ The movie holds a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/naked_spur/ According to MGM records the film earned $2,423,000 in the US and Canada and $1,427,000 overseas, resulting in a profit to the studio of $1,081,000. This success ensured three more Stewart-Mann collaborations, including two more westerns. Screenwriters Sam Rolfe and Harold Jack Bloom were nominated for the 1953 Best Screenplay Academy Award. In the years since its release, the film has achieved continued success, gaining more critical acclaim now than upon first release. Leonard Maltin has lauded The Naked Spur as \\"one of the best westerns ever made\\". In 1997, The Naked Spur was added to the United States National Film Registry, being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Although much is made of the collaboration between James Stewart and Anthony Mann, Robert Ryan also teamed with Mann in The Naked Spur, Men in War, and God's Little Acre.

The film follows various people involved in the country and gospel music businesses in Nashville, Tennessee, over a five-day period, leading up to a gala concert for a populist outsider running for President on the Replacement Party ticket. Nashville is often noted for its scope. The film contains 24 main characters, an hour's worth of musical numbers, and multiple storylines. Its large ensemble cast includes David Arkin, Barbara Baxley, Ned Beatty, Karen Black, Ronee Blakley, Timothy Brown, Keith Carradine, Geraldine Chaplin, Robert DoQui, Shelley Duvall, Allen Garfield, Henry Gibson, Scott Glenn, Jeff Goldblum, Barbara Harris, David Hayward, Michael Murphy, Allan F. Nicholls, Dave Peel, Cristina Raines, Bert Remsen, Lily Tomlin, Gwen Welles, and Keenan Wynn. The screenplay for Nashville was written by Altman's frequent collaborator Joan Tewkesbury, based partly on her experiences as an outsider visiting the city and observing its local music industry. Several incidents she experienced appear in the finished film, though Altman improvised numerous additional scenes and plot strands during filming. The film was shot on location in Nashville in 1974. Nashville was released by Paramount Pictures in the summer of 1975, and opened to largely positive reviews. It garnered numerous accolades, including five Academy Award nominations, winning for Best Original Song for Carradine's track \\"I'm Easy\\". The film was also nominated for a total of 11 Golden Globe Awards, to date the highest number of nominations received by one film. Selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1992, it is now considered Altman's magnum opus, \\"It seems clearer than ever that Nashville is [...] Altman's greatest achievement\\" and one of the greatest films of all time. Plot Hal Philip Walker, Replacement Party candidate in the 1976 United States presidential election, arrives in Nashville for a fundraising gala. Meanwhile, country superstar Haven Hamilton records a patriotic song commemorating the Bicentennial. Opal, an Englishwoman who claims to be working on a documentary for the BBC, attempts to listen in on the sessions. Later that day, country singer Barbara Jean returns to Nashville following a burn accident, and is greeted at Berry Field by local industry elites, including Haven and his companion, Lady Pearl, a nightclub owner. Also present are Pfc. Glenn Kelly, who is obsessed with Barbara Jean, and a popular folk trio consisting of married couple Bill and Mary, and guitarist Tom, who are in town to record an album. Meanwhile, Martha, a teen groupie going by the name \\"L.A. Joan,\\" is picked up by her uncle, Mr. Green, at the airport; she has arrived to visit her dying aunt Esther, but covertly plans to pursue musicians. In the airport cafe, African-American cook Wade Cooley and his co- worker, a waitress named Sueleen, discuss her aspirations to become a singer. On the tarmac, Barbara Jean collapses from heat exhaustion, and those in attendance depart the airport only to become stranded after a vehicle pile-up occurs. During the commotion, Winifred, an aspiring country singer, runs away from her husband Star; Star then gives a ride to Kenny Frasier, who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview Linnea Reese, a white gospel singer, and Tommy Brown, an African-American country singer. That night, Sueleen performs at an open mic at Lady Pearl's club, demonstrating no singing ability. Meanwhile, Linnea's husband Del has John Triplette, Walker's political organizer, over for dinner. Throughout the meal, Linnea mainly focuses on communicating with her two deaf children. Tom, who crossed paths with Linnea earlier that day, phones the house to ask Linnea on a date, but she dissuades him. Glamorous singer Connie White also performs that night, in lieu of Barbara Jean at the Grand Ole Opry. Mary misses Connie's performance to Bill's dismay, instead having sex with Tom at the hotel. At the hospital, Barbara Jean argues with her manager husband Barnett over Connie replacing her, and he accuses her of having another nervous breakdown. On Sunday morning, Lady Pearl, Wade, and Sueleen attend a Catholic mass, while Linnea sings in the choir of a black Baptist church. In the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings \\"In the Garden\\" from her wheelchair while Mr. Green, Pfc. Kelly, and others watch. Opal wanders through a massive auto scrapyard, recording observations on a tape recorder. Haven, Tommy, and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred unsuccessfully attempts to sing on a small stage. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who recruits them to perform at the gala, while Tom tries to get chauffeur Norman to score him drugs. After Barbara Jean is discharged, she gives a performance at Opryland USA that ends in her being pulled off stage as she rambles between songs. To remediate her poor performance, Barnett pledges her to perform at Walker's gala. Martha meanwhile agitates Kenny, who is renting a room in her uncle's house, when she attempts to investigate his violin case. At Lady Pearl's club that night, Linnea, Martha, Bill, Mary, Opal, Norman and Wade are among those attending an open mic. Tom sings \\"I'm Easy\\" and Linnea, moved, goes back to his room, where they have sex. Meanwhile, at an all-male Walker fundraiser, Sueleen is booed off stage for singing poorly; Del and Triplette convince her to perform a striptease in exchange for a slot at the gala. A drunken Del later comes onto Sueleen, but she is saved by Wade. The next morning, the performers and audience converge at the Parthenon for Walker's gala concert. The lineup consists of Haven, Barbara Jean, Linnea and her choir, Mary and Tom, and Sueleen; Winifred also arrives, hoping to sing. Meanwhile, Mr. Green and Kenny arrive at the gala searching for Martha, who has failed to attend her aunt Esther's funeral, and find her accompanying Bill. During Barbara Jean's set, Kenny produces a gun from his violin case, and begins shooting at the stage. A bullet grazes Haven's arm, but Barbara Jean is seriously injured. Pfc. Kelly disarms Kenny as chaos breaks out. Barbara Jean is carried from the stage, bleeding and unconscious, while Haven tries to calm the crowd by exhorting them to sing, asserting that \\"This isn't Dallas\\". Winifred is handed the microphone in the melee, and begins singing \\"It Don't Worry Me\\", joined by Linnea's gospel choir. Cast Major characters Minor characters * Richard Baskin, the film's musical supervisor, wrote several of the songs performed in the film. He has a cameo as Frog, a session musician, appearing in several scenes. * Merle Kilgore as Trout, the owner of a club that has an open-mic talent night that gives Sueleen Gay what she believes is her big break as a singer. There are cameo appearances by Elliott Gould, Julie Christie, Vassar Clements and Howard K. Smith, all playing themselves. Gould and Christie were passing through Nashville when Altman added them. Altman himself plays Bob, an unseen producer who in the beginning of the film is producing Haven Hamilton's song \\"200 Years.\\" He can be heard on a speaker when Hamilton gets agitated by Frog's inept piano playing. Analysis and themes In a 1995 academic article published in American Quarterly, Paul Lauter, a professor of American Studies at Trinity College, compared the film to \\"a poststructuralist theoretical text\\", adding that \\"it invites, indeed valorizes, contradiction and seems designed to resist closure.\\" As a result, he explained, \\"interpretations of the film have been wildly divergent and evaluations contradictory.\\" =Political content= Film scholars Yoram Allon, Del Cullen, and Hannah Patterson describe Nashville as an \\"epic study of ambition, greed, talent, and politics in American culture, with the country and western music businesses serving as a microcosm of American society.\\" Ray Sawhill of Salon views the film as reflective of the 1970s' political climate, writing that the film \\"comes across as a piece of New Journalism; it's like Norman Mailer's reports from conventions and rallies. Altman is using Nashville metaphorically‚Äîhe's really talking about politics. I wish he didn't make that quite so explicit. There's a reference to Dallas and a few to the Kennedys, as well as some red- white-and-blue visual cues, that the film could have done without. Still, the result is an X-ray of the era's uneasy political soul. What it reveals is a country trying to pull itself together from a nervous breakdown.\\" =Celebrity= Sawhill suggests that the film is preoccupied with \\"a populist culture driving itself mad with celebrity\\" and presents Nashville as a \\"provincial New York or Hollywood, as one of the places where the culture manufactures its image of itself.\\" He cites the various recording and communication devices present as evidence of this: \\"wires, phones, intercoms, cameras, mikes, speakers‚Äîseem to be everywhere; so does the machinery of publicity and fame. We watch the city recording itself, playing itself back to itself and marketing that image to itself. We eavesdrop on the culture's conversation with itself. We're watching people decide how they want to see themselves and how they want to sell themselves.\\" Production =Screenplay= The original screenplay for Nashville was written by Joan Tewkesbury, who had collaborated with Altman on several of his films, including McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) and Thieves Like Us (1974). She had proposed a Nashville-set film to Altman prior to his filming of McCabe & Mrs. Miller; he became interested in the setting and sent Tewkesbury to Nashville in the fall of 1973 to observe the area and its citizenry. Tewkesbury's diary of her trip provided the basis for the screenplay, with many observations making it into the finished film, such as the highway pileup. However, as with most Altman projects, much of the dialogue was improvised with the script acting as a \\"blueprint\\" dictating the actions of the characters and the plot. Tewkesbury, who was working as an instructor at the University of Southern California, rewrote her screenplay several times. In the original draft, the film opened with a scene featuring Tom on the street in New York City prior to his arrival in Nashville. Tewkesbury had been partly inspired to write the film based on her observations of the music industry being geographically \\"pulled apart. The country-western thing had suddenly exploded in Nashville, but [musicians] still had to come to New York for getting paid, and business deals.\\" None of Tewkesbury's incarnations of the screenplay featured any death scenes, but Altman, who had a \\"penchant for the tragic denouement,\\" proposed the idea that Barbara Jean would be assassinated in the finale. Numerous characters in Nashville are based on real country music figures: Henry Gibson's Haven Hamilton is a composite of Roy Acuff, Hank Snow, and Porter Wagoner; Ronee Blakley's Barbara Jean is based on Loretta Lynn; the black country singer Tommy Brown (played by Timothy Brown) is based on Charley Pride; and the feuding folk trio is based on Peter, Paul and Mary; within the trio, the married couple of Bill and Mary were inspired by Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert, who later became Starland Vocal Band. Keith Carradine's character is believed to be inspired by Kris Kristofferson, and Karen Black's Connie White was conceived as a composite of Lynn Anderson (who herself spoke unfavorably of the film after its release), Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton. Other characters were based on or inspired by real persons: Linnea was inspired by Louise Fletcher, who had appeared in Altman's Thieves Like Us (1973), and who had two deaf parents. =Casting= As with most of Altman's feature films, he cast the roles using unorthodox methods, forgoing standard auditions and instead basing his decisions off meetings with individual actors. Geraldine Chaplin, daughter of Charlie Chaplin and Oona O'Neill, was the first to be cast, appearing in the role of Opal, the chatty journalist who has arrived from out of town to cover the gala. Screenwriter Tewkesbury, who had based the character of Opal on herself, selected Chaplin for the role long before the production had even secured funding. Altman flew Chaplin from her residence in Switzerland to Nashville, and she toured the city with Tewkesbury in preparation for the role. Several Altman regulars were cast in the film, among them Keith Carradine as Tom, the dashing folk singer who woos several of the female characters, and Shelley Duvall as Martha, the young groupie. Both Carradine and Duvall had had minor roles in McCabe & Mrs. Miller, and had co- starred in Thieves Like Us. Through Carradine, Altman met Allan Nicholls, Carradine's co-star from a Broadway production of Hair. After a meeting, Altman offered Nicholls the role of Bill. Cristina Raines, Carradine's real- life girlfriend at the time, was given the role of Mary, the female counterpart in Bill and Tom's folk trio. Karen Black was cast in the role of glamorous singer Connie White after having approached Altman to appear in a prior film, the psychological thriller Images (1972). Black, who had been writing and singing songs in the interim, was cast in Nashville after performing several original songs for Altman. The role of Barbara Jean had not been filled when filming was about to commence. Ronee Blakley, a singer- songwriter from Idaho with no acting experience, was in Nashville at the time and took on the role at the last minute, having been hired to write several songs for the film. Barbara Harris, primarily a stage actress, was given the role of fledgling singer Winifred, while Gwen Welles was cast as Sueleen, a waitress who longs to be a singer. In the role of Linnea Reese, the gospel singer and dedicated mother, Altman cast Lily Tomlin, who at the time had no prior film experience, having worked exclusively in television. \\"When I got the script, I didn't even know what part I was being considered for,\\" Tomlin recalled. \\"But I thought, I could play any one of these parts. Even the boys.\\" Ned Beatty was cast as Del, Linnea's lawyer husband. Robert Duvall was initially sought for the role of Haven Hamilton, the country superstar, but he declined the role based on Altman's low salary offer. Instead, Altman cast Henry Gibson in the part. Altman struggled finding an actor to portray Bud Hamilton, the Harvard-graduate son of country superstar Haven. While preparing for his role as Haven, Gibson began taking guitar lessons in Santa Monica, and met David Peel, a guitar instructor, who bore a significant resemblance to him. After meeting with Peel, Altman cast him as Bud. =Filming= The film was shot on location in Nashville in the summer of 1974 on a budget of $2.2 million. In late June, the cast began arriving in Nashville; Carradine and Raines traveled together from Los Angeles, while Beatty arrived and hitched a camper where he resided along with his wife through the duration of the shoot. Beatty recalled an early meeting in which Altman had the cast convene prior to filming: \\"Bob gets us together in this room. We're all ready to start the movie. And he said, 'Look, I want you to have fun with this. There is only one thing we have to remember. Every character in this movie loves one character. Every one of these characters loves Barbara Jean.' Well, within a short time Ronee Blakley was the only actor in the film who was universally disliked.\\" Throughout the shoot, Altman and Blakley had several disputes regarding her character, and Blakley sometimes rewrote her scenes to Altman's dismay. Parthenon in Nashville, location of the climactic final scene Locations featured in the film include the Nashville International Airport, and the Exit/In, a Nashville club which screenwriter Tewkesbury had frequented during her trips there. The scene in which Carradine's character performs \\"I'm Easy\\" was shot at this club. Altman's log cabin-style house on the outskirts of Nashville was used as the home of Haven and Lady Pearl. The film's climactic assassination sequence, which takes places at the Parthenon, was originally intended to take place at the Ryman Auditorium. However, Altman was forced to change the locale when he was unable to secure access to the then-recently shuttered Ryman Auditorium. Walker, the climactic assassination, the political theme and various associated characters (such as Haven Hamilton) do not appear in the earliest versions of the script, and were integrated into the screenplay throughout filming. All of the musical scenes featured in the film are actual live concert footage. The hospital scenes centered on Barbara Jean were filmed in a local hospital that had been closed; one floor of it was refurbished for use in filming. Nearly all of the extras in the film were Nashville locals. Many of them were not actively participating in the film but simply happened to be at the location where the cast and crew were filming at the time. Recording session legend Lloyd Green (\\"Mr. Nashville Sound\\") can be seen playing pedal steel guitar in the opening studio scene. Jeff Newman, also known for the pedal steel, is sitting next to him playing a banjo. =Post- production= Nashville's opening title sequence was designed by the film title designer Dan Perri, who had recently enjoyed his big break with his work on The Exorcist (1973). Under Altman's direction, Perri based the film's unusual, kitschy title sequence on low-budget K-Tel Records television commercials, and bought in Johnny Grant to provide the loud, brash voiceover. Perri later went on to design titles for a number of other major Hollywood pictures, including Taxi Driver (1976), Star Wars (1977), and Raging Bull (1980). Altman had enough footage to produce a four-hour film, and assistant director Alan Rudolph suggested he create an expanded version of Nashville to be shown in two parts, \\"Nashville Red\\" and \\"Nashville Blue\\", but the film ultimately remained intact. After a rush of critical acclaim, ABC expressed interest in a proposal for a 10-hour miniseries of Nashville, based on the footage not used in the final cut, but plans for the project were scrapped. The additional footage has not been made available on DVD releases. However, in a 2000 interview with The A.V. Club, Altman disputed the claim that he had several hours worth of deleted scenes to cut another feature-length film (or two) out of. Altman claimed that there \\"were no deleted scenes\\" and that \\"almost everything we shot is in that film\\". Altman further stated the unseen, extra footage that wasn't used in the final cut of the film was mainly music and not much else. =Music= Many of the actors and actresses in the film composed the songs they performed in the film. Blakley wrote several tracks, including \\"Bluebird\\", performed by Timothy Brown, and \\"Tapedeck in His Tractor\\" and \\"My Idaho Home\\", performed by Blakley herself. Karen Black also wrote \\"Memphis\\" and \\"Rolling Stone\\", the two songs she performed in the character of Connie White. Carradine wrote and performed \\"I'm Easy,\\" which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Golden Globe for Best Original Song - Motion Picture. Additionally, Carradine wrote \\"It Don't Worry Me\\", which is heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, and is the closing number performed by Barbara Harris onstage at the Parthenon. Composer Richard Baskin composed songs for Henry Gibson to sing in character as Haven Hamilton. Several Nashville session musicians also took part in the music recording and in the film itself, including violinist Vassar Clements and guitarist Harold Bradley. While the music featured in the film was viewed in the Nashville music industry as mean-spirited satire, the songs have achieved a cult-status among alternative country musicians. In 2002, the album, A Tribute to Robert Altman's Nashville was released, featuring interpretations of the film's songs by Canadian alt-country figures, including Carolyn Mark, Kelly Hogan and Neko Case. ABC Records issued a motion picture soundtrack to the film in 1975, featuring the various original musical numbers. It was reissued by MCA Nashville in 2015.

Pauline Kael described it as \\"the funniest epic vision of America ever to reach the screen\\". Reprinting of Kael's review that originally appeared as Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert, and Leonard Maltin gave the film four-star reviews and called it the best film of 1975. In his original review, Ebert wrote \\"after I saw it I felt more alive, I felt I understood more about people, I felt somehow wiser. It's that good a movie.\\" On August 6, 2000, Ebert included it in his The Great Movies compilation. Vincent Canby of The New York Times praised the film's music as \\"funny, moving and almost nonstop\\" as well as its \\"well‚Äêdefined structure, [in which] individual sequences often burst virith (sic) the kind of life that seems impossible to plan.\\" Writing for the New York Daily News, Harry Haun praised the film's attention to detail and characterization, noting: \\"I have seen Nashville 4¬Ω times, and I'm still discovering dimensions that had eluded me.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times praised the humor, which he noted as ranging \\"from slapstick to satire,\\" and commended the film as \\"the most original and provocative American movie in a very long time.\\" According to film critic Ruth McCormick, however, after an initial wave of praise, a critical backlash ensued. \\"Robert Mazzocco in The New York Review of Books, Greil Marcus in The Village Voice and John Malone in The New York Times wrote articles that ranged from debunking the hype and calling Nashville superficial and overrated, to absolutely hating the film for its aesthetic shortcomings or its purported pessimism, cynicism and sexism.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 8.67/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Robert Altman captures the bravado and cynicism of the American dream in Nashville, a sprawling epic bursting with vivid performances and an unforgettable soundtrack.\\" =Controversy= The film was widely despised by the mainstream country-music community at the time of its release; many artists believed it ridiculed their talent and sincerity. Altman felt they were mad because he chose not to use their music in favor of letting the actors compose their own material. However, he stated the movie has since become popular in the city among more recent generations. The film garnered further attention in 1980 due to its climactic shooting scene of Barbara Jean, as it predated, but eerily mirrored, what would be the murder of John Lennon. In an interview on 2000 DVD release, Altman remarks that after Lennon's death, reporters questioned the director about Nashville and its harbinger of the assassination of a music star. :Robert Altman: \\"When John Lennon got assassinated, I get a call immediately from the Washington Post and they said, 'Do you feel responsible for this?' and I said 'What do you mean, responsible?' 'Well, I mean you're the one that predicted there would be a political assassination of a star.' 'And I said 'Well, I don't feel responsible,' but I said, 'but don't you feel responsible for not heeding my warning?' The statement here is, these people are not assassinated because of their ideas or what they do. They're assassinated to draw attention to the assassin. And in political assassinations, in their sort of warped minds, they know that they are going to have a certain amount of people who said 'that son of a bitch [the politician] should have been shot,' because there's such heat about it. But actually what they are doing is killing somebody who's in the public eye and is some sort of an icon. Because this feeling that by doing that, committing that assassination they draw the attention to themself, and they make themselves consequently important. Ah, and it's no surprise to me, the Lennon assassination, because this is what all that is, and I don't think we have seen the end of it either.\\" =Home media= Paramount Home Video released Nashville on VHS and DVD in 2000. In 2016, The Criterion Collection released a Blu-ray edition of the film featuring a new scan and supplemental features, including an archival commentary with Altman as well as archival interviews, and a new documentary piece. Accolades Nashville received numerous awards and nominations from various critical organizations, including a total of 11 Golden Globe nominations, which, as of 2019, are the most ever received by one film. It also received four nominations in a single acting category; this was and remains unprecedented for major film award shows. It won a BAFTA Film Award for Best Sound Track. Altman won for best director from: Cartagena Film Festival; Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards; National Board of Review; National Society of Film Critics Awards; and the New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Lily Tomlin was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress. Legacy Plans were discussed for a sequel set 12 years later and titled Nashville 12, and most of the original players agreed to appear. In the script for the sequel, Lily Tomlin's character, Linnea, is running for political office; and Barnett now managing Connie White and obsessed with a Barbara Jean impersonator. Contemporarily, Nashville is regarded in critical circles as Altman's magnum opus, as well as one of the greatest films of all time. In 1992, Nashville was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". In 2007, the movie was ranked No. 59 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies - 10th Anniversary Edition list; it did not appear on the original 1998 list. The song \\"I'm Easy\\" was named the 81st Best Song of All Time by the American Film Institute (AFI). In 2013, Entertainment Weekly ranked it the ninth-greatest film in history.

First attested as a Gothic name in the 5th century, it became widespread in the Germanic-speaking world, not least due to its most famous bearer, Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths. Overview The name was Latinized as Theodoricus or Theodericus, originally from a Common Germanic form *√æeudo-rƒ´ks (\\"people-ruler\\"), which would have resulted in a Gothic √æiuda-reiks.The Proto-Germanic and Gothic forms are reconstructions. The -riks element was ultimately a borrowing from Celtic, see Reich#Etymology. Anglicized spellings of the name during Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages include Theodoric, Theoderic, Theudoric, Theuderic. Gregory of Tours Latinized the name as Theodorus, in origin the unrelated Greek name Theodore (ŒòŒµœåŒ¥œâœÅŒøœÇ, meaning \\"god-gift\\"). As the name survived throughout the Middle Ages, it transformed into a multitude of forms in the languages of Western Europe. These include the High German form Dietrich, abbreviated Dieter, the Low German and Dutch form Diederik, or Dierik, abbreviated Dirck, Dirk, Dik or Diede, the Norwegian Tjodrik, Diderik and Didrik. Of the Romance languages, French has Thierry and Italian, Portuguese and Spanish has Teodorico. The English forms Derek, Derrick and Terry have been re-introduced from the continent, from Low German, Dutch and French sources. The Welsh form Tudur (from Proto-Celtic *Toutorƒ´xs, cognate with Proto-Germanic *√ûeudarƒ´ks) is the origin of the name of the English Tudor dynasty. Late Antiquity to Early Middle Ages The earliest record of the name is in a Roman-era (3rd century) inscription, discovered in 1784 in Wiesbaden (at the time known as Aquae Mattiacorum in Germania Superior), edited in Codex inscriptionum romanarum Danubii et Rheni as no. 684: , interpreted as In honorem domus divinae, Apolloni toutiorigi. This has given rise to a supposed \\"Apollo Teutorix\\" in 19th-century literature. Rhys (1892) opined that \\"the interest attached to the word Toutiorix is out of all proportion to its single occurrence\\". John Rhys, Lectures on the origin and growth of religion as illustrated by Celtic heathendom (1892), p. 30. The existence of a genuinely Celtic name Teutorix or Tout(i)orix is uncertain, though Welsh Tudur, Old Welsh Tutir presupposes a precise cognate of Toutorix at least in ancient British Celtic. (See p. 11, n. 34 in the online version.) Rhys surmises that the \\"historical Teuton\\" (viz. Theoderic the Great) bore a name of the Gaulish Apollo as adopted into early Germanic religion. The first known bearer of the name was Theodoric I, son of Alaric I, king of the Visigoths (d. 451). The Gothic form of the name would have been √ûiudareiks, which was Latinized as Theodericus. The notability of the name is due to Theoderic the Great, son of Theodemir, king of the Ostrogoths (454-526), who became a legendary figure of the Germanic Heroic Age as Dietrich von Bern. After the end of Late Antiquity, during the 6th to 8th century there were also several kings of the Franks called Theodoric (or Theuderic). Finally, there was an early Anglo-Saxon king of Bernicia called Theodric (also spelled Deoric, Old English '). *Theodoric I (died 451), king of the Visigoths *Theodoric II (died 466), king of the Visigoths *Theoderic the Great (454‚Äì526), ruler of the Ostrogoths, Italy, and the Visigoths *Theodoric Strabo (died 481) *Theuderic I (died ca. 534), Frankish king *Theuderic II (587‚Äì613), Frankish king *Theuderic III (died 691), king of the Franks *Theuderic IV (died 737), king of the Franks *Theodric of Bernicia, 6th century Anglo-Saxon king *Saint Tewdrig (alternatively Tewdric or Theodoric) (c. 580 ‚Äì c. 630), Welsh king of Gwent and Glywysing, who was martyred fighting the Saxons *Theodoric, Bishop of Minden (died 880) *Theodoric I, Bishop of Paderborn (died 916) High and Late Middle Ages While the Anglo-Saxon name Theodric (Deoric, old form: th = d) became extinct in the Middle English period, it was adopted in Welsh as Tewdrig. The name remains popular in medieval German as Dietrich, and is adopted into French as Thierry. It is rendered in Medieval Latin as Theodoricus or as Theodericus. The Middle High German legend of Dietrich von Bern is based on the historical Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths. The German Dietrich von Bern is reflected as √ûi√∞rekr af Bern in the Old Norse Thidrekssaga. The medieval German legend gives rise to the Dietrich of the Renaissance era Heldenb√ºcher. The Old Norse form of the name was √ûj√≥√∞r√≠kr (spelled √æiaurik Ä on the 9th-century R√∂k runestone). This became Tjodrik in Middle Norwegian. The Dutch form Derek was used in England from the 15th century. Similarly, the Scandinavian Tjodrik is attested for the 12th century, but it is replaced by the Low German forms Ditrik, Dirk in the late medieval period. The spread of the Dutch or Low German form to Middle Norwegian, Middle Danish and late Middle English or Early Modern English are part of a larger linguistic trend due to the influence of the Hanseatic League during this period. *Antipope Theodoric (died 1102) *Thierry of Chartres (12th century), philosopher *Theodoric the Monk (12th century), Norwegian Benedictine *Theoderic (fl. c. 1172), author of the Libellus de locis sanctis *Theoderich (Bishop of Estonia), 13th century bishop *Theodoric of Prague (14th century), court painter to Charles IV *Theodoric of Freiberg (14th century), theologian and scientist Counts of Holland Dirk I, Dirk II, Dirk III, Dirk IV, Dirk V, Dirk VI, and Dirk VII Modern era The German form Dietrich was abbreviated to Dieter. The Low German and Dutch languages abbreviated Diederik as Dirk or Diede. French retains Thierry.

It stars John Belushi, Peter Riegert, Tim Matheson, John Vernon, Verna Bloom, Thomas Hulce, Stephen Furst, and Donald Sutherland. The film is about a trouble-making fraternity whose members challenge the authority of the dean of the fictional Faber College. The film was produced by Matty Simmons of National Lampoon and Ivan Reitman for Universal Pictures. It was inspired by stories written by Miller and published in National Lampoon. The stories were based on Ramis's experience in the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis, Miller's Alpha Delta Phi experiences at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, and producer Reitman's at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. Of the younger lead actors, only the 28-year-old Belushi was an established star, but even he had not yet appeared in a film, having gained fame mainly from his television appearances on Saturday Night Live, which was starting its third season in autumn 1977. Several of the actors who were cast as college students, including Hulce, Karen Allen, and Kevin Bacon, were just beginning their film careers, although Matheson had appeared as one of the vigilante cops in the second Dirty Harry film, Magnum Force, and had voiced the title character in Jonny Quest. Upon its initial release, Animal House received generally mixed reviews from critics, but Time and Roger Ebert proclaimed it one of the year's best. Filmed for only $3 million, it garnered an estimated gross of more than $141 million in the form of theatrical rentals and home video, not including merchandising, making it the highest grossing comedy film of its time. The film, along with 1977's The Kentucky Fried Movie, also directed by Landis, was largely responsible for defining and launching the gross out film genre, which became one of Hollywood's staples. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed Animal House \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was No. 1 on Bravo's \\"100 Funniest Movies\\". It was No. 36 on AFI's \\"100 Years... 100 Laughs\\" list of the 100 best American comedies. In 2008, Empire magazine selected it as No. 279 of \\"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\\". Plot In 1962, Faber College freshmen Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Kroger and Kent Dorfman seek to join a fraternity. Finding themselves out of place at the prestigious Omega Theta Pi house's party, they visit the slovenly Delta Tau Chi house next door, where Kent is a \\"legacy\\": he cannot be rejected, because his older brother Fred was a member. John \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky welcomes them, and they meet other Deltas, including motorcyclist Daniel Simpson \\"D-Day\\" Day, chapter president Robert Hoover, ladies' man Eric \\"Otter\\" Stratton, and Otter's best friend Donald \\"Boon\\" Schoenstein, whose girlfriend Katy is constantly pressuring him to stop drinking with the Deltas and do something with his life. Larry and Kent are invited to pledge and given the fraternity names \\"Pinto\\" and \\"Flounder\\" respectively, by Bluto, Delta's sergeant-at-arms. College Dean Vernon Wormer wants to remove the Deltas, who are already on probation, due to various campus conduct violations and an abysmal academic standing, so he invokes his emergency authority and places the fraternity on \\"double-secret probation.\\" He directs the clean-cut, smug Omega president Greg Marmalard to find a way for him to remove the Deltas from campus. Various incidents further increase the dean's and the Omegas' animosity toward the Deltas, including the prank-related accidental death of a horse belonging to Omega member and Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadet commander Douglas C. Neidermeyer and Otter flirting with Marmalard's girlfriend Mandy. Bluto and D-Day steal the answers to an upcoming test from the trash, not realizing that the Omegas have switched papers for the exam. The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife Marion attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him. Pinto hooks up with Clorette, a cashier he meets at the supermarket. They make out, but they do not have sex because she passes out drunk. Pinto takes her home in a shopping cart and learns that she is the mayor's daughter. Outraged by his wife's escapades and the mayor's threat of personal violence, Wormer organizes a hearing and revokes Delta's charter. To take their minds off their troubles, Otter, Boon, Flounder, and Pinto go on a road trip. Otter picks up four young women from Emily Dickinson College as dates for himself and his Delta brothers by posing as Frank Lymon, the fianc√© of a college student who died in a recent kiln explosion. They stop at a roadhouse bar where Otis Day's band is performing, not realizing it has an exclusively African-American clientele. A couple of hulking patrons intimidate the Deltas and they quickly leave, smashing up Flounder's brother's car in their haste and leaving their dates behind. Marmalard and other Omegas lure Otter to a motel and beat him up after Mandy's best friend Babs tells him that Mandy and Otter are having an affair. The Deltas' midterm grades are so poor that an ecstatic Wormer expels them all, having already notified their local draft boards that they are now eligible for military service. The news shocks Flounder so badly that he vomits on Wormer. The Deltas are despondent, but Bluto rallies them with an impassioned speech. They decide to get revenge on Wormer, the Omegas, and the college. D-Day converts Flounder's brother Fred's damaged car into an armored vehicle. They hide it inside a cake-shaped breakaway float and sneak into the annual homecoming parade. As they wreak havoc on the event, the futures of several of the student main characters are revealed using freeze-frame labels. Most of the Deltas become respectable professionals (with Bluto marrying Mandy and becoming a senator), while the Omegas and the other adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes (Neidermeyer, for example, is reported killed by his own troops in Vietnam).

The periodical specialized in satirizing politics and popular culture. Many of the magazine's writers were recent college graduates, hence its appeal to students all over the country. Doug Kenney was a Lampoon writer and the magazine's first editor-in-chief. He graduated from Harvard University in 1969 and had a college experience closer to the Omegas in the film (he had been president of the university's elite Spee Club). Kenney was responsible for the first appearances of three characters that would appear in the film, Larry Kroger, Mandy Pepperidge, and Vernon Wormer. They made their debut in 1973's National Lampoon's High School Yearbook, a satire of a Middle America 1964 high school yearbook. Kroger's and Pepperidge's characters in the yearbook were effectively the same as their characters in the movie, whereas Vernon Wormer was a P. E. and civics teacher as well as an athletic coach in the yearbook. However, Kenney felt that fellow Lampoon writer Chris Miller was the magazine's expert on the college experience. Faced with an impending deadline, Miller submitted a chapter from his then-abandoned memoirs entitled \\"The Night of the Seven Fires\\" about pledging experiences from his fraternity days in Alpha Delta (associated with the national Alpha Delta Phi during Miller's undergraduate years, the fraternity subsequently disassociated itself from the national organization and is now called Alpha Delta) at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire. The antics of his fellow fraternities, coupled with experiences like that of a road trip to University of Wisconsin- Madison and its Delta Chi Fraternity, became the inspiration for the Delta Tau Chis of Animal House and many characters in the film (and their nicknames) were based on Miller's fraternity brothers. Filmmaker Ivan Reitman had just finished producing David Cronenberg's first film, Shivers, and called the magazine's publisher Matty Simmons about making movies under the Lampoon banner. Reitman had put together The National Lampoon Show in New York City featuring several future Saturday Night Live cast members, including John Belushi. When most of the Lampoon group moved on to SNL except for Harold Ramis, Reitman approached him with an idea to make a film together using some skits from the Lampoon Show. =Screenplay= Kenney met Lampoon writer Ramis at the suggestion of Simmons. Ramis drew from his own fraternity experiences as a member of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis and was working on a film treatment about college called \\"Freshman Year\\", but the magazine's editors were not happy with it. The famous scene of John Belushi as D-Day riding a motorcycle up the stairs of the fraternity house was inspired by Belushi's own antics while a student at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. Kenney and Ramis started working on a new film treatment together, positing Charles Manson in a high school, calling it Laser Orgy Girls. Simmons was cool to this idea so they changed the setting to a \\"northeastern college ... Ivy League kind of school\\". Kenney was a fan of Miller's fraternity stories and suggested using them as a basis for a movie. Kenney, Miller and Ramis began brainstorming ideas. They saw the film's 1962 setting as \\"the last innocent year ... of America\\", and the homecoming parade that ends the film as occurring on November 21, 1963, the day before President Kennedy's assassination. They agreed that Belushi should star in it and Ramis wrote the part of Bluto specifically for the comedian, having been friends with him while at Chicago's The Second City. The writers were new to screenwriting, so their film treatment ran to 110 pages, where most treatments average 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, an executive at Universal Studios. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the \\"Seven Fires\\" film treatment as Tanen's assistant while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, \\"We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And we had a lot of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit ... We didn't back off anything\\". As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay (nine in total), the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, \\"They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we'll make a couple of bucks if we're lucky‚Äîlet them do whatever they want.' =Casting= Initially, Reitman had wanted to direct but had made only one film, Cannibal Girls, for $5,000. The film's producers approached Richard Lester and Bob Rafelson before considering John Landis, who got the director job based on his work on Kentucky Fried Movie. That film's script and continuity supervisor was the girlfriend of Sean Daniel, an assistant to Mount. Daniel saw Landis' movie and recommended him. Landis then met with Mount, Reitman and Simmons and got the job. Landis remembers, \\"When I was given the script, it was the funniest thing I had ever read up to that time. But it was really offensive. There was a great deal of projectile vomiting and rape and all these things\\". Landis claims his big contribution to the film was that there \\"had to be good guys and bad guys. There can‚Äôt just be bad guys, so there became a good fraternity and bad fraternity\\". There was also friction between Landis and the writers early on because Landis was a high-school dropout from Hollywood and they were college graduates from the East Coast. Ramis remembers, \\"He sort of referred immediately to Animal House as 'my movie.' We'd been living with it for two years and we hated that\\". According to Landis, he drew inspiration from classic Hollywood comedies featuring the likes of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and the Marx Brothers. The initial cast was to feature Chevy Chase as Otter, Bill Murray as Boon, Brian Doyle-Murray as Hoover, Dan Aykroyd as D-Day, and John Belushi as Bluto, but only Belushi was interested. Chase turned the film down to do Foul Play; Landis, who wanted to cast unknown dramatic actors such as Bacon and Allen (the first film for both) instead of famous comedians, takes credit for subtly discouraging Chase by describing the cast as an \\"ensemble\\". Landis has also stated that he was not interested in directing a \\"Saturday Night Live movie\\" and that unknowns would be the better choice. The character of D-Day was based on Aykroyd, who was a motorcycle aficionado. Aykroyd was offered the part, but he was already committed to Saturday Night Live. Belushi, who had worked on The National Lampoon Radio Hour before Saturday Night Live, was also busy with SNL, but spent Monday through Wednesday making the film and then flew back to New York to do the show on Thursday through Saturday. Ramis originally wrote the role of Boon for himself, but Landis felt that he looked too old for the part and Riegert was cast instead. Landis offered Ramis a smaller part, but he declined. Landis met with Jack Webb to play Dean Wormer and Kim Novak to play his wife; at the time, Webb reportedly turned down the role because of concerns over his clean-cut Dragnet image, but later said he didn't find the script funny. Ultimately, John Vernon was cast as Wormer after Landis saw him in The Outlaw Josey Wales. Belushi initially received only $35,000 for Animal House, but was paid a bonus after the film became a hit. Landis also met with Meat Loaf in case Belushi turned down the role of Bluto. Landis worked with Belushi on his character, who \\"hardly had any dialogue\\"; they decided that Bluto was a cross between Harpo Marx and the Cookie Monster. Belushi said he developed his ability to communicate without talking because his grandmother spoke little English. Belushi was considered a supporting actor and Universal wanted another star. Landis had been a crew member on Kelly's Heroes and had become friends with actor Donald Sutherland, sometimes babysitting his son Kiefer. He had also just worked with him on Kentucky Fried Movie. Landis asked Sutherland, one of the most popular film stars of the early 1970s, to be in the movie. For two days of work, Sutherland declined the initial offer of $20,000 plus \\"points\\" (a percentage of the gross or net income). Universal then offered him his day rate of $25,000 or 2% of the film's gross. Sutherland took the guaranteed fee, assuming that the film would not be very successful; although this made him the highest-paid member of the cast (Neidemeyer's horse, Junior, and John Belushi each received $40,000), the decision cost Sutherland what he estimates as around $14 million. The star's participation, however, was crucial; Landis later said \\"It was Donald Sutherland who essentially got the film made.\\" \\"Pinto\\" was screenwriter Chris Miller's nickname at his Dartmouth fraternity.Animal House: The Inside Story. August 13, 2008. DeWayne Jessie adopted the \\"Otis Day\\" name in his private life and continued touring with the band. =Locations= Plaque at the Delta House site (2007) Otis Day and the Knights sang Shama Lama Ding Dong at the Dexter Lake Club (2012 photo) The filmmakers' next problem was finding a college that would let them shoot the film on their campus. They submitted the script to a number of colleges and universities but \\"nobody wanted this movie\\" due to the script; according to Landis, \\"I couldn't find 'the look'. Every place that had 'the look' said, 'no thank you.'\\" The University of Missouri (Columbia, Missouri) initially gave their consent to shoot the movie at the college, but the president (Herbert W. Schooling) withdrew permission to film there after reading the script. The president of the University of Oregon in Eugene, William Beaty Boyd, had been a senior administrator at the University of California in Berkeley in 1966 when his campus was considered for a location of the film The Graduate. After he consulted with other senior administrative colleagues who advised him to turn it down due to the lack of artistic merit, the college campus scenes set at Berkeley were shot at USC in Los Angeles. The film went on to become a classic, and Boyd was determined not to make the same mistake twice when the producers inquired about filming at Oregon. After consulting with student government leaders and officers of the Pan Hellenic Council, the Director of University Relations advised the president that the script, although raunchy and often tasteless, was a very funny spoof of college life. Boyd even allowed the filmmakers to use his office as Dean Wormer's. The actual house depicted as the Delta House was originally a residence in Eugene, the Dr. A.W. Patterson House. Around 1959, it was acquired by the Psi Deuteron chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity and was their chapter house until 1967, when the chapter was closed due to low membership. The house was sold, remained vacant and slid into disrepair, with the spacious porch removed and the lawn graveled over. At the time of the shooting, the Phi Kappa Psi and Sigma Nu fraternity houses sat next to the old Phi Sigma Kappa house, on the 700 block of East 11th Avenue. The interior of the Phi Kappa Psi house and the Sigma Nu house were used for many of the interior scenes, but the individual rooms were filmed on a soundstage. The Patterson house remained vacant after filming ended in 1977 and was demolished in 1986, and the site () is now occupied by Northwest Christian University's school of Education and Counseling. A large boulder placed to the west of the parking entrance displays a bronze plaque commemorating the Delta House location. The concluding parade scene was filmed on Main Street in downtown Cottage Grove, about south of Eugene via Interstate 5. =Principal photography= Filming commenced in the autumn of 1977, and Landis brought the actors who played the Deltas up five days early in order to bond. Staying at the Rodeway Inn motel in adjacent Springfield, they moved an old piano from the lobby into McGill's room, which became known as \\"party central.\\" James Widdoes (\\"Hoover\\") remembers, \\"It was like freshman orientation. There was a lot of getting to know each other and calling each other by our character names.\\" This tactic encouraged the actors playing the Deltas to separate themselves from the actors playing the Omegas, helping generate authentic animosity between them on camera. Belushi and his wife Judy rented a house in south Eugene in order to keep him away from alcohol and drugs; she remained in Oregon while he commuted to New York City for Saturday Night Live. Although the cast members were warned against mixing with the college students, one night, some girls invited several of the cast members to a fraternity party; assuming the invitation had been made with the knowledge of the fraternity, the actors arrived and were greeted with open hostility. It was obvious the group was not welcome, and as they were leaving, Widdoes threw a cup of beer at a group of drunk football players and a fight \\"like a scene from the movie\\" broke out. Tim Matheson, Bruce McGill, Peter Riegert, and Widdoes narrowly escaped, with McGill suffering a black eye and Widdoes getting several teeth knocked out. Other than Belushi's opening yell, the food fight was filmed in one shot, with the actors encouraged to fight for real. Flounder's groceries handling in the supermarket was another single shot; Furst deftly caught the many items Landis and Matheson threw at him, amazing the director. By filming the long courtroom scene in one day Landis won a bet with Reitman. The film's budget was so small that during the 32 days of shooting in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He fell to the ground and pretended to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move. Dexter Lake Club in 2011 Black extras had to be bused in from Portland for the segment at the Dexter Lake Club () due to their scarcity around Eugene. More seriously, the segment alarmed Tanen and other studio executives, who perceived it as racist and warned that \\"'black people in America are going to rip the seats out of theaters if you leave that scene in the movie.'\\" Richard Pryor's approval helped retain the segment in the film. The studio became more enthusiastic about the film when Reitman showed executives and sales managers of various regions in the country a 10-minute production reel that was put together in two days. The reaction was positive and the studio sent 20 copies out to exhibitors. The first preview screening for Animal House was held in Denver four months before it opened nationwide. The crowd loved it and the filmmakers realized they had a potential hit on their hands. The original cut of the movie was a lengthy 175 minutes and more than an hour was dropped; the deleted scenes included: * a John Landis cameo as a cafeteria dishwasher who tries to stop Bluto from eating all the food. Landis is dragged across a table and thrown to the floor by Bluto who then says \\"You don't fuck with the eagles unless you know how to fly.\\" * a scene where Boon and Hoover tell Pinto the tales of legendary Delta House frat brothers from years before who had names like Tarantula, Bulldozer, Giraffe, and his girlfriend, Gross Kay. * two different deleted scenes with Otter and a couple of his girlfriends (one played by Sunny Johnson‚Äîlisted in the credits as \\"Otter's Co-Ed\\" although her scene was deleted‚Äîand the other played by location scout Katherine Wilson, whose deleted scene can be seen in the theatrical trailer). * an extended version of the scene where Bluto pours mustard on himself and starts singing \\"I am the Mustard Man.\\" Soundtrack and score The soundtrack is a mix of rock and roll and rhythm and blues with the original score created by film composer Elmer Bernstein, who had been a Landis family friend since John Landis was a child. Bernstein was easily persuaded to score the film, but was not sure what to make of it. Similar to his preferring dramatic actors for the comedy, Landis asked Bernstein to score it as though it were serious. He adapted the \\"Faber College Theme\\" from the Academic Festival Overture by Brahms, and said that the film opened yet another door in his diverse career, to scoring comedies. The soundtrack was released as a vinyl album in 1978, and then as a CD in 1998. In the late 2000s, the very first song on the soundtrack, the \\"Faber College Theme\\", came to prominence due to its purported resemblance to the Bosnian national anthem. ;Soundtrack album listing ;Additional music in the film * \\"Theme from A Summer Place\\", composed by Max Steiner; performed by Percy Faith and his Orchestra * \\"Who's Sorry Now?\\", written by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby; performed by Connie Francis * \\"The Washington Post March\\", composed by John Philip Sousa * \\"Tammy\\", by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans Reception =Critical reception= At the time of its release, Animal House received mixed reviews from critics but several immediately recognized its appeal, and it has since been recognized as one of the best films of 1978. The film holds a 90% positive rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 51 critics. Its consensus states \\"The talents of director John Landis and Saturday Night Live's irrepressible John Belushi conspired to create a rambunctious, subversive college comedy that continues to resonate.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on 13 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and wrote, \\"It's anarchic, messy, and filled with energy. It assaults us. Part of the movie's impact comes from its sheer level of manic energy. ... But the movie's better made (and better acted) than we might at first realize. It takes skill to create this sort of comic pitch, and the movie's filled with characters that are sketched a little more absorbingly than they had to be, and acted with perception\\". Ebert later placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978, the only National Lampoon film to have received this honor. In his review for Time, Frank Rich wrote, \\"At its best it perfectly expresses the fears and loathings of kids who came of age in the late '60s; at its worst Animal House revels in abject silliness. The hilarious highs easily compensate for the puerile lows\\". Gary Arnold wrote in his review for The Washington Post, \\"Belushi also controls a wicked array of conspiratorial expressions with the audience. ... He can seem irresistibly funny in repose or invest minor slapstick opportunities with a streak of genius\\". David Ansen wrote in Newsweek, \\"But if Animal House lacks the inspired tastelessness of the Lampoon's High School Yearbook Parody, this is still low humor of a high order\\". Robert Martin wrote in The Globe and Mail, \\"It is so gross and tasteless you feel you should be disgusted but it's hard to be offended by something that is so sidesplittingly funny\\". Time magazine proclaimed Animal House one of the year's best. When the film was released, Landis, Widdoes and Allen went on a national promotional tour. Universal Pictures spent about $4.5 million promoting the film at selected college campuses and helped students organize their own toga parties. One such party at the University of Maryland attracted some 2,000 people, while students at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison tried for a crowd of 10,000 people and a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. Thanks to the film, toga parties became one of the favorite college campus happenings during 1978 and 1979. In 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list, where it was ranked #36. Then in 2005, AFI ranked John \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky's quote \\"Toga! Toga!\\" at #82 on its list of 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes, with the quotes \\"Over? Did you say \\"over?\\" Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell, no!\\" and \\"Fat, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through life, son\\" being nominated. The New York Times placed the film on its Best 1000 Movies Ever list.The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made. The New York Times via Internet Archive. Published April 29, 2003. Retrieved June 12, 2008. In 2001, the Library of Congress deemed the film to be \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" and selected it as one of 25 films preserved in the National Film Registry that year. =Box office= In its opening weekend, Animal House grossed $276,538 in 12 theaters in New York before expanding to 500 theaters. It grossed $120.1 million in North America and went on to achieve a domestic lifetime gross of $141.6 million. It was the highest grossing comedy of all time until the release of Ghostbusters (which was also written by Ramis and produced by Reitman) and the seventh highest-grossing film of the 1970s. Adjusted for inflation, it is the 68th highest-grossing film in North America. Spin-offs The film inspired a short-lived half-hour ABC television sitcom, Delta House, in which Vernon reprised his role as the long-suffering, malevolent Dean Wormer. The series also included Furst as Flounder, McGill as D-Day, and Widdoes as Hoover. The pilot episode was written by the film's screenwriters, Kenney, Miller, and Ramis. Michelle Pfeiffer made her acting debut in the series (playing a new character, \\"Bombshell\\"), and Peter Fox was cast as Otter. Belushi's character from the film, John \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky, is in the Army, but his brother, Blotto, played by Josh Mostel, transfers to Faber to carry on Bluto's tradition. Jim Belushi was asked to play the role of Blotto, but declined. Animal House inspired Co- Ed Fever, another sitcom but without the involvement of the film's producers or cast. Set in a dorm of the formerly all-female Baxter College, the pilot of Co-Ed Fever was aired by CBS on February 4, 1979, but the network canceled the series before airing any more episodes. NBC also had its Animal House-inspired sitcom, Brothers and Sisters, in which three members of Crandall College's Pi Nu fraternity interact with members of the Gamma Iota sorority. Like ABC's Delta House, Brothers and Sisters lasted only three months. The film's writers planned a film sequel set in 1967 (the so-called \\"Summer of Love\\"), in which the Deltas have a reunion for Pinto's marriage in Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco. The only Delta to have become a hippie is Flounder, who is now called Pisces. Later, Chris Miller and John Weidman, another Lampoon writer, created a treatment for this screenplay, but Universal rejected it because the sequel to American Graffiti, which contained some hippie-1967 sequences, had not done well. When John Belushi died, the idea was indefinitely shelved. A second attempt at a sequel was made in 1982 with producer Matty Simmons co- authoring a script which saw some of the Deltas returning to Faber College five years after the events of the film. The project got no further than a first draft script dated May 6, 1982. Where Are They Now? The 2003 \\"Double Secret Probation Edition\\" DVD included a short film, Where Are They Now?: A Delta Alumni Update, a mockumentary purporting that the original film had been a documentary and Landis was catching up with some of the cast (played by their original actors). It was never shown theatrically. It shows the main Animal House characters 30 years on, following Landis to cities all over America in search of the former Deltas, Omegas, and Dean Wormer, and describes the various locales and professions the characters have settled into: * Donald Schoenstein ‚Äì Film editor, New York City. Currently in his third marriage to Katy. He has a son named Otis. Otis's face is badly marked up, reminding viewers of Donald's \\"pepperoni pizza\\" face alluded to in the original film. * Babs Jansen ‚Äì Tour guide, Universal Studios Hollywood. She mentions to Landis that she is organizing an upcoming Faber reunion, and seems to be successful at her job. * Marion Wormer ‚Äì Seemingly unemployed in Chicago. She tells Landis of how her husband Vernon accepted the blame for the parade debacle, and was subsequently fired, leading to their divorce. She becomes progressively more tipsy throughout the interview, eventually falling off her chair. * Kent Dorfman ‚Äì Executive director, Encounter Groups of Cleveland, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio. He recalls trying to diet during the 1970s with a special program requiring him to shoot up the urine of pregnant women. * Robert Hoover ‚Äì Assistant district attorney, Baltimore, Maryland. Hoover tells the tale of how he quit being a public defender after he realized many of his clients were insane. He also boasts of how his legal advice was sought during the O.J. Simpson murder case. * Chip Diller ‚Äì Landis receives a letter from Diller, who is currently serving as a missionary in Africa. He recalls how he was prevented from going to Vietnam as his father was a prime donor to several right-wing political campaigns. When he learned of Doug Neidermeyer's fragging in Vietnam, he fell into alcoholism and despair. When he began seeing Jesus in his food, he became a born-again Christian and fell into his current profession as minister and missionary. * Dean Vernon Wormer ‚Äì Wormer is seen at a nursing home in Florida, under the watchful eye of a male nurse. He appears to be senile, not recognizing Landis at first (calling him \\"Larry\\"), and not remembering his tenure as Dean of Faber. When Landis mentions the Deltas, Wormer erupts into a violent, profanity-laced tirade against the boys who cost him his job. He lashes out against the nurse and then physically attacks Landis, knocking out the camera in the process. * Eric Stratton ‚Äì Gynecologist, Beverly Hills, California. Otter is depicted as still being the affable, suave gentleman he was in his college days. He remarks that gynecology has been very enjoyable for him and that he has straightened up a bit since leaving Faber. An attractive, blonde patient in her underwear then tells Otter she's ready for her examination. Otter politely cuts the interview off and goes into the exam room. * Daniel Simpson Day ‚Äì Landis remarks in a voiceover that D-Day has been the hardest to track down for the documentary, saying that rumors have flown around, with his whereabouts ranging from a Buddhist monastery in Nepal to the Yukon Territory. Landis eventually approaches a house in Modesto, California, where a man opens the door by a crack and claims, in a Hispanic accent, \\"I don't know no D-Day person! I don't know him!\\" He slams the door in Landis' face and then bursts out of the garage in a car. He pulls out onto the street to the strains of the William Tell Overture, gives a manic laugh exactly like D-Day's, and speeds off. * John Blutarsky ‚Äì In a final voice-over a shot of the White House, Landis remarks that the viewers all know what happened to Bluto and Mandy Pepperidge: they became the President of the United States and First Lady of the United States.  Home media  Since its initial release, the film has garnered an estimated $141 million in domestic total gross sales, not including merchandising. Animal House was released on videodisc in 1979. It was released on VHS in 1980, 1983, 1988, and 1990. In 1992, it was released in a 2-pack VHS set that included The Blues Brothers. It was first released on DVD in February 1998 in a \\"bare bones\\" full screen presentation. A 20th anniversary widescreen Collector's Edition DVD and a coinciding THX special edition VHS and a widescreen Signature Collection Laserdisc was released later that year, with a 45-minute documentary titled \\"The Yearbook ‚Äî An Animal House Reunion\\" by producer J.M. Kenny, with production notes, theatrical trailer, and new interviews with director Landis, writers Harold Ramis and Chris Miller, composer Elmer Bernstein, and stars Tim Matheson, Karen Allen, Stephen Furst, John Vernon, Verna Bloom, Bruce McGill, James Widdoes, Peter Riegert, Mark Metcalf and Kevin Bacon. In 2000, the collector's edition DVD was packaged along with The Blues Brothers and 1941 in a John Belushi 3-pack box set. The \\"Double Secret Probation Edition\\" DVD released in 2003 features cast members reprising their respective roles in a \\"Where Are They Now?\\" mockumentary, which posited the original film as a documentary. One major change shown in this mockumentary from the epilogue of the original film is that Bluto went on from his career in the U.S. Senate to become the President of the United States, with a voiceover on a shot of the north portico of the White House, since by then Belushi had died. This DVD also includes \\"Did You Know That? Universal Animated Anecdotes\\", a subtitle trivia track, the making of documentary from the Collector's Edition, MxPx \\"Shout\\" music video, a theatrical trailer, production notes, and cast and filmmakers biographies. In August 2006, the film was released on an HD DVD/DVD combo disc, which featured the film in a 1080p high-definition format on one side, and a standard- definition format on the opposite side. Along with the film Unleashed, Animal House was one of Universal's first two HD/DVD combo releases, but was later discontinued in 2008 after Universal decided to switch to the Blu-ray optical disc format following the conclusion of the high-definition optical disc format war. It became available on Blu-ray optical disc in July 26, 2011. Precursors and legacy Animal House was a great box office success despite its limited production costs and started an industry trend, inspiring other comedies such as Porky's, the Police Academy films, the American Pie films, Up the Academy (made by their rival magazine company: MAD), and Old School among others. One writer suggested, half-seriously, that the film's impact was such that future college students seeking to emulate Delta House's antics in real life lead to \\"a drop of American college students‚Äô GPA's an average of .18 grade points, per semester.\\" Belushi became the most successful male comedy star in the world until his 1982 death; Bacon also became a star, and he, Matheson, and Allen are among those who have had lengthy acting careers. Reitman, Landis, and Ramis became successful filmmakers; Landis' use of dramatic actors and soundtrack to make the comedy believable became the traditional approach for film comedies. On the left-wing and counterculture side, the film included references to topical political matters like President Harry S. Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Richard Nixon, the Vietnam war, and the civil rights movement. Precursors of this counterculture subversive humor in film were two non-\\"college movies\\", M*A*S*H, a 1970 satirical dark comedy, and The Kentucky Fried Movie, a 1977 formless comedy consisting of a series of sketches (which was also directed by Landis). At the start of Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), also directed by John Landis, a scene set in Vietnam includes the character Bill Connor saying \\"I told you guys, we shouldn't have shot Lieutenant Neidermeyer.\\" In 2001, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Animal House is first on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies. In 2000, the American Film Institute ranked the film No. 36 on 100 Years... 100 Laughs, a list of the 100 best American comedies. In 2006, Miller wrote a more comprehensive memoir of his experiences in Dartmouth's AD house in a book entitled, The Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movie, in which Miller recounts hijinks that were considered too risqu√© for the movie. In 2008, Empire magazine selected Animal House as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. The film was also selected by The New York Times as one of The 1000 Best Movies Ever Made. In 2012, Universal Pictures Stage Productions announced it was developing a stage musical version of the movie. Barenaked Ladies were originally announced to write the score, but they were replaced by composer David Yazbek. Casey Nicholaw will direct; author Michael Mitnick is also reportedly involved.

It was the first of five films the Marx Brothers made under contract for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after their departure from Paramount Pictures, and the first after Zeppo left the act. The film was written by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind from a story by James Kevin McGuinness, with additional uncredited dialogue by Al Boasberg. The film was directed by Sam Wood. One of MGM's biggest hits at the 1935 box office, A Night at the Opera was selected in 1993 for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".List of National Film Registry (1988-2003). It is also included in the 2007 update of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, at number 85; and previously in AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs 2000 showing, at number 12. Plot In Milan, Otis B. Driftwood (Groucho), business manager for wealthy dowager Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont) has stood her up and is having dinner with another woman in the very same restaurant. When she discovers him seated directly behind her, Driftwood joins Mrs. Claypool, and introduces her to Herman Gottlieb (Sig Ruman), director of the New York Opera Company, also dining at the restaurant. Driftwood has arranged for Mrs. Claypool to invest $200,000 in the opera company, allowing Gottlieb to engage Rodolfo Lassparri (Walter Woolf King), the \\"greatest tenor since Caruso\\". Backstage at the opera house, chorister Ricardo Baroni (Allan Jones) hires his best friend Fiorello (Chico) to be his manager. Ricardo is in love with the soprano, Rosa Castaldi (Kitty Carlisle), who is also being courted by Lassparri. Driftwood arrives and finds Lassparri attacking Tomasso, his dresser (Harpo), who knocks Lassparri unconscious by hitting him over the head with a mallet. Fiorello appears and identifies himself as the manager of the \\"greatest tenor in the world\\". Driftwood, mistakenly thinking Fiorello is referring to Lassparri, signs Ricardo to a contract. Driftwood, Mrs. Claypool, Rosa, Lassparri and Gottlieb all set sail from Italy to New York aboard an ocean liner. After bidding farewell to Rosa at the pier, Ricardo, Fiorello, and Tomasso stow away inside Driftwood's steamer trunk. After being discovered, Driftwood tries to get the three of them to leave, as he is expecting a rendezvous with Mrs. Claypool. Fiorello refuses to go until they've eaten, and eventually Driftwood's very small stateroom is crowded with an assortment of people. (See Stateroom scene below.) Later, Lassparri spots the three stowaways among the immigrants on the ship, and they are caught and thrown into the brig. They escape with help from Driftwood and are able to sneak into the country by assuming the identities of three famous bearded aviators,The nationality of the aviators is never identified. In The Annotated Marx Brothers: A Filmgoer's Guide to In-Jokes, Obscure References and Sly Details (2015, McFarland, ), Matthew Coniam points out that the omission seems to have been intentional, in order to avoid an obvious lampoon of the Italian fascist aviator Italo Balbo, and that in the newspaper caption that follows they are identified as the \\"Santopoulos Brothers\\", suggesting that they may be Greek. (pp. 124-125) who are traveling aboard the ship. During a hero's welcome in New York, the stowaways' true identities are discovered and they hide out in Driftwood's hotel room, pursued by police sergeant Henderson (Robert Emmett O'Connor). Meanwhile, Ricardo is reunited with Rosa after climbing in the window of her hotel room. Ricardo has an altercation with Lassparri, which results in both Rosa and Driftwood being fired from the opera company by Gottlieb. The boys decide to seek revenge by sabotaging the opening night performance of Il trovatore climaxing with the abduction of Lassparri, which forces Gottlieb into substituting Ricardo and Rosa in his place. The audience clearly prefers Ricardo over Lassparri, and the latter is booed and hit with an apple after he is untied and attempts to return to the stage. The film ends with Driftwood and Fiorello attempting to negotiate another contract, as Rosa and Ricardo sing an encore. Selected scenes The stateroom scene, from the trailer to the film =Stateroom scene= This scene was written primarily by legendary gag man Al Boasberg. Famously eccentric, Boasberg typed up the finished scene, then shredded the pages into thin pieces and tacked them to his ceiling. It took Irving Thalberg and the brothers hours to cut and paste the scene back together. Driftwood plans a rendezvous with Mrs. Claypool in his stateroom. Then he finds out how small it is (a third class cabin, about the size of a janitor's closet), and that he, his steamer trunk, and the bed barely fit in it. Driftwood discovers that Fiorello, Tomasso, and Ricardo have stowed away in his steamer trunk and discarded his clothes. Fiorello insists on eating (\\"We getta food or we don't go\\"). Driftwood calls a steward (\\"I say, Stew\\") and orders dinner. This continues until Fiorello and Tomasso each have ordered about a dozen hard-boiled eggs and Driftwood has ordered about everything else including coffee to sober up some stewed prunes. This is just a set-up for the famous \\"Stateroom Scene\\", in which a total of 15 people crowd into Driftwood's tiny cabin. The three stowaways have to hide out in the room while a parade of people walk in, asking to either use the cabin, or to perform their regular duties. Crammed into this little space at the end of the scene are Driftwood, Fiorello, Tomasso, Ricardo, two cleaning ladies who make up the bed, a manicurist (Manicurist: Do you want your nails long or short? Driftwood: You better make them short, it's getting crowded in here.\\"), a ship's engineer and his fat assistant, a young woman passenger using the phone to call her Aunt Minnie, a maid (Maid: \\"I come to mop up.\\" Driftwood: \\"You'll have to start on the ceiling.\\") and four waiters with trays of hard-boiled eggs. (Driftwood: Tell Aunt Minnie to send up a bigger room\\".) All of the foregoing tumble out into the hallway when Mrs. Claypool opens the door. =Contract scene= The contract scene between Driftwood and Fiorello (\\"the party of the first part ...\\"): Cast The trailer for the film's re-release * Groucho Marx as Otis B. Driftwood * Harpo Marx as Tomasso * Chico Marx as Fiorello * Kitty Carlisle as Rosa Castaldi * Allan Jones as Ricardo Baroni * Margaret Dumont as Mrs. Claypool * Sig Ruman as Herman Gottlieb * Walter Woolf King as Rodolfo Lassparri * Robert Emmett O'Connor as Sergeant Henderson * Edward Keane as the Captain * Purnell Pratt as the Mayor * Harry Allen as doorman (uncredited) * Billy Gilbert as musician who asks Chico not to play the piano (uncredited) Production In an interview with Richard J. Anobile in The Marx Brothers Scrapbook, Groucho said he was so appalled by an early draft of the script‚Äîwhich was apparently written by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby‚Äîthat he shouted, \\"Why fuck around with second-rate talent, get Kaufman and Ryskind [to write the screenplay]!\\" At the suggestion of producer Irving Thalberg, the film marked a change of direction in the brothers' career. In their Paramount films, the brothers' characters were much more anarchic: they attacked almost anybody who was so unfortunate to cross their paths whether they deserved it or not, albeit comically. Thalberg, however, felt that this made the brothers unsympathetic, particularly to female filmgoers. So in the MGM films, the brothers were recast as more helpful characters, saving most of their comic attacks for the villains. Though some Marx Brothers fans disliked these changes, Thalberg was vindicated when the film became a solid hit. It helped that the film contained some of what fans consider to be among the brothers' funniest and most memorable routines. These routines were carefully honed in a series of live stage performances, as the brothers took to the road and performed the new material around the country before filming began. However, according to Oscar Levant, the first preview of the finished film in Long Beach was a \\"disaster\\", with \\"hardly a laugh\\" as was the second. Thalberg and George S. Kaufman spent days in the editing room, adjusting the timing to match the rhythm of a stage performance. About nine minutes was cut from the running time, and the result was a hit.Oscar Levant, The Unimportance of Being Oscar, Pocket Books 1969 (reprint of G.P. Putnam 1968), p. 67. . Box office Lobby card The film grossed a total (domestic and foreign) of $1,815,000: $1,164,000 from the US and Canada and $651,000 elsewhere. It made a profit of $90,000. =Opera= True to its title, the film includes adaptations of some real opera scenes from I Pagliacci and Il Trovatore, featuring the Miserere duet sung by Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones. The opera setting also allowed MGM to add big production song numbers (which were one of this studio's specialties), such as the song Alone, with the departure of the steamship, and the song Cosi Cosa with the Italian buffet and dancing. Carlisle and Jones were both trained in operatic singing and provided their own singing voices in the film. Walter Woolf King was a trained baritone, but he portrayed a tenor in the film. His singing was dubbed by Metropolitan Opera tenor Tandy MacKenzie. =Subsequent re-editing= The film originally was to have begun with each of the Marx Brothers taking turns roaring instead of Leo the Lion (MGM's iconic mascot); Harpo was to have honked his horn. This unique opening was created, but not used in the released film because MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer felt the parody would cheapen the respected trademark. It turned up years later, however, in a re-release trailer for the film.A Night at the Opera trivia at the Internet Movie Database.Monkey Business: The Lives and Legends of the Marx Brothers (Hardcover) by Simon Louvish. Thomas Dunne Books; 1st U.S. edition (2000), . According to MGM's dialogue cutting continuity and Leonard Maltin's audio commentary on the current DVD release, the film originally began (after the opening credits) with the image of a \\"boat on canal\\". A superimposed title read, \\"ITALY ‚Äì WHERE THEY SING ALL DAY AND GO TO THE OPERA AT NIGHT\\", and was followed by a musical number featuring bits and pieces from Leoncavallo's Pagliacci performed by \\"everyday\\" Italians: a street sweeper sings part of the prologue (\\"Un nido di memorie...\\") as he greets a man who then hands out opera tickets to a group of children emerging from a store; the children respond with \\"la-la-la-la-la, verso un paese strano\\" (from \\"Stridono lass√π\\"); a \\"captain\\" comes down a set of steps, salutes a sentry, then bursts into \\"Vesti la giubba\\"; then, a lap dissolve into a hotel lobby, where a \\"baggage man\\" is rolling a trunk and crooning about \\"nettare divino\\" (\\"divine nectar\\"); a waiter joins the baggage man in song, enters the dining room, and sings as he serves a man who for a few notes also sings; the waiter then crosses the dining room to speak to Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont), marking the beginning of the film in existing copies. In his commentary, Maltin repeats an assertion originally made by Glenn Mitchell in The Marx Brothers Encyclopedia that the scene was cut during World War II to remove references to Italy. However, according to MPAA records, the film was re-edited by MGM in 1938, prior to the war, because of complaints from the Italian government that it \\"made fun of Italian people\\". Unfortunately, the edits were made to MGM's master negative, and no prints of the original uncut version are known to survive. This notable cut, with several other small ones made at about the same time, is why the stated running time of the film (95 minutes) was three minutes longer than that of existing prints. A persistent rumor concerning A Night at the Opera involves the presence of the Marx Brothers' father Sam Marx (also known as \\"Frenchy\\") on the ship and on the dock, waving goodbye. Both Groucho and Harpo stated this as fact in their memoirs,Groucho and Me by Groucho Marx. Marx, Harpo (1961). Harpo Speaks!. New York: B. Geis Associates; New York: Limelight Editions, 1985, . and Leonard Maltin repeats it in the DVD commentary. But this could not have occurred, because Sam Marx had died in 1933, during pre-production of Duck Soup, two years before A Night at the Opera was released. The rumor arose because Frenchy had had such a cameo appearance in the Marx Brothers' earlier Monkey Business. There is, however, a reference to the Marx Brothers' mother, Minnie Marx, during the stateroom scene, in which a woman asks, \\"Is my Aunt Minnie in here?\\" Part of the concept of casting the Marx Brothers as stowaways on a ship was recycled from Monkey Business. As Groucho's and Margaret Dumont's characters are boarding the ocean liner, Dumont asks Groucho, \\"Are you sure you have everything, Otis?\\"; Groucho replies, \\"I've never had any complaints yet.\\" In two different interviews with Dick Cavett on The Dick Cavett Show ‚Äì Comic Legends DVD, Groucho claimed that that exchange of dialogue was banned in a majority of states when the film was released because it was too suggestive, although the number of states varied with different tellings of the story. =Hungarian rediscovery= In 2008, a film student reported that the Hungarian National Film Archive possesses a longer print of the film. While the print does not contain the opening musical number, it does contain several excised lines referencing Italy that had been cut sometime after the film's original release. With the opening number still missing, it may be that this scene was cut before the subsequent edits were made. However, the discovery of the Hungarian print has not yet been independently verified, and Turner Entertainment, who owns the rights to the film, has not indicated that any restoration is forthcoming. =Hidden material= In the scene where the three stowaways are impersonating \\"the three greatest aviators in the world\\", Driftwood seems to talk gibberish with the dignitaries. Actually it is English; if played backwards, it can be heard what they are saying (\\"This man is accusing you of being impostors\\", etc.). It was recorded normally, then reversed and dubbed over the scene in post-production. Musical numbers *\\"Alone\\" (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed) *\\"Santa Lucia\\" *\\"All I Do Is Dream of You\\" *\\"Cosi-Cosa\\" *\\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\\" * Prelude to Il trovatore *\\"Anvil Chorus\\" (from Il trovatore) *\\"Stride la vampa\\" (from Il trovatore) *\\"Di quella pira\\" (from Il trovatore) *\\"Miserere\\", (From Il trovatore) *\\"Stridono lass√π\\" (from Pagliacci) Style change A Night at the Opera began a new era for the Marx Brothers' style of comedy. Whereas their previous comedies at Paramount Pictures consisted of a constant barrage of zany, free-for-all jokes sandwiched in between something resembling a plot, A Night at the Opera was calculated comedy. Producer Irving Thalberg insisted on a strong story structure, making the Brothers more sympathetic characters, interweaving their comedy with romantic plots and non-comic spectacular musical numbers. The targets of their mischief were largely confined to clear villains. Thalberg's logic was that the Marxes could get \\"twice the box office with half the laughs\\", believing their films would attract a wider audience. Groucho himself agreed with Thalberg's rationale. In his autobiography, Groucho and Me, he wrote of the Marx Brothers' 13 films, \\"Two were far above average. Some of the others were pretty good. Some were deplorable. The best two were made by Thalberg\\"‚Äîa reference not only to A Night at the Opera but A Day at the Races. Another idea which Thalberg consented to, was that before filming would commence on an upcoming picture, the Marx Brothers would try out the new material on the vaudeville stage, working on comic timing and learning which jokes and gags earned a laugh and which did not. Jokes were planted accordingly, so the laughs could be timed correctly. What was to become the famous \\"stateroom\\" scene was nearly eliminated because it was not getting any laughs. One evening the Marx Brothers threw away the script and ad-libbed the whole thing. As a result, a weak scene was transformed into one of their all- time classics. In A Night at the Opera, each of the brothers' characters was refined: Groucho was somewhat less nonsensical, and less trouble; Chico became less of a scammer and gained some intelligence; Harpo became less mischievous and more sympathetic. The film dives straight into a plot and accompanying comedy, with every scene having a clear beginning, middle, and end. The end consisted of a grand finale in the traditional MGM musical fashion, something lacking from the brothers' Paramount efforts. A Night at the Opera established a basic formula that was utilized in every subsequent film the Marx Brothers made at MGM: * a friendship existing between the romantic couple and Chico * establishing sympathy for Harpo * Chico and Groucho going through an extensive verbal routine * Harpo joining as Chico's partner (or brother) * lush surroundings as a backdrop to the brothers' lunacy * a key scene with all three Marxes * a fall from grace * a rebound on a grand scale in which everything is righted Reputation and legacy Contemporary reviews were positive. Andre Sennwald of The New York Times wrote, \\"If 'A Night at the Opera' is a trifle below their best, it is also considerably above the standard of laughter that has been our portion since they quit the screen. George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind have given them a resounding slapstick to play with and they wield it with maniacal delight.\\" \\"The comedy material is always good and sometimes brilliant\\", reported Variety. \\"This should be a laugh fest with all types of audiences\\", wrote Film Daily. \\"This is a good Marx Brothers film, good as any they have done\\", wrote John Mosher in The New Yorker. \\"It may not be new or surprising, but it's quick and funny.\\" The film holds a 98% \\"fresh\\" score at Rotten Tomatoes based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 8.57/10. Internet reviews take a revisionist approach and suggest that the film is \\"a very funny movie slowed down by MGM's expensive production values and idiotic songs.\\" Ken Hanke calls it \\"hysterical, but not up to the boys' Paramount films.\\" Mark Bourne concurs: \\"[The Marx Brothers] still let the air out of stuffed shirts and barbecue a few sacred cows, but something got lost in all that MGMness when the screen's ultimate anti- authoritarian team starting working the Andy Hardy side of the street.\\" Roger Ebert admitted that, while A Night at the Opera \\"contains some of their best work\\", he \\"fast-forward[ed] over the sappy interludes involving Kitty Carlisle and Allan Jones.\\" Danel Griffin says: \\"A Night at the Opera is funny, but this is NOT the Marx Brothers, and their earlier style is so sorely missed that the film falls flat. The main problem with A Night at the Opera is the obvious lack of the Marx Brothers' trademark anarchy. What distinguished them in their Paramount films from all other comedians was their thumb-biting indictment of society.

The screenplay by James Agee was based on the 1953 novel of the same title by Davis Grubb. The plot focuses on a corrupt minister-turned-serial killer who attempts to charm an unsuspecting widow and steal $10,000 hidden by her executed husband. The novel and film draw on the true story of Harry Powers, who was hanged in 1932 for the murder of two widows and three children in Clarksburg, West Virginia. The film's lyrical and expressionistic style with its leaning on the silent era sets it apart from other Hollywood films of the 1940s and 1950s, and it has influenced later directors such as Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Robert Altman. Selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1992, it is now considered one of the greatest films of all time. The influential film magazine Cahiers du cin√©ma selected The Night of the Hunter in 2008 as the second-best film of all time, behind Citizen Kane. Plot In West Virginia in the 1930s, Reverend Harry Powell is a self-appointed preacher and misogynistic serial killer who travels along the Ohio River, justifying the women he murdered with his switchblade knife after marrying them for their money as doing God's work. After reaching a town sometime after his latest murder, Powell ends up being arrested for driving a stolen car and serves his sentence at Moundsville Penitentiary. By chance, Powell ends up sharing the same cell as Ben Harper, a local man who murdered two men in a bank robbery for ten thousand dollars. But with the police about to catch him, Harper makes his children John and Pearl promise to never reveal where the money is hidden after hiding it in Pearl's doll. Despite Powell's attempts to learn the money's location, Harper takes it to his grave. Following Harper's execution, the released Powell makes his way to Harper's hometown where he charms the townsfolk while wooing Harper's widow Willa, who has been working for Walter Spoon and his wife Icey.https://cinephiliabeyond.org/the-night-of-the-hunter-the-extraordinary- single-directorial-entry-in-charles-laughtons-career/ Powell eventually marries Willa. Powell manages to win the town's trust, and only John is distrustful of him. John accidentally reveals that he knows the money's location when Powell overhears him reminding Pearl of their promise. Willa overhears Powell threatening Pearl to reveal the money, but Willa is deluded that Powell married her to redeem her soul. Powell murders Willa soon after, dumping her body in the river while making it appear that she left him and the children for a life of sin. Powell then proceeds to threaten John and Pearl before learning the money is hidden inside Pearl's doll. The children escape him and attempt to seek refuge with Birdie Steptoe, an elderly man who spends his days drinking on his riverboat and is friendly with John. When they arrive, they find that Birdie has drunk himself into a stupor after discovering Willa's corpse, fearing that the town would blame him for her death. The children use their father's boat to flee down the river and eventually take sanctuary with Rachel Cooper, a tough old woman who looks after stray children. Powell tracks them down, but Rachel sees through his deceptions and runs him off her property with Powell threatening to come back after dark. During the all-night standoff, Rachel shoots and wounds Powell as she traps him in her barn house before calling the police. The police, by now having discovered Willa's body, arrive to arrest Powell. John breaks down as he witnesses the arrest of Powell as a parallel to his father's arrest, beating the doll against the handcuffed Powell as the money spills out. Following Powell's sentencing at Moundsville, with John as a witness, Rachel takes him and the other children away as a bereaved Icey leads a lynch mob to take Powell from the police station. The police take Powell to safety, but the professional executioner promises to see Powell again soon. Finally, John and Pearl have their first Christmas together with Rachel and their new family.

Irving Allen and Laughton also directed but are not credited. Laughton had directed plays on Broadway, most produced by his friend Paul Gregory. =Development= Harold Matson, a literary agent, sent a copy of the 1953 novel The Night of the Hunter by Davis Grubb to Paul Gregory. He sent the book to Laughton, who loved it and described it as a \\"nightmarish Mother Goose story\\". Laughton contacted Grubb, and the two of them instantly got along very well. He traveled to Philadelphia, where Grubb lived, and they spent five days discussing ideas for the film. Grubb had studied art in college, so he offered to draw sketches as a form of inspiration. Laughton loved the drawings, and many of them were used in the film's storyboard. At first Grubb was being considered to write the screenplay himself, but the studio wanted to hire someone with experience writing for films. James Agee was hired as the screenwriter because he was from the South and had experience writing about the Depression. Agee began writing in April 1954, and finished in June, but his script was 293 pages: much too long for a feature film. Laughton made significant rewrites to the script, and his was the version used for shooting, even though he insisted that Agee be credited as the only writer. Agee's original script ended with a shot of children's faces floating among the stars, an idea that was eventually moved to the opening of the film. Throughout 1954, Gregory worked with the Production Code Administration to change the script to meet the guidelines of the Production Code. There was much concern about depicting a preacher on screen as an evil person, and Gregory made an effort to make the character of the Reverend not appear to be a real, ordained minister. Eventually the script was approved, but Protestant groups who had read the script continued to object to the film's production. While preparing for the filming, Laughton studied silent films by viewing their original nitrate prints, including The Birth of a Nation, Intolerance, and The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. He wanted to \\"restore the power of silent films to talkies.\\" The budget of the film was a little under $600,000, of which about $75,000 was for the rights to adapt the novel. =Casting= Robert Mitchum playing Reverend Harry Powell and Shelley Winters as Willa Harper Laughton's initial thought after reading the novel was to cast himself in the role of the preacher, but Gregory convinced him that no studio would finance a film unless they cast someone else. For the most part, he didn't hold traditional auditions for the actors; he simply met with them to get a sense of their personalities and whether they were right for the role. Laughton considered casting Gary Cooper as Harry Powell, but Cooper did not accept the role as he thought it might be detrimental to his career. John Carradine expressed interest in the role of the reverend, as did Laurence Olivier, but his schedule wasn't free for two years. Robert Mitchum was eager for the part of the preacher. When he auditioned, a moment that particularly impressed Charles Laughton was when Laughton described the character as \\"a diabolical shit,\\" and Mitchum promptly answered \\"Present!\\" Laughton liked Mitchum for the role partly due to his sexual persona, but Grubb was concerned about the character of the preacher being considered sexual. Laughton told him, \\"If you want to sell God, you have to be sexy.\\" Agnes Moorehead, Grace Kelly, and Betty Grable were all considered for the role of Willa Harper. In the end Laughton chose Shelley Winters because he felt she had a vulnerable quality and was more of a serious actor than a movie star; she committed to the role only two weeks before filming began. In her 1989 memoir, Winters described this as \\"probably the most thoughtful and reserved performance I ever gave\\". Laughton's first pick for the role of Rachel Cooper was his wife Elsa Lanchester. Jane Darwell and Louise Fazenda also were considered. Lanchester, for reasons unknown to Laughton, turned down the role, suggesting silent movie star Lillian Gish for the role. A doubtful Laughton went to New York for the purpose of watching films in which Gish starred. These included the shorts and feature films she made with pioneer D.W. Griffith. Gish had gotten word of him watching these old movies, and when she asked him why, he replied, \\"When I first went to the movies, they sat in their seats straight and leaned forward. Now they slump down, with their heads back, and eat candy and popcorn. I want them to sit up straight again.\\" =Filming= A lighting arrangement in The Night of the Hunter. Note the placement of the 330 px Principal photography of The Night of the Hunter began on August 15 and ended on October 7, 1954, a total of 36 days of shooting. Laughton kept the editor and musical composer on set during filming, which was very uncommon at the time. Mitchum originally suggested Laughton to shoot the film in authentic Appalachian locations but the director couldn't afford the budget to do on- location shooting. Besides, he wanted to create the film's unique look on Hollywood sound stages and found what he was looking for at Path√©, Republic Studios, and the Rowland V. Lee ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Certain cutaway shots and compositing shots were shot in West Virginia. Laughton hired Terry Sanders as second unit director in order to scout and shoot the river scenes because he had recently directed an Academy Award-winning short film A Time Out of War, which mostly took place on a river. Rather than shooting with traditional takes, Laughton had the crew only slate at the beginning of each reel of film and let the camera roll continuously until the reel ran out. This was so that he could direct the actors without waiting to reset the camera and sound equipment, not unlike the way silent films used to be directed. Shelley Winters told Laughton she had this image of Willa as being \\"a fly fascinated by a spider, and she very willingly walks into this web\\". He liked this image and told her to channel that into the performance. Mitchum's performance in the film has been described as Brechtian acting, which Laughton had extensive experience with. According to Lillian Gish, Laughton was very unsure of himself on set as this was his first time directing a film, and when someone would give him a suggestion he would start talking about fears that his whole vision was wrong. Laughton's directing style was supportive and respectful of the actors' input and several of the actors have said it was among their favorite professional experiences. The director of photography was Stanley Cortez, who also shot Orson Welles' 1942 film The Magnificent Ambersons. Because Laughton had very little experience working with film, Cortez would visit his house to explain various concepts of camera lenses, camera heights, and what effect each of them gave. Laughton told Cortez that the nitrate prints of the silent movies that he had been watching for research impressed them with how sharp they looked, so he asked Cortez to create that same sharpness for The Night of the Hunter. The studio brought most of the crew from a recent film Black Tuesday because they had worked so well together, and Cortez had experimented with a new black-and-white film Kodak Tri-X on that production, with great results. He chose to shoot certain scenes of this film on Tri-X because it had a sharp contrast that would help fulfill Laughton's vision. The studio however, tried to convince them to shoot on color film instead because they thought it would sell more tickets. Gregory fought to keep it black-and-white: \\"I could not see this film being in color.\\" The style of the cinematography was split up between the two units: the first unit of the crew shot the scenes in and around the Harpers' home, which were very dark, whereas the second unit shot the scenes traveling along the river, which were designed to look more like images from the children's perspective. One scene is particular that Cortez has spoken about is in the bedroom after Willa has overheard Powell threatening the children. He lit this scene with a halo of light surrounding Willa's head on the pillow, foreshadowing that her death is imminent. Cortez also brought back the Iris shot in one scene, as an homage to silent films. Laughton drew on the harsh, angular look of German expressionist films of the 1920s, which is especially noticeable in the art direction by Hilyard Brown.The Night of the Hunter: Not Noir http://www.filmsnoir.net. He had the idea that children only noticed certain details of their surroundings that they are focused on, which is why some set pieces are somewhat abstract and minimal: neon lights that aren't attached to a particular store, white picket fences that are not surrounding any house, the barn along the river that looks like a painting, and the \\"chapel-like\\" parents' bedroom. The river scenes with the children were all shot on a sound stage. The shot of John looking out of the barn window and seeing Powell's silhouette on the horizon was created using a little person and a miniature horse. The underwater scene showing Willa's dead body was shot in a studio using a mannequin with a custom mask to make it look like Winters. =Score= The film's score, composed and arranged by Walter Schumann in close association with Laughton, features a combination of nostalgic and expressionistic orchestral passages. The film has two original songs by Schumann, \\"Lullaby\\" (sung by Kitty White, whom Schumann discovered in a nightclub) and \\"Pretty Fly\\" (originally sung by Sally Jane Bruce as Pearl, but later dubbed by an actress named Betty Benson). A recurring musical device involves the preacher making his presence known by singing the traditional hymn \\"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\\". RCA Victor was impressed by the score, so in 1955 they released a soundtrack with Schumann's score and Laughton narrating an abridged version of the story, also written by Grubb. =Post production= The film's editor, Robert Golden, has said that after he screened the complete film to one of the United Artists studio executives for the first time, the executive told Golden, \\"It's too arty.\\" Release An image from the original trailer for The Night of the Hunter The Night of the Hunter premiered on July 26, 1955 in Des Moines, Iowa, a special event to raise money for the YMCA in Gregory's hometown, which included a parade and a broadcast on The Tonight Show. It later had its premiere in Los Angeles on August 26, 1955, and in New York on September 29, 1955. To promote the film, the Los Angeles Herald-Express serialized the film's script throughout April 1955. The film also received an extensive promotional campaign from United Artists, but they weren't sure about the best way to promote it because it didn't fall into any typical film genres, and the promotional material didn't give a good sense of what the film was about. However, one of the film's ads won an award for being in the top 50 best ads of 1954 from the American Institute of Graphic Arts. According to Paul Gregory, \\"absolutely no money was spent on promotion...United Artists didn't have the muscle, desire, or intelligence to handle the picture.\\" He originally had the idea to tour the film \\"road show style\\", stopping at certain cities that were familiar with Laughton's plays, but he couldn't convince the studio. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Cheyenne denied the film's release, and Gregory wanted to put together a lawsuit against them, but the studio wouldn't allow him to. Reception =Contemporaneous= The Night of the Hunter was not a success with either audiences or critics at its initial release, and Laughton never directed another film. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called the film \\"a weird and intriguing endeavor,\\" adding: \\"unfortunately the story and the thesis presented by Mr. Grubb had to be carried through by Mr. Laughton to a finish‚Äîand it is here that he goes wrong. For the evolution of the melodrama, after the threatened, frightened children flee home, angles off into that allegorical contrast of the forces of Evil and Good.\\" The staff of Variety summarized: \\"The relentless terror of Davis Grubb‚Äôs novel got away from Paul Gregory and Charles Laughton in their translation of Night of the Hunter. This start for Gregory as producer and Laughton as director is rich in promise but the completed product, bewitching at times, loses sustained drive via too many offbeat touches that have a misty effect.\\" Life summed up the film, \\"If sometimes it strains too hard at being simple and winds up being pretentious, it still is one of the year‚Äôs most interesting and provocative films.\\" The Legion of Decency gave the film a B because it degraded marriage, and the Protestant Motion Picture Council rated it \\"objectionable,\\" saying that any religious person would be offended by it. The film was also banned in Memphis, Tennessee by the city's head of censorship, Lloyd Binford. Great Britain rated the film \\"adults only.\\" The film was shot in black and white in the styles and motifs of German Expressionism (bizarre shadows, stylized dialogue, distorted perspectives, surrealistic sets, odd camera angles) to create a simplified and disturbing mood that reflects the sinister character of Powell, the nightmarish fears of the children, and the sweetness of their savior Rachel. Due to the film's visual style and themes, it is also often categorized as a film noir. Laughton took this commercial failure of his first film personally, and never attempted to make another film. =Retrospective= At the time of its release, The Night of the Hunter received mixed reviews, but over the years it has come to be regarded as a classic. It began as a cult film, with a small group of fans, and regularly played at museums and in revival houses. Its popularity grew as a new generation of children were exposed to the film when it played on television. In the '70s, as the field of film criticism began to expand, many articles were written about the film. Roger Ebert wrote, \\"It is one of the most frightening of movies, with one of the most unforgettable of villains, and on both of those scores, it holds up ... well after four decades.\\" The Night of the Hunter was rated No. 90 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments. In a 2007 listing of the 100 Most Beautiful Films, Cahiers du cin√©ma ranked The Night of the Hunter No. 2. It is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14. In 2008, it was ranked as the 71st greatest movie of all time by Empire magazine in its issue of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. In 1992, the United States Library of Congress deemed The Night of the Hunter to be \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\", and selected the film for preservation in its National Film Registry. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on , with a weighted average rating of 9.03/10.

Young. The film tells the story of Duff Anderson, an African-American railroad worker in the early 1960s who tries to maintain his respect in a racist small town near Birmingham, Alabama, after he marries the local preacher's daughter.The New York Times. In addition to dealing with oppression and discrimination, Anderson must also come to terms with his troubled relationship with his own father, a drunk who abandoned and rejected him. Although it was not widely seen upon release due to difficulties in finding distribution, the film is now generally considered to be an important example of neorealistic American cinema. In 1993, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Duff Anderson works on a railroad section gang near Birmingham, Alabama, earning a good wage and living an itinerant life with his black co- workers. On their night off, while the other men drink and visit a pool hall, Duff decides to walk into the nearby small town, and ends up at a church meeting featuring good food and lively gospel music. There, Duff meets the pretty and genteel schoolteacher Josie, the daughter of Preacher Dawson. They begin to date against the wishes of Josie's father and stepmother, who think the relatively uneducated, non-religious, and (to them) arrogant Duff is not good enough for Josie. Despite her parents' objections, Josie continues to see Duff, partly because Duff shows himself willing to resist and challenge the social conventions that oppress black people, rather than just accepting the status quo in order to get along with white people, as Josie's father has done. Initially, Duff is just looking for a sexual relationship and tells Josie he doesn't want to get married. But after Duff visits his four-year-old illegitimate son in the care of an unloving, indifferent stepmother, and his emotionally abusive, hardly functioning drunken father (Harris) living off his girlfriend (Lee), Duff realizes that he prefers the stability of a family to the life of a drifter. Duff and Josie marry with bright hopes for the future but then begin to face a series of challenges as a married couple. Duff quits the section gang and takes a lower paying job at the local sawmill in order to have a stable home life. Being on the move had given Duff the illusion of freedom, but living in the town makes Duff subject to the town's social rules, and he immediately starts to have problems. Unlike his peers, Duff refuses to pretend to be friendly to white people who treat him obnoxiously or patronize him. Duff tries to encourage his black co-workers at the mill to stick together and stand up for their rights, but one of them informs on him to the white mill bosses, who suspect him of being a union organizer and troublemaker. After Duff refuses to follow his white boss's order to retract his statements to the other men, Duff is fired, and subsequently finds himself blacklisted at other area mills. Despite diligently searching for work, he is unable to find another job that is not humiliating and that also pays enough to support his family, now including a baby on the way. Duff hates his preacher father-in-law, whom he sees as having sold out to the white people in return for social status and economic gain, and he hurtfully says to his wife, \\"You've never really been a nigger, living with them, in that house.\\" Nevertheless, out of concern for Josie, Preacher Dawson uses his connections in the town to get Duff a job at a white-owned gas station. Soon, white customers who find Duff too proud for a black \\"boy\\" threaten to cause trouble if the boss keeps him on, and he loses that job as well. Although Josie is understanding, Duff, under emotional pressure and in a rage, shoves his pregnant wife to the floor when she tries to comfort him. Duff packs his bag and leaves their house, telling Josie that he will write her when he is on his feet again. Duff storms off to his father, and finds him so inebriated that he dies as Duff and Lee are driving him to the hospital. Neither Duff nor Lee know where Duff's father was born or how old he was, and the only possessions he has handed down to Duff are the contents of his pockets. Duff decides to return home with his young son, whom Josie had been wanting to adopt. Duff and Josie tearfully embrace as he reassures her that it \\"ain't gonna be easy, baby, but it's going to be alright. Baby, I feel so free inside‚Äù.Roemer, M., & Young, R. M. (1964). INT.

Young and Michael Roemer, who drew on his own background as a Jew persecuted by Nazis. Roemer had fled Nazi Germany as an 11-year-old child on the Kindertransports. Before starting to write, Roemer and Young went on a quest to understand and get to know the African-American culture of the South. They ‚Äúleft on an Underground Railway in reverse‚Äù. As liberal Jews in the South, they were treated by whites as pariahs and warned that their food might be poisoned, causing them to relate strongly to the black families whom they met. They allowed themselves to be passed on from one family and community to the next so they could learn as much as possible about the relationships and experiences. One morning in Mississippi, the plot of a young couple's struggles and the man's relationship with his father came to Roemer, and the script was written in six weeks as soon as they were back in New York City.Vicki Vasilopoulos, \\"New Life for a 1964 Film\\", The New York Times (November 14, 2004). Retrieved October 20, 2011. Although the script was written quickly, casting took several months. Charles Gordone was responsible for introducing the writers to some of the main talent, including Broadway actor Ivan Dixon, who went on to play the role of Staff Sergeant James Kinchloe on the CBS-TV sitcom Hogan's Heroes, and jazz great Abbey Lincoln. Julius Harris made his acting debut in the film playing Duff's father. Harris was a male nurse before he was cast, but had always wanted to act.William H. Smock, \\"Michael Roemer: Silhouette\\", The Harvard Crimson (March 4, 1965). Retrieved October 28, 2011. Yaphet Kotto also had his first credited movie role in the film, playing a railroad worker. Both Harris and Kotto went on to appear in many more films and television programs over the next four decades. At the last minute, the film's title was almost changed to Duff Anderson. Reception Nothing But a Man premiered at Philharmonic Hall and had a limited run in a few cities, receiving rave reviews at the New York Film Festival and winning a coveted prize at the Venice Film Festival. However, according to Roger Ebert, the film's release was \\"spotty\\" and little money was available for its promotion. The film was mostly shown at theaters specializing in independent and foreign films. Ebert has suggested that it failed to find a wider audience because it did not \\"[employ] the easy liberal pieties of its period in an attempt to reassure white audiences that all stories have happy endings.\\" As a result, the film became, in Ebert's words, \\"more famous than familiar\\" and as of the early 1990s, few people had seen it. In 1993, a restored print of the film was nationally re-released, bringing it to the attention of a wider audience. It was later released on DVD in 2004.Walker, David (September 28, 2004), \\"Nothing But a Man\\" (review), DVD Talk. The film has received many excellent reviews and as of 2016, had a 95% fresh rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.

Honors and awards In 1964, Nothing But a Man won the San Giorgio Prize at the Venice Film Festival, awarded to films considered especially important for the progress of civilization. The film was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1993. Soundtrack The soundtrack to the film was put together by Wilbur Kirk.

The film was adapted by Daniel Mainwaring (using the pseudonym Geoffrey Homes) from his novel Build My Gallows High (also written as Homes), with uncredited revisions by Frank Fenton and James M. Cain. Film historians consider Out of the Past a superb example of film noir for its complex, fatalistic storyline, dark cinematography, and classic femme fatale. In 1991, Out of the Past was added to the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Plot Joe Stefanos is hired muscle for ‚Äúbig operator‚Äù Whit Sterling, a former New York City gambling kingpin relocated to Lake Tahoe. He arrives in a rural mountain town in the California Sierra Nevada looking to hook up with someone from their past. Jeff Bailey, owner of Bridgeport's gas station, is fishing at a nearby lake with wholesome local girl Ann Miller. Stefanos sends Jeff's deaf mute employee, The Kid, to retrieve Jeff, then informs Jeff that Whit wants to see him. Though Ann trusts Jeff implicitly, her parents are wary of him, as is Jim, a local conservation official who has been sweet on Ann since childhood. Jeff reluctantly agrees to meet with Whit, and invites Ann to join him for the 75 mile drive to Whit's home. On the way, Jeff tells Ann of a dark episode in his past (in flashback) involving both men and a beautiful but dangerous woman. Bailey's real name is Markham. He and former partner Jack Fisher were private investigators in New York. The pair had been hired at an extremely lucrative rate by the shady but superficially amiable Sterling to find his girlfriend, Kathie Moffat, who had shot him and stolen $40,000 before fleeing. Jeff is hesitant, sensing Sterling, who claims he is disinterested in the money and wealthy enough that may be true, instead is seeking revenge rather than a reconciliation. Whit assures Jeff he just wants her back, and will not harm her, but, having an impulsive disregard for Fisher, tells Markham he wants him to handle the case alone. On their way out in the elevator Fisher insists the payday still be split 50-50 according to their standing agreement, and Markham agrees. Kathie's maid tells Jeff she helped Kathie pack for a ‚Äútropical‚Äú climate, and mentions something about inoculations, but seeks to throw him off by dissembling that she has gone to Florida. Jeff guesses Mexico instead, since shots were not needed for Florida but still were to visit that country in those days. He follows her trail to Mexico City and Taxco, before staking her out in Acapulco and eventually striking up an acquaintance. She slowly but successfully seduces a willing Jeff, admitting she shot Sterling but denying she took his money. Befuddled with desire, Markham proposes the two of them go on the run together. Kathie warns him Sterling won't forget, which Jeff tries to dismiss with the wisecrack that the two of them will send him a postcard greeting every Christmas. Jeff proposes they leave the next morning for somewhere south by sea, and Kathie agrees to meet him at his hotel. While packing, he is surprised by the arrival of Sterling and Stefanos, checking up on his lack of progress. Jeff lies that Kathie slipped past him and is on a steamer going south. Whit instructs Jeff to keep looking for her. Jeff overreacts and tells Sterling he's finished both with the case and their relationship, to which Sterling responds threateningly, ‚ÄúI fire people. Nobody quits me.‚Äú After a close call in the hotel cocktail lounge, Sterling departs. The fugitive couple instead flees north by freighter to San Francisco. They live there as inconspicuously as possible initially, but are spotted at a horse race by Fisher, now working for Sterling. Jeff and Kathie split up to shake him, with Jeff conspicuously heading to Los Angeles. When he is confident he has given Fisher the slip, Jeff arranges to meet Kathie at a cabin in the Sierra Nevada, only to find that Fisher had been following her instead. When Fisher demands the full $10,000 originally promised the pair by Sterling to keep quiet, the two men brawl. Kathie suddenly shoots Fisher dead. Jeff is not merely startled but appalled, and lets her know that. He turns back towards Fisher and she flees, leaving him to bury the body. In her haste to flee, some of her purse contents had spilled out on a table, including her bank book. Jeff opens it to reveal a single deposit, $40,000. Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer in Out of the Past Jeff finishes his confession to Ann just as they reach Sterling's palatial Lake Tahoe estate, ending the flashback. Ann drops him off and Jeff is greeted with great bonhomie and apparent forgiveness by a cheerful Whit, who tells him he has a job only Jeff can handle. Markham instinctively declines. Over breakfast, Markham is startled when Kathie appears. Whit dismissively yet with seeming graciousness tells them that they are both ‚Äúback in the fold‚Äú, indicating to Jeff the job is not one that he can turn down. Trying to sugar-coat things, he indicates it is the only way to square things between them. A crooked San Francisco lawyer, Leonard Eels, has helped Whit dodge $1,000,000 ($ million today) in taxes, but now is blackmailing him for $200,000 or he will turn the incriminating records over to the United States Treasury. Whit wants Jeff to recover them and sends him on the afternoon train to San Francisco. Mitchum and Greer There, Jeff meets Eels' secretary, Meta Carson, who explains the plan. Markham begins to suspect he is being framed. That night, at Eels' apartment, she introduces him to Eels, which is to cause him, Jeff deduces, to leave his fingerprints on a glass. The couple leave, Jeff trails Carson, then returns and finds Eels dead. Knowing he will be blamed, he hides the body to throw off those plotting against him. Returning to Carson's apartment, he entraps Kathie (who has impersonated Carson in seeking to ensure that Eels' apartment manager finds the dead man's body) and wrings out of her that she gave Whit a signed affidavit swearing that Jeff killed Fisher. Jeff manages to retrieve the tax papers from some of Sterling's thugs and mails them to a safe location, substituting a local phonebook in the briefcase to throw off Sterling's henchmen when he is captured. He tells them he will only deal with Sterling and flees, only to find him himself the focus of a police dragnet for an accused double murderer. Jeff returns to the Bridgeport area. Unbeknownst to Whit, Kathie has ordered Stefanos to trail The Kid so he can find and kill Jeff. The Kid drives to a steep, narrow canyon where Jeff is hiding. The Kid spots Stefanos aiming a pistol at Jeff and quickly hooks him with a fishing line, causing Stefanos to lose his balance and fall to his death. Jeff goes back to Whit's mansion and tells him of Kathie's double-cross and Stefanos's death. He offers that the death of Stefanos, Eels' actual murderer, can be made to look like a guilt-ridden suicide, removing Jeff from that frame-up. Furthermore, he will return the business records to Whit if Whit destroys Kathie's affidavit and hands her over to the police for Fisher's death. Whit takes the offer and Jeff believes he has worked his way out of Kathie's web. Jeff makes a quick visit to Ann, then returns to Tahoe to discover that Kathie has killed Whit. She gives Jeff the choice of running away with her and a satchel of Whit's money or taking the blame for all three murders. He agrees to go with her, but phones the state police while she is upstairs packing. Driving up to a police roadblock, Kathie realizes that Jeff has betrayed her and shoots him dead. She then fires at the police, who fatally shoot her. When the news reaches Bridgeport, Jim offers to take Ann away. Ann asks The Kid if Jeff had been planning to run away with Kathie. Wanting to free Ann, The Kid lies and nods his head. Ann returns to Jim and she drives off with him as The Kid smiles and salutes Jeff's name on the station's sign.

D'Agostino's design group ‚Äî were long-time RKO collaborators. Although the studio had focused on making the more lucrative B-films during the early 1940s, the post-World War II Out of the Past was given an A-budget. John Garfield and Dick Powell turned down the lead.Richard B. Jewell, Slow Fade to Black: The Decline of RKO Radio Pictures, Uni of California, 2016 In only his second film role, Kirk Douglas plays a supporting part as Mitchum's antagonist in this film. The next time Mitchum and Douglas played major roles in the same picture was in the 1967 Western The Way West alongside Richard Widmark. Musuraca also shot Tourneur's Cat People. Reception =Box office= The film made a profit of $90,000. =Critical response= Out of the Past is considered one of the greatest of all films noir. Robert Ottoson hailed the film as \\"the ne plus ultra of forties film noir\\". Film critic Bosley Crowther wrote, \\"However, as we say, it's very snappy and quite intriguingly played by a cast that has been well and smartly directed by Jacques Tourneur. Robert Mitchum is magnificently cheeky and self-assured as the tangled 'private eye,' consuming an astronomical number of cigarettes in displaying his nonchalance. And Jane Greer is very sleek as his Delilah, Kirk Douglas is crisp as a big crook and Richard Webb, Virginia Huston, Rhonda Fleming and Dickie Moore are picturesque in other roles. If only we had some way of knowing what's going on in the last half of this film, we might get more pleasure from it. As it is, the challenge is worth a try.\\" The staff at Variety wrote, \\"Out of the Past is a hardboiled melodrama [from the novel by Geoffrey Homes] strong on characterization. Direction by Jacques Tourneur pays close attention to mood development, achieving realistic flavor that is further emphasized by real life settings and topnotch lensing by Nicholas Musuraca...Mitchum gives a very strong account of himself. Jane Greer as the baby-faced, charming killer is another lending potent interest. Kirk Douglas, the gangster, is believable and Paul Valentine makes role of henchman stand out. Rhonda Fleming is in briefly but effectively.\\" In a 2004 review of the film, critic Roger Ebert wrote \\"Out of the Past is one of the greatest of all film noirs, the story of a man who tries to break with his past and his weakness and start over again in a town, with a new job and a new girl. The film stars Robert Mitchum, whose weary eyes and laconic voice, whose very presence as a violent man wrapped in indifference, made him an archetypal noir actor. The story opens before we've even seen him, as trouble comes to town looking for him. A man from his past has seen him pumping gas, and now his old life reaches out and pulls him back.\\" Ebert also called it, \\"The greatest cigarette-smoking movie of all time.\\"Ebert, Roger - 200 Cigarettes Chicago Sun, February 26, 1999. This review also later appeared in the book by Roger Ebert, \\"I Hated Hated Hated HATED this movie\\" \\"The trick, as demonstrated by Jacques Tourneur and his cameraman, Nicholas Musuraca, is to throw a lot of light into the empty space where the characters are going to exhale. When they do, they produce great white clouds of smoke, which express their moods, their personalities and their energy levels. There were guns in Out of the Past, but the real hostility came when Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas smoked at each other.\\" The film currently holds a \\"Fresh\\" score of 95% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 9/10, based on 37 reviews. Adaptations Out of the Past was remade as Against All Odds (1984) with Rachel Ward in the Greer role, Jeff Bridges filling in for Mitchum, and James Woods as a variation of Kirk Douglas' villain, with Jane Greer as the mother of her original character in Out of the Past and Richard Widmark in a supporting role.

The park is roughly long, following the course of the Genesee River as it flows north through a deep gorge and over several large waterfalls. It is located southwest of Rochester and southeast of Buffalo, and spans portions of the Livingston County towns of Leicester, Mount Morris, and Portage, as well as the Wyoming County towns of Castile and Genesee Falls. In 1859, industrialist William Pryor Letchworth (1823-1910) began purchasing land near the Middle Falls, and started construction of his Glen Iris Estate. In 1906 he bequeathed the estate to New York, which soon after became the core of the newly created Letchworth State Park. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The park prominently features three large waterfallsthe Upper, Middle, and Lower Fallson the Genesee River, which flows within a deep gorge that winds through the park. The rock walls of the gorge, which rise up to in places, prompted the area's reputation as the \\"Grand Canyon of the East\\". Features and activities View of Middle Falls at Letchworth State Park Map of Letchworth State Park and surrounding area. Park entrances are located near Mount Morris, Perry, Castile and Portageville. A paved two- or three-lane road follows the west side of the gorge, allowing many scenic viewpoints for the geologic features. The park includes pavilions, picnic tables, playgrounds, of hiking trails, two large swimming pools, cabins, campsites for tents, trailer sites with dumping stations, and horse-riding trails. Activities within the park include hiking, biking, fishing, whitewater rafting and kayaking, geocaching, and hunting (wild turkey and deer when in season). During the winter, the park facilitates snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, snow tubing, and horse-drawn sleighs. Hot air ballooning is available at the park, weather permitting. In 2015, Letchworth State Park won USA Today's Reader's Choice competition as the best state park in the United States. In 2020 the park topped a similar list.Alison Medley (July 20, 2020 ) Two Texas state parks top the list of 20 best state parks in U.S., new ranking says =Waterfalls and geology= Lower Falls and stone footbridge at Letchworth State Park Within the park, there are three large waterfalls on the Genesee River and as many as 50 waterfalls found on tributaries that flow into it; the deep gorge formed by the river, with rock walls rising up to in places and which narrow to across above the middle of the three falls, prompted the area's reputation as the \\"Grand Canyon of the East\\". The three major waterfalls  called the Upper, Middle, and Lower Falls  are located in Portage Canyon, the southern section of the park. The only trail bridging the Genesee River in the park crosses a stone bridge just below the Lower Falls. The Middle Falls is the highest, and the Upper Falls has an active railroad trestle crossing immediately above it. The park also contains Inspiration Falls, a ribbon waterfall that is located on a tributary creek a short distance east of the Inspiration Point Overlook, west of the park visitor center. It has a total drop of . While impressive in its height, it is seasonal and often appears as only a water stain on the cliff. The falls faces to the south-southwest and has a crest that is wide. View of the Genesee River and gorge The bedrock exposed in the gorge is Devonian in age, mostly shales, with some layers of limestone and sandstone. The rock was laid down in an ancient inland sea, and it holds many marine fossils. The landform of the section of the Genesee River valley represented by the park is geologically very young, caused by a diversion of the river from the old valley by the last continental glacier, which forced the river to cut a new section of valley. =Historic sites and museums= The historic, restored Glen Iris Inn, William Pryor Letchworth's former residence adapted for use as a hotel, is located on the top of a cliff overlooking Middle Falls and offers in-season meals and overnight accommodations. It is open to the public for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The park is the present-day site of the grave of Mary Jemison, a Scots-Irish immigrant pioneer who was captured at the age of 12 from central Pennsylvania by a French and Shawnee raiding party during the French and Indian War. She was soon adopted by a family of Seneca people, and eventually lived in western New York on the Genesee River. She had become thoroughly assimilated and chose to live with the Seneca for the rest of her long life, having a total of seven children by two successive husbands. Her remains were exhumed from the Buffalo Creek Reservation and reinterred on the grounds of a Seneca Council House, relocated to the site by Letchworth and rededicated in 1872. The park also features the William Pryor Letchworth Museum, which was founded with the collections of the park's founder. The exhibits focus on the natural and cultural history of the Genesee Valley, and include archaeological artifacts of the Seneca nation, and displays on Mary Jemison, early pioneers, the Genesee Valley Canal and William Pryor Letchworth. The Humphrey Nature Center opened in 2016. Operated year-round by New York State, the sustainable building features classrooms and meeting rooms, a research lab, a butterfly garden, and connections to various trails. =Mount Morris Dam= Mount Morris Dam Found at the north end of the park, the construction of the Mount Morris Dam was begun in 1948 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers under the Flood Control Act of 1944. The dam was completed in 1954. The Genesee River became wider and deeper immediately upstream as a result, but areas downstream were spared yearly flooding which destroyed valuable farmland. The Mount Morris Dam is the largest flood control device of its kind (concrete gravity) east of the Mississippi River. It is in length and rises from the riverbed. The dam proved its worth during the Flood of 1972, saving thousands of acres of farmland and the city of Rochester from flooding. =Portage Viaduct= Upper Falls with a train passing over the Portage Viaduct The Portage Viaduct is an iron railroad bridge located upstream and within view of the park's Upper Falls. The bridge is long and high. Although walking on the structure is considered trespassing, visitors to the park commonly disregard warning signs in order to view the gorge from the bridge, despite the safety concerns associated with walking on an active railroad bridge. On November 29, 2011, Norfolk Southern Railway announced plans to demolish the Portage Viaduct and build a new bridge approximately to the south of the current structure. Norfolk Southern had offered the old bridge to the State of New York, but the offer was declined due to a lack of available funds to convert the bridge into an observation platform. An arched design was approved for the bridge's replacement in late 2014 and construction of the new bridge was expected to begin in 2015, with an estimated cost of $71 million. The project is scheduled for completion in early 2018. Park history Genesee Scenery, an 1847 oil painting by Thomas Cole. The territory of the park was long part of the homeland of the Seneca people, who were largely forced out after the American Revolutionary War, as they had been allies of the defeated British. The Seneca called the land around this canyon Sehgahunda, the \\"Vale of the three falls\\"; the Middle Falls (Ska-ga-dee) was believed to be so wondrous it made the sun stop at midday. Having first viewed the gorge that was to become the park from the nearby railroad trestle in 1858, William Pryor Letchworth purchased an initial of land near the Portage Falls in 1859 and subsequently began work on his Glen Iris Estate. By purchasing the land, Letchworth successfully halted plans to install a hydroelectric dam in the gorge that would have altered the flow of the river and diminished flows over the large waterfalls. He enlisted the services of the famous landscape artist William Webster to design winding paths and roadways, rustic bridges, glistening \\"lakes\\" and a sparkling fountain. William Pryor Letchworth Letchworth spent the following years expanding his land holdings in the area. In 1906, Letchworth granted the Glen Iris and the surrounding to the State of New York as a public park, intending to deter commercial businesses from damaging the fragile nature of the gorge and surrounding woodlands. He further required that the land be managed by the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. A plaque near the gorge contains a dedication written by Letchworth's niece in 1910, and reads: George F. Kunz, president of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society of New York, was an enthusiastic supporter of the park.Kunz, George F. \\"The Educational Possibilities of Letchworth Park.\\" Albany. 1907.

Kunz Portrait.\\" American Review of Reviews. Volume 45, page 148. February 1912. Dr. Kunz helped with the organization and preservation of the library of William Pryor Letchworth when the Society took over the management of his estate in New York. In 1907, it was stated, \\"The library embraces one of the finest, if not the finest, private collection of book on charities in the country. It contains also a good collection of local histories, books about Indians, and a miscellaneous assortment of standard literature. His mementos - personal gifts and testimonials - are extremely interesting. It is most desirable that these should be kept together and adequately preserved in a new library building, as part of the monument to the generous donor of Letchworth Park.\\"American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. 12th Annual Report, 1907 pages 192-193. See: http://www.letchworthparkhistory.com/museum.html, accessed on July 9, 2002. Further, Dr. Kunz helped with the 1910 memorial to Mary Jemison, \\"The White Indian of the Genesee\\", who is buried at \\"the ancient Indian Council House of the Senecas\\" located on the grounds of the Letchworth park.Seaver, James Everett. 1918. The Life of Mary Jemison: The White Indian of the Genesee. NY: American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society. Pages 238-239. Letchworth, having earned \\"life-residence\\" at the Glen Iris, died there on December 1, 1910. He was buried in nearby Buffalo at Forest Lawn Cemetery. The park was the beneficiary of numerous enhancements enacted by workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps, who inhabited a large camp at the park during the 1930s. Improvements enacted by the CCC included the construction of cabins, overlooks, bridges and trails. =Old Portageville Bridge Fire= The Erie Railroad Company built a wooden trestle bridge over the Genesee River just above the Upper Falls. Construction started on July 1, 1851 and opened August 16, 1852. At the time, it was the longest and tallest wooden bridge in the world. In the early morning hours of Thursday, May 6, 1875, the great wooden railroad bridge was destroyed in a tremendous fire. The bridge was a total loss, leaving only the concrete bridge abutments. Immediately after the Portage Bridge fire, officials of the Erie Railroad Company moved quickly to replace the wooden bridge with an iron and steel design. Construction began June 8, 1875 and the Portage Viaduct opened for traffic July 31, 1875. =Flood of 1972= One of the greatest natural disasters in Genesee Valley history took place in June 1972. Hurricane Agnes came ashore on the Florida Panhandle on June 19, and moved north through Georgia and the Carolinas. The hurricane then went out to sea, recharged its energy and hit the Southern Tier of New York State on June 22. Although Agnes was only a Category 1 hurricane, it soon stalled over North Central Pennsylvania. Caught up in a slow moving low pressure system, the storm drifted slowly northeastward into New York State. The area, having already been soaked by showers the week before, could not absorb the rainfall that fell over Pennsylvania and New York. Known locally as \\"The Flood of '72\\", the event would have a tremendous impact on Western New York and Letchworth Park. Although the Genesee River and Letchworth Park was not hit as hard as the Susquehanna Valley and other areas, the impact of the flood would be felt in the park for many years. The Lower Falls Bridge and trail to Sugar Loaf did not officially reopen for several years. To this day, visitors can still see some of the natural \\"scars\\" left by the flood waters over 40 years ago. Video footage of the devastation can be viewed upon request at the William Pryor Letchworth Museum, located near the Glen Iris Inn.

Wellman, starring Henry Fonda, Dana Andrews and Mary Beth Hughes, with Anthony Quinn, William Eythe, Harry Morgan and Jane Darwell. Two drifters are passing through a Western town, when news arrives that a local rancher has been murdered and his cattle stolen. The townspeople, joined by the drifters, form a posse to catch the perpetrators. They find three men in possession of the cattle, and are determined to see justice done on the spot. The film premiered in May 1943 to positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture at the 16th Academy Awards, losing to Casablanca. In 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The film was adapted from the 1940 novel of the same name, written by Nevadan Walter Van Tilburg Clark.\\"The Ox-Bow Incident (1943)\\". The Ox-Bow Incident (1943). FilmSite, n.d. Web. 01 Dec. 2012. . Plot In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex- girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Mart√≠nez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke. Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others. Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die. The Mexican \\"Juan\\" is recognized as a gambler named Francisco Morez. He tries to escape and is shot and wounded. The posse discovers that Morez has Kinkaid's gun. Major Tetley wants the men to be lynched immediately. A vote is taken as to whether the men should be hanged or taken back to stand trial. Only seven, among them Davies, Gerald Tetley, Gil and Art, vote to take the men back to town alive; the rest support immediate hanging. Gil tries to stop it, but is overpowered. After the lynching, the posse heads back towards Bridger's Wells and immediately encounters Sheriff Risley, who tells them that Lawrence Kinkaid is not dead and that the men who shot him have been arrested. Risley strips the deputy of his badge and asks Davies who is responsible. ‚ÄúAll but seven,‚Äù Davies replies, and the sheriff declares ‚ÄúGod have mercy on you...you'll get none from me.‚Äù The men of the posse gather in Darby's Saloon and drink in silence. Major Tetley returns to his house, shuts out his son (who condemns his sadistic behavior), goes to his study and closes the door, before a gunshot is heard from within. In the saloon, Gil reads Martin's letter to Art while members of the posse listen. In the letter, Martin confessed feeling sorry for the posse members, who will have to live with what they have done for the rest of their lives. In the final scene Gil and Art head out of town by the same route they rode in to deliver the letter and $500 ($ today) raised by those in the posse for Martin's wife. Cast Production Director William A. Wellman loved the novel and wanted to adapt it into a film and then interested Darryl F. Zanuck in producing it. Zanuck agreed in producing the story, on the condition that Wellman would also direct two other films for the studio, Thunder Birds (1942) and Buffalo Bill (1944).. There are several differences between the film and the novel, notably the fate of the Tetleys and the fate of the lynch mob. In the book, young Gerald commits suicide by hanging himself in the barn. This leads his father to fall on his cavalry sword. The sheriff stares down each member of the mob, but then he says he will forget everything. The role of Gil Carter, played by Henry Fonda, was originally offered to Gary Cooper, who turned it down. Fonda was generally unhappy with the quality of the films he was cast in while under contract with 20th Century Fox. This was one of only two films from that period that he was enthusiastic about acting in (the other was The Grapes of Wrath, made in 1940). Fonda regarded this film as one of his favorites. Filming was done from late June to early August 1942, mostly in studio back-lots and sound stages; a limited amount of location shooting was done at a ranch in Chatsworth and in Lone Pine, both in California. Additional sequences and retakes were done mid-August to late August. The production on the film would be shut down for a week or ten days \\"due to the $5,000-per-film limit on new construction materials\\" (imposed by the War Production Board). During the shutdown, already used sets were torn down so their materials could be used to build the mountain pass set. Studio publicity noted that the Ox-Bow Valley setting was \\"the largest set ever constructed\\" by Fox, covering . The western street set seen in this film was subsequently used in another western, The Gunfighter (1950), which starred Gregory Peck. After filming was completed, Fonda immediately enlisted in the U.S. Navy, in which he served until 1946. After the film was completed, it was kept on the shelf for months because Fox executives were uncertain how to market a film with such a sobering theme. Reception The film received mostly positive reviews. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that it \\"is not a picture which will brighten or cheer your day. But it is one which, for sheer, stark drama, is currently hard to beat.\\" Variety called it a \\"powerful preachment against mob lynching ... Director William Wellman has skillfully guided the characters and driven home the point that hanging is unwarranted. Fonda measures up to star rating ... He helps hold together the loose ends of the rather patent plot.\\" David Lardner of The New Yorker called it a \\"rather good piece of work\\". Harrison's Reports printed a negative review, calling it a \\"depressing, unpleasant, at times horrible, melodrama ... Whoever is responsible for selecting such sordid material for the screen should be awarded a 'booby' prize.\\" More recently, La Furia Umanas Toshi Fujiwara said the film is \\"one of the most important westerns in the history of American cinema\\". Clint Eastwood has stated this is his favorite film. However, Darryl F. Zanuck, head of Twentieth Century-Fox 1935‚Äì1956, recalled the film as 'a flop. In spite of its significance and its dramatic value, our records showed that it had failed to pay its way. In fact, its pulling power was less than that of a Laurel and Hardy comedy we made about the same time.' It earned $750,000 in the United States.Aubrey Solomon, Twentieth Century-Fox: A Corporate and Financial History Rowman & Littlefield, 2002 p 220 Awards and honors The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 16th Academy Awards, losing to Casablanca. As of 2018, it is the last film to be nominated for Best Picture and nothing else. An outdoor mural at Twentieth Century Fox Studios, Century City, depicts the filming of The Ox-Bow Incident.

It was directed by and starred Clint Eastwood (as the eponymous Josey Wales), with Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Sam Bottoms, and Geraldine Keams.Variety film review; June 30, 1976. The film tells the story of Josey Wales, a Missouri farmer whose family is murdered by Union militants during the Civil War. Driven to revenge, Wales joins a Confederate guerrilla band and makes a name for himself as a feared gunfighter. After the war, all the fighters in Wales' group except for him surrender to Union officers, but they end up being massacred. Wales becomes an outlaw and is pursued by bounty hunters and Union soldiers as he tries to make a new life for himself. The film was adapted by Sonia Chernus and Philip Kaufman from author Forrest Carter's 1972 novel The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales (republished, as shown in the movie's opening credits, as Gone to Texas).Barra, Allen. \\"The Education of Little Fraud\\", Salon.com, December 20, 2001. The film was a commercial success, earning $31.8 million against a $3.7 million budget. In 1996, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress for being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Josey Wales was portrayed by Michael Parks in the film's 1986 sequel, The Return of Josey Wales. His wife Laura Lee was played by Mary Ann Averett in the sequel. Plot Josey Wales, a Missouri farmer, is driven to revenge by the murder of his wife and young son by a band of pro-Union Jayhawker militants from Senator James H. Lane's Kansas Brigade, led by the brutal Captain Terrill. After grieving and burying his wife and son, Wales practices shooting a gun before joining a group of pro-Confederate Missouri bushwhackers led by William T. Anderson, taking part in attacks on Union sympathizers and army units. At the conclusion of the war, Josey's friend and superior, Captain Fletcher, persuades the guerrillas to surrender, having been promised by Senator Lane that they will be granted amnesty if they hand over their weapons. Wales refuses to surrender, and as a result, he and a young guerrilla named Jamie are the only survivors when Terrill's Redlegs massacre the surrendering men. Wales intervenes and wipes out most of the Redlegs with a Gatling gun before fleeing with Jamie, who dies from a bullet wound after helping Josey kill two pursuing militiamen. Lane forces a reluctant Fletcher to assist Terrill in finding his friend and puts a $5,000 bounty on his head, attracting the attention of Union soldiers and bounty hunters who seek to hunt him down. Along the way, and despite his aversion to traveling with company, he accumulates a diverse group of companions. They include an old Cherokee man named Lone Watie; Little Moonlight, a young Navajo woman; Sarah Turner, an elderly woman from Kansas; and her granddaughter Laura Lee, whom Wales and Little Moonlight rescue from a group of marauding Comancheros. Josey and Laura later sleep together as does Lone Watie and Little Moonlight. At the town of Santo Rio, two men, Travis and Chato, who had worked for Grandma Sarah's deceased son Tom, join the group. Wales and his companions find an abandoned ranch once owned by Tom and settle in after Wales parleys and makes peace with the neighboring Comanche tribe leader, Ten Bears. Meanwhile, a bounty hunter whose partner was gunned down by Wales at Santo Rio guides Captain Terrill and his men to the town. The following morning, the Redlegs launch a surprise attack on the ranch. Wales' companions take cover in the fortified ranch house and open fire, gunning down all of Terrill's men. A wounded Wales, despite being out of ammunition, pursues the fleeing Terrill back to Santa Rio. When he corners him, Wales dry fires his four pistols through all the empty chambers before holstering them. Terrill attempts to draw his cavalry sabre, but Wales grabs the blade and stabs him through the chest, finally avenging his family. Returning to the Santa Rio saloon, Wales finds Fletcher accompanied by two Texas Rangers. The locals at the saloon, who refer to Wales as \\"Mr. Wilson\\", tell the Rangers that Wales was killed in a shoot-out in Monterrey. The Rangers accept this story and move on, but Fletcher sees through the lie, and pretends to not recognize Wales. He says that he will go to Mexico to look for Wales himself and try to tell him that the war is over. Wales says, \\"I reckon so. I guess we all died a little in that damned war\\", before riding off.

The Outlaw Josey Wales was inspired by a 1972 novel by former KKK leader Forrest Carter, and was originally titled The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales and later retitled Gone to Texas. The script was worked on by Sonia Chernus and producer Bob Daley at Malpaso, and Eastwood himself paid some of the money to obtain the screen rights.McGilligan (1999), p. 257 Michael Cimino and Philip Kaufman later oversaw the writing of the script, aiding Chernus. Kaufman wanted the film to stay as close to the novel as possible in style and retained many of the mannerisms in Wales's character which Eastwood would display on screen, such as his distinctive lingo with words like \\"reckon\\", \\"hoss\\" (instead of \\"horse\\"), and \\"ye\\" (instead of \\"you\\") and spitting tobacco juice on animals and victims. The characters of Wales, the Cherokee chief, Navajo woman, and the old settler woman and her daughter all appeared in the novel.McGilligan (1999), p.258 On the other hand, Kaufman was less happy with the novel's political stance; he felt that it had been \\"written by a crude fascist\\" and that \\"the man's hatred of government was insane\\". He also felt that that element of the script needed to be severely toned down, but, he later said, \\"Clint didn't, and it was his film\\". Kaufman was later fired by Eastwood, who took over the film's direction himself. Cinematographer Bruce Surtees, James Fargo, and Fritz Manes scouted for locations and eventually found sites in Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, and Oroville, California even before they saw the final script. Kaufman cast Chief Dan George, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for Supporting Actor in Little Big Man, as the old Cherokee Lone Watie. Sondra Locke, also a previous Academy Award nominee, was cast by Eastwood against Kaufman's wishesMcGilligan (1999), p.261 as Laura Lee, the granddaughter of the old settler woman. This marked the beginning of a close relationship between Eastwood and Locke that would last six films and the beginning of a romance that would last into the late 1980s. Ferris Webster was hired as the film's editor and Jerry Fielding as composer. In June 1975, it was announced that Eastwood would star in the film with a scheduled Bicentennial Celebration release.\\"'Gone to Texas' Packs Eastwood-Style Action\\" Gynter Quill, Waco Tribune-Herald, June 29, 1975 Principal photography began on October 6 in Lake Powell. A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming. Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail, which caused disagreements with Eastwood, not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman's part in regard to their emerging relationship.McGilligan (1999), p. 262 One evening, Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene, but while he was absent, Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away, leaving before Kaufman had returned.McGilligan (1999), p. 263 Soon after, filming moved to Kanab, Utah. On October 24, 1975, Kaufman was fired at Eastwood's command by producer Bob Daley.McGilligan (1999), p. 264 The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives, since the director had already worked hard on the film, including completing all of the pre-production. Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down, and their refusal to do so resulted in a fine, reported to be around $60,000 for the violation. This resulted in the Director's Guild passing a new rule, known as \\"the Eastwood Rule\\", which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then personally taking on the director role. From then on, the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second-in-command; with Kaufman's planning already in place, the team was able to finish making the film efficiently. Reception Upon release in August 1976, The Outlaw Josey Wales was widely acclaimed by critics, many of whom saw Eastwood's role as an iconic one, relating it with much of America's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War.McGilligan (1999), p.266 The film was pre-screened at the Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities in Idaho in a six-day conference entitled Western Movies: Myths and Images. Academics such as Bruce Jackson, critics such as Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight and directors such as King Vidor, Henry King, William Wyler and Howard Hawks were invited to the screening.Time magazine named the film one of the year's top 10.McGilligan (1999), p.267 Roger Ebert compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood's portrayal of Josey Wales with his \\"Man with No Name\\" character in the Dollars Trilogy and praised the atmosphere of the film. On The Merv Griffin Show, Orson Welles lauded the film, calling Eastwood \\"one of America's finest directors\\". Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gave the film a 90% approval rating based on 41 reviews, with an average score of 7.92/10. =Awards= The Outlaw Josey Wales was nominated for the Academy Award for Original Music Score. In 1996, it was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. It was also one of the few Western films to receive critical and commercial success in the 1970s at a time when the Western was thought to be dying as a major genre in Hollywood. Clint Eastwood says on the 1999 DVD release that the movie is \\"certainly one of the high points of my career... in the Western genre of filmmaking\\". Meaning In 2011, Eastwood called The Outlaw Josey Wales an anti-war film. > As for Josey Wales, I saw the parallels to the modern day at that time. > Everybody gets tired of it, but it never ends. A war is a horrible thing, > but it's also a unifier of countries... Man becomes his most creative during > war.

These ferns typically have creeping rhizomes. The fronds are simply pinnate to pinnate-pinnatifid. There is either no frond dimorphism or only mild dimorphism, either open venation or very simple anastomosing. The sori are mostly reniform in shape and have indusia, except for the Phegopteris group.  Classification  At one time, all thelypterioid ferns were included in the genus Dryopteris because of the sorus shape. However, there are a great many differences between the groups, and these plants are now segregated in their own family. Genetic evidence shows that the family is clearly monophyletic. =Phylogenetic relationships= The following cladogram for the suborder Aspleniineae (as eupolypods II), based on Lehtonen (2011), and Rothfels & al. (2012), shows a likely phylogenetic relationship between the Thelypteridaceae and the other families of the clade. =Genera= The family can be divided into two major clades, which the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) recognizes as two subfamilies, Phegopteridoideae and Thelypteroideae. Their division into genera has been described as \\"highly controversial and fluctuating\\". The family includes several complexes of species that are difficult to distinguish, and seem to represent a remarkable evolutionary radiation. Some researchers include the entire family Thelypteridaceae in the genus Thelypteris; others divide the family into as many as 30 genera. An intermediate position is to place the bulk in Thelypteris (which can then be divided into subgenera and sections corresponding to the genera of other authors) but to separate out Phegopteris and Macrothelypteris. Another choice is to divide the family into a half a dozen or so genera. The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) accepts 30 genera: *Subfamily Phegopteridoideae Salino, A.R.Sm. & T.E.Almeid Macrothelypteris (H.Ito) Ching Phegopteris (C.Presl) F√©e Pseudophegopteris Ching ‚Äì here treated as a synonym of Phegopteris *Subfamily Thelypteridoideae C.F.Reed Amauropelta Kunze Amblovenatum J.P.Roux Ampelopteris Kunze Chingia Holttum Christella H.L√©v.

Regulations of the profession vary by country and state. The terminology has evolved to include those once known as landscape gardeners, landscape designers, architects, surveyors, or civil engineers. In particular, this includes people from the 19th century who'd practiced before the term \\"landscape architect\\" was coined. Landscape architecture was also differentiated as a profession in the United States earlier than other parts of the world, but this ambiguity has persisted to the present day. In much of Europe, for example, landscape architecture is not a distinct profession; but there are many significant historical and contemporary examples of \\"landscape architectural design\\" projects. Though their influence on landscape architecture may be great, this list precludes gardeners, botanists, writers, theoreticians, ecologists, artists, and others who did not practice landscape design at a site scale and were not trained as a historical 'landscape gardener' or contemporary 'landscape architect.'

Her career included commissions to design about 110 gardens for private residences, estates and country homes, public parks, botanic gardens, college campuses, and the White House. Only a few of her major works survive: Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C., the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Garden on Mount Desert, Maine, the restored Farm House Garden in Bar Harbor, the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at the New York Botanical Garden (constructed after Farrand's death, using her original plans, and opened in 1988), and elements of the campuses of Princeton, Yale, and Occidental.Parke, Margaret. \\"A portrait of Beatrix Farrand\\", American Horticulturist, April 1985, pp. 10-13. Farrand was one of the founding eleven members, and the only woman, of the American Society of Landscape Architects. Beatrix Farrand is one of the most accomplished persons, and women, recognized in both the first decades of the landscape architecture profession and the centuries of landscape garden design arts and accomplishments. From Introduction: \\"Beatrix Farrand (1872-1959) was one of America's most celebrated landscape architects. She was renowned for the private estate gardens she designed for the cream of East Coast society as well as for her work as a landscape consultant at some of the country's most prestigious private universities and colleges... Variously praised as 'the Gertrude Jekyll of America' and 'the doyenne of her profession,' Farrand owed her success to her unerring eye for design, profound knowledge of horticulture, phenomenal energy, and deep commitment to her profession that inspired others to follow in her footsteps.\\" Early years Beatrix Cadwalader Jones was born in New York City on June 19, 1872, into a family among whom she liked to claim were \\"five generations of gardeners.\\" Her mother was Mary Cadwalader Rawle (1850‚Äì1923), whose father was lawyer William Henry Rawle (1823‚Äì1889). Her father was Frederic Rhinelander Jones (1846‚Äì1918). She enjoyed long seasons at the family's summer home Reef Point Estate in Mount Desert Island, Maine. She was the niece of Edith WhartonEdith Wharton was the author among other books, of Italian Villas and Their Gardens. and lifelong friend of Henry James, who called her 'Trix'. At age twenty, she was introduced to one of her primary mentors, the botanist Charles Sprague Sargent, who at Harvard University was both a professor of horticulture at the Bussey Institute and the founding director of the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts. Sargent named a species, Crataegus jonesae, in her honor, as it was she who first noticed it and brought it to his attention. Farrand lived at Sargent's home, Holm Lea in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1893 and studied landscape gardening, for which there was no specialized school at the time, botany, and land planning. She wanted to learn drafting to scale, elevation rendering, surveying, and engineering, and so studied at the Columbia School of Mines under the direction of Prof. William Ware. She was influenced in using native plant species from: her many successful Reef Point experiences; studying the contemporary books from the U.S. and abroad advocating the advantages of native palettes; and from visiting the influential British garden authors William Robinson at Gravetye Manor in Sussex, and Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood in Surrey. Jekyll's series of thematic gardening books emphasized the importance and value of natural plantings and were influential in the U.S. On December 17, 1913 Beatrix married Max Farrand, the accomplished historian at Stanford and Yale universities, and the first director of the Huntington Library. Landscape design career Fountain at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C., site of her best known garden design She began practicing landscape architecture in 1895, working from the upper floor of her mother's brownstone house on East Eleventh Street in New York. Since women were excluded from public projects, her first designs were residential gardens, beginning with some for neighbouring Bar Harbor residents. With the help of her mother and with her aunt Edith Wharton's social connections, she was introduced to prominent people, which led to working on a variety of significant projects. Within three years she was so prominent in her field that she was chosen the only woman among the founders of the American Society of Landscape Architects, although she preferred the British term \\"landscape gardener\\". Farrand did the initial site and planting planning for the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. in 1899. In 1912, she designed the walled residential garden, Bellefield, for Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Newbold in Hyde Park, New York (now a part of the Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site). In addition to being the earliest extant example of her residential designs, this exquisite walled garden, now restored, is one of the only known pairings of works by two prominent designers of that era‚ÄîFarrand and the architects McKim, Mead & White ‚Äî who remodeled the Newbolds' eighteenth-century house. She collaborated with the firm of McKim, Mead & White in the construction of service buildings at Dumbarton Oaks. For the White House, the first Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, Ellen Loise Axson Wilson, had commissioned Beatrix Farrand to design the East Colonial Garden (now redesigned as the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden) and the West Garden (now the redesigned White House Rose Garden) in 1913. After Mrs. Wilson's August 1914 death the project languished until the second Mrs. Wilson, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, had its installation restarted and completed in 1916. She received the commission from J. Pierpont Morgan to design the Morgan Library grounds in New York City, and continued as a consultant for thirty years (1913‚Äì43). Dumbarton Oaks site plan Her most notable work was at the Dumbarton Oaks estate in the Georgetown district of Washington, D.C. for Mildred and Robert Woods Bliss (1922‚Äì1940). Her design was inspired by her European ventures, especially from the Italian Renaissance gardens, and consisted of establishing a sophisticated relationship between the architectural and natural environments, with formal terraced gardens stepping down a steep slope and transitioning to a more naturalistic aesthetic approaching the creek. In 1928 her husband accepted the position as the first Director of The Huntington Library (1927‚Äì41) in San Marino, California. They moved to California, but Farrand had trouble building a clientele in that state. William Hertrich had long standing dominion of the Botanical Gardens at the Huntington. The landscape designers Florence Yoch and Louise Council, and Lockwood DeForest Jr., among others, were already well established there. Her few projects came via friends, such as the Bliss winter and retirement estate, Casa Dorinda, in Montecito, California and the patronage of Mildred Bliss's mother, Anna Blakely Bliss, for the nearby Santa Barbara Botanic Garden project. In the Los Angeles area, she had several commissions each with astronomer George Ellery Hale and architect Myron Hunt. With the latter she worked on projects at Occidental College and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Farrand commuted cross-country by train for her eastern projects, such as the design and supervision of the Chinese inspired garden at 'The Eyrie' for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller on Mount Desert Island in Seal Harbor, Maine (1926‚Äì35). This was the era of the automobile, and in her designs Farrand applied principles learned earlier from Frederick Law Olmsted's drives at the Arnold Arboretum and the Biltmore Estate of George Washington Vanderbilt II. John D. Rockefeller, Jr.\\"Mr. Rockefeller's Roads\\" by Ann Rockefeller Roberts and many other sources sought out and funded Farrand to design planting plans for subtle carriage roads at Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, Maine, near her Reef Point home (c.1930). Their use continues at the Park. Extant Farrand private gardens in the eastern U.S. are: the Bliss family's Dumbarton Oaks in Georgetown, Washington, D.C.; the Harkness summer home 'Eolia' in Waterford, Connecticut (1918‚Äì1924), now preserved as the Harkness Memorial State Park; and the Rockefellers' estate 'The Eyrie' in Seal Harbor, Maine. She also collaborated with Edith Wharton on landscape and garden design for The Mount, Wharton's home in Lenox, Massachusetts, which is open to visitors from May‚ÄìOctober. Henry James introduced her to Theodate Pope Riddle, \\"one of her most fascinating clients\\", who owned the estate 'Hill-Stead' (1913), now preserved as the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington, Connecticut. In 1942, with Walter Macomber, she designed the gardens at Green Spring, near Alexandria, Virginia. The Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, for California native plants, represents her talent in Santa Barbara, California. In England, her evolving major project, 'Dartington Hall', was for heiress Dorothy Payne Elmhirst in Devon (1932‚Äì37). The Reef Point Collection of her library, drawings and herbarium specimens are archived in the Environmental Design Archives at the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley (U.C. Berkeley) campus, except for the Dumbarton Oaks documents located at the library there, and the Arnold Arboretum drawings in their archives, both under the stewardship of Harvard. In 2014, Farrand was recognized for her work designing the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at New York Botanical Garden, a winning site of Built by Women New York City, a competition launched by the Beverly Willis Architecture Foundation during the fall of 2014 to identify outstanding and diverse sites and spaces designed, engineered and built by women. College campuses Farrand's campus designs were based on three concepts: plants that bloomed throughout the academic year, emphasizing architecture as well as hiding flaws, and using upright and climbing plants so that the small spaces between buildings would not seem reduced in scale. Her designs are noted for their practicality, simplicity and ease of maintenance. She was the first consulting landscape architect for Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey (1912‚Äì43). As new buildings are constructed at Princeton now, architects are often referred to Farrand's papers at U.C. Berkeley. She was the consulting landscape architect at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut for twenty- three years (1923‚Äì45), with projects including the Marsh Botanical Garden. She later went on to improve a dozen other campuses including the University of Chicago (1929‚Äì43), along with Southern California's Occidental College and the California Institute of Technology. Beatrix Farrand completed design work for the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women (1931‚Äì32). Later she was also the landscape consultant to the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University (1946‚Äì50). Later years and death During the last part of her life Farrand devoted herself to creating a landscape study center at Reef Point, Maine. Here she continued developing the extensive garden and preparing the property for a transition to a public study center. She published the Reef Point Gardens Bulletin (1946‚Äì55) in which she reported on the progress of the gardens and center. After a wildfire on the island and facing a lack of funding to complete and ensure the continued operation of a center she made a remarkable decision in 1955 to discontinue the preparations, dismantle the garden, sell the property, and use the proceeds for her last years. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. purchased all Reef Point's larger plants for his Asticou Azalea Garden in Northeast Harbor, Maine, which continue to flower. Approximately 2000 herbarium specimens were given to the University and Jepson Herbaria at the University of California, Berkeley where they serve as a permanent record of her choice of plants and localities. Farrand lived at and spent the last three years of her life at Garland Farm, the home of her friends Lewis and Amy Magdalene Garland, on Mount Desert Island, Maine. It was here that she created her final garden, an intimate space in keeping with the size of the property. At age 86 Farrand died at the Mount Desert Island Hospital on February 28, 1959. She was interred alongside her husband at Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, New York. The Garland Farm was purchased by the Beatrix Farrand Society on January 9, 2004. The society's mission is \\"to foster the art and science of horticulture and landscape design, with emphasis on the life and work of Beatrix Farrand\\".http://www.beatrixfarrandsociety.org/donate/ It plans to continue Reef Point's original educational mission as well as to preserve Garland Farm and Beatrix Farrand's final garden.

The scope of the profession is broad and can be subdivided into several sub-categories including professional or licensed landscape architects who are regulated by governmental agencies and possess the expertise to design a wide range of structures and landforms for human use; landscape design which is not a licensed profession; site planning; stormwater management; erosion control; environmental restoration; parks, recreation and urban planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private estate and residence landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture may be called a landscape architect, however in jurisdictions where professional licenses are required it is often only those who possess a landscape architect license who can be called a landscape architect. Definition of landscape architecture Landscape architecture is a multi- disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of urban design, architecture, geography, ecology, civil engineering, structural engineering, horticulture, environmental psychology, industrial design, soil sciences, botany, and fine arts. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks; from the design of residential estates to the design of civil infrastructure; and from the management of large wilderness areas to reclamation of degraded landscapes such as mines or landfills. Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces in the landscape aspect of the design ‚Äì large or small, urban, suburban and rural, and with \\"hard\\" (built) and \\"soft\\" (planted) materials, while integrating ecological sustainability. The most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design, organization, and use of spaces. The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan, from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared. They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work. Other skills include preparing design impact assessments, conducting environmental assessments and audits, and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues. The majority of their time will most likely be spent inside an office building designing and preparing models for clients.  Education  Landscape Architects are required to take four to five years of college to get a degree in the field. Must know how to create projects from scratch, such as residential or commercial planting and designing outdoor living spaces.https://study.com/landscape_architect_education.html Are willing to work with others to get a better outcome for the customers when doing a project. Will have to learn the basics of how to create a project on a manner of time and will require to get your license in a certain state to be allowed to work. Landscape Architects will learn how to interact with clients and will learn how to explain a design from scratch when giving the final project.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEWHsuFM9o  History  Orangery at the Palace of Versailles, outside Paris For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and garden design for manor houses, palaces and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by Andr√© Le N√¥tre for King Louis XIV of France at the Palace of Versailles. The first person to write of making a landscape was Joseph Addison in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by Gilbert Laing Meason in 1828, and John Claudius Loudon (1783‚Äì1843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton.London: Longman. The practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term \\"landscape architect\\" was used as a professional title by Frederick Law Olmsted in the United States in 1863 and Andrew Jackson Downing, another early American landscape designer, was editor of The Horticulturist magazine (1846‚Äì52). In 1841 his first book, A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America, was published to a great success; it was the first book of its kind published in the United States. During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect began to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. and Beatrix Jones (later Farrand) with others founded the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) in 1899. IFLA was founded at Cambridge, England, in 1948 with Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe as its first president, representing 15 countries from Europe and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA's Headquarters were established in Versailles.IFLA Past, Present, Future - A publication about the history of IFLA. UNCESCO Documents and Publications Fields of activity Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London, established 1759 The Palm House built 1844‚Äì1848 by Richard Turner to Decimus Burton's designs Urban design in city squares. Water feature in London, by Tadao Ando who also works with landscapes and gardens The variety of the professional tasks that landscape architects collaborate on is very broad, but some examples of project types include: * Parks of general design and public infrastructure * Sustainable development * Stormwater management including rain gardens, green roofs, groundwater recharge, green infrastructure, and constructed wetlands. * Landscape design for educational function and site design for public institutions and government facilities * Parks, botanical gardens, arboretums, greenways, and nature preserves * Recreation facilities, such as playgrounds, golf courses, theme parks and sports facilities * Housing areas, industrial parks and commercial developments * Estate and residence landscape planning and design * Landscaping and accents on highways, transportation structures, bridges, and transit corridors * Contributions to urban design, town and city squares, waterfronts, pedestrian schemes * Natural park, tourist destination, and recreating historical landscapes, and historic garden appraisal and conservation studies * Reservoirs, dams, power stations, reclamation of extractive industry applications or major industrial projects and mitigation * Environmental assessment and landscape assessment, planning advice and land management proposals. * Coastal and offshore developments and mitigation * Ecological design (any aspect of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with natural processes and sustainability) Landscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long-term care and development of the landscape. They often work in forestry, nature conservation and agriculture. Landscape scientists have specialist skills such as soil science, hydrology, geomorphology or botany that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular species in a given area. Landscape planners are concerned with landscape planning for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural, and coastal land use. Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as landscape archaeology or law to the process of landscape planning. Green roof (or more specifically, vegetative roof) designers design extensive and intensive roof gardens for storm water management, evapo-transpirative cooling, sustainable architecture, aesthetics, and habitat creation. Therapeutic/ Healing gardens are also a part of rooftop gardens. These types of gardens have proven to help reduce stress, anxiety, and even help hospital patients recover faster. Plants have always been the center of a landscape design and now with these types of gardens, it is proof that nature is a vital part of the well being of humans. In recent years the need and interest of therapeutic gardens have been increasingly rising. The topic was vastly known and a main reason for this was because there was nothing written on the topic. Recently there has been a lot of research done and published on the topic and as a result, the increase of interest for therapeutic gardens has spiked. Relation to urban planning The combination of the traditional landscape gardening and the emerging city planning combined together gave landscape architecture its unique focus. Frederick Law Olmsted used the term 'landscape architecture' using the word as a profession for the first time when designing the Central Park. Through the 19th century, urban planning became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of landscape gardening and the emerging field of urban planning offered landscape architecture an opportunity to serve these needs.Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., & de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198. In the second half of the century, Frederick Law Olmsted completed a series of parks that continue to have a significant influence on the practices of landscape architecture today. Among these were Central Park in New York City, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York and Boston's Emerald Necklace park system. Jens Jensen designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for Chicago, Illinois, and private estates for the Ford family including Fair Lane and Gaukler Point. One of the original eleven founding members of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA), and the only woman, was Beatrix Farrand. She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: Princeton in Princeton, New Jersey; Yale in New Haven, Connecticut; and the Arnold Arboretum for Harvard in Boston, Massachusetts. Her numerous private estate projects include the landmark Dumbarton Oaks in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C.. Since that time, other architects ‚Äì most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins ‚Äì changed certain elements of the Farrand design. Since this period urban planning has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as civil engineering, architecture and public administration. Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners. Landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Thomas Church was a mid- century landscape architect significant in the profession. Roberto Burle Marx in Brazil combined the International style and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens. Ian McHarg was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture. He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. This system became the foundation of today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc. GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth's surface and is similarly used by urban planners, geographers, forestry and natural resources professionals, etc. Profession In many countries, a professional institute, comprising members of the professional community, exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests, and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture. The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation, with some requiring licensure in order to practice; and some having little or no regulation. In Europe, North America, parts of South America, Australia, India, and New Zealand, landscape architecture is a regulated profession. =Argentina= Since 1889, with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper Carlos Thays, recommended to recreate the National Capital's parks and public gardens, it was consolidated an apprentice and training program in landscaping that eventually became a regulated profession, currently the leading academic institution is the UBA University of Buenos Aires\\"UBA Facultad de Arquitectura, Dise√±o y Urbanismo\\" (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism) offering a Bacherlor's degree in Urban Landscaping Design and Planning, the profession itself is regulated by the National Ministry of Urban Planning of Argentina and the Institute of the Buenos Aires Botanical Garden. =Australia= The Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (AILA) provides accreditation of university degrees and non statutory professional registration for landscape architects. Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title 'Registered Landscape Architect' across the six states and territories within Australia. AILA's system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by the AILA National Office in Canberra. To apply for AILA Registration, an applicant usually needs to satisfy a number of pre-requisites, including university qualification, a minimum number years of practice and a record of professional experience. Landscape Architecture within Australia covers a broad spectrum of planning, design, management, and research. From specialist design services for government and private sector developments through to specialist professional advice as an expert witness. =Canada= In Canada, landscape architecture, like law and medicine, is a self-regulating profession pursuant to provincial statute. For example, Ontario's profession is governed by the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects pursuant to the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act. Landscape architects in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta must complete the specified components of L.A.R.E (Landscape Architecture Registration Examination) as a prerequisite to full professional standing. Provincial regulatory bodies are members of a national organization, the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects / L'Association des Architectes Paysagistes du Canada (CSLA-AAPC), and individual membership in the CSLA-AAPC is obtained through joining one of the provincial or territorial components.Canadian Society of Landscape Architects Official Site - English =Indonesia= ISLA (Indonesia Society of Landscape Architects) is the Indonesian society for professional landscape architects formed on 4 February 1978 and is a member of IFLA APR and IFLA World. The main aim is to increase the dignity of the professional members of landscape architects by increasing their activity role in community service, national and international development. The management of IALI consists of National Administrators who are supported by 20 Regional Administrators (Provincial level) and 3 Branch Managers at city level throughout Indonesia. Landscape architecture education in Indonesia was held in 18 universities, which graduated D3, Bachelor and Magister graduates. The landscape architecture education incorporate in Association of Indonesian Landscape Architecture Education. =Italy= AIAPP (Associazione Italiana Architettura del Paesaggio) is the Italian association of professional landscape architects formed in 1950 and is a member of IFLA and IFLA Europe (formerly known as EFLA). AIAPP is in the process of contesting this new law which has given the Architects' Association the new title of Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners and Conservationists whether or not they have had any training or experience in any of these fields other than Architecture. In Italy, there are several different professions involved in landscape architecture: *Architects *Landscape designers *Doctor landscape agronomists and Doctor landscape foresters, often called Landscape agronomists. *Agrarian Experts and Graduated Agrarian experts. =New Zealand= The New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA) is the professional body for Landscape Architects in NZ www.nzila.co.nz. In April 2013, NZILA jointly with AILA, hosted the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress in Auckland, New Zealand. The World Congress is an international conference where Landscape Architects from all around the globe meet to share ideas around a particular topic. Within NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA. NZILA provides an education policy and an accreditation process to review education programme providers; currently there are three accredited undergraduate Landscape Architecture programmes in New Zealand. Lincoln University also has an accredited masters programme in landscape architecture. = Norway = Landscape architecture in Norway was established in 1919 at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) at √Ös. The Norwegian School of Landscape Architecture at the Faculty of Landscape and Society is responsible for Europe's oldest landscape architecture education on an academic level. The departments areas include design and design of cities and places, garden art history, landscape engineering, greenery, zone planning, site development, place making and place keeping. = South Africa = In May 1962, Joane Pim, Ann Sutton, Peter Leutscher and Roelf Botha (considered the forefathers of the profession in South Africa) established the Institute for Landscape Architects, now known as the Institute for Landscape Architecture in South Africa (ILASA).http://www.ilasa.co.za/ ILASA is a voluntary organisation registered with the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession (SACLAP). It consists of three regional bodies, namely, Gauteng, KwaZula-Natal and the Western Cape. ILASA's mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the institute. ILASA holds the country's membership with The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA). In South Africa, the profession is regulated by SACLAP, established as a statutory council in terms of Section 2 of the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession Act ‚Äì Act 45 of 2000. The Council evolved out of the Board of Control for Landscape Architects (BOCLASA), which functioned under the Council of Architects in terms of The Architectural Act, Act 73 of 1970. SACLAP's mission is to establish, direct, sustain and ensure a high level of professional responsibilities and ethical conduct within the art and science of landscape architecture with honesty, dignity and integrity in the broad interest of public health, safety and welfare of the community. After completion of an accredited under-graduate and/or post-graduate qualification in landscape architecture at either the University of Cape Town or the University of Pretoria, or landscape technology at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, professional registration is attained via a mandatory mentored candidacy period (minimum of two years) and sitting of the professional registration exam. After successfully completing the exam, the individual is entitled to the status of Professional Landscape Architect or Professional Landscape Technologist. =United Kingdom= The UK's professional body is the Landscape Institute (LI). It is a chartered body that accredits landscape professionals and university courses. At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK. Membership of the LI is available to students, academics and professionals, and there are over 3,000 professionally qualified members. The Institute provides services to assist members including support and promotion of the work of landscape architects; information and guidance to the public and industry about the specific expertise offered by those in the profession; and training and educational advice to students and professionals looking to build upon their experience. In 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled \\"I want to be a Landscape Architect\\" to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture. The campaign aimed to raise the profile of landscape architecture and highlight its valuable role in building sustainable communities and fighting climate change. As of July 2018, the \\"I want to be a Landscape Architect\\" initiative was replaced by a brand new careers campaign entitled #ChooseLandscape, which aims to raise awareness of landscape as a profession; improve and increase access to landscape education; and inspire young people to choose landscape as a career. This new campaign includes other landscape-related professions such as landscape management, landscape planning, landscape science and urban design. =United States= In the United States, Landscape Architecture is regulated by individual state governments. For a landscape architect, obtaining licensure requires advanced education and work experience, plus passage of the national examination called The Landscape Architect Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.). Several states require passage of a state exam as well. In the United States licensing is overseen both at the state level, and nationally by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB). Landscape architecture has been identified as an above-average growth profession by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and was listed in U.S. News & World Report's list of Best Jobs to Have in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. The national trade association for United States landscape architects is the American Society of Landscape Architects. Frederic Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park in New York City, is known as the \\"father of American Landscape Architecture.\\"https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/massachusetts_conservation/frederick_law_olmsted.html  Examples  File:Moli√®res (24) Sautet potager (2).JPGPotager in Dordogne, France File:Kloster Bebenhausen Alte Bew√§sserungsgr√§ben.jpgMonastery garden Bebenhausen Abbey in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany File:Arch at entrance to walled kitchen garden - geograph.org.uk - 935467.jpgEntrance to walled Kitchen garden in Norfolk, United Kingdom File:Coulommiers Vue Jardin Medieval.jpgMedieval garden (reconstruction) in √éle-de-France, France File:Saihouji-kokedera01.jpgWoodland in Saih≈ç-ji, Japan File:Shigain- monzeki05s4592.jpgJapanese garden in ≈åtsu, Japan File:Chinese garden.jpgClassical Chinese garden File:Pinjore Gardens at night.jpgGarden lighting in Pinjore, India File:Henckelska g√•rden 3.jpgTopiary in Helsingborg, Sweden File:Crow Asian Sculpture Garden 01.jpgAsian sculpture garden in Texas, United States File:The monolith.JPGVigeland sculpture garden in Oslo, Norway File:Giardini pensili 2.jpgRoof terrace garden (Ventimiglia, Italy) File:El Escorial-Gardens.jpgEscorial Formal palace garden in Madrid, Spain File:Medieval garden of Sainte-Agnes.jpgMediterranean garden in Alpes- Maritimes, France File:Herb Garden - geograph.org.uk - 1404860.jpgHerb garden in Warwickshire, United Kingdom File:Villa la magia 03.JPGUse of steps at Villa la Magia, in Quarrata, Italy File:Lurie Garden in sun.jpgLurie Garden in Chicago, United States, GGN & Piet Oudolf File:High Line Park the new second section.jpgHigh Line (second section) A repurposed area in New York City, United States File:MADRID PARQUE MADRID RIO SOLSTICIO A√ëO 2015 VIEW √ê - panoramio.jpgParque Madrid Rio Formal use of water in Madrid, Spain File:Schouwburgplein Rotterdam DSCF3134.JPGSchouwburgplein Urban park in Rotterdam, Netherlands File:911 Memorial Park.jpg911 Memorial Park A memorial park in New York City United States See also * Energy-efficient landscape design * Environmental graphic design * Green roof * Hard landscape materials * Landscape architecture design competitions * Landscape detailing * Landscape engineering * Landscape products * Landscape urbanism * List of landscape architects * List of schools of landscape architecture * Planting design * Principles of intelligent urbanism * Soft landscape materials * Sustainable landscape architecture * Topocide * Urban forestry * Urban reforestation References External links * Category:Architecture Category:Environmental social science ","title":"Landscape architecture"},{"id":"75289","text":"Super Cub, 2009 The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS or FWS) is an agency of the US federal government within the US Department of the Interior dedicated to the management of fish, wildlife, and natural habitats. The mission of the agency is \\"working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.\\" President Donald Trump nominated Aurelia Skipwith as the agency's director. On December 12, 2019, the United States Senate confirmed her nomination. She previously served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks in the Department of the Interior, with previous experience at Monsanto and her husband's environmental lobbying firm, Gage International. Among the responsibilities of the FWS are enforcing federal wildlife laws; protecting endangered species; managing migratory birds; restoring nationally significant fisheries; conserving and restoring wildlife habitat, such as wetlands; helping foreign governments with their international conservation efforts; and distributing money to states' fish and wildlife agencies through the Wildlife Sport Fish and Restoration Program. Sub-units of the FWS include: * National Wildlife Refuge System‚Äî560 National Wildlife Refuges and thousands of small wetlands and other special management areas covering over 150 million acres (607,000 km¬≤) * Division of Migratory Bird Management * Federal Duck Stamp * National Fish Hatchery System‚Äî70 National Fish Hatcheries and 65 Fish and Wildlife Conservation Offices * Endangered Species program‚Äî86 Ecological Services Field Stations * International Affairs Program * National Conservation Training Center * USFWS Office of Law Enforcement * Clark R. Bavin National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory * Landscape Conservation Cooperatives The vast majority of fish and wildlife habitat is on non-federal state or private land. Therefore, the FWS works closely with private groups such as Partners in Flight and Sport Fishing and Boating Partnership Council to promote voluntary habitat conservation and restoration. The FWS employs approximately 9,000 people and is organized into a central administrative office in Falls Church, Virginia; eight regional offices; and nearly 700 field offices distributed throughout the United States. History FWS patrol vehicles, Alaska 1950 FWS personnel in uniform The FWS originated in 1871 as the United States Commission on Fish and Fisheries, more commonly referred to as the United States Fish Commission, created by the United States Congress with the purpose of studying and recommending solutions to a noted decline in the stocks of food fish. Spencer Fullerton Baird was appointed its first commissioner. In 1903, the Fish Commission was reorganized as the United States Bureau of Fisheries. In 1885‚Äì1886, the Division of Economic Ornithology and Mammalogy (in 1885 it was the Section of Economic Ornithology) was established within the United States Department of Agriculture. In 1896 it became the Division of Biological Feces Survey. Its early work focused on the effect of birds in controlling agricultural pests and mapping the geographical distribution of plants and animals in the United States. Clinton Hart Merriam headed the Bureau for 25 years and became a national figure for improving the scientific understanding of birds and mammals in the United States. Jay Norwood Darling was appointed Chief of the new Bureau of Biological Survey in 1934; the same year Congress passed the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA), one of the oldest federal environmental review statutes.Rosenberg, Ronald H., and Olson, Allen H., Federal Environmental Review Requirements Other than NEPA: The Emerging Challenge (1978). CLEVELAND STATE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 27: 195. 1978] FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. In Faculty Publications. Paper 672. College of William and Mary Law School Under Darling's guidance, the Bureau began an ongoing legacy of protecting vital natural habitat throughout the country. The FWS was created in 1940, when the Bureaus of Fisheries and Biological Survey were combined after being moved to the Department of the Interior. In 1959, the methods used by FWS's Animal Damage Control Program were featured in the Tom Lehrer song \\"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park\\". The FWS governs six US National Monuments: * Hanford Reach National Monument in Washington state; * PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument, a huge maritime area in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands (jointly with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the State of Hawaii); * World War Two Valor in the Pacific National Monument in Alaska, Hawaii and California (jointly managed with the US National Park Service); * Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, the largest marine protected area in the world (in consultation with NOAA); * the Rose Atoll Marine National Monument in American Samoa (with NOAA and the American Samoan Government); and * the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, which includes undersea mud volcanoes, vents, chemosynthetic organisms, and many of the deepest points on Earth (in co- ordination of management with NOAA and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). Tribal relations Pursuant to the eagle feather law, Title 50, Part 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR 22), and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, the US Fish and Wildlife Service administers the National Eagle Repository and the permit system for Native American religious use of eagle feathers. These exceptions often only apply to Native Americans that are registered with the federal government and are enrolled with a federally recognized tribe. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the FWS began to incorporate the research of tribal scientists into conservation decisions. This came on the heels of Native American traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) gaining acceptance in the scientific community as a reasonable and respectable way to gain knowledge of managing the natural world. Additionally, other natural resource agencies within the United States government, such as the USDA, have taken steps to be more inclusive of tribes, native people, and tribal rights.Banegas, Diane, \\"Native American Students Mentored by Forest Service Scientists,\\" US Forest Service (blog), April 5, 2016 (1:00pm), http://blogs.usda.gov/2016/04/05/native-american-students- mentored-by-forest-service-scientists/. This has marked a transition to a relationship of more co-operation rather than the tension between tribes and government agencies seen historically. Today, these agencies work closely with tribal governments to ensure the best conservation decisions are made and that tribes retain their sovereignty .

Like many of Stephenson's novels, it covers history, linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, religion, computer science, politics, cryptography, memetics and philosophy. Stephenson explained the title of the novel in his 1999 essay \\"In the Beginning... Was the Command Line\\" as his term for a particular software failure mode on the early Macintosh computer. Stephenson wrote about the Macintosh that \\"When the computer crashed and wrote gibberish into the bitmap, the result was something that looked vaguely like static on a broken television set‚Äîa 'snow crash' \\". Stephenson has also mentioned that Julian Jaynes' book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind was one of the main influences on Snow Crash. The book presents the Sumerian language as the firmware programming language for the brainstem, which is supposedly functioning as the BIOS for the human brain. According to characters in the book, the goddess Asherah is the personification of a linguistic virus, similar to a computer virus. The god Enki created a counter-program which he called a nam-shub that caused all of humanity to speak different languages as a protection against Asherah (a re- interpretation of the ancient Near Eastern story of the Tower of Babel). Snow Crash was nominated for both the British Science Fiction Award in 1993, and the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1994.  Background  The story opens in Los Angeles in the 21st century, an unspecified number of years after a worldwide economic collapse. Los Angeles is no longer part of the United States, since the federal government has ceded most of its power and territory to private organizations and entrepreneurs.\\"Snow Crash depicts a twenty-first-century America in which the needs of entrepreneurs have won out over hopes of a free and egalitarian society.\\" Rorty, Achieving Our Country, 4. Franchising, individual sovereignty, and private vehicles reign supreme. Mercenary armies compete for national defense contracts while private security guards preserve the peace in sovereign, gated housing developments. Highway companies compete to attract drivers to their roads and all mail delivery is by hired courier. The remnants of government maintain authority only in isolated compounds where they do tedious make-work that is, by and large, irrelevant to the society around them. Much of the world's territory has been carved up into sovereign enclaves, each run by its own big business franchise (such as \\"Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong\\", or the corporatized American Mafia), or various residential burbclaves ‚Äî quasi-sovereign gated communities. This arrangement resembles anarcho-capitalism, a theme Stephenson carries over to his next novel The Diamond Age. As described in both novels, and the short story \\"The Great Simoleon Caper\\" (1995), hyperinflation has sapped the value of the US dollar to the extent that trillion dollar bills‚ÄîEd Meeses‚Äîare nearly disregarded and the quadrillion dollar note‚Äîthe Gipper‚Äîis the standard \\"small\\" bill. This hyperinflation was created by the government overprinting money, due to loss of tax revenue, as people increasingly began to use electronic currency which they exchanged in untaxable encrypted online transactions. For physical transactions, most people resort to alternative currencies such as yen or \\"Kongbucks\\" (the official currency of Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong). Hyperinflation has also negatively affected much of the rest of the world (with some exceptions like Japan), resulting in waves of desperate refugees from Asia who cross the Pacific in rickety ships hoping to arrive in North America. The Metaverse, a phrase coined by Stephenson as a successor to the Internet, constitutes Stephenson's vision of how a virtual reality‚Äìbased Internet might evolve in the near future. Resembling a massively multiplayer online game (MMO), the Metaverse is populated by user-controlled avatars as well as system daemons. Although there are public-access Metaverse terminals in Reality, using them carries a social stigma among Metaverse denizens, in part because of the poor visual representations of themselves as low-quality avatars. Status in the Metaverse is a function of two things: access to restricted environments such as the Black Sun, an exclusive Metaverse club, and technical acumen, which is often demonstrated by the sophistication of one's avatar.  Plot summary  Hiro Protagonist is a hacker and pizza delivery driver for the Mafia. He meets Y.T. (short for Yours Truly), a young skateboard Kourier (courier) who refers to herself in the third person, during a failed attempt to make a delivery on time. Y.T. completes the delivery on his behalf and they strike up a partnership, gathering intel and selling it to the CIC, the for-profit organization that evolved from the CIA's merger with the Library of Congress. Within the Metaverse, Hiro is offered a datafile named Snow Crash by a man named Raven who hints that it is a form of narcotic. Hiro's friend and fellow hacker Da5id views a bitmap image contained in the file which causes his computer to crash and Da5id to suffer brain damage in the real world. Hiro meets his ex-girlfriend Juanita Marquez, who gives him a database containing a large amount of research compiled by her associate, Lagos. This research posits connections between the virus, ancient Sumerian culture, and the legend of Tower of Babel. Juanita advises him to be careful and disappears. The Mafia boss Uncle Enzo begins to take a paternal interest in Y.T. Impressed by her attitude and initiative, he arranges to meet her and offers her freelance jobs. Hiro's investigations and Y.T.'s intelligence gathering begin to coincide, with links between the neuro-linguistic viruses, a religious organization known as Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates and a media magnate named L. Bob Rife beginning to emerge. Lagos's research showed that the ancient Sumerian ur-language allowed brain function to be 'programmed' using audio stimuli in conjunction with a DNA altering virus. Sumerian culture was organized around these programs (known as me) which were administered by priests to the populace. Enki, a figure of legend, developed a counter-virus (known as the nam-shub of Enki) which when delivered stopped the Sumerian language from being processed by the brain and led to the development of other, less literal languages, giving birth to the Babel myth. L. Bob Rife had been collecting Sumerian artifacts and developed the drug Snow Crash in order to make the public vulnerable to new forms of me which he would control. The physical form of the virus is distributed in the form of an addictive drug and within Reverend Wayne's church via infected blood. There is also a digital version to which hackers are especially vulnerable as they are accustomed to processing information in binary form. Hiro heads north to where the Raft, a huge collection of boats containing Eurasian refugees, is approaching the American coast. The center of the Raft is L Bob Rife's yacht, formerly the USS Enterprise nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. Rife has been using the Raft as a mechanism to indoctrinate and infect thousands with the virus and to import it to America. Y.T. is captured and brought to Rife on the Raft, who intends to use her as a hostage, knowing her connection to Uncle Enzo. With help from the Mafia, Hiro makes it onto the raft and recovers the nam-shub of Enki which Rife had been concealing. With help from Juanita who had previously infiltrated the Raft, the nam-shub is read out and Rife's control over the Raft is broken. Rife flees the Raft, taking Y.T., and Raven attempts to activate the digital form of Snow Crash at a virtual concert within the Metaverse. Hiro is able to neutralize the virus and Y.T. escapes. After a confrontation with the Mafia, Raven is injured, and Rife is killed as he attempts to flee on his private jet. Y.T. is reunited with her mother and Hiro and Juanita appear reconciled.  Characteristic technologies  Various technologies are employed in this fictional world, and help define it. Among these are: = Rat Things = Rat Things, also known as semi-autonomous guard units, are cybernetic personal defensive guards found in and around Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong. Engineered from pit bull terriers surgically augmented with cybernetic components, Rat Things are named for their long, flexible tails. Rat Things were invented by Mr. Ng, of Ng Security Industries, who was severely handicapped after a helicopter accident in Vietnam. Like the Rat Things, Mr. Ng is also a cyborg. Rat Things remember their previous lives as dogs. They can also communicate with other Rat Things by \\"barking\\" in the Metaverse. Although their minds are largely controlled by their implants, they can sometimes act independently of their programming. When in the Metaverse and not performing guard duties, Rat Things experience running on endless beaches, playing in the surf, eating steaks that grow on trees, and blood- drenched Frisbees floating around, waiting to be caught. Like other technology in Snow Crash, Rat Things are powered by a nuclear isotope battery, which requires extensive cooling due to the massive amount of waste heat generated. The Rat Things are passively cooled by a system of heat sinks that are only effective when the Rat Thing runs fast enough to move ambient air across the fins. To prevent rapid overheating when stationary, they must remain in their hutches (effectively dog houses), where they are continuously sprayed by jets of refrigerant. Through running, Rat Things are capable of breaking the sound barrier (about 768 mph at sea level), although this is not typically permitted by Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong's \\"good neighbor\\" policies due to noise reasons. Because they must be either moving at high velocities or actively cooling in their hutches, Rat Things are rarely seen by human eyes and few people know what they look like. =Smartwheels= A fictional type of wheel used on skateboards and advanced motorcycles. They consist of small segments of contact surface mounted on telescoping spokes, allowing the wheel to take the shape of cracks, curbs, and bumps. They have a passing mention in The Diamond Age as being used on a wheelchair belonging to a minor character.Note:Arthur C. Clarke's version of adaptive wheels are utilized by the lunar transport which shuttles Dr. Heywood Floyd to the site where the Tycho Magnetic Anomaly TMA-1 was excavated on the moon. =Reason= Reason is a railgun in a rotary cannon configuration which fires depleted uranium flechettes. It is mounted to a large, wheeled ammunition box and is equipped with a harness for user comfort, a nuclear battery pack, and a water-cooled heat exchanger. The weapon, created by Ng, was still in beta testing, and suffers a software crash during a battle, resulting in the death of its user. Hiro is later able to apply a firmware update, and uses it until its ammunition supply is depleted. It bears, in inscription on its nameplate, the Latin phrase Ultima Ratio Regum, \\"the last argument of kings\\". = Metaverse = The Metaverse is a collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet. The word metaverse combines the prefix \\"meta\\" (meaning \\"beyond\\") with \\"universe\\" and is typically used to describe the concept of a future iteration of the internet, made up of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces linked into a perceived virtual universe. Stephenson's Metaverse appears to its users as an urban environment, developed along a single hundred-meter-wide road, the Street, that runs the entire 65536 km (216 km) circumference of a featureless, black, perfectly spherical planet. The virtual real estate is owned by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, a fictional part of the real Association for Computing Machinery, and is available to be bought and buildings developed thereupon. Users of the Metaverse gain access to it through personal terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality display onto goggles worn by the user, or from low-quality public terminals in booths (with the penalty of presenting a grainy black and white appearance). Stephenson also describes a sub-culture of people choosing to remain continuously connected to the Metaverse by wearing portable terminals, goggles and other equipment; they are given the sobriquet \\"gargoyles\\" due to their grotesque appearance. The users of the Metaverse experience it from a first person perspective. Within the Metaverse, individual users appear as avatars of any form, with the sole restriction of height, \\"to prevent people from walking around a mile high\\". Transport within the Metaverse is limited to analogs of reality by foot or vehicle, such as the monorail that runs the entire length of the Street, stopping at 256 Express Ports, located evenly at 256 km intervals, and Local Ports, one kilometer apart.  Literary significance and criticism  Snow Crash established Stephenson as a major science fiction writer of the 1990s. The book appeared on Time magazine's list of 100 all-time best English-language novels written since 1923. Some critics have considered it a parody of cyberpunk and mentioned its satiric or absurdist humor. In his book The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the End of History, Walter Benn Michaels targets Stephenson's view that \\"languages are codes\\" rather than a grouping of letters and sounds to be interpreted. Michaels contends that this basic idea of language as code is central to the construct of Snow Crash (\\"... a good deal of Snow Crash's plot depends upon eliding the distinction between hackers and their computers, as if‚Äîindeed, in the novel, just because‚Äîlooking at code will do to the hacker what receiving it will do to the computer\\"), but at the same time, trivializes the role of meaning in linguistic works. In this respect, Stephenson's views are not shared with other contemporary writers such as Bret Easton Ellis, Kathy Acker, Octavia Butler, Paul de Man and Richard Rorty (with respect to the latter's literary criticism). In contrast, it uniquely risks developing a racialized view of culture. Because \\"in Snow Crash, the bodies of humans are affected by \\"information\\" they can't read; the virus, like the icepick [in American Psycho], gets the words inside you even if you haven't read them,\\" culture is not transmitted by beliefs and practices, but rather by physical characteristics, such as blood (or genetic codes). Rorty's Achieving Our Country uses Snow Crash as an example of modern culture that \\"express the loss of what he [Rorty] calls \\"national hope\\"...the problem with Snow Crash is not that it isn't true‚Äîafter all, it's a story‚Äîbut that it isn't inspirational.\\" This lack of inspiration is offset by something else Snow Crash and other works like it offer: \\"These books produce in their readers the 'state of soul' that Rorty calls 'knowingness,' which he glosses as a 'preference for knowledge over hope' (37)\\"; this preference for knowledge \\"contribute[s] to a more fundamental failure to appreciate the value of inspiration‚Äîand hence of literature‚Äîitself.\\" = Influence on the World Wide Web and computing = While the 1986 virtual environment Habitat applied the Sanskrit term avatar to online virtual bodies before Stephenson, the success of Snow Crash popularized the termA Beginner's Web Glossary to the extent that avatar is now the accepted term for this concept in computer games and on the World Wide Web. Many virtual globe programs, including NASA World Wind and Google Earth, bear a resemblance to the \\"Earth\\" software developed by the Central Intelligence Corporation in Snow Crash. One Google Earth co-founder claimed that Google Earth was modeled after Snow Crash, while another co-founder said it was inspired by Powers of Ten.Avi Bar-Ze‚Äôev (from Keyhole, the precursor to Google Earth) on origin of Google Earth Stephenson himself has commented on the legacy of his \\"Earth\\" program's god's-eye aesthetic in his novel Reamde, in which his protagonist, a game designer, steals the technique from Google Earth: Stephenson's concept of the Metaverse has enjoyed continued popularity and strong influence in high-tech circles (especially Silicon Valley) ever since the publication of Snow Crash. This article was published in print on page 11 of the Economist's technology quarterly special section, which ran in the center pages of the printed issue dated 3 October 2020. As a result, Stephenson has become \\"a sought-after futurist\\" and has worked as a futurist for Blue Origin and more recently, Magic Leap. Software developer Michael Abrash was inspired by Snow Crash's Metaverse and its networked 3D world. He left Microsoft for Id Software to write something in that direction, the result being Quake. The story for the 3DO game Immercenary was also heavily influenced by Snow Crash. A direct video game adaptation of Snow Crash was in development in 1996, but it was never released. The online virtual worlds Active Worlds and Second Life were both directly inspired by the Metaverse in Snow Crash. Former Microsoft Chief Technology Officer J Allard and former Xbox Live Development Manager Boyd Multerer claimed to have been heavily inspired by Snow Crash in the development of Xbox Live, and that it was a mandatory read for the Xbox development team. = Possible film or television adaptation = The novel was optioned shortly after its publication and subsequent success, although to date it has never progressed past pre-production. American-Canadian science fiction director Vincenzo Natali in particular has remarked against a two-hour feature film adaptation because of a perceived lack of fit with the form; inasmuch as the novel is \\"tonally all over the place\\", he feels that a mini-series would be a more suitable format for the material. In late 1996, it was announced that writer-director Jeffrey Nachmanoff would adapt the novel for The Kennedy/Marshall Company and Touchstone Pictures. Marco Brambilla was attached to direct the film. In June 2012, it was announced that English director Joe Cornish, following his 2011 debut film Attack the Block, had been signed as director of a future film adaptation for Paramount Studios. In 2013, Stephenson described Cornish's script as \\"amazing\\", but also warned that there was no guarantee that a film would be made. In July 2016, producer Frank Marshall said that filming could start in 2017. In August 2017, Amazon Studios announced that it was co- producing an hour-long science fiction drama television show based on Snow Crash with Paramount. The television show will be executive produced by Cornish and the Kennedy/Marshall Company's Frank Marshall.Amazon Increases Production Spending for 2018, Developing Three New Sci-Fi Series, Variety, September 28, 2017 In December 2019, it was announced that HBO Max had acquired the series with Paramount continuing to produce and Cornish remaining executive producer.‚ÄòSnow Crash‚Äô TV Series Adaptation From Michael Bacall & Joe Cornish In Works At HBO Max From Paramount TV, Deadline Hollywood, December 13, 2019  See also  * Distributed republic, form of government used by Stephenson in this and other works * Neurotheology * Videodrome (1983) * Neuromancer (1984) * \\"BLIT\\" (1988)  References   Further reading  *  External links  * Category:Novels by Neal Stephenson Category:1992 American novels Category:Fictional cyborgs Category:Fictional medicines and drugs Category:Fictional diseases and disorders Category:Fictional illeists Category:Postcyberpunk novels Category:Cyberpunk novels Category:1992 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Anarchist fiction Category:Texts related to the history of the Internet Category:Novels about computing Category:Novels about virtual reality Category:Fictional cults Category:Novels set in Los Angeles Category:Religion in science fiction Category:Novels about the Internet Category:Malware in fiction Category:Works about computer hacking ","title":"Snow Crash"},{"id":"75292","text":"AFS is an acronym that may refer to: Computing * Andrew File System, a distributed networked file system  OpenAFS, an open source implementation of the Andrew File System * Apple File Service, implementing the Apple Filing Protocol, * Apple File System, Apple's proprietary file system. * AtheOS File System, part of the Syllable operating system Education * AFS Intercultural Programs, formerly American Field Service * Abington Friends School, in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, United States Military * Army Fire Service, UK * Air force station Places * Afs, Idlib, a Syrian village Other * Aeronautical Fixed Service, for air navigation * Afghan afghani, unit of currency * Afro-Seminole Creole language, ISO 639-3 code * AFS Trinity Power Corporation, US * Allergic fungal sinusitis * Alternative financial service * Alternative for Sweden, a political party in Sweden * American Folklore Society * American Foundry Society * Ashford (Surrey) railway station, Middlesex, UK, station code * Association of Football Statisticians, UK * Atomic fluorescence spectroscopy * Australian Flag Society * Auxiliary Fire Service, UK and Ireland * Available for sale, an accounting term * International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships, 2001 * Nikon AF-S, a type of Nikon F-mount lens * Aspergers For Stocks (AFS) * Apley Farm Shop (AFS) *Aqua Filling System (AFS) Single point battery filling system by Philadelphia Scientific Limited.

19 January 1200 ‚Äì 22 September 1253), also known as D≈çgen Kigen (ÈÅìÂÖÉÂ∏åÁéÑ), Eihei D≈çgen (Ê∞∏Âπ≥ÈÅìÂÖÉ), K≈çso J≈çy≈ç Daishi (È´òÁ•ñÊâøÈôΩÂ§ßÂ∏´), or Bussh≈ç Dent≈ç Kokushi (‰ªèÊÄß‰ºùÊù±ÂõΩÂ∏´), was a Japanese Buddhist priest, writer, poet, philosopher, and founder of the S≈çt≈ç school of Zen in Japan. Originally ordained as a monk in the Tendai School in Kyoto, he was ultimately dissatisfied with its teaching and traveled to China to seek out what he believed to be a more authentic Buddhism. He remained there for five years, finally training under Tiantong Rujing, an eminent teacher of the Chinese Caodong lineage. Upon his return to Japan, he began promoting the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) through literary works such as Fukan zazengi and Bend≈çwa. He eventually broke relations completely with the powerful Tendai School, and, after several years of likely friction between himself and the establishment, left Kyoto for the mountainous countryside where he founded the monastery Eihei-ji, which remains the head temple of the S≈çt≈ç school today. D≈çgen is known for his extensive writing including his most famous work, the collection of 95 essays called the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, but also Eihei K≈çroku, a collection of his talks, poetry, and commentaries, and Eihei Shingi, the first Zen monastic code written in Japan, among others. Biography =Early life= D≈çgen was probably born into a noble family, though as an illegitimate child of Minamoto Michitomo, who served in the imperial court as a high-ranking . His mother is said to have died when D≈çgen was age 7. =Early training= At some later point, D≈çgen became a low-ranking monk on Mount Hiei, the headquarters of the Tendai school of Buddhism. According to the Kenzeiki (Âª∫ÊíïË®ò), he became possessed by a single question with regard to the Tendai doctrine: This question was, in large part, prompted by the Tendai concept of original enlightenment (Êú¨Ë¶ö hongaku), which states that all human beings are enlightened by nature and that, consequently, any notion of achieving enlightenment through practice is fundamentally flawed. The Kenzeiki further states that he found no answer to his question at Mount Hiei, and that he was disillusioned by the internal politics and need for social prominence for advancement. Therefore, D≈çgen left to seek an answer from other Buddhist masters. He went to visit K≈çin, the Tendai abbot of Onj≈ç- ji Temple (ÂúíÂüéÂØ∫), asking him this same question. K≈çin said that, in order to find an answer, he might want to consider studying Ch√°n in China.Tanahashi 4 In 1217, two years after the death of contemporary Zen Buddhist My≈çan Eisai, D≈çgen went to study at Kennin-ji Temple (Âª∫‰ªÅÂØ∫), under Eisai's successor, My≈çzen (ÊòéÂÖ®). =Travel to China= In 1223, D≈çgen and My≈çzen undertook the dangerous passage across the East China Sea to China to study in Jing-de-si (Ching-te- ssu, ÊôØÂæ∑ÂØ∫) monastery as Eisai had once done. In China, D≈çgen first went to the leading Chan monasteries in Zh√®jiƒÅng province. At the time, most Chan teachers based their training around the use of g≈çng-√†ns (Japanese: k≈çan). Though D≈çgen assiduously studied the k≈çans, he became disenchanted with the heavy emphasis laid upon them, and wondered why the sutras were not studied more. At one point, owing to this disenchantment, D≈çgen even refused Dharma transmission from a teacher.Tanahashi p.5 Then, in 1225, he decided to visit a master named R√∫j√¨ng (Â¶ÇÊ∑®; J. Ny≈çjo), the thirteenth patriarch of the C√°od√≤ng (J. S≈çt≈ç) lineage of Zen Buddhism, at Mount TiƒÅnt√≥ng (Â§©Á´•Â±± TiƒÅnt√≥ngshƒÅn; J. Tend≈çzan) in N√≠ngb≈ç. Rujing was reputed to have a style of Chan that was different from the other masters whom D≈çgen had thus far encountered. In later writings, D≈çgen referred to Rujing as \\"the Old Buddha\\". Additionally he affectionately described both Rujing and My≈çzen as . Under Rujing, D≈çgen realized liberation of body and mind upon hearing the master say, \\"Cast off body and mind\\" (Ë∫´ÂøÉËÑ±ËêΩ shƒìn xƒ´n tu≈ç lu√≤). This phrase would continue to have great importance to D≈çgen throughout his life, and can be found scattered throughout his writings, as‚Äîfor example‚Äîin a famous section of his \\"Genj≈çk≈çan\\" (ÁèæÊàêÂÖ¨Ê°à): My≈çzen died shortly after D≈çgen arrived at Mount Tiantong. In 1227,Tanahashi 6 D≈çgen received Dharma transmission and inka from Rujing, and remarked on how he had finally settled his \\"life's quest of the great matter\\". =Return to Japan= D≈çgen watching the moon. H≈çky≈çji monastery, Fukui prefecture, circa 1250. D≈çgen returned to Japan in 1227 or 1228, going back to stay at Kennin-ji, where he had trained previously. Among his first actions upon returning was to write down the Fukan Zazengi (ÊôÆË¶≥ÂùêÁ¶ÖÂÑÄ; \\"Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen\\"), a short text emphasizing the importance of and giving instructions for zazen, or sitting meditation. However, tension soon arose as the Tendai community began taking steps to suppress both Zen and J≈çdo Shinsh≈´, the new forms of Buddhism in Japan. In the face of this tension, D≈çgen left the Tendai dominion of Ky≈çto in 1230, settling instead in an abandoned temple in what is today the city of Uji, south of Ky≈çto.Tanahashi 39 In 1233, D≈çgen founded the Kannon-d≈çri-inTanahashi 7 in Fukakusa as a small center of practice. He later expanded this temple into K≈çsh≈çh≈çrin-ji (ËààËÅñÊ≥ïÊûóÂØ∫). =Eihei-ji= In 1243, Hatano Yoshishige (Ê≥¢Â§öÈáéÁæ©Èáç) offered to relocate D≈çgen's community to Echizen province, far to the north of Ky≈çto. D≈çgen accepted because of the ongoing tension with the Tendai community, and the growing competition of the Rinzai- school. His followers built a comprehensive center of practice there, calling it Daibutsu Temple (Daibutsu-ji, Â§ß‰ªèÂØ∫). While the construction work was going on, D≈çgen would live and teach at Yoshimine-dera Temple (Kipp≈ç-ji, ÂêâÂ≥ØÂØ∫), which is located close to Daibutsu-ji. During his stay at Kipp≈ç-ji, D≈çgen \\"fell into a depression\\". It marked a turning point in his life, giving way to \\"rigorous critique of Rinzai Zen\\". He criticized Dahui Zonggao, the most influential figure of Song Dynasty Ch√°n. In 1246, D≈çgen renamed Daibutsu-ji, calling it Eihei-ji. This temple remains one of the two head temples of S≈çt≈ç Zen in Japan today, the other being S≈çji-ji. D≈çgen spent the remainder of his life teaching and writing at Eihei-ji. In 1247, the newly installed sh≈çgun's regent, H≈çj≈ç Tokiyori, invited D≈çgen to come to Kamakura to teach him. D≈çgen made the rather long journey east to provide the sh≈çgun with lay ordination, and then returned to Eihei-ji in 1248. In the autumn of 1252, D≈çgen fell ill, and soon showed no signs of recovering. He presented his robes to his main apprentice, Koun Ej≈ç (Â≠§Èõ≤ÊáêÂºâ), making him the abbot of Eihei-ji. =Death= At Hatano Yoshishige's invitation, D≈çgen left for Ky≈çto in search of a remedy for his illness. In 1253, soon after arriving in Ky≈çto, D≈çgen died. Shortly before his death, he had written a death poem: Fifty-four years lighting up the sky. A quivering leap smashes a billion worlds. Hah! Entire body looks for nothing. Living, I plunge into Yellow Springs.Quoted in Tanahashi, 219 Miraculous events and auspicious signs Several \\"miraculous experiences\\" and \\"auspicious signs\\" have been recorded in D≈çgen's life, some of them quite famous. According to Bodiford, \\"Monks and laymen recorded these events as testaments to his great mystical power,\\" which \\"helped confirm the legacy of D≈çgen's teachings against competing claims made by members of the Buddhist establishment and other outcast groups.\\" Bodiford further notes that the \\"magical events at Eiheiji helped identify the temple as a cultic center,\\" putting it at a par with other temples where supernatural events occurred. According to Faure, for D≈çgen these auspicious signs were proof that \\"Eiheiji was the only place in Japan where the Buddhist Dharma was transmitted correctly and that this monastery was thus rivaled by no other.\\" In Menzan Zuih≈ç's well-known 1753 edition of D≈çgen's biography, it records that while traveling in China with his companion D≈çsh≈ç, D≈çgen became very ill, and a deity appeared before him who gave him medicine which instantly healed him: This medicine, which later became known as Gedokuen or \\"Poison-Dispelling Pill\\" was then produced by the S≈çt≈ç church until the Meiji Era, and was commonly sold nationwide as an herbal medicine, and became a source of income for the S≈çt≈ç church. The statue memorializing D≈çgen's vision of Avalokiteshvara at a pond in Eihei-ji, Japan. Another famous incident happened when he was returning to Japan from China. The ship he was on was caught in a storm. In this instance, the storm became so severe, that the crew feared the ship would sink and kill them all. D≈çgen then began leading the crew in recitation of chants to Kannon (Avalokiteshwara), during which, the Bodhisattva appeared before him, and several of the crew saw her as well. After the vision appeared, the storm began to calm down, and consensus of those aboard was that they had been saved due to the intervention of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara. This story is repeated in official works sponsored by the S≈çt≈ç Sh≈´ Head Office and there is even a sculpture of the event in a water treatment pond in Eihei-ji Temple. Additionally, there is a 14th-century copy of a painting of the same Kannon, that was supposedly commissioned by D≈çgen, that includes a piece of calligraphy that is possibly an original in D≈çgen's own hand, recording his gratitude to Avalokiteshwara: Another miraculous event occurred, while D≈çgen was at Eihei-ji. During a ceremony of gratitude for the 16 Celestial Arahants (called Rakan in Japanese), a vision of 16 Arahants appeared before D≈çgen descending upon a multi-colored cloud, and the statues of the Arahants that were present at the event began to emanate rays of light, to which D≈çgen then exclaimed: D≈çgen was profoundly moved by the entire experience, and took it as an auspicious sign that the offerings of the ceremony had been accepted. In his writings he wrote: D≈çgen is also recorded to have had multiple encounters with non-human beings. Aside from his encounter with the kami Inari in China, in the Denk≈çrou it is recorded that while at K≈çsh≈ç-ji, he was also visited by a deva who came to observe during certain ceremonies, as well as a dragon who visited him at Eihei-Ji and requested to be given the eight abstinence Precepts: Teachings =Zazen= D≈çgen often stressed the critical importance of zazen, or sitting meditation as the central practice of Buddhism. He considered zazen to be identical to studying Zen. This is pointed out clearly in the first sentence of the 1243 instruction manual \\"Zazen-gi\\" (ÂùêÁ¶™ÂÑÄ; \\"Principles of Zazen\\"): \\"Studying Zen ... is zazen\\".Principles of Zazen ; tr. Bielefeldt, Carl. D≈çgen taught zazen to everyone, even for the laity, male or female and including all social classes. In referring to zazen, D≈çgen is most often referring specifically to shikantaza, roughly translatable as \\"nothing but precisely sitting\\", or \\"just sitting,\\" which is a kind of sitting meditation in which the meditator sits \\"in a state of brightly alert attention that is free of thoughts, directed to no object, and attached to no particular content\\". In his Fukan Zazengi, D≈çgen wrote: D≈çgen called this zazen practice \\"without thinking\\" (hi-shiryo) in which one is simply aware of things as they are, beyond thinking and not-thinking - the active effort not to think. The correct mental attitude for zazen according to D≈çgen is one of effortless non- striving, this is because for D≈çgen, enlightenment is already always present. Further, D≈çgen frequently distanced himself from more syncretic Buddhist practices at the time, including those of his contemporary Eisai. In the Bendowa, D≈çgen writes: =Oneness of practice-enlightenment= The primary concept underlying D≈çgen's Zen practice is \\"oneness of practice-enlightenment\\" (‰øÆË≠â‰∏ÄÂ¶Ç shush≈ç-itt≈ç / shush≈ç-ichinyo). For D≈çgen, the practice of zazen and the experience of enlightenment were one and the same. This point was succinctly stressed by D≈çgen in the Fukan Zazengi, the first text that he composed upon his return to Japan from China: Earlier in the same text, the basis of this identity is explained in more detail: The \\"oneness of practice-enlightenment\\" was also a point stressed in the Bend≈çwa (ÂºÅÈÅìË©± \\"A Talk on the Endeavor of the Path\\") of 1231: =Buddha-nature= For D≈çgen, Buddha-nature or Bussh≈ç (‰ΩõÊÄß) is the nature of reality and all Being. In the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, D≈çgen writes that \\"whole-being is the Buddha-nature\\" and that even inanimate things (grass, trees, etc.) are an expression of Buddha-nature. He rejected any view that saw Buddha-nature as a permanent, substantial inner self or ground. D≈çgen held that Buddha-nature was \\"vast emptiness\\", \\"the world of becoming\\" and that \\"impermanence is in itself Buddha-nature\\".Dumoulin 82, 85 According to D≈çgen: > Therefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is > the Buddha nature. The very impermanency of men and things, body and mind, > is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains and rivers, are > impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete > enlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.Dumoulin 85 =Time-Being= D≈çgen's conception of Being-Time or Time-Being (Uji, ÊúâÊôÇ) is an essential element of his metaphysics in the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç. According to the traditional interpretation, \\"Uji\\" here means time itself is being, and all being is time.\\"\\"Uji: The Time-Being by Eihei Dogen\\" Translated by Dan Welch and Kazuaki Tanahashi from: The Moon in a Dewdrop; writings of Zen Master Dogen Uji is all the changing and dynamic activities that exist as the flow of becoming, all beings in the entire world are time.Dumoulin 89 The two terms are thus spoken of concurrently to emphasize that the things are not to be viewed as separate concepts. Moreover, the aim is to not abstract time and being as rational concepts. This view has been developed by scholars such as Steven Heine,Existential and Ontological Dimensions of Time in Heidegger and Dogen, SUNY Press, Albany 1985 Joan StambaughImpermanence is Buddha-Nature: Dogen's Understanding of Temporality, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu 1990 and others and has served as a motivation to compare D≈çgen's work to that of Martin Heidegger's \\"Dasein\\". Recently, however, Rein Raud has argued that this view is not correct and that D≈çgen asserts that all existence is momentary, showing that such a reading would make quite a few of the rather cryptic passages in the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç quite lucid.Raud, Rein. \\"The Existential Moment: Re-reading D≈çgen's theory of time\\". Philosophy East and West, vol.62 No.2, April 2012 =Perfect expression= Another essential element of D≈çgen's 'performative' metaphysics is his conception of Perfect expression (D≈çtoku, ÈÅìÂæó).Cf. Kim (2004) and more systematically based on a theory of symbols M√ºller (2013); reviewed by Steffen D√∂ll in Philosophy East & West Volume 65, Number 2 April 2015 636‚Äì639. \\"While a radically critical view on language as soteriologically inefficient, if not positively harmful, is what Zen Buddhism is famous for,\\"D√∂ll (2015), p. 637 it can be argued \\"'within the framework of a rational theory of language, against an obscurantist interpretation of Zen that time and again invokes experience.'\\"M√ºller (2013), p. 25 cited after D√∂ll (2015), p. 637 D≈çgen distinguishes two types of language: monji ÊñáÂ≠ó, the first, ‚Äì after Ernst Cassirer ‚Äì \\"discursive type that constantly structures our experiences and‚Äîmore fundamentally‚Äîin fact produces the world we experience in the first place\\"; and d≈çtoku ÈÅìÂæó, the second, \\"presentative type, which takes a holistic stance and establishes the totality of significations through a texture of relations.\\".D√∂ll (2015), 637, cf. M√ºller (2013), p. 231. As D√∂ll points out, \\"It is this second type, as M√ºller holds, that allows for a positive view of language even from the radically skeptical perspective of D≈çgen‚Äôs brand of Zen Buddhism.\\"D√∂ll (2015), p. 637. =Critique of Rinzai= D≈çgen was sometimes critical of the Rinzai school for their formulaic and intellectual koan practice (such as the practice of the Shiryoken or \\"Four Discernments\\")Dumoulin 65 as well as for their disregard for the sutras: > Recently in the great Sung dynasty of China there are many who call > themselves \\"Zen masters\\". They do not know the length and breadth of the > Buddha-Dharma. They have heard and seen but little. They memorize two or > three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men and think this is the whole way of the > Buddha-Dharma. If the Dharma of the Buddha could be condensed in two or > three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men, it would not have been transmitted to > the present day. One can hardly say that Lin Chi and Yun Men are the > Venerable ones of the Buddha-Dharma. D≈çgen was also very critical of the Japanese Daruma school of Dainichi N≈çnin. =Virtues= Dogen's perspective of virtue is discussed in the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç text as something to be practiced inwardly so that it will manifest itself on the outside. In other words, virtue is something that is both internal and external in the sense that one can practice internal good dispositions and also the expression of these good dispositions. Writings Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen (ÊôÆÂãßÂùêÁ¶ÖÂÑÄ, fukan zazengi) While it was customary for Buddhist works to be written in Chinese, D≈çgen often wrote in Japanese, conveying the essence of his thought in a style that was at once concise, compelling, and inspiring. A master stylist, D≈çgen is noted not only for his prose, but also for his poetry (in Japanese waka style and various Chinese styles). D≈çgen's use of language is unconventional by any measure. According to D≈çgen scholar Steven Heine: \\"Dogen's poetic and philosophical works are characterized by a continual effort to express the inexpressible by perfecting imperfectable speech through the creative use of wordplay, neologism, and lyricism, as well as the recasting of traditional expressions\\". =Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç= D≈çgen's masterpiece is the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, talks and writings collected together in ninety-five fascicles. The topics range from monastic practice, to the equality of women and men, to the philosophy of language, being, and time. In the work, as in his own life, D≈çgen emphasized the absolute primacy of shikantaza and the inseparability of practice and enlightenment. =Shinji Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç= D≈çgen also compiled a collection of 301 koans in Chinese without commentaries added. Often called the Shinji Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç (shinji: \\"original or true characters\\" and sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, variously translated as \\"the right-dharma-eye treasury\\" or \\"Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma\\"). The collection is also known as the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç Sanbyakusoku (The Three Hundred Verse Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç\\") and the Mana Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, where mana is an alternative reading of shinji. The exact date the book was written is in dispute but Nishijima believes that Dogen may well have begun compiling the koan collection before his trip to China. Although these stories are commonly referred to as k≈çans, D≈çgen referred to them as kosoku (ancestral criteria) or innen (circumstances and causes or results, of a story). The word k≈çan for Dogen meant \\"absolute reality\\" or the \\"universal Dharma\\". =Eihei K≈çroku, Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç Zuimonki= Lectures that D≈çgen gave to his monks at his monastery, Eihei-ji, were compiled under the title Eihei K≈çroku, also known as D≈çgen Osh≈ç K≈çroku (The Extensive Record of Teacher D≈çgen's Sayings) in ten volumes. The sermons, lectures, sayings and poetry were compiled shortly after D≈çgen's death by his main disciples, Koun Ej≈ç (Â≠§Èõ≤ÊáêÂ•ò, 1198‚Äì1280), Senne, and Gien. There are three different editions of this text: the Rinn≈ç-ji text from 1598, a popular version printed in 1672, and a version discovered at Eihei-ji in 1937, which, although undated, is believed to be the oldest extant version. Another collection of his talks is the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç Zuimonki (Gleanings from Master D≈çgen's Sayings) in six volumes. These are talks that D≈çgen gave to his leading disciple, Ej≈ç, who became D≈çgen's disciple in 1234. The talks were recorded and edited by Ej≈ç. =H≈çkoj≈çki= The earliest work by D≈çgen is the H≈çkoj≈çki (Memoirs of the H≈çky≈ç Period). This one volume work is a collection of questions and answers between D≈çgen and his Chinese teacher, TiƒÅnt√≥ng R√∫j√¨ng (Â§©Á´•Â¶ÇÊ∑®; Japanese: Tend≈ç Nyoj≈ç, 1162‚Äì1228). The work was discovered among D≈çgen's papers by Ej≈ç in 1253, just three months after D≈çgen's death. =Other writings= Other notable writings of D≈çgen are: * Fukan-zazengi (ÊôÆÂãßÂùêÁ¶ÖÂÑÄ, General Advice on the Principles of Zazen), one volume; probably written immediately after D≈çgen's return from China in 1227. * Bend≈çwa (ÂºÅÈÅìË©±, \\"On the Endeavor of the Way\\"), written in 1231. This represents one of D≈çgen's earliest writings and asserts the superiority of the practice of shikantaza through a series of questions and answers. * Eihei shoso gakud≈ç-y≈çjinsh≈´ (Advice on Studying the Way), one volume; probably written in 1234. * Tenzo ky≈çkun (Instructions to the Chief Cook), one volume; written in 1237. * Bend≈çh≈ç (Rules for the Practice of the Way), one volume; written between 1244 and 1246. Source: See Kim (1987), Appendix B, pp. 234‚Äì237, for a more complete list of D≈çgen's major writings. =Shush≈ç-gi= The concept of oneness of practice-enlightenment is considered so fundamental to D≈çgen's variety of Zen ‚Äî and, consequently, to the S≈çt≈ç school as a whole ‚Äî that it formed the basis for the work Shush≈ç-gi (‰øÆË≠âÂÑÄ), which was compiled in 1890 by Takiya Takush≈´ (ÊªùË∞∑ÂçìÊ¥≤) of Eihei-ji and Azegami Baisen (Áïî‰∏äÊ•≥‰ªô) of S≈çji-ji as an introductory and prescriptive abstract of D≈çgen's massive work, the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç (\\"Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma\\"). Lineage Though Dogen emphasised the importance of the correct transmission of the Buddha dharma, as guaranteed by the line of transmission from Shakyamuni, his own transmission became problematic in the third generation. In 1267 Ej≈ç retired as Abbot of Eihei-ji, giving way to Gikai, who was already favored by D≈çgen. Gikai introduced esoteric elements into the practice. Opposition arose, and in 1272 Ej≈ç resumed the position of abbot. Following Ej≈ç's death in 1280, Gikai became abbot again, strengthened by the support of the military for magical practices. Opposition arose again, and Gikai was forced to leave Eihei-ji. He was succeeded by Gien, who was first trained in the Daruma-school of N≈çnin. His supporters designated him as the third abbot, rejecting the legitimacy of Gien. * Koun Ej≈ç, commentator on the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç, and former Darumash≈´ elder  Giin, through Ej≈ç  Gikai, through Ej≈ç * Keizan  Gien, through Ej≈ç * Senne, another commentator of the Sh≈çb≈çgenz≈ç. Jakuen, a student of Rujing, who traced his lineage \\"directly back the Zen of the Song period\\", established H≈çky≈ç-ji, where a strict style of Zen was practised. Students of his played a role in the conflict between Giin and Gikai. A notable successor of Dogen was Keizan (Áë©Â±±; 1268‚Äì1325), founder of S≈çji-ji Temple and author of the Record of the Transmission of Light (ÂÇ≥ÂÖâÈåÑ Denk≈çroku), which traces the succession of Zen masters from SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama up to Keizan's own day. Together, D≈çgen and Keizan are regarded as the founders of the S≈çt≈ç school in Japan. See also *Zen - 2009 Japanese biopic about the life of D≈çgen Notes References Sources  * Cleary, Thomas.

He started professionally in the medium at the age of 14, and he is most notable for his successful and controversial run as Marvel Comics' ninth editor-in-chief, and his work as editor in chief of Valiant Comics. Early life Jim Shooter was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to parents Ken and Eleanor \\"Ellie\\" Shooter,Shooter, Jim. \\"Bullpen Bulletins\\", Marvel comics cover-dated August 1982.Shooter, Jim. \\"Bullpen Bulletins,\\" Marvel comics cover-dated October 1982. who are of Polish descent.Shooter, Jim. \\"Bullpen Bulletins,\\" Marvel comics cover-dated April 1982. Shooter read comics as a child, though he stopped when he was about eight years old. His interest in the medium was rekindled in 1963, at the age of twelve, through the comics in the children's ward of the hospital where he convalesced after undergoing minor surgery. He found the DC Comics stories to be similar to the DC stories he had previously read, but was impressed with the style of the Marvel Comics, which had only begun publication two years earlier. Thinking that if he learned to write the types of stories that Marvel published, he would be an asset to DC Comics ‚Äì whose books, Shooter felt, \\"needed the help\\" ‚Äì Shooter spent about a year reading and studying comics from both companies.Irving, Christopher (July 20, 2012). \\"Jim Shooter's Secret Origin, in his Own Words ‚Äì Part One\\". Graphic NYC. Career =DC Comics= Shooter at the 2017 Phoenix Comicon At age 13, in mid-1965, he wrote and drew stories featuring the Legion of Superheroes, and sent them in to DC Comics. On February 10, 1966, he received a phone call from Mort Weisinger, who wanted to purchase the stories Shooter had sent, and commissioned Shooter to write Supergirl and Superman stories. Weisinger eventually offered Shooter a regular position on Legion, and wanted Shooter to come to New York to spend a couple of days in his office. Shooter, who was 14 and lived in Pittsburgh, had to wait until school was in recess, after which he went to New York with his mother, spurred in part by the need to support his financially struggling parents.Shooter, Jim (March 11, 2011). \\"Regrets? \\". jimshooter.com.Sacks, Jason (2001), \\"Bill Schelly: Joe Kubert's Art is Like the Difference Between a Pop Song and a Symphony\\".

Sense of Wonder: A Life in Comic Fandom : a Personal Memoir of Fandom's Golden Age, TwoMorrows Publishing, p. 103Cadigan, Glen; Grell, Mike (2003), The Legion Companion, TwoMorrows Publishing, p. 51 According to Shooter, his father earned very little as a steelworker, and Shooter saw comic-book writing as a means of helping economically. Shooter reflected in a 2010 interview: At 14, Shooter began selling stories to DC Comics, writing for both Action Comics and Adventure Comics, beginning with Adventure Comics No. 346 (July 1966), and providing pencil breakdowns as well. Shooter created several characters for the Legion of Super-Heroes including Karate Kid, a teenage superhero who predated the martial arts fad of the 1970s; Ferro Lad, a teenage superhero who can transform to living iron; and Princess Projectra, who could cast realistic illusions; as well as the Sun- Eater and the group of ultra-powerful villains known as The Fatal Five. He also created the Superman villain the Parasite in Action Comics No. 340 (Aug. 1966).McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 118: \\"With a story written by Jim Shooter and drawn by Al Plastino, the Parasite entered Superman's life.\\" Shooter and artist Curt Swan devised the first race between the Flash and Superman, two characters known for their super-speed powers, in \\"Superman's Race with the Flash!\\" in Superman No. 199 (Aug. 1967).McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 124: \\"Since the dawn of comics' Silver Age, readers have asked 'Who's faster: Superman or the Flash?' Writer Jim Shooter and artist Curt Swan tried answering that question when the Man of Steel and the Fastest Man Alive agreed to the U.N.'s request to race each other for charity.\\" Shooter wrote the first issue of Captain Action (Oct.-Nov. 1968), which was DC's first toy tie-in. In 1969 Shooter was accepted into New York University, but after graduating from high school he successfully applied for a job at Marvel Comics. Unable to pursue both his studies and work for Marvel, he decided against going to New York University and quit working for DC as well. While at Marvel he worked as an editor and occasional co-plotter, taking his residence at the YMCA, but after only three weeks his financial situation compelled him to give up the post and return home to Pittsburgh. After leaving Marvel, Shooter took up work in advertising concepts, writing, and illustration for several years, supporting himself through an assortment of menial jobs during periods when advertising work was unavailable. An interview for a Legion of Super-Heroes fanzine led to his again applying to both Marvel and DC. Though both companies offered him work, Shooter opted to return to DC because they had offered him more prestigious assignments: Superman and a chance to again write Legion of Super-Heroes, now in their own book, Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes. However, his relationships with both Superman editor Julius Schwartz and Legion editor Murray Boltinoff were unpleasant, and Shooter claims that for varying reasons the two editors forced him to do a number of unnecessary rewrites. In December 1975, Marvel editor-in-chief Marv Wolfman called to offer him an editorial position. =Marvel Comics= In the mid-1970s, Marvel Comics was undergoing a series of changes in the position of Editor-in-Chief. After Roy Thomas stepped down from the post to focus on writing, a succession of other editors, including Len Wein, Marv Wolfman, Gerry Conway, and Archie Goodwin, took the job during a relatively short span of time, only to find the task too daunting as Marvel continued to grow and add new titles and a larger staff to turn out material.Priest, Christopher J. (May 2002). \\"Chapter Two: Oswald: Why I Never Discuss Spider-Man\\" , Adventures in the Funnybook Game. On January 2, 1976, Shooter joined the Marvel staff as an assistant editor and writer. With the quick turnover at the top, Shooter rapidly found himself rising in the ranks, and on the first working day of January 1978, he succeeded Archie Goodwin to become Marvel's ninth editor-in-chief.The Secret Origin of Jim Shooter, Editor in Chief ‚Äì Part 2 During this period, publisher Stan Lee relocated to Los Angeles to better oversee Marvel's animation, television and film projects, leaving Shooter largely in charge of the creative decision-making at Marvel's New York City headquarters. Although there were complaints among some that Shooter imposed a dictatorial style on the \\"Bullpen\\", he cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel, successfully managed to keep the line of books on schedule (ending the widespread practice of missed deadlines), add new titles, and develop new talent.Rozanski, Chuck. \\"Tales From the Database: Meeting with Jim Shooter in May of 1979,\\" Comics Buyer's Guide (Feb 2004).

Comic Book Resources. the first issue of this series was sold only through specialty stores, bypassing the then-standard newsstand/spin rack distribution route altogether, as a recognition by Marvel of the growing comics shop sector. Subsequent issues of Dazzler, however, were sold through newsstand [returnable] accounts as well. Dazzler was the first direct sales-only ongoing series from a major publisher; other Marvel titles, such as Marvel Fanfare and Ka-Zar, soon followed.DeFalco \\"1980s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 195: \\"Marvel made three of its monthly titles ‚Äì Moon Knight, Micronauts, and Ka-Zar ‚Äì 'direct only' and the company was soon creating new titles (for example, Marvel Fanfare ... that were reserved exclusively for comic book stores.\\" Later that same year, Shooter wrote Marvel Treasury Edition No. 28 which featured the second Superman and Spider-Man intercompany crossover.Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 194: \\"In an oversized treasury edition carrying a hefty $2.50 price tag, the Man of Steel paired for the second time with Marvel's iconic web-slinger ...

[Jim Shooter] embarked on his most ambitious project: he would celebrate the birth of one universe by creating a brand new one.\\" Despite his success in revitalizing Marvel, Shooter angered and alienated a number of long-time Marvel creators by insisting on strong editorial control and strict adherence to deadlines. Although he instituted an art-return program, and implemented a policy giving creators royalties when their books passed certain sales benchmarks or when characters they worked on were licensed as toys, Shooter occasionally found himself in well-publicized conflicts with some writers and artists.

Roy Thomas, who left Marvel following a contract dispute with Shooter, reflected in 2005 on Shooter's editorial policies: John Romita Sr. said: John Byrne said similarly: Shooter was fired from Marvel on April 15, 1987.Jim Shooter: Conversations =Valiant Comics= Shooter and his investors then founded a new company, Voyager Communications, which published comics under the Valiant Comics banner, entering the market in 1989 with comics based on Nintendo and WWF licensed characters. Two years later Valiant entered the superhero market with a relaunch of the Gold Key Comics character Magnus, Robot Fighter. Shooter brought many of Marvel's creators to Valiant, including Bob Layton and Barry Windsor-Smith, as well as industry veterans such as Don Perlin. Valiant also established \\"knob row\\" ‚Äî taking in raw talent and teaching them how to make comics Valiant-style ‚Äì and launched many careers, most notably Joe Quesada's. Occasionally over the years, Shooter was required to fill in as penciller on various books he wrote and/or oversaw as editor. During his period as Valiant's publisher, money and talent were often at a premium, and Shooter was sporadically forced to pencil a story. To conceal this fact, he drew under the pseudonym of Paul Creddick, which is the name of his brother- in-law.Petrilak, Joe. \\"THE Jim Shooter Interview\\"; The Valiant Era Online; July 22, 1998.

Valiant sued Shooter over his moving to write the Gold Key characters for Dark Horse as they expected to get the rights and that he interfered with their ability to license the Key characters by indicating that he would write them for Dark Horse. As of January 2010, Valiant had given up the lawsuit against Shooter.Bill Jemas Is One Of The People Behind Valiant Entertainment, Inc He subsequently wrote the relaunched Magnus: Robotfighter, Turok and Dr. Solar series as well as Mighty Samson, another Gold Key character (that hasn't been picked up by Valiant Comics), for Dark Horse, beginning in 2010.

PDF is an opaque, impure variety of silica, usually red, yellow, brown or green in color; and rarely blue. The common red color is due to iron(III) inclusions. Jasper breaks with a smooth surface and is used for ornamentation or as a gemstone. It can be highly polished and is used for items such as vases, seals, and snuff boxes. The specific gravity of jasper is typically 2.5 to 2.9. A green variety with red spots, known as heliotrope (bloodstone), is one of the traditional birthstones for March. Jaspillite is a banded-iron-formation rock that often has distinctive bands of jasper.

Hebrew ◊ô◊©◊§◊î yashpeh, Akkadian yashupu).\\"Jasper\\" at etymonline.com This Semitic etymology is believed to be unrelated to that of the English given name Jasper (of Persian origin). Green jasper was used to make bow drills in Mehrgarh between 4th and 5th millennium BC. Jasper is known to have been a favorite gem in the ancient world; its name can be traced back in Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Assyrian, Greek and Latin. On Minoan Crete, jasper was carved to produce seals circa 1800 BC, as evidenced by archaeological recoveries at the palace of Knossos. Although the term jasper is now restricted to opaque quartz, the ancient iaspis was a stone of considerable translucency including nephrite. The jasper of antiquity was in many cases distinctly green, for it is often compared to emerald and other green objects. Jasper is referred to in the Nibelungenlied as being clear and green. The jasper of the ancients probably included stones which would now be classed as chalcedony, and the emerald-like jasper may have been akin to the modern chrysoprase. The Hebrew word may have designated a green jasper. Flinders Petrie suggested that the odem, the first stone on the High Priest's breastplate, was a red jasper, whilst tarshish, the tenth stone, may have been a yellow jasper.Hastings's Dict. Bible, 1902, as cited in 1911 Britannica.

Russian, late 19th century, Kremlin Armoury Jasper is an opaque rock of virtually any color stemming from the mineral content of the original sediments or ash. Patterns arise during the consolidation process forming flow and depositional patterns in the original silica rich sediment or volcanic ash. Hydrothermal circulation is generally thought to be required in the formation of jasper. Jasper can be modified by the diffusion of minerals along discontinuities providing the appearance of vegetative growth, i.e., dendritic. The original materials are often fractured and/or distorted, after deposition, into diverse patterns, which are later filled in with other colorful minerals. Weathering, with time, will create intensely colored superficial rinds. The classification and naming of jasper varieties presents a challenge. Terms attributed to various well- defined materials includes the geographic locality where it is found, sometimes quite restricted such as \\"Bruneau\\" (a canyon) and \\"Lahontan\\" (a lake), rivers and even individual mountains; many are fanciful, such as \\"forest fire\\" or \\"rainbow\\", while others are descriptive, such as \\"autumn\\" or \\"porcelain\\". A few are designated by the place of origin such as a brown Egyptian or red African. =Banded iron formations = Jasper is the main component in the silica-rich parts of banded iron formations (BIFs) which indicate low, but present, amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water such as during the Great Oxidation Event or snowball earths. The red bands, typically more competent than the hematite layers surrounding it, are made of microcrystalline red chert, also called jasper. =Picture jaspers= Earrings of polished \\"leopard-spot jasper\\" (actually a type of spherulitic rhyolite) Picture jaspers exhibit combinations of patterns resulting in what appear to be scenes or images, when seen on a cut section. Such patterns include banding from flow or depositional patterns (from water or wind), as well as dendritic or color variations. Diffusion from a center produces a distinctive orbicular appearance, i.e., leopard skin jasper or linear banding from a fracture as seen in leisegang jasper. Healed, fragmented rock produces brecciated (broken) jasper. While these \\"picture jaspers\\" can be found all over the world, specific colors or patterns are unique to the geographic region from which they originate. One source of the stone is Indonesia, especially in Purbalingga district. From the US is Oregon's Biggs jasper and Idaho's Bruneau jasper from the Bruneau River canyon are particularly fine examples. Other examples can be seen at Ynys Llanddwyn in Wales.Jasper Gemological Information - International Gem Society (IGS) Retrieved 16 January 2015 A remarkable, pale, blue-green jasper, with patterns somewhat resembling those of malachite, occurs in a deposit at Ettutkan Mountain, Staryi Sibay, Bashkortostan, Russia.

Basanite (not to be confused with bassanite), Lydian stone, and radiolarite (a.k.a. lydite or flinty slate) are terms used to refer to several types of black, jasper-like rock (also including tuffs, cherts and siltstones) which are dense, fine-grained and flinty / cherty in texture and found in a number of localities. The \\"Lydian Stone\\" known to the Ancient Greeks is named for the ancient kingdom of Lydia in what is now western Turkey. A similar rock type occurs in New England. Such rock types have long been used for the making of touchstones to test the purity of precious metal alloys, because they are hard enough to scratch such metals, which, if drawn (scraped) across them, show to advantage their metallic streaks of various (diagnostic) colours, against the dark background. There are, confusingly, not one but two rocks called Basanite, one being a black form of jasper and the other a black volcanic rock closely akin to basalt. Add to this the fact that many different rock types - having in common the colour black and a fine texture - have, over the ages, been pressed into service as touchstones and it will be seen that there is ample scope for confusion in this petrology- and mineralogy-related field of study. =Gallery= References External links * ","title":"Jasper"},{"id":"75358","text":"A trial at the Old Bailey in London as drawn by Thomas Rowlandson and Augustus Pugin for Ackermann's Microcosm of London (1808‚Äì11). A court is any person or institution, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all people have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court. The system of courts that interprets and applies the law is collectively known as the judiciary. The place where a court sits is known as a venue. The room where court proceedings occur is known as a courtroom, and the building as a courthouse; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large buildings in cities. The practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (from Latin , from , \\"of the law,\\" + , \\"to declare,\\" + , noun-forming suffix), the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it. According to William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, a court (for civil wrongs) is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the or plaintiff, who complains of an injury done; the or defendant, who is called upon to make satisfaction for it; and the or judicial power, who is to examine the truth of the fact, determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, ascertain and by its officers apply a legal remedy. It is also usual in the superior courts to have barristers, and attorneys or counsel, as assistants, though, often, courts consist of additional barristers, bailiffs, reporters, and perhaps a jury. The term \\"the court\\" is also used to refer to the presiding officer or officials, usually one or more judges. The judge or panel of judges may also be collectively referred to as \\"the bench\\" (in contrast to attorneys and barristers, collectively referred to as \\"the bar\\").See generally : \\"The Supreme Court of the United States shall consist of a Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices [ . . . ]\\" (italics added); : \\"Each court of appeals shall consist of the circuit judges of the circuit in regular active service.\\" (italics added); (in part): \\"Each district court shall consist of the district judge or judges for the district in regular active service.\\" (italics added); (in part): \\"In each judicial district, the bankruptcy judges in regular active service shall constitute a unit of the district court to be known as the bankruptcy court for that district [ . . . ]\\" (italics added). In the United States, the legal authority of a court to take action is based on personal jurisdiction over the parties to the litigation and subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted. Etymology The building of the Supreme Court of Estonia in Tartu The word court comes from the French , an enclosed yard, which derives from the Latin form , the accusative case of , which again means an enclosed yard or the occupants of such a yard. The English word court is a cognate of the Latin word from Ancient Greek () (meaning \\"garden\\", hence horticulture and orchard), both referring to an enclosed space. The meaning of a judicial assembly is first attested in the 12th century, and derives from the earlier usage to designate a sovereign and his entourage, which met to adjudicate disputes in such an enclosed yard. The verb \\"to court\\", meaning to win favor, derives from the same source since people traveled to the sovereign's court to win his favor. Jurisdiction Jurisdiction is defined as the official authority to make legal decisions and judgements over a person or material item within a territory. \\"Whether a given court has jurisdiction to preside over a given case\\" is a key question in any legal action.Jurisdiction, Legal Information Institute, Cornell Law School. Three basic components of jurisdiction are personal jurisdiction over an individual or thing (), jurisdiction over the particular subject matter (subject-matter jurisdiction) and territorial jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over a person refers to the full authority over a person regardless on where they live, jurisdiction over a particular subject matter refers to the authority over the said subject of legal cases involved in a case, and lastly territorial jurisdiction is the authority over a person within an x amount of space. Other concepts of jurisdiction include general jurisdiction, exclusive jurisdiction, appellate jurisdiction, and (in the United States federal courts) diversity jurisdiction. Trial and appellate courts A courtroom of the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland Trial courts are courts that hold trials. Sometimes termed \\"courts of first instance\\", trial courts have varying original jurisdiction. Trial courts may conduct trials with juries as the finders of fact (these are known as jury trials) or trials in which judges act as both finders of fact and finders of law (in some jurisdictions these are known as bench trials). Juries are less common in court systems outside the Anglo-American common law tradition. Appellate courts are courts that hear appeals of lower courts and trial courts. Some courts, such as the Crown Court in England and Wales may have both trial and appellate jurisdictions. Civil law courts and common law courts The two major legal traditions of the western world are the civil law courts and the common law courts. These two great legal traditions are similar, in that they are products of western culture although there are significant differences between the two traditions. Civil law courts are profoundly based upon Roman Law, specifically a civil body of law entitled \\"Corpus iuris civilis\\". This theory of civil law was rediscovered around the end of the eleventh century and became a foundation for university legal education starting in Bologna, Italy and subsequently being taught throughout continental European Universities. Civil law is firmly ensconced in the French and German legal systems. Common law courts were established by English royal judges of the King's Council after the Norman Invasion of Britain in 1066. The royal judges created a body of law by combining local customs they were made aware of through traveling and visiting local jurisdictions. This common standard of law became known as \\"Common Law\\". This legal tradition is practiced in the English and American legal systems. In most civil law jurisdictions, courts function under an inquisitorial system. In the common law system, most courts follow the adversarial system. Procedural law governs the rules by which courts operate: civil procedure for private disputes (for example); and criminal procedure for violation of the criminal law. In recent years international courts are being created to resolve matters not covered by the jurisdiction of national courts. For example, The International Criminal Court, based in The Hague, in The Kingdom of The Netherlands or _The Court of Permanent Lok Adalat (Public Utility Services) based in India._ Court television shows Television show courts, which are not part of the judicial system and are generally private arbitrators, are depicted within the court show genre; however, the courts depicted have been criticized as misrepresenting real-life courts of law and the true nature of the legal system.

In contrast to most other Indo-European languages, English does not retain grammatical gender and most of its nouns, adjectives and pronouns are therefore not gender-specific. In most other Indo-European languages, nouns are grammatically masculine (as in Spanish el humano) or grammatically feminine (as in French la personne), or sometimes grammatically neuter (as in German das M√§dchen), regardless of the actual gender of the referent. In addressing natural gender, English speakers use linguistic strategies that may reflect the speaker's attitude to the issue or the perceived social acceptability of such strategies. Debate Proponents of gender-neutral language argue that making language less biased is not only laudable but also achievable. Some people find non-neutral language to be offensive. > [There is] a growing awareness that language does not merely reflect the way > we think: it also shapes our thinking.

United > Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 1999. > http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001149/114950mo.pdf. Accessed March > 25, 2007. Standards advocated by supporters of the gender-neutral modification in English have been applied differently and to differing degrees among English speakers worldwide. This reflects differences in culture and language structure, for example American English in contrast to British English. =Arguments for= Proponents of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society. According to The Handbook of English Linguistics, generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances \\"where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species.\\"Aarts, Bas and April M. S. McMahon. The Handbook of English Linguistics. Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell Pub., 2006, . Proponents also argue that words that refer to women often devolve in meaning, frequently developing sexual overtones. The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing says that the words children hear affect their perceptions of the gender-appropriateness of certain careers (e.g. firemen vs firefighters). Men and women apply for jobs in more equal proportions when gender-neutral language is used in the advertisement, as opposed to the generic he or man. Some critics make the further claim that these differences in usage are not accidental, but have been deliberately created for the purpose of upholding a patriarchal society. =Arguments against= Various criticisms have been leveled against the use of gender-neutral language, most focusing on specific usages, such as the use of \\"human\\" instead of \\"man\\" and \\"he or she\\" instead of \\"he\\". Any other alternatives to gender-specific language are claimed to \\"lead one into using awkward or grating constructions\\" or neologisms that are so ugly as to be \\"abominations\\". Others argue that the linguistic differentiation of women actually reflects them being _more_ valued than men, not _less_. Opponents of gender-neutral language often argue that its proponents are impinging on the right of free expression and promoting censorship. A few commentators do not disagree with the usage of gender-neutral language per se, but they do question the effectiveness of gender-neutral language in overcoming sexism. =In religion= Much debate over the use of gender-neutral language surrounds questions of liturgy and Bible translation. Some translations of the Bible in recent years have used gender-inclusive pronouns, but these translations have not been universally accepted. =Naming practices= Some critics oppose the practice of women changing their names upon marriage, on the grounds that it makes women historically invisible: \\"In our society 'only men have real names' in that their names are permanent and they have 'accepted the permanency of their names as one of the rights of being male.'... Essentially this practice means that women's family names do not count and that there is one more device for making women invisible.\\" Up until the 1970s, as women were granted greater access to the professions they were less likely to change their names, either professionally or legally; names were seen as tied to reputations and women were less likely to change their names when they had higher reputations. However, that trend was reversed starting in the 1970s; since that time, increasingly more women have been taking their husband's surname upon marriage, especially among well-educated women in high- earning occupations. Increasingly, studies have shown women's decisions on the issue are guided by factors other than political or religious ideas about women's rights or marital roles, as often believed. The practice of referring to married women by their husband's first and last names, which only died out in the late 20th century, has been criticized since the 19th century. When the Reverend Samuel May \\"moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee\\" of the National Women's Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, Lucretia Mott quickly replied: \\"Woman's Rights' women do not like to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own\\".Quoted in Elizabeth Cady Stanton refused to be addressed as \\"Mrs Henry B. Stanton\\". The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of coverture, the idea that \\"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\\"Henry Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, quoted in There is a tendency among scientists to refer to women by their first and last name and to men by their surname only. This may result in female scientists being perceived as less eminent than their male colleagues. Problems and their resolution =Job titles= Gender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include firefighter instead of fireman; flight attendant instead of steward or stewardess; bartender instead of barman or barmaid; and chairperson or chair instead of chairman or chairwoman. There are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or \\"male\\") form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including man), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include actor and actress; usher and usherette; comedian and comedienne. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using comedian rather than comedienne, for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman). Terms such as male nurse, male model or female judge are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in \\"my brother is a male nurse\\"). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with lady, as in lady doctor: here woman or female is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender. =Generic words for humans= Another issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words man, men and mankind to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes. Although the word man originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously. In Old English, the word wer referred to males only and wif to females only, while man referred to both, although in practice man was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males. In time, wer fell out of use, and man came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; \\"[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.\\" By the 18th century, man had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. Anthony Trollope, for example, writes of \\"the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind\\",Quoted in and when \\"Edmund Burke, writing of the French Revolution, used men in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: 'Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France....'\\" Proponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word \\"man\\" are often not in fact generic. Miller and Swift illustrate with the following quotation: > \\"As for man, he is no different from the rest. His back aches, he ruptures > easily, his women have difficulties in childbirth....\\" \\"If man and he were truly generic, the parallel phrase would have been he has difficulties in childbirth\\", Miller and Swift comment. Writing for the American Philosophical Association, Virginia L. Warren follows Janice Moulton and suggests truly generic uses of the word man would be perceived as \\"false, funny, or insulting\\", offering as an example the sentence \\"Some men are female.\\" Further, some commentators point out that the ostensibly gender- neutral use of man has in fact sometimes been used to exclude women: > Thomas Jefferson did not make the same distinction in declaring that \\"all > men are created equal\\" and \\"governments are instituted among men, deriving > their just powers from the consent of the governed.\\" In a time when women, > having no vote, could neither give nor withhold consent, Jefferson had to be > using the word men in its principal sense of males, and it probably never > occurred to him that anyone would think otherwise. For reasons like those above, proponents of gender-neutral language argue that linguistic clarity as well as equality would be better served by having man and men refer unambiguously to males, and human(s) or people to all persons; similarly, the word mankind replaced by humankind or humanity The use of the word man as a generic word referring to all humans has been declining, particularly among female speakers and writers. =Pronouns= Another target of frequent criticism by proponents of gender-neutral language is the use of the masculine pronoun he (and its derived forms him, his and himself) to refer to antecedents of indeterminate gender. Although this usage is traditional, its critics argue that it was invented and propagated by males, whose explicit goal was the linguistic representation of male superiority.. Among writers defending the usage of generic he, the author cites a Thomas Wilson, writing in 1553, and grammarian Joshua Poole (1646). The use of the generic he was approved in an Act of Parliament, the Interpretation Act 1850 (the provision continues in the Interpretation Act 1978, although this states equally that the feminine includes the masculine). However, despite its putative inclusiveness, it has been used to deny women's entry into professions and schools. Proposed alternatives to the generic he include he or she (or she or he), s/he, or the use of singular they. Each of these alternatives has met with objections. Some feel the use of singular they to be a grammatical error, but according to most references, they, their and them have long been grammatically acceptable as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English, having been used in the singular continuously since the Middle Ages, including by a number of prominent authors, such as Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, and Jane Austen. Linguist Steven Pinker goes further and argues that traditional grammar proscriptions regarding the use of singular \\"they\\" are themselves incorrect: > The logical point that you, Holden Caulfield, and everyone but the language > mavens intuitively grasp is that everyone and they are not an \\"antecedent\\" > and a \\"pronoun\\" referring to the same person in the world, which would force > them to agree in number. They are a \\"quantifier\\" and a \\"bound variable\\", a > different logical relationship. Everyone returned to their seats means \\"For > all X, X returned to X's seat.\\" The \\"X\\" does not refer to any particular > person or group of people; it is simply a placeholder that keeps track of > the roles that players play across different relationships. In this case, > the X that comes back to a seat is the same X that owns the seat that X > comes back to. The their there does not, in fact, have plural number, > because it refers neither to one thing nor to many things; it does not refer > at all. Some style guides accept singular they as grammatically correct, while others reject it. Some, such as The Chicago Manual of Style, hold a neutral position on the issue, and contend that any approach used is likely to displease some readers. Research has found that the use of masculine pronouns in a generic sense creates \\"male bias\\" by evoking a disproportionate number of male images and excluding thoughts of women in non-sex specific instances. Moreover, a study by John Gastil found that while they functions as a generic pronoun for both males and females, males may comprehend he/she in a manner similar to he. =Honorifics= Proponents of gender-neutral language point out that while Mr is used for men regardless of marital status, the titles Miss and Mrs indicate a woman's marital status, and thus signal her sexual availability in a way that men's titles do not. The honorific \\"Ms\\" can be used for women regardless of marital status. The gender-neutral honorific, Mx ( \\"mix\\", ), can be used in place of gendered honorifics in order to provide gender neutrality. Adoption of the honorific has been relatively rapid and thorough in the UK. In 2013, Brighton and Hove City Council in Sussex, England, voted to allow its use on council forms, and in 2014, The Royal Bank of Scotland included the title as an option. In 2015, recognition spread more broadly across UK institutions, including the Royal Mail, government agencies responsible for documents such as passports and drivers' licenses, and several other major banks. In 2015, it was included in the Oxford English Dictionary. Style guidance by publishers and others Many editing houses, corporations, and government bodies have official policies in favor of in-house use of gender-neutral language. In some cases, laws exist regarding the use of gender-neutral language in certain situations, such as job advertisements. Different authorities have presented guidelines on whether and how to use gender-neutral, or \\"non-sexist\\" language. Several are listed below: * The \\"Publication Manual\\" of the American Psychological Association has an oft-cited section on \\"Guidelines to Reduce Bias in Language\\". * American Philosophical Association‚Äîpublished 1986 * The Guardian‚Äîsee section \\"gender issues\\" * Avoiding Heterosexual Bias in Language, published by the Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concerns, American Psychological Association. In addition, gender-neutral language has gained support from some major textbook publishers, and from professional and academic groups such as the American Psychological Association and the Associated Press. Newspapers such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal use gender-neutral language. Many law journals, psychology journals, and literature journals will only print articles or papers that use gender-inclusive language. Employee policy manuals sometimes include strongly worded statements prescribing avoidance of language that potentially could be considered discriminatory. One such example is from the University of Saskatchewan: \\"All documents, publications or presentations developed by all constituencies...shall be written in gender neutral and/or gender inclusive language.\\"\\"Gender Neutral Language\\". University of Saskatchewan Policies, 2001. . Accessed March 25, 2007. In 1989 the American Bar Association's House of Delegates adopted a resolution stating that \\"the American Bar Association and each of its entities should use gender-neutral language in all documents establishing policy and procedure.\\" In 2015 the Union for Reform Judaism in North America passed a \\"Resolution on the Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People\\" stating in part: \\"THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Union for Reform Judaism...[u]rges Reform Movement institutions to review their use of language in prayers, forms and policies in an effort to ensure people of all gender identities and gender expressions are welcomed, included, accepted and respected. This includes developing statements of inclusion and/or non- discrimination policies pertaining to gender identity and gender expression, the use when feasible of gender-neutral language, and offering more than two gender options or eliminating the need to select a gender on forms\\".

Walter Karl Koch (May 3, 1880 in Dortmund, Germany - 1962 ) was a German surgeon best known for the discovery of Koch's triangle, a triangular shaped area in the right atrium of the heart, and of Tawara's node, the atrioventricular node which is the beginning of the auricular-ventricular bundle. Educated in Freiburg im Breisgau and at the Kaiser Wilhelm Academy in Berlin, he obtained his doctorate in 1907 at Freiburg. As a military physician, he served at the Heidelberg pathological institute and the 2nd medical clinic in Berlin. Here he habilitated in general pathology and pathological anatomy in 1921. After being named a professor in 1922, he worked as head of department at Berlin's Westend hospital.

From September 1941 until August 1942, he served as the first commandant of the Majdanek concentration camp in occupied Poland, stealing vast amounts of valuables and money from murdered Jews. His wife, Ilse Koch, also took part in the crimes at Buchenwald and Majdanek. Life Koch was born in Darmstadt, Grand Duchy of Hesse on August 2, 1897. His father worked in a local registrar's office and died when Karl was eight years old. After completing elementary school in 1912, Koch attended Mittelschule and completed a commercial apprenticeship. In 1916, he volunteered to join the army and fought on the Western Front until he was later captured by the British. Koch spent the rest of the war as a POW and returned to Germany in 1919. As a soldier, he conducted himself well and was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class, the Observer's Badge and the Wound Badge in Black. Following World War I, Koch worked as a commercial manager, an authorized signatory and insurance agent and became unemployed in 1932 (he had served a prison sentence in 1930 for embezzlement and forgery). In 1931, Karl- Otto Koch joined the Nazi Party and the Schutzstaffel (SS).Gedenkst√§tte Buchenwald: Buchenwald Concentration Camp, 1937-1945: A Guide to the Permanent Historical Exhibition, Wallstein Verlag, 2004 p. 41-43Whitlock Flint: Buchenwaldsk√© bestie: Karl a Ilse Kochovi a lampy se st√≠n√≠tkem z lidsk√© k≈Ø≈æe, Grada Publishing, a.s., Sep 29, 2015 p. 326-327 Service with the SS Koch served with several SS-Standarten (Thirty fifth SS Regiment Kassel, SS Special Detachment Saxony). In 1934, he took command of the Sachsenburg Concentration Camp. Briefly, he was the officer in charge of the Esterwegen Concentration Camp guard unit, officer in charge of the preventive custody camp in the Lichtenburg Concentration Camp, and the adjutant at Dachau Concentration Camp. On 13 June 1935, he became commander of the Columbia concentration camp in Berlin-Tempelhof and, in April 1936, he was assigned to the concentration camp at Esterwegen. Four months later, he was moved to Sachsenhausen. Within a few years (September 1937) he advanced to SS-Standartenf√ºhrer (colonel).. On 1 August 1937, he was given command of the new Buchenwald concentration camp. He remained at Buchenwald until September 1941, when he was transferred to the Majdanek concentration camp for POWs near Lublin, Poland. That was largely due to an investigation based on allegations of his improper conduct at Buchenwald, which included corruption, fraud, embezzlement, drunkenness, sexual offences and a murder. Koch commanded the Majdanek camp for only one year; he was relieved from his duties after 86 Soviet POWs escaped from the camp in August 1942. Koch was charged with criminal negligence and transferred to Berlin, where he worked at the SS Personnel Main Office and as a liaison between the SS and the German Post Office.Rescue and Resistance: Portraits of the Holocaust, Macmillan Library Reference USA, Jan 1, 1999 p. 311. Prosecution and death Koch's actions at Buchenwald first caught the attention of SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Josias, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont in 1941. In glancing over the death list of Buchenwald, Josias had stumbled across the name of Walter Kr√§mer, a head hospital orderly at Buchenwald, which he recognized because Kr√§mer had successfully treated him in the past. Josias investigated the case and found out that Koch, in a position as the Camp Commandant, had ordered Kr√§mer and Karl Peix, a hospital attendant, killed as \\"political prisoners\\" because they had treated him for syphilis and he feared it might be discovered. Waldeck also received reports that a certain prisoner had been shot while attempting to escape. By that time, Koch had been transferred to the Majdanek concentration camp in Poland, but his wife, Ilse, was still living at the Commandant's house in Buchenwald. Waldeck ordered a full-scale investigation of the camp by Georg Konrad Morgen, an SS officer who was an SS-judge in the SS Court Main Office. Throughout the investigation, more of Koch's orders to kill prisoners at the camp were revealed, as well as embezzlement of property stolen from prisoners. A charge of incitement to murder was lodged by Prince Waldeck and Morgen against Koch, to which were later added charges of embezzlement. Other camp officials were charged, including Koch's wife. The trial resulted in Koch being sentenced to death for disgracing both himself and the SS. Koch was executed by firing squad on 5 April 1945, one week before American allied troops arrived to liberate the camp.Mark Jacobson: The Lampshade: A Holocaust Detective Story from Buchenwald to New Orleans, Simon and Schuster, Sep 14, 2010 p. 15 Family Ilse Koch after her arrest Koch first married in 1924 and had one son; however, this marriage ended in divorce in 1931, due to his infidelity. On May 25, 1936 Koch married Ilse Koch (n√©e Margarete Ilse K√∂hler), with whom he had a son and two daughters. Ilse later became known as \\"The Witch of Buchenwald\\" (Die Hexe von Buchenwald), usually rendered in English as \\"The Bitch of Buchenwald.\\" When Koch was transferred to Buchenwald, Ilse was appointed an Oberaufseherin (overseer) by the SS and thus had an active, official role in the atrocities committed there. She was known for extreme cruelty towards prisoners.

Biography =Early life and reign= Ptolemy XVI Philadelphos Antonius was of Greek and Roman heritage. His father Mark Antony summoned Cleopatra to a summit near Antioch, Syria (now a part of modern Turkey) in a place Plutarch locates situated between Beirut and Sidon, called Light, an unwalled village.Plutarch, Antony 51.2. If Plutarch is to be believed, then, Philadelphos was conceived in an unwalled village called Light, during this Mark Antony and Cleopatra summit between roughly November and December 37 BCE because Prof Tarn believes his birth (presumably in Alexandria, Egypt) was between August‚ÄìSeptember 36 BCE.Cassius Dio, Roman History 49.32.4-5. This cited passage only reports the birth not the location.W W Tarn, Journal of Roman Studies, 1932, 135-160. Ptolemy XVI was named after the original Ptolemy II Philadelphus (the second Pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty) and Cleopatra's intention was recreating the former Ptolemaic Kingdom, which she herself received from Antony in the Donations of Antioch in 36 BCE at this time with full approval from Octavian.Strootman, Rolf, 2010, Queen of Kings: Cleopatra VII and the Donations of Alexandria, pp 139-158 in: M Facella and T Kaizer editors, Kingdoms and Principalities in the Roman Near East, Occidens et Oriens 19, Franz Steiner Verlag, Stuttgart. Two years later in late 34 BCE, at the Donations of Alexandria, part of her kingdom was granted to Ptolemy making him ruler of Syria, Phoenicia and Cilicia.Plutarch, Antony 54.6-9; Cassius Dio, Roman History 49.41.1-3; Livy, periochae 131. Having approved of Antony's planned reorganization of the East in 36 BCE, by 34 BCE their political situations had evolved and Octavian then used with potency the Donations of Alexandria in his propaganda war against Antony. Ultimately, the parents of Philadelphos were defeated by Caesar Octavian (future Emperor Augustus) during the naval battle at Actium, Greece in 31 BC. The next year, his parents committed suicide as Octavian and his legions invaded Egypt to annex it as a province (provincia) of the Roman Republic (Roma). =Capture and fate= Octavian took him and his elder siblings Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II from Egypt to Roman Italy (Italia). Octavian celebrated his military triumph in Rome, by parading the three orphans in heavy golden chains in the streets of Rome. The chains were so heavy they could not walk, prompting reactions of sympathy from the Romans.Cassius Dio, Roman History 51.21.8 (who only says that Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene participated in the triumph, but does not mention Ptolemy Philadelphos). Octavian gave these siblings to Octavia Minor, his second- eldest sister who was their father's former wife.Plutarch, Antony 87.1; Cassius Dio, Roman History 51.15.6; Suetonius, Augustus 17.5 The fate of Ptolemy Philadelphos is unknown. Plutarch states that the only child that Octavian killed out of Antony's children was Marcus Antonius Antyllus, but the ancient sources make no mention of him after being taken to Rome with his surviving siblings. His sister Cleopatra Selene survived to adulthood and was married to Juba of Mauretania, a client king of the Roman empire. Through her, the Ptolemaic line intermarried back into the Roman nobility for many generations. If Ptolemy Philadelphus survived to adulthood, proof of his survival has not been found.

It is approximately west of central London. The studio has been the base for many productions over the years from large-scale films to television programmes, commercials, and pop promos. It is well known as the home of the James Bond and Carry On film franchises. History Pinewood Studios was built on the estate of Heatherden Hall, a large Victorian country house which was purchased by Canadian financier, and MP for Brentford and Chiswick, Lt. Col. Grant Morden (1880‚Äì1932). He added refinements such as a ballroom, a Turkish bath and an indoor squash court. Due to its seclusion, it was used as a discreet meeting place for high-ranking politicians and diplomats; the agreement to create the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed there. In 1934, building tycoon Charles Boot (1874‚Äì1945) bought the land and turned it into a country club. The ballroom was converted into a restaurant and many of the bedrooms became furnished suites. =1930s= In 1935, millionaire Methodist and flour magnate J. Arthur Rank (1888‚Äì1972) went into partnership with Boot and they transformed the estate into a film studio. Boot based designs for the studio complex on the latest ideas being employed by film studios in Hollywood, California. Boot named the new studio Pinewood because \\"of the number of trees which grow there and because it seemed to suggest something of the American film centre in its second syllable\\". Construction began in December of that year, with a new stage completed every three weeks. The studios were finished nine months later, having cost ¬£1 million (approx. ¬£37 million at 2012 prices). Five stages were initially completed and there was provision for an enclosed water tank capable of holding , which is still in use. In the years that followed, he also undertook further work on both the Pinewood Film Studios and the Denham Film Studios, both of which had by then become a part of the newly-formed Rank Organisation. On 30 September 1936, the studio complex was officially openedPatricia Warren British Film Studios: An Illustrated History, London: B.T. Batsford, 2001, p.119 by Dr Leslie Burgin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. The first film director to use the facilities was Herbert Wilcox, completing London Melody (1937) featuring Anna Neagle, portions of which had already been filmed at British and Dominions Imperial Studios in Elstree, before a fire there halted production. The first film to be made entirely at Pinewood was Talk of the Devil (1936), directed by Carol Reed. There followed a prolific period of Pinewood and British film history, with Pinewood following the studios adopting the \\"unit system\\", an American industry practice. That enabled several pictures to be filmed simultaneously and, ultimately, Pinewood achieved the highest output of any studio in the world. =1940s= During the Second World War, Pinewood was requisitioned, and the Crown Film Unit, No. 5 Army Film and Photographic Unit, Royal Air Force Film Production Unit, and Polish Air Force Film Unit were based there. The Crown Film Unit completed many classic wartime documentaries, and Roy Boulting's Desert Victory, Humphrey Jennings' Fires Were Started, Coastal Command and Pat Jackson's Western Approaches (all 1943) were filmed there during that period. As well its use by the armed forces, the Royal Mint and Lloyd's of London were installed on sound stages at Pinewood, and were open for business for the duration of the war. The Company of Youth, the Rank Organisation acting school (often referred to as \\"The Charm School\\"), which launched several film careers, was founded in 1945. The next year, Pinewood re-opened for (non-war- related) business. Two landmarks in British film produced at Pinewood were released within two months of each other in 1948: Oliver Twist, directed by David Lean, and Powell and Pressburger's The Red Shoes. Due to a shortfall in funds, brought about by financial overspends the previous year, Rank did not have enough money to market The Red Shoes sufficiently at first in the US, but it became Rank's biggest earner up to that point, grossing over ¬£1 million (the equivalent of ¬£26 million in 2012 terms). In the same year, John Davis was appointed managing director.John Clement Obituary: Sir John Davis, The Independent, 1 July 1993 By the following year, Rank had run up an overdraft of ¬£16 millionPatricia Warren British Fiklm Studios: An Illusrtrated History, London: B. T. Batsford, 2001, p.120 (the equivalent of ¬£364.5 million in 2012), and announced a loss of ¬£3.5 million, mainly due to big budget flops. One of the largest of these had been Caesar and Cleopatra (1946), which was originally budgeted at ¬£250,000, but which eventually cost ¬£1,278,000 (the equivalent of ¬£33 million in 2012). =1950s= The Doctor film series, produced by Betty E. Box and directed by Ralph Thomas, began with Doctor in the House (1954), the most successful film at the box-office of its year in Great Britain. All of the Doctor films, running until 1970, were shot at Pinewood. The Carry On franchise began in 1958, produced on behalf of Rank by Peter Rogers (who was married to Box), and directed by Gerald Thomas (brother of Ralph). The Norman Wisdom comedies, the last of which was released in 1966, were also filmed at the facility. =1960s= Goldfinger Avenue The 1960s were buoyant years for Pinewood, which was no longer solely dependent on the Rank Organisation to fill its stages. \\"Renters\\" (producers hiring the sound stages for a film-by-film agreement) were using half of the stages as Pinewood turned into a four walls facility. The James Bond franchise began at Pinewood with the Terence Young directed Dr. No (1962), and has continued to be based at the studios since then. J. Arthur Rank (by then Lord Rank) retired as chairman in 1962 and was succeeded by John Davis, who had begun to move the Rank Organisation away from mass film production and towards more profitable and less risky businesses such as bingo and holidays. =1970s= The 1970s were an uncertain period for Pinewood and the film industry in general, with the studios being used more for television programmes, including ITC Entertainment's UFO (1970), The Persuaders! (1971), starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore, Space: 1999 (1975‚Äì1977), and Superman. =1980s= Four James Bond movies, For Your Eyes Only; Octopussy; A View to a Kill and The Living Daylights, among several other very large productions, such as Aliens and Tim Burton's Batman, were all produced at Pinewood. =1990s= Due in large part to unfavourable UK tax laws for inward investment in the UK film industry, the 1990s were precarious, and witnessed an all-time low in British film production generally. However, many large-scale productions, such as Alien 3, Tim Burton's Batman Returns and three further Bond films, GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough, kept Pinewood operating. As well, Swear It Again, the debut music video of the first single by Irish pop vocal band Westlife, was shot at the studios in 1999. The Rank Group owned the studio until 2001, when it sold Pinewood to a group led by Michael Grade and Ivan Dunleavy. The purchase of Shepperton Studios from a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, gave rise to the Pinewood Group, eventually comprising Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios, Teddington Studios, Pinewood Toronto Studios, Pinewood Indomina Studios, Pinewood Studio Berlin, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios, and a joint venture in the US with Pinewood Atlanta Studios. =2000s= In 2009, Pinewood and Shepperton received a BAFTA Award for their Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema. =2010s= The Pinewood Studios Group was subject to a hostile takeover approach in 2011. Manchester-based The Peel Group acquired a 73% stake, but Warren James Jewellers retained a 27% stake, so preventing a full takeover. As of 2012, Pinewood's management is waiting to see if the Financial Services Authority would cancel the stock market listing in recognition of the fact that nearly all the shares are held by two groups. In June 2016, five new stages and 10 new workshops were opened at Pinewood. The Walt Disney Studios announced a 10-year lease of most of the Pinewood Studios in September 2019, to start in 2020.  Stages, studios and locations  The 007 stage at Pinewood Studios in March 2006, before the July fire and rebuilding The 007 Stage was originally built for the Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and featured a massive water tank, one of the largest in Europe. The stage was destroyed by fire in 1984; it was rebuilt four months later and renamed Albert R. Broccoli's 007 Stage in time for filming to commence on A View to a Kill. Another fire on 30 July 2006 seriously damaged the stage, causing the roof to partly collapse. Construction of a new stage began on 18 September and was completed in under six months. Since then, the stage has accommodated large productions including Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), Quantum of Solace (2008) and the whole fishing village from Mamma Mia! (2008) was built on the stage. As well as the 007 Stage, which is the largest stage at any of the studios under The Pinewood Studios Group at , the studio has fifteen other stages ranging from just , to cater for productions of all sizes. One of those studios, the T Stage, is a specialist stage for both television and film productions and the Studios second largest stage at . Pinewood Studios paid tribute to Richard Attenborough's body of work by naming a purpose-built film and television stage after him. The Richard Attenborough Stage has an area of . In his absence because of illness, Lord Puttnam and Pinewood chairman Lord Grade officially unveiled the stage on 23 April 2012. Opposite it, is a post-production block named in honour of Stanley Kubrick. The studio also has two specialist TV studios, named TV One and TV Two, complete with integral galleries, TV studio floors, TV lighting grids and SD or HD facilities. Both studios stand at just under . As stated earlier, Pinewood is situated on the old estate of Heatherden Hall which still stands today. The mansion, its gardens and other parts of the studios have been used in various productions over the years. Peeping Tom (1960) shows people driving out through the main gate and has various shots in the studios (showing things behind the camera), offices and corridors. Return to the Edge of the World (1978) includes shots of director Michael Powell driving into the studio. The iconic main gate (now no longer used due to the construction of a purpose-built security entrance further along the road) also features in My Week with Marilyn (2011) when Eddie Redmayne greets Judi Dench. This film also contains many shots of the dressing-room corridors in the main make-up block. Heatherden Hall (converted to production offices) has appeared in several films: it was made to look fire-damaged and derelict for the children's film The Amazing Mr Blunden (1972) and also appeared as the Indian residence of Governor Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond in Carry on up the Khyber (1969). The studios have acres of backlots where huge sets have been built, from castles to whole villages including the Baker Street set built for Billy Wilder's The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes and Godric's Hollow from the Harry Potter film series. =Burnham Beeches and Black Park= The proximity of the ancient woodland Burnham Beeches and Black Park to Pinewood (as well as to Shepperton and Bray studios) and the outstanding natural beauty of the forest have made Burnham Beeches a desirable filming location for productions being filmed at Pinewood. Burnham Beeches has been used for a large number of films, including Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, First Knight, Goldfinger, The Princess Bride and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Fahrenheit 451 at Black Park. Many other films and TV productions have made use of the facilities on offer at the Beeches. (For a more comprehensive list, see.) =Pinewood Atlanta Studios= The studios announced in April 2013 that its first film production facility in the United States would be located south of Atlanta at a complex consisting of in Fayette County, Georgia.

Project Pinewood  In November 2007, Pinewood announced a ¬£200m expansion plan, known as Project Pinewood. If built the development would see replicas of streetscapes and zones replicating locations from the UK, Europe and the USA. Planned zones include a college campus, Amsterdam, modern European housing, Venice, Lake Como, Paris, an Amphitheatre, Prague, West coast American housing, warehousing and downtown New York sets, Chicago, Vienna, a castle, a UK canal, Chinatown and a London street market built. In addition it will also be used as residential housing, with the proposed creative community, expected to be in the region of 2000 and 2250, being integrated with the film locations. Job creation is also a key part of the plan, helping to boost the economy of both the region and the nation as a whole. Following consultations with the local community the plans changed to reflect the community's opinions and suggestions. However, the planning application was still rejected by South Bucks District Council in October 2009, following a prolonged opposition campaign by local residents, who formed a \\"Stop Project Pinewood\\" group. Pinewood appealed against the decision and a public inquiry commenced on 5 April 2011 and on 20 January 2012, it was announced that the appeal had been turned down. On 15 May 2013, local councillors in South Buckinghamshire rejected a pared down version of the expansion plans. The Chief Executive of the studios, Ivan Dunleavy, said he expected to appeal against the latest decision to the Secretary of State, Eric Pickles, who rejected the previous application, a year earlier. On 19 June 2014 it was reported that Pinewood Studios had received approval to go ahead with the multimillion-pound expansion plans which would see it rival Hollywood film sets. Enter the Pitch Pinewood Studios is one of the sponsors for the short film competition Enter the Pitch, also known as The Pitch, which launched in 2009. The Pitch is an online short film pitching competition that invites film makers to submit a project that takes inspiration from any story, character or theme in the Bible. The top ten finalists are taken to Pinewood Studios, where they pitch their film to a panel of judges who are industry professionals. The person giving the winning pitch will win an apprenticeship with industry professionals and will be mentored on how to turn their pitch into a short film. Past winners are Derelict (2009), Rahab (2010), The Black Scholes Conspiracy (2011), The Light (2012), Pulsar (2013), and Only Child (2014).  Production history  Since its beginning, Pinewood Studios has been the location for many well-known films, with the long-running James Bond and Carry On British film series making Pinewood their home.

It is generally considered a pseudoscience. The term is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to forensic document examination, due to the fact that aspects of the latter dealing with the examination of handwritten documents are occasionally referred to as graphanalysis. Graphological Analysis Graphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although supporters point to the anecdotal evidence of positive testimonials as a reason to use it for personality evaluation, empirical studies fail to show the validity claimed by its supporters. Etymology The word \\"graphology\\" is derived from grapho- (from the Greek Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒÆ, \\"writing\\") and logos (from the Greek ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ, which relates to discussion or theory).  History  Jean-Charles Gille-Maisani stated in 1991 that Juan Huarte de San Juan's 1575 Examen de ingenios para las ciencias was the first book on handwriting analysis. In American graphology, Camillo Baldi's Trattato come da una lettera missiva si conoscano la natura e qualita dello scrittore from 1622 is considered to be the first book. Around 1830 Jean-Hippolyte Michon became interested in handwriting analysis. He published his findings shortly after founding Soci√©t√© Graphologique in 1871. The most prominent of his disciples was Jules Cr√©pieux-Jamin who rapidly published a series of books that were soon published in other languages. Starting from Michon's integrative approach, Cr√©pieux-Jamin founded a holistic approach to graphology. Alfred Binet was convinced to conduct research into graphology from 1893 to 1907. He called it \\"the science of the future\\" despite rejection of his results by graphologists. After World War I, interest in graphology continued to spread in Europe as well as the United States. In Germany during the 1920s, Ludwig Klages founded and published his finding in Zeitschrift f√ºr Menschenkunde (Journal for the Study of Mankind). His major contribution to the field can be found in Handschrift und Charakter. Thea Stein Lewinson and J. Zubin modified Klage's ideas, based upon their experience working for the U.S. government, publishing their method in 1942. In 1929 Milton Bunker founded The American Grapho Analysis Society teaching graphoanalysis. This organization and its system split the American graphology world in two. Students had to choose between graphoanalysis or holistic graphology. While hard data is lacking, anecdotal evidence indicates that 10% of the members of International Graphoanalysis Society (IGAS) were expelled between 1970 and 1980. Regarding a proposed correlation between gender and handwriting style, a paper published by James Hartley in 1989 concluded that there was some evidence in support of this hypothesis.  Professional status  Although graphology had some support in the scientific community before the mid-twentieth century, more recent research rejects the validity of graphology as a tool to assess personality and job performance.Nevo, B Scientific Aspects Of Graphology: A Handbook Springfield, IL: Thomas: 1986 Today it is considered to be a pseudoscience. \\"they simply interpret the way we form these various features on the page in much the same way ancient oracles interpreted the entrails of oxen or smoke in the air. i.e., it's a kind of magical divination or fortune telling where 'like begets like'\\". Many studies have been conducted to assess its effectiveness to predict personality and job performance. Recent studies testing the validity of using handwriting for predicting personality traits and job performance have been consistently negative. In a 1987 study, graphologists were unable to predict scores on the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire using writing samples from the same people. In a 1988 study, graphologists were unable to predict scores on the Myers-Briggs test using writing samples from the same people. A 1982 meta-analysis drawn from over 200 studies concludes that graphologists were generally unable to predict any kind of personality trait on any personality test. Measures of job performance appear similarly unrelated to the handwriting metrics of graphologists. Professional graphologists using handwriting analysis were just as ineffective as lay people at predicting performance in a 1989 study. A broad literature screen done by King and Koehler confirmed dozens of studies showing the geometric aspects of graphology (slant, slope, etc.) are essentially worthless predictors of job performance. Rowan Bayne, a British psychologist who has written several studies on graphology, summarized his view of the appeal of graphology: \\"[i]t's very seductive because at a very crude level someone who is neat and well behaved tends to have neat handwriting\\", adding that the practice is \\"useless... absolutely hopeless\\". The British Psychological Society ranks graphology alongside astrology, giving them both \\"zero validity\\". Graphology was also dismissed as a pseudo-science by the skeptic James Randi in 1991. In his May 21, 2013 Skeptoid podcast episode titled \\"All About Graphology,\\" scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning reports: > In his book The Write Stuff, Barry Beyerstein summarized the work of > Geoffrey Dean, who performed probably the most extensive literature survey > of graphology ever done. Dean did a meta-analysis on some 200 studies: > >> Dean showed that graphologists have failed unequivocally to demonstrate the validity or reliability of their art for predicting work performance, aptitudes, or personality. Graphology thus fails according to the standards a genuine psychological test must pass before it can ethically be released for use on an unsuspecting public. > > Dean found that no particular school of graphology fared better than any > other... In fact, no graphologist of any stripe was able to show reliably > better performance than untrained amateurs making guesses from the same > materials. In the vast majority of studies, neither group exceeded chance > expectancy. Dunning concludes: > Other divining techniques like iridology, phrenology, palmistry, and > astrology also have differing schools of thought, require years of training, > offer expensive certifications, and fail just as soundly when put to a > scientific controlled test. Handwriting analysis does have its plausible- > sounding separation from those other techniques though, and that's the whole > \\"handwriting is brainwriting\\" idea ‚Äî traits from the brain will be > manifested in the way that it controls the muscles of the hand. > Unfortunately, this is just as unscientific as the others. No amount of > sciencey sounding language can make up for a technique failing when put to a > scientifically controlled test. =Additional specific objections= * The Barnum effect (the tendency to interpret vague statements as specifically meaningful) and the Dr. Fox effect (the tendency for supposed experts to be validated based on likeability rather than actual skill) make it difficult to validate methods of personality testing. These phenomena describe the observation that individuals will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. See, for example, Tallent (1958). Non- individualized graphological reports give credence to this criticism. * Effect Size: Dean's (1992) primary argument against the use of graphology is that the effect size is too small. Regardless of the validity of handwriting analysis, the research results imply that it is not applicable for any specific individual, but may be applicable to a group. * Vagueness: Some important principles of graphology are vague enough to allow significant room for a graphologist to skew interpretations to suit a subject or preconceived conclusion. For example, one of the main concepts in the theory of Ludwig Klages is form-niveau (or form-level): the overall level of originality, beauty, harmony, style, etc. of a person's handwriting‚Äîa quality that, according to Klages, can be perceived but not measured. According to this theory, the same sign has a positive or negative meaning depending on the subject's overall character and personality as revealed by the form-niveau. In practice, this can lead the graphologist to interpret signs positively or negatively depending on whether the subject has high or low social status.Ulfried Geuter, The Professionalization of Psychology in Nazi Germany, pp. 95‚Äì96. Cambridge University Press, 1992.  Approaches  Max Pulver supports a system called symbolic analysis in which he looks for symbols in the handwriting. = Systems of handwriting analysis = Each approach to handwriting analysis has spawned several systems. Integrative graphology focuses on strokes and their relation to personality. Graphoanalysis was the most influential system in the United States, between 1929 and 2000. The Sistema de Xandr√≥ is another method of integrative graphology. Holistic graphology is based on form, movement, and use of space. The psychogram is another method which uses specific diagrams to analyze handwriting. The Personal Worth Chart is one such method developed by the Handwriting Consultants of San Diego during the early 1980s. The psychograph is an additional psychogram method. was developed by Leslie King during the 1970s. The Wittlich Character Diagram, and the Muller-Enskat Protokol are other psychogram methods. Psychologists Leopold Szondi, Augusto Vels, and Girolamo Moretti invented their personal schools of graphology.:Moretti, Girolamo (1980) : Trattato di Grafologia. Intelligenza ‚Äì Sentimento, Padova, Ed. Messagero di S. Antonio, 12¬™ Ed.: Vels, Augusto: Tratado de Grafolog√≠a, Barcelona, Editorial Vives, 1945:Vels, Augusto: El lenguaje de la Escritura, Barcelona, Editorial Miracle, 1949.:Vels, Augusto: C√≥mo ser importante, Barcelona, P.E.A.P., 1957.: Vels, Augusto: Escritura y Personalidad, Barcelona, Editorial Herder, 468 p√°g. - 8¬™ ed.:Vels, Augusto: La Selecci√≥n de Personal y el problema humano en las empresas, Barcelona, Ed.

Four academic institutions offer an accredited degree in handwriting analysis: * The University of Urbino, Italy: MA (Graphology) * Instituto Superior Emerson, Buenos Aires, Argentina: BA (Graphology) * Centro de Estudios Superiores (CES), Buenos Aires, Argentina: BA (Graphology) * Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain: MA (Graphology) The majority of material in the field is oriented toward the Latin writing system. Courses offered in the subject reflect that bias.  Vocabulary  Every system of handwriting analysis has its own vocabulary. Even though two or more systems may share the same words, the meanings of those words may be different. The technical meaning of a word used by a handwriting analyst, and the common meaning is not congruent. Resentment, for example, in common usage, means annoyance. In Graphoanalysis, the term indicates a fear of imposition.  Legal considerations  = In Hungary = A report by the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information says that handwriting analysis without informed consent is a privacy violation. = In the United States =  Sex and handwriting  A 1991 review of the then-current literature concluded that respondents were able to predict the gender of handwriting between 57-78% of the time. However, most of these samples, as well as subsequent studies, are based on small sample sizes that are collected nonrandomly. A much larger and more recent survey of over 3,000 participants only found a classification accuracy of 54%.http://blog.survata.com/identifying-gender-by-handwriting-youre-probably- not-as-good-at-it-as-you- think#:~:text=Gender%20equality&text;=Men%20identified%20male%20handwriting%20successfully,of%2049%25%20to%2045%25 As statistical discrimination below .7 is generally considered unacceptable, this indicates that most results are rather inaccurate, and that variation in results observed are likely due to sampling technique and bias. The reason for this bias varies; while it has been speculated as being contributed to by biology due to fine motor skills, however this explanation is flawed due to a lack of direct evidence, a lack of large differences in motor skills by gender, and any differences remaining being nonuniform and explainable by culture.. Instead, explanations rooted in culture and gender bias may better explain the data.https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1510&context;=gsurc  Employment law A 2001 advisory opinion letter from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission responded to a question regarding \\"whether it is legal to use an analysis of an applicant's handwriting as an employment screening tool. You also ask whether it is legal to ask the applicant's age and use of medications to allow for variants in his/her handwriting.\\" The letter advised that in this circumstance, it was illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to ask a job applicant whether he or she is taking any medications, and also advised that asking an applicant for his or her age \\"allegedly to allow for variants in analyzing his/her handwriting\\" was not a per se violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), but could be significant evidence of age discrimination. The letter also said that there was no judicial guidance on \\"whether a policy of excluding applicants based upon their handwriting has an adverse impact on a protected group\\" under the ADA, ADEA, or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Applications  = Employment profiling = A company takes a writing sample provided by an applicant, and proceeds to do a personality profile, matching the congruency of the applicant with the ideal psychological profile of employees in the position. Applicant can also malpractice in this system; they may ask someone to write on their behalf. A graphological report is meant to be used in conjunction with other tools, such as comprehensive background checks, practical demonstration or record of work skills. Graphology supporters state that it can complement but not replace traditional hiring tools. Research in employment suitability has ranged from complete failure. ; to guarded success. The most substantial reason for not using handwriting analysis in the employment process is the absence of evidence of a direct link between handwriting analysis and various measures of job performance. The use of graphology in the hiring process has been criticized on ethical grounds and on legal grounds in the United States. = Psychological analysis = Graphology has been used clinically by European counselors and psychotherapists. When it is used, it is generally used alongside other projective personality assessment tools, and not in isolation. It is often used within individual psychotherapy, marital counseling, or vocational counseling.Poizner, Annette (2012). Clinical Graphology: An Interpretive Manual for Mental Health Practitioners. Springfield, IL: Charles C Thomas Publishers =Marital compatibility= In its simplest form only sexual expression and sexual response are examined. At its most complex, every aspect of an individual is examined for how it affects the other individual(s) within the relationship.Karohs, Erika (1994) SSS. Pebble Beach, CA The theory is that after knowing and understanding how each individual in the relationship differs from every other individual in the relationship, the resulting marriage will be more enduring. With a comparative analysis receiving and non-receiving parts responses are measured.IGAS (1976) MGA. Chicago, IL: IGAS = Medical diagnosis = Medical graphology is probably the most controversial branch of handwriting analysis. Strictly speaking, such research is not graphology as described throughout this article but an examination of factors pertaining to motor control. Research studies have been conducted in which a detailed examination of handwriting factors, particularly timing, fluidity, pressure, and consistency of size, form, speed, and pressure are considered in the process of evaluating patients and their response to pharmacological therapeutic agents. The study of these phenomena is a by- product of researchers investigating motor control processes and the interaction of nervous, anatomical, and biomechanical systems of the body. The Vanguard Code of Ethical Practice, amongst others, prohibits medical diagnosis by those not licensed to do diagnosis in the state in which they practice. = Graphotherapy = This is the pseudoscience of changing a person's handwriting with the goal of changing features of his or her personality, or \\"handwriting analysis in reverse.\\" It originated in France during the 1930s, spreading to the United States in the late 1950s. The purported therapy consists of a series of exercises which are similar to those taught in basic calligraphy courses, sometimes in conjunction with music or positive self-talk.

Anastasia was the younger sister of Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, and Maria, and was the elder sister of Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia. She was killed with her family by a group of Bolsheviks in Yekaterinburg on July 17, 1918. Persistent rumors of her possible escape circulated after her death, fueled by the fact that the location of her burial was unknown during the decades of Communist rule. The abandoned mine serving as a mass grave near Yekaterinburg which held the acidified remains of the Tsar, his wife, and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991. These remains were put to rest at Peter and Paul Fortress in 1998. The bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and the remaining daughter‚Äîeither Anastasia or her older sister Maria‚Äîwere discovered in 2007. Her possible survival has been conclusively disproved. Scientific analysis including DNA testing confirmed that the remains are those of the imperial family, showing that all four grand duchesses were killed in 1918. Several women falsely claimed to have been Anastasia; the best known impostor is Anna Anderson. Anderson's body was cremated upon her death in 1984, but DNA testing in 1994 on available pieces of Anderson's tissue and hair showed no relation to the Romanov family.Massie (1995), pp. 194‚Äì229 Biography = Early years = Grand Duchess Anastasia in 1904 Grand Duchess Anastasia in a formal portrait taken in 1906 When Anastasia was born, her parents and extended family were disappointed that she was a girl. They had hoped for a son who would have become heir apparent to the throne. Tsar Nicholas II went for a long walk to compose himself before going to visit Tsarina Alexandra and the newborn Anastasia for the first time.Massie (1967), p. 153 The fourth grand duchess was named for the fourth-century martyr St. Anastasia, known as \\"the breaker of chains\\" Rappaport, Helen The Romanov Sisters. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2014, pp. 59‚Äì60 because, in honor of her birth, her father pardoned and reinstated students who had been imprisoned for participating in riots in St. Petersburg and Moscow the previous winter. \\"Anastasia\\" is a Greek name (ŒëŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒØŒ±), meaning \\"of the resurrection\\", a fact often alluded to later in stories about her rumored survival. Anastasia's title is most precisely translated as \\"Grand Princess\\". \\"Grand Duchess\\" became the most widely used translation of the title into English from Russian.Zeepvat, (2004), p. xiv The Tsar's children were raised as simply as possible. They slept on hard camp cots without pillows, except when they were ill, took cold baths in the morning, and were expected to tidy their rooms and do needlework to be sold at various charity events when they were not otherwise occupied. Most in the household, including the servants, generally called the Grand Duchess by her first name and patronym, \\"Anastasia Nikolaevna\\", and did not use her title or style. She was occasionally called by the French version of her name, \\"Anastasie\\", or by the Russian nicknames \\"Nastya\\", \\"Nastas\\", or \\"Nastenka\\". Other family nicknames for Anastasia were \\"Malenkaya\\", meaning \\"little (one)\\" in Russian,Kurth (1983), p. 309 or \\"Schwipsig\\", meaning \\"merry little one\\"Rappaport (2008), p. 82 or \\"little mischief\\"Rappaport (2014), p. 103 in German. Young Anastasia was a vivacious and energetic child, described as short and inclined to be chubby, with blue eyesMassie (1967), p. 134 and blonde hair. Margaretta Eagar, a governess to the four grand duchesses, said one person commented that the toddler Anastasia had the greatest personal charm of any child she had ever seen. While often described as gifted and bright, she was never interested in the restrictions of the school room, according to her tutors Pierre Gilliard and Sydney Gibbes. Gibbes, Gilliard, and ladies-in-waiting Lili Dehn and Anna Vyrubova described Anastasia as lively, mischievous, and a gifted actress. Her sharp, witty remarks sometimes hit sensitive spots. Anastasia's daring occasionally exceeded the limits of acceptable behavior. \\"She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family, for in naughtiness she was a true genius\\", said Gleb Botkin, son of the court physician Yevgeny Botkin, who later died with the family at Yekaterinburg.King and Wilson (2003), p. 250 Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she would climb trees and refuse to come down. Once, during a snowball fight at the family's Polish estate, Anastasia rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana, knocking her to the ground. A distant cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, recalled that \\"Anastasia was nasty to the point of being evil\\", and would cheat, kick and scratch her playmates during games; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was.King and Wilson (2003), p. 50 She was less concerned about her appearance than her sisters. Hallie Erminie Rives, a best-selling American author and wife of an American diplomat, described how 10-year-old Anastasia ate chocolates without bothering to remove her long, white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house.Lovell (1991), pp. 35‚Äì36 Maria, Anastasia, Alexei, Olga and Tatiana at the Gulf of Finland, 1908 Anastasia and her older sister Maria were known within the family as \\"The Little Pair\\". The two girls shared a room, often wore variations of the same dress, and spent much of their time together. Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana also shared a room and were known as \\"The Big Pair\\". The four girls sometimes signed letters using the nickname OTMA, which derived from the first letters of their first names.Christopher, Kurth, Radzinsky (1995), pp. 88‚Äì89 Despite her energy, Anastasia's physical health was sometimes poor. The Grand Duchess suffered from painful bunions, which affected both of her big toes.Kurth (1983), p. 106 Anastasia had a weak muscle in her back and was prescribed twice-weekly massage. She hid under the bed or in a cupboard to put off the massage.Maylunas, Andrei, Mironenko, et al. (1997), p. 327 Anastasia's older sister, Maria, reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene, like their mother.Vorres (1965), p. 115 Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood-clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding.Zeepvat (2004), p. 175 DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from Hemophilia B, a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they might have been afflicted by the disease as well. Alexei's hemophilia was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.Massie (1995), pp. 159‚Äì61 =Association with Grigori Rasputin= Grand Duchess Anastasia with her mother, Tsarina Alexandra, in about 1908 Her mother relied on the counsel of Grigori Rasputin, a Russian peasant and wandering starets or \\"holy man,\\" and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Anastasia and her siblings were taught to view Rasputin as \\"Our Friend\\" and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Anastasia's aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Anastasia, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. \\"All the children seemed to like him,\\" Olga Alexandrovna recalled. \\"They were completely at ease with him.\\"Massie (1967), pp. 199‚Äì200 Rasputin's friendship with the imperial children was evident in some of the messages he sent to them. In February 1909, Rasputin sent the imperial children a telegram, advising them to \\"Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.\\"Maylunas, Andrei, Mironenko, et al. (1997), p. 321 However, one of the girls' governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns and wanted him barred. Nicholas asked Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future. The children were aware of the tension and feared that their mother would be angered by Tyutcheva's actions. \\"I am so afr(aid) that S.I. (governess Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva) can speak ... about our friend something bad,\\" Anastasia's twelve-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to their mother on March 8, 1910. \\"I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now.\\"Maylunas, Andrei, Mironenko, et al. (1997), p. 330 Grand Duchess Anastasia with her brother Alexei Grand Duchess Anastasia in court dress in 1910 Tyutcheva was eventually fired. She took her story to other members of the family.Massie (1967), p. 208 While Rasputin's visits to the children were, by all accounts, completely innocent in nature, the family was scandalized. Tyutcheva told Nicholas's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, that Rasputin visited the girls, talked with them while they were getting ready for bed, and hugged and patted them. Tyutcheva said the children had been taught not to discuss Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff. Xenia wrote on March 15, 1910, that she couldn't understand \\"...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he's only a khlyst!)\\" In the spring of 1910, Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, a royal governess, claimed that Rasputin had raped her. Vishnyakova said the empress refused to believe her account of the assault, and insisted that \\"everything Rasputin does is holy.\\"Moss, Vladimir (2005). \\"The Mystery of Redemption\\". St. Michael's Press; retrieved February 21, 2007. Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but instead \\"they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard.\\" Vishnyakova was kept from seeing Rasputin after she made her accusation and was eventually dismissed from her post in 1913.Radzinsky (2000), pp. 129‚Äì30 However, rumors persisted and it was later whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses.Mager, Hugo. Elizabeth: Grand Duchess of Russia, Carroll and Graf Publishers, Inc., 1998 The gossip was fueled by ardent, yet by all accounts innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. \\"My dear, precious, only friend,\\" wrote Anastasia. \\"How much I should like to see you again. You appeared to me today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will come ... I think of you always, my dear, because you are so good to me ...\\" This was followed by circulation of pornographic cartoons, which depicted Rasputin having relations with the Empress, her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova.Christopher, Kurth, Radzinsky (1995), p. 115 After the scandal, Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine.Christopher, Kurth, Radzinsky (1995), p. 116 Despite the rumors, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until his murder on December 17, 1916. \\"Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed\\", Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6, 1916.Maylunas, Andrei, Mironenko, et al. (1997), p. 489 In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared \\"cold and visibly terribly upset\\" by Rasputin's death, and sat \\"huddled up closely together\\" on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov recalled that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed.Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 507 Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse by Anastasia, her mother and her sisters. She attended his funeral on December 21, 1916, and her family planned to build a church over the site of Rasputin's grave.Maylunas and Mironenko (1997), p. 511 After they were killed by the Bolsheviks, it was discovered Anastasia and her sisters were all wearing amulets bearing Rasputin's picture and a prayer.Robert K. Massie, The Romanovs: The Final Chapter p. 8 =World War I and Russian Revolution= During World War I, Anastasia, along with her sister Maria, visited wounded soldiers at a private hospital in the grounds at Tsarskoye Selo. The two teenagers, too young to become Red Cross nurses like their mother and elder sisters, played games of checkers and billiards with the soldiers and tried to lift their spirits. Felix Dassel, who was treated at the hospital and knew Anastasia, recalled that the grand duchess had a \\"laugh like a squirrel\\", and walked rapidly \\"as though she tripped along.\\"Kurth (1983), p. 187 In February 1917, Anastasia and her family were placed under house arrest at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo during the Russian Revolution. Nicholas II abdicated on . As the Bolsheviks approached, Alexander Kerensky of the Provisional Government had them moved to Tobolsk, Siberia.King and Wilson (2003), pp. 57‚Äì59 After the Bolsheviks seized majority control of Russia, Anastasia and her family were moved to the Ipatiev House, or House of Special Purpose, at Yekaterinburg.King and Wilson (2003), pp. 78‚Äì102 The stress and uncertainty of captivity took their toll on Anastasia as well as her family. \\"Goodby \\", she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917. \\"Don't forget us.\\"Kurth (1983), p. xiv At Tobolsk, she wrote a melancholy theme for her English tutor, filled with spelling mistakes, about \\"Evelyn Hope\\", a poem by Robert Browning about a girl: > \\"When she died she was only sixteen years old ... Ther(e) was a man who > loved her without having seen her but (k)new her very well. And she he(a)rd > of him also. He never could tell her that he loved her, and now she was > dead. But still he thought that when he and she will live [their] next life > whenever it will be that ...\\", she wrote. At Tobolsk, she and her sisters sewed jewels into their clothing in hopes of hiding them from their captors, since Alexandra had written to warn them that she, Nicholas and Maria had been searched upon arriving in Yekaterinburg, and had items confiscated. Their mother used predetermined code words \\"medicines\\" and \\"Sednev's belongings\\" for the jewels. Letters from Demidova to Tegleva gave the instructions.Robert Wilton, Last Days of the Romanovs, 1920, p. 30 Pierre Gilliard recalled his last sight of the children at Yekaterinburg: > \\"The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window > carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses > loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but > was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I came back to the > window. Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling > to drag a heavy brown valise. It was raining and I saw her feet sink into > the mud at every step. Nagorny tried to come to her assistance; he was > roughly pushed back by one of the commisars ...\\"Bokhanov, Knodt, Oustimenko, > Peregudova, Tyutynnik (1993), p. 310 Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden told of her sad last glimpse of Anastasia: > \\"Once, standing on some steps at the door of a house close by, I saw a hand > and a pink-sleeved arm opening the topmost pane. According to the blouse the > hand must have belonged either to the Grand Duchess Marie or Anastasia. They > could not see me through their windows, and this was to be the last glimpse > that I was to have of any of them!\\" Grand Duchesses Anastasia, Maria, and Tatiana Nikolaevna at Tsarskoye Selo in the spring of 1917 However, even in the last months of her life, she found ways to enjoy herself. She and other members of the household performed plays for the enjoyment of their parents and others in the spring of 1918. Anastasia's performance made everyone howl with laughter, according to her tutor Sydney Gibbes.Christopher, Kurth, Radzinsky (1995), p. 177 In a May 7, 1918, letter from Tobolsk to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia described a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: > \\"We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was > so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about it so many times yesterday > that they got quite fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times ... > What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy.\\"Maylunas and > Mironenko (1997), p. 619 In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as \\"very friendly and full of fun\\", while another guard said Anastasia was \\"a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus.\\" Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess \\"offensive and a terrorist\\" and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks.King and Wilson (2003), p. 251 Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.Massie (1995), p. 288 In the summer, the privations of the captivity, including their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family. According to some accounts, at one point Anastasia became so upset about the locked, painted windows that she opened one to look outside and get fresh air. A sentry reportedly saw her and fired, narrowly missing her. She did not try again.Robert Wilton, Last Days of the Romanovs, p. 407 On July 14, 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, \\"Something has happened to them in there.\\"Helen Rappaport, Last Days of the Romanovs, Tragedy at Ekaterinburg, pp. 162‚Äì63 But the next day, on July 15, 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards were not watching. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, when he momentarily turned his back and left the room.Helen Rappaport, The Last Days of the Romanovs, St. Martin's Griffin, 2008, p. 172 =Captivity and death= Grand Duchesses Maria and Anastasia making faces for the camera in Tsarskoye Selo, around 1917 After the Bolshevik revolution in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations for the release of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled.King and Wilson (2003), p. 203 As the Whites (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was that the family had been murdered. This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at Ganina Yama.King and Wilson (2003), pp. 353‚Äì67 The \\"Yurovsky Note\\", an account of the event filed by Yurovsky to his Bolshevik superiors following the killings, was found in 1989 and detailed in Edvard Radzinsky's 1992 book, The Last Tsar. According to the note, on the night of the deaths, the family was awakened and told to dress. They were told they were being moved to a new location to ensure their safety in anticipation of the violence that might ensue when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg. Once dressed, the family and the small circle of servants who had remained with them were herded into a small room in the house's sub-basement and told to wait. Alexandra and Alexei sat in chairs provided by guards at the Empress's request. After several minutes, the guards entered the room, led by Yurovsky, who quickly informed the Tsar and his family that they were to be executed. The Tsar had time to say only \\"What?\\" and turn to his family before he was killed by several bullets to the chest (not, as is commonly stated, to the head; his skull, recovered in 1991, bears no bullet wounds).Rappaport (2008), p. 180 The Tsarina and her daughter Olga tried to make the sign of the cross but were killed in the initial volley of bullets fired by the executioners. The rest of the Imperial retinue were shot in short order, with the exception of Anna Demidova, Alexandra's maid. Demidova survived the initial onslaught but was quickly stabbed to death against the back wall of the basement while trying to defend herself with a small pillow she had carried into the sub-basement that was filled with precious gems and jewels.Radzinsky (1992), pp. 380‚Äì93 Grand Duchesses Tatiana and Anastasia and the dog Ortino in captivity at Tsarskoe Selo in the spring of 1917 The \\"Yurovsky Note\\" further reported that once the thick smoke that had filled the room from so many weapons being fired in such close proximity cleared, it was discovered that the executioners' bullets had ricocheted off the corsets of two or three of the Grand Duchesses. The executioners later came to find out that this was because the family's crown jewels and diamonds had been sewn inside the linings of the corsets to hide them from their captors. The corsets thus served as a form of \\"armor\\" against the bullets. Anastasia and Maria were said to have crouched up against a wall, covering their heads in terror, until they were shot down by bullets, recalled Yurovsky. However, another guard, Peter Ermakov, told his wife that Anastasia had been finished off with bayonets. As the bodies were carried out, one or more of the girls cried out, and were clubbed on the back of the head, wrote Yurovsky. False reports of survival Anastasia's supposed escape and possible survival was one of the most popular historical mysteries of the 20th century, provoking many books and films. At least ten women claimed to be her, offering varying stories as to how she had survived. Anna Anderson, the best known Anastasia impostor, first surfaced publicly between 1920 and 1922. She contended that she had feigned death among the bodies of her family and servants, and was able to make her escape with the help of a compassionate guard who noticed she was still breathing and took sympathy upon her.Kurth (1983), pp. 33‚Äì39 Her legal battle for recognition from 1938 to 1970 continued a lifelong controversy and was the longest running case ever heard by the German courts, where it was officially filed. The final decision of the court was that Anderson had not provided sufficient proof to claim the identity of the grand duchess. Anderson died in 1984 and her body was cremated. DNA tests were conducted in 1994 on a tissue sample from Anderson located in a hospital and the blood of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a great-nephew of Empress Alexandra. According to Dr Gill who conducted the tests, \\"If you accept that these samples came from Anna Anderson, then Anna Anderson could not be related to Tsar Nicholas or Tsarina Alexandra.\\" Anderson's mitochondrial DNA was a match with a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska, a missing Polish factory worker. Some supporters of Anderson's claim acknowledged that the DNA tests proving she could not have been the Grand Duchess had \\"won the day\\".Christopher, Kurth, and Radzinsky (1995), p. 218Anastasia Dead or Alive?

Season 23 Ep. 1. Other lesser known claimants were Nadezhda Ivanovna VasilyevaMassie (1995), pp. 145‚Äì46 and Eugenia Smith.Massie (1995), p. 157 Two young women claiming to be Anastasia and her sister Maria were taken in by a priest in the Ural Mountains in 1919 where they lived as nuns until their deaths in 1964. They were buried under the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna.Massie (1995), p. 146 Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna in captivity at Tobolsk in the spring of 1918 Rumors of Anastasia's survival were embellished with various contemporary reports of trains and houses being searched for \\"Anastasia Romanov\\" by Bolshevik soldiers and secret police.Kurth (1983), p. 44 When she was briefly imprisoned at Perm in 1918, Princess Helena Petrovna, the wife of Anastasia's distant cousin, Prince John Constantinovich of Russia, reported that a guard brought a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked if the girl was the daughter of the Tsar. Helena Petrovna said she did not recognize the girl and the guard took her away.Kurth (1983), p. 43 Although other witnesses in Perm later reported that they saw Anastasia, her mother and sisters in Perm after the murders, this story is now widely discredited. Rumors that they were alive were fueled by deliberate misinformation designed to hide the fact that the family was dead. A few days after they had been murdered, the German government sent several telegrams to Russia demanding \\"the safety of the princesses of German blood\\". Russia had recently signed a peace treaty with the Germans, and did not want to upset them by letting them know the women were dead, so they told them they had been moved to a safer location.Alexeev, V. V., \\"Last Act of a Tragedy\\", documents from German government files discovered by Sokolov. In another incident, eight witnesses reported the recapture of a young woman after an apparent escape attempt in September 1918 at a railway station at Siding 37, northwest of Perm. These witnesses were Maxim Grigoyev, Tatiana Sitnikova (and her son Fyodor Sitnikov), Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina, Vassily Ryabov, Ustinya Varankina, and Dr Pavel Utkin, a physician who treated the girl after the incident.Occleshaw (1993), p. 46 Some of the witnesses identified the girl as Anastasia when they were shown photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators. Utkin also told the White Russian Army investigators that the injured girl, whom he treated at Cheka headquarters in Perm, told him, \\"I am the daughter of the ruler, Anastasia.\\" Utkin obtained a prescription from a pharmacy for a patient named \\"N\\" at the orders of the secret police. White Army investigators later independently located records for the prescription.Occleshaw (1993), p. 47 During the same time period in mid-1918, there were several reports of young people in Russia passing themselves off as Romanov escapees. Boris Soloviev, the husband of Rasputin's daughter Maria, defrauded prominent Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov impostor to escape to China. Soloviev also found young women willing to masquerade as one of the grand duchesses to assist in deceiving the families he had defrauded. Some biographers' accounts speculated that the opportunity for one or more of the guards to rescue a survivor existed. Yakov Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the murder. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were reportedly left in the basement with the bodies.King and Wilson (2003), p. 314 Romanov graves and DNA proof From left to right, Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, Tsar Nicholas II, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia and Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia in captivity at Tobolsk in the winter of 1917 In 1991, the presumed burial site of the imperial family and their servants was excavated in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who were still ruling Russia at the time. The grave only held nine of the expected eleven sets of remains. DNA and skeletal analysis matched these remains to Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of the four grand duchesses (Olga, Tatiana and presumably Maria). The other remains, with unrelated DNA, correspond to the family's doctor (Yevgeny Botkin), their valet (Alexei Trupp), their cook (Ivan Kharitonov), and Alexandra's maid (Anna Demidova). Forensic expert William R. Maples decided that the Tsarevitch Alexei and Anastasia's bodies were missing from the family's grave. Russian scientists contested this conclusion, however, claiming it was the body of Maria that was missing. The Russians identified the body as that of Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest grand duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave. They estimated the height and width of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact.Massie (1995), p. 67 American scientists thought the missing body to be Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they would have expected to find in a seventeen-year-old. In 1998, when the remains of the imperial family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5'7\\" (1.70 m) was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of her standing beside her three sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Anastasia was several inches shorter than all of them. Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia aboard the Rus, the ship that ferried her to Yekaterinburg in May 1918. This is the last known photograph of Anastasia. The account of the \\"Yurovsky Note\\" indicated that two of the bodies were removed from the main grave and cremated at an undisclosed area in order to further disguise the burials of the Tsar and his retinue, if the remains were discovered by the Whites, since the body count would not be correct. Searches of the area in subsequent years failed to turn up a cremation site or the remains of the two missing Romanov children.King and Wilson (2003), p. 469 However, on August 23, 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky's memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones were from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three years old. Anastasia was seventeen years and one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Anastasia's elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old respectively at the time of the assassination. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found \\"shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber\\". The site was initially found with metal detectors and by using metal rods as probes. DNA testing by multiple international laboratories including the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory and Innsbruck Medical University confirmed that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters, proving conclusively that all family members, including Anastasia, died in 1918. The parents and all five children are now accounted for, and each has his or her own unique DNA profile. While the tests have confirmed that all the Romanov bodies have been found, one of the studies was still unsure which body from the two graves was Maria's and which was Anastasia's: > [‚Ä¶] a well publicized debate over which daughter, Maria (according to > Russian experts) or Anastasia (according to US experts), has been recovered > from the second grave cannot be settled based upon the DNA results reported > here. In the absence of a DNA reference from each sister, we can only > conclusively identify Alexei ‚Äì the only son of Nicholas and Alexandra. Sainthood In 2000, Anastasia and her family were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church. The family had previously been canonized in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs. The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were finally interred in the St. Catherine Chapel at Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, St Petersburg on July 17, 1998, eighty years after they were murdered. As of 2018 the bones of Alexei and Anastasia (or possibly Maria) were still being held by the Orthodox Church.Russian Orthodox Church Blocks Funeral for Last of Romanov Remains Influence on culture A forensic facial reconstruction of Grand Duchess Anastasia by S. A. Nikitin, 1994 The purported survival of Anastasia has been the subject of cinema (such as the 1997 animated film), made-for-television films, and a Broadway musical. The earliest, made in 1928, was called Clothes Make the Woman. The story followed a woman who turns up to play the part of a rescued Anastasia for a Hollywood film, and ends up being recognized by the Russian soldier who originally rescued her from her would-be assassins.Harlow Robinson, Russians in Hollywood, Hollywood's Russians: biography of an image, Northeastern University Press, 2007, p. 27 Ancestry Notes References * Bokhanov, Alexander; Knodt, Manfred; Oustimenko, Vladimir; Peregudova, Zinaida; Tyutynnik, Lyubov (1993).

History DFL logo used on a lectern at the 2006 DFL state convention. DFL 2006 state convention registration desk. The DFL was created on April 15, 1944, with the merger of the Minnesota Democratic Party and the larger Farmer‚ÄìLabor Party. Leading the merger effort were Elmer Kelm, the head of the Minnesota Democratic Party and the founding chairman of the DFL; Elmer Benson, effectively the head of the Farmer‚ÄìLabor Party by virtue of his leadership of its dominant left-wing faction; and rising star Hubert H. Humphrey, who chaired the Fusion Committee that accomplished the union and then went on to chair its first state convention. By the party's second convention in 1946, tensions had re-emerged between members of the two former parties. While the majority of delegates supported left-wing policies, Humphrey managed to install a more conservative ally, Orville Freeman, as party secretary. Some Farmer‚ÄìLabor leaders such as Benson moved to the Progressive Party. Freeman was elected the state's first DFL governor in 1954. Important members of the party have included Humphrey and Walter Mondale, who each went on to be United States senators, vice presidents of the United States, and unsuccessful Democratic nominees for president; Eugene McCarthy, a U.S. senator who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968 as an anti-Vietnam War candidate; and Paul Wellstone, a U.S. senator from 1991 to 2002 who became an icon of populist progressivism.

When sweep picking, the guitarist plays single notes on consecutive strings with a 'sweeping' motion of the pick, while using the fretting hand to produce a specific series of notes that are fast and fluid in sound. Both hands essentially perform an integral motion in unison to achieve the desired effect. History The technique was first used and developed by jazz guitarists Les Paul, Chet Atkins, Tal Farlow and Barney Kessel in the 1950s, as well as rock guitarists Jan Akkerman, Ritchie Blackmore and Steve Hackett in the 1970s. In the 1980s, sweep picking became widely known for its use by shred guitarists including Yngwie Malmsteen, Jason Becker, Tony MacAlpine and Marty Friedman. Jazz fusion guitarist Frank Gambale released several books and instructional videos about the technique, of which the most well-known is Monster Licks & Speed Picking in 1988.Prasad, Anil (2014-01-30). \\"Steve Hackett Revisits Genesis' Classics\\". Guitar Player. NewBay Media. Retrieved 2015-06-14.Griffiths, Charlie (2015-03-24). \\"Big Strokes: A Beginner's Guide to Sweep Picking\\". Guitar World. NewBay Media. Retrieved 2015-06-14. Application Guitarists often use the technique to play arpeggios at high speed. A common fretting shape is the one- or two-octave stacked triad. In scalar terms, this is the first (tonic), third (mediant) and fifth (dominant) of a scale, played twice, with an additional tonic added at the high end. For example, an A minor stacked triad is A-C-E-A-C-E-A. When the guitarist plays such a series of notes quickly up and down as an arpeggio, the phrasing sounds typical of pianos and other instruments more associated with such arpeggios. Unlike pianos, woodwinds, and many other instruments, the guitarist can change key by moving the same arpeggio shape up and down the fretboard. Compared to other techniques, such as alternate picking, sweep picking requires few strokes. In some instances, however, a guitarist uses hammer-ons and pull-offs to produce a legato sound instead of actual pick strokes. This applies when a certain string must sound two notes in the shape due to the natural limits of a fretted string instrument. However, as with all guitar techniques, individual players may integrate sweep picking into existing repertoire and use it in an individually stylistic manner. Therefore, some guitarists use legato techniques and others double-pick multiple notes on a single string. These are separate yet related techniques that produce obvious differences in legato versus struck notes, as well as shift in the timing of the entire arpeggio. Furthering the idea, most players who master the basic sweep picking pattern use only parts of it, or alter the technique to achieve a certain lick. In this sense, sweep picking is not so much a concrete action such as the aforementioned alternate picking, but instead is a technical idea with many possible applications in all genres of music. Practical examples A simple example of the technique is the use of the three-string sweep arpeggio done on the upper three (thinnest) strings. Beginning on the middle tonic of this progression, the player may sweep first up the arpeggio and then back down to resolve on the initial tonic. This would notate as A-C-E-A-E-C-A. Written in tablature form for the twelfth position, it would be seen as: e-12-17-12- B1313 G-14 14- D A E If one then adds to it the lower octave of the arpeggio, the complete shape (in this particular position) is seen as: e12-17-12 B-13 13- G1414 D-14 14- A-12-1515-12- E In the middle of the above sequence, on the third and fourth string, the guitarist must finger the same fret for both strings. There are more fingerings than humans have fingers, though both of these problems are solved by first fretting the initial string (fourth on the downstroke) with the tip of the ring finger, then rolling into the next string by fretting it with the pad of the same finger. In the upstroke, one frets the third string first, reversing the rolling action. Also note that on the lowest and highest strings in the shape, two notes must be played immediately following each other, but on the same string. This is where legato comes into effect, so that the guitarist can sustain a fluid picking motion. However, the guitarist can sound these notes in the arpeggio through other techniques‚Äîincluding changing pick articulation, double-picking notes (with an additional upstroke or downstroke), legato, or sliding, though the latter is less common because it requires acute control to slide to a precise point. A guitarist may continue a sweep to the next note by tapping to play passing notes outside the classic arpeggio. Sweep picking is not limited to a few note patterns. Guitarists can construct as many patterns as there are chords, and apply sweep picking to any idea‚Äîarpeggio or otherwise.

Early life  He was born in Pisa. In 1968 Ortolani moved to Parma, where he still lives with his wife Caterina and his adoptive daughters Johanna and Lucy Maria. From an early age, Ortolani showed a great passion for the world of comic books, and in particular The Fantastic Four by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, which will affect its style of narrative. After finishing high school, he enrolled at the University of Parma to study Geology. While at university, Ortolani draws his characters first, and the theme of geology became a catchphrase of the first issues of his major work, Rat-Man.  Career  = First works and the creation of Rat-Man = In 1989 joined publishing house Comic Art to work on two stories: the tragic and the other comic. Publisher Rinaldo Traini published the comic story on the second Spot (supplement of Eternauta dedicated to beginners), marking the Birth of Rat-Man. The shocking origins of Rat-Man earned Ortolani an award for best newcomer by Lucca Comics of 1990. With this visibility, Leo began to collaborate with magazines and independent fanzines. For the fanzineMade in USA he created two more stories starring Rat- Man ( Topin! The Wonder Mouse! And From the Future) and several parodies of superheroes (including X-Men, Fantastic Four and Superman). The most important works of this cycle are his four parodies of the Fantastic Four. Kirby stopped drawing Fantastic Four at issue #102. Ortolani wrote numbers 103-106, completely upsetting the group. Called to military service in the Air Force, Ortolani drew inspiration from life in the barracks, gathering his experiences in a detailed diary that became the starting point for The last rookie, a strip on military life (the same as the protagonist Ortolani) which were published as an appendix to Storm Trooper. During this period, Ortolani also collaborated on the Starcom√¨x humor magazine directed by Luca Boschi and published by Star Comics in Totem Comic and Totem Extra, where he made The impervious, Clan, The wonder of nature and The wonders of technology. In this period he also stripped the series Those of Parma, published in the Gazzetta di Parma, speaking of the city of Parma and its inhabitants, a selection of which was collected in the volume Editions Bands Dessin√©e. The short stories of the series of Wonderland were taken years later, collected in three volumes by Panini Comics. = Popularity and the contract with Marvel Italia = In 1995 Leo Ortolani published Venerd√¨ 12 as a series of the comic magazine L'isola che non c'√®. That same year, Ortolani chose to self-publish the comic book series Rat-Man alongside his primary job as a geologist; however, in 1997 Leo signed a contract with Marvel Italia, today a brand owned by Panini Comics (and, at the time, a branch of Marvel Comics itself), to publish the comic under the Marvel brand, which allowed Leonardo to become a full-time comics author. The contract also allowed him to use popular Marvel characters like Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Doctor Doom and Elektra in Rat-Man stories; however, copyright problems have since prohibited such use of characters in the Rat-Man world. = Successful parodies = Ortolani created several popular parodies of famous works of fiction and blockbusters in his Rat-Man stories. In 1999 Leo Ortolani created Star Rats, a parody of Star Wars. In 2004 he created Il Signore dei Ratti, a parody of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In 2005 Ortolani published Star Rats - Episodio I, a parody of Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace, which was the best selling Panini Comics book in the release month. In 2007 Ortolani created 299+1, a parody of 300 and one of his best works. In 2009 he created Ratto, a parody of Rambo films. In 2010 he published Avarat, a parody of Avatar. In 2011 Leo Ortolani created La Quadrilogia dei Sacrificabili, a parody of The Expendables series, that won the award \\"Fede a strisce 2011\\" at RiminiComix. In 2012 he created Il Grande Magazzi, a parody of Harry Potter and Twilight series. That same year he published also Allen, a parody of Alien. In 2014 Leo Ortolani published Star Rats - Episodio II, a parody of Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, and then soon after in 2015 he published also Star Rats - Episodio III, a parody of Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith. = The end of the series Rat-Man = In 2016 Ortolani stated his intention to close the series Rat-Man with issue #122, which was published around September 2017.

This was the second of six case histories that Freud published, and the first in which he claimed that the patient had been cured by psychoanalysis. The nickname derives from the fact that among the patient's many compulsions was an obsession with nightmarish fantasies about rats.Sigmund Freud, Case Histories II (PFL 9) p. 93 To protect the anonymity of patients, psychoanalytic case studies usually withheld or disguised the names of the individuals concerned (Anna O., Little Hans, Wolf Man, Dora, etc.).Katz, Maya Balakirsky (2011). \\"A Rabbi, A Priest, and a Psychoanalyst: Religion in the Early Psychoanalytic Case History\\". Contemporary Jewry 31 (1): 3‚Äì24. doi:10.1007/s12397-010-9059-y Recent researchers have decided that the \\"Rat Man\\" was in fact a clever lawyer named Ernst Lanzer (1878‚Äì1914)‚Äîthough many other sources maintain that the man's name was Paul Lorenz.  History of the analysis  Lanzer first came to Freud in October 1907 complaining of obsessive fears and compulsive impulses. Freud treated his patient for a little over three months on a regular daily basis. The treatment was irregular for the next three months and sporadic, at best, after that. Lanzer's principal fear was that something terrible was going to happen to his father and a female friend (who later became his wife). His fear had grown out of an account he heard from a fellow army officer concerning a Chinese torture method in which a large pot containing a live rat was strapped to the buttocks of the victim, and the rat, encouraged by a red-hot poker, would gnaw its way out through the victim's anus. Lanzer claimed that he fantasized about murder and suicide, and he developed a number of compulsive irrational behavior patterns. For example, he mentioned his habit of opening the door to his flat between 12 midnight and 1:00 A.M., apparently so that his father's ghost could enter. Lanzer would then stare at his penis, sometimes using a mirror. Freud encouraged Lanzer to discuss details of his sex life (such as his first efforts at masturbation at age 20) and focused on a number of verbal associations with the word \\"Ratten\\" (\\"rats\\"). According to Freud's analysis, Lanzer unconsciously identified himself with rats: that is, Lanzer was unconsciously fantasizing that he ‚Äì a rat and a biter ‚Äì was having anal intercourse with his father and with his lady friend. Lanzer was verbally clever and introduced Freud to Nietzsche's phrase (which Freud later cited) \\"'I did this,' says my Memory. 'I cannot have done this,' says my Pride, and remains inexorable. In the end ‚Äì Memory yields.\\"Quoted in L. Appignanesi/J, Forrester, Freud's Women (2004) p. 113 Freud retold the saying more than once, and it was used by later therapists such as Fritz Perls.F. Perls, Gestalt Therapy Verbatim (1972) p. 45 Lanzer broke off his analysis with Freud after a relatively brief period and well before his transference had been fully resolved. Just after Freud had completed the written version of the case history in October 1909, he confessed to Jung that his patient was having ongoing problems. Lanzer was killed in World War I, and later researchers were unable to interview him.  Freud's write-up: \\"Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis\\"  Freud was led to publish the Rat Man case history, because he was feeling pressured to show the world that psychoanalysis could achieve successful therapeutic results. Because the Rat Man previously consulted Julius von Wagner-Jauregg, Freud's eminent psychiatric colleague at the University of Vienna, the case was a particularly critical test of Freud's therapeutic abilities. Before October 1908, when he communicated this case history at the first International Psychoanalytic Congress in Salzburg, Austria, Freud had yet to publish the results of a successful psychoanalysis. The case study was published in 1909 in Germany. Freud saw the Rat Man patient for some six months despite later claiming the treatment lasted about a year.Mahony: Freud and the Rat Man, page 69. Yale University Press, 1986 He considered the treatment a success. The patient presented with obsessional thoughts and with behaviors that he felt compelled to carry out,Freud, p. 39 which had been precipitated by the loss/replacement of his pince-nez and the problem of paying for them, combined with the impact of a story he heard from a fellow officer about a torture wherein rats would eat their way into the anal cavity of the victim.Elisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (2005) p. 214-5 The patient then felt a compulsion to imagine that this fate was befalling two people dear to him, specifically his father and his fianc√©e. The irrational nature of this obsession is revealed by the fact that the man had the greatest regard for his fianc√©e and that his revered father had been dead for some years.Freud, p. 48 Freud theorized that these obsessive ideas and similar thoughts were produced by conflicts consisting of the combination of loving and aggressive impulses relating to the people concerned ‚Äì what Eugen Bleuler later called ambivalence.Freud, p. 119 The Rat Man often defended himself against his own thoughts. He had had a secret thought that he wished his father would die so he could inherit all of his money and become rich enough to marry, before shaming himself by fantasizing that his father would die and leave him nothing. The patient even goes so far as to fantasize about marrying Freud's daughter, believing (Freud writes) that \\"the only reason I was so kind and incredibly patient with him was that I wanted to have him for a son-in- law\\"Freud, p. 80 ‚Äì a matter linked in the transference to his conflicts between his mother's wish for him to marry rich like his father and his fianc√©e's poverty.Roudinesco, p. 214-5 In addition, the symptoms were believed to keep the patient from needing to make difficult decisions in his current life, and to ward off the anxiety that would be involved in experiencing the angry and aggressive impulses directly. The patient's older sister and father had died, and these losses were considered, along with his suicidal thoughts and his tendency, to form part of the tissue of phantasies, verbal associations and symbolic meanings in which he was trapped.Freud, p. 88n Freud believed that they had their origin in the Rat Man's sexual experiences of infancy, in particular harsh punishment for childhood masturbation, and the vicissitudes of sexual curiosity. In the theoretical second part of the case study, Freud elaborates on such defence mechanisms as rationalization, doubt, undoing and displacement.Freud, 122-8 In a later footnote, Freud laments that although \\"the patient's mental health was restored to him by the analysis ... like so many young men of value and promise, he perished in the Great War\\".Freud, p. 128 A number of significant discrepancies between the published case history and Freud's process notes, which were discovered among his papers after his death, have been pointed out by Patrick Mahony. According to Mahony, who is an analyst and sympathetic to the general goals of psychoanalysis, Freud's published case history is \\"muddled\\" and \\"inconsistent\\" on various matters of fact and also exhibits \\"glaring\\" omissions of information. In particular, there is an overemphasis on the father to the exclusion of the mother. Mahony states \\"Freud mixed momentous insights with exaggerated claims,\\" some of which \\"were made in his zeal to protect and promote a new discipline.\\"Mahony, Freud and the Rat Man, pp. 32, 34, 216. Legacy Jacques Lacan built his early structuralist theory around the Rat Man case, in particular the polarity of father‚Äìrich wife/son‚Äìpoor wife as an intergenerational force creating the individual neurosis.Roudinesco, p. 213-6 Freud's late note upon the Rat Man's acute sense of smell would later be developed into his theory of the process of civilisation and organic repression.Angela Richards ed., Civilisation, Society and Religion (PFL 12) p. 247 Criticism of Freud The only known case in which Freud's notes survive is that of Ernst Lanzer, the Rat-Man, where they exist for the first third of the treatment.Angela Richards, in Freud, p. 34 Freud treated him for obsessions, particularly the dread that something terrible would happen to his father and his fianc√©e. His fear of rats, Freud concluded after elaborate interpretations, was based on disguised anal erotic fantasies.Peter Gay, Freud: A Life for Our Time (1989) p. 266 Mr. Stadlen tracked down relatives of Mr. Lanzer who said the account handed down by the family was that Freud had helped him overcome shyness so that he could marry. Peter Gay concluded in Freud: A Life for Our Time (1988) that \\"apart from a handful of interesting deviations, the case history Freud published generally followed the process notes he made every night\\".Gay, p. 262 Patrick Mahony, a psychoanalyst and professor of English at the University of Montreal, has highlighted such discrepancies in his detailed study Freud and the Rat Man, published in 1986 by the Yale University Press. Dr. Mahony said Freud seems to have consistently implied that the case lasted longer than it actually did.Patrick Mahoney, 'Rat Man' He also said Freud claimed in a lecture to be able to guess the name of the Rat Man's girlfriend, Gisela, from an anagram, Glejisamen, which the patient had invented.Mahoney Actually, the notes show Freud had learned her name first, and then used it to deduce the meaning of the anagram, although in the actual case-study Freud merely states that \\"when he told it to me, I could not help noticing that the word was in fact an anagram of the name of his lady\\".Freud, p. 105 Critics have objected to Freud's downplaying of the role of the Rat Man's mother, and for several deviations on his part from what later became standard psychoanalytic practice.Gay, p. 263 and p. 266-7 =Efficacy of the treatment= Mahoney accepted that Freud obtained a degree of success in restoring his patient to functional life, though he considered Freud exaggerated the extent of this in his case-study.Mahoney Others have suggested that by concentrating on building rapport with his patient, at the expense of analyzing the negative transference, Freud merely achieved a temporary transference cure.Michael Thompson, The Truth about Freud's Technique (1995) p. 239 Lacan for his part concluded that although he did not \\"regard the Rat Man as a case that Freud cured\\", in it \\"Freud made the fundamental discoveries, which we are still living off, concerning the dynamics and structure of obsessional neurosis\\".J. Lacan, √âcrits: A Selection (1997) p. 237-8 In a letter Freud wrote to Jung, shortly after publication of the case study, he claimed of the Rat Man that \\"he is facing life with courage and ability. The one point that still gives him trouble (father-complex and transference) has shown up clearly in my conversations with this intelligent and grateful man\\"McGuire, W: The Freud/Jung Letters, page 255. Princeton University Press, 1974. ‚Äì a not insignificant reservation. But while Freud in the case-history had certainly claimed that \\"the patient's rat delirium had disappeared\\",Freud, p. 100 he had also pointed out the limited time and depth of the analysis: \\"The patient recovered, and his ordinary life began to assert its claims...which were incompatible with a continuation of the treatment\\".Freud, p. 88n As the average length of time expected of an analysis increased from months to years over the 20th century,Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis (1989) p. 151 so too the success of the Rat Man's case has perhaps come to resemble rather the symptomatic relief of brief psychotherapy or focal psychotherapy, more than the achievement of a full psychoanalysis.Gay, p. 245  References  Further reading Mark Kanzer/Jules Glenn, Freud and His Patients (1980) External links * A Short Account of Obsessional Neurosis in Freud and Lacan Pt II * Jacques Lacan's interpretation of the Rat Man case in his paper 'The Neurotic's Individual Myth' - article on LacanOnline.com * Video explaining Jacques Lacan's analysis of the Rat Man case Lanzer, Ernst Lanzer, Ernst Category:Case studies by Sigmund Freud Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud ","title":"Rat Man"},{"id":"75443","text":"Venerd√¨ 12 (Friday 12) is a comic strip series created by Italian author Leo Ortolani first published in 1996 as a series of the comic magazine L'isola che non c'√® and continued on the Rat-Man Collection, where it was also completed. It tells the story of Aldo, a man who becomes an hideous monster after being dumped by his girlfriend Bedelia, and his evil servant Giuda (Judas). Aldo's history Everything starts at school where Aldo meets and falls in love with Bedelia, a schoolmate of his who has had an affair with almost every boy at school, but him. He tries many approaches, failing miserably, til Bedelia accepts his court in order to win a bet. So Aldo, full of joy, decides to buy her, as a present for her birthday, a carillon with a dancing puppet. The salesman offers him, for free, a cursed carillon warning him: if he will give it to a woman who doesn't love him he will turn into a monster; the curse will be broken only if he will find a woman who really loves him or if he will sacrifice a virgin. Aldo doesn't care about the curse and, on a Friday 12, gives the carillon to Bedelia who, short after, breaks up with him and throws the carillon out of the window of her car, breaking its puppet. Aldo, left alone in the middle of the street, painfully turns into a monster. It's here that he meets Giuda, an extravagant runt who is searching for a master and accepts to become Aldo's evil servant. From that moment, Aldo first tries to take back Bedelia; then, helped but more often hindered by Giuda, tries to find, despite his appearance, someone who really loves him to break the curse, as it is easier than finding a virgin. In his misadventures will meet various strange women like Ciurga and Isolda and finally meets Dulcistella, his neighbour, who finally breaks the curse, on Saturday 13, making Aldo to fall in love with her. Moreover, in that moment it's also revealed that Giuda is carillon's puppet, so he turns back into the carillon ready to serve next lover who will bw cursed.

It is the successor to Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), and was released to manufacturing on June 19, 2000, with general availability on September 14, 2000. Windows Me was the last operating system released in the Windows 9x series which was targeted specifically at home PC users, and included Internet Explorer 5.5, Windows Media Player 7, and the new Windows Movie Maker software, which provided basic video editing and was designed to be easy to use for home users. Microsoft also incorporated features first introduced in Windows 2000, which had been released as a business-oriented operating system seven months earlier, into the graphical user interface, shell, and Windows Explorer. Windows Me was a continuation of the Windows 9x model and still DOS-based like its predecessors, albeit with restricted access to real mode MS-DOS in order to decrease system boot time. Windows Me was heavily panned by many users and critics, mainly due to speed and stability issues, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support. Windows Me is considered to be one of the worst operating systems of all time. Consequently, most home users remained with Windows 98, while some moved to Windows 2000 despite the latter being enterprise-oriented. In October 2001, Windows XP was released to the public, and became the successor of Windows Me, popularizing most of its features and introducing more visual themes, while being based upon the more stable Windows NT kernel. Extended support for Windows Me ended on July 11, 2006.  Development  In 1998, Microsoft stated that there would be no version of Windows 9x after Windows 98. In May 1999, however, Microsoft released Windows 98 Second Edition, and then announced a new version of Windows 9x which was later revealed to be codenamed Millennium. Derived from the enterprise-oriented Windows 2000, Microsoft originally planned for Windows Neptune to be the first consumer version of Windows based on the NT kernel, though Neptune's release was postponed in favor of finalizing project Millennium, which was released as Windows Me. Much of the work in developing Neptune was incorporated into Microsoft's next consumer release, the first NT- based one, Windows XP. At least three beta versions of Windows Me were available during its development phase. On September 24, 1999, Microsoft announced that Windows Millennium Beta 1 was released. Windows Millennium Beta 2 was released on November 24, 1999 and added a couple of new features such as System File Protection and Game Options Control Panel. Several interim builds were released between Beta 1 and 2, and added features such as automatic updates and personalized menus. Beta 3 was released on April 11, 2000, and this version marked the first appearance of its final version startup and shutdown sounds (derived from Windows 2000), as the previous betas used Windows 98's startup and shutdown sounds. The final version boot screen was first featured in Pre-Beta 3 build 2470. The general availability date of Windows Millennium Edition was September 14, 2000. At launch time, Microsoft announced a time-limited promotion from September 2000 to January 2001 which entitled Windows 95 or Windows 98 users to upgrade to Windows Me for $59.95 instead of the regular retail upgrade price of $109. Shortly after Windows Me was released to manufacturing on June 19, 2000, Microsoft launched a campaign- initiative to promote Windows Me in the U.S., which they dubbed the Meet Me Tour. A national partnered promotional program featured Windows Me, OEMs and other partners in an interactive multimedia attraction in 25 cities across the U.S. It was launched on September 14, 2000. Both the \\"Windows Me\\" and \\"Windows ME\\" spellings are used when referring to the operating system, with \\"Windows Me\\" being the official spelling used by Microsoft. Compared with other releases of Windows, Windows Me had a short shelf-life of just over a year. Windows Me, along with Windows 2000, was eventually succeeded by the NT-based Windows XP, which was launched on August 24, 2001.  New and updated features  = User interface = Windows Me featured the shell enhancements inherited from Windows 2000 such as personalized menus, customizable Windows Explorer toolbars, auto-complete in Windows Explorer address bar and Run box, Windows 2000 advanced file type association features, displaying comments in shortcuts as tooltips, extensible columns in Details view (IColumnProvider interface), icon overlays, integrated search pane in Windows Explorer, sort by name function for menus, Places bar in common dialogs for Open and Save, cascading Start menu special folders, some Plus! 95 and Plus! 98 themes, and updated graphics. The notification area in Windows Me and later supported 16-bit high color icons. The Multimedia control panel was also updated from Windows 98 SE. Taskbar and Start Menu options allowed disabling of the drag and drop feature and could prevent moving or resizing the taskbar, which was easier for new users. = Hardware support improvements = * Faster boot times: Windows Me features numerous improvements for improving cold boot time, pre and post- logon boot times and time required for resuming from hibernation. Processing of real mode configuration files, \`CONFIG.SYS\` and \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\`, is bypassed at startup and essential real mode drivers like \`HIMEM.SYS\` and \`SMARTDRV.EXE\` are embedded into \`IO.SYS\`. The registry is loaded only once; for efficient loading, the registry is split into three files instead of two (\`SYSTEM.DAT\` and \`USER.DAT\`), with the new file \`CLASSES.DAT\` containing the contents of the hive \`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\` required for boot loaded initially. Plug and Play device enumeration is more parallelized than in Windows 98 SE. Boot time is not affected due to unavailability of a DHCP server or other network components. There are also optimizations to prevent boot slowdown due to BIOS POST operations. * USB Human Interface Device Class: Generic support for 5-button mice is also included as standard and installing IntelliPoint allows reassigning the programmable buttons. * Windows Image Acquisition: Windows Me introduced the Windows Image Acquisition API for a standardized method of allowing Windows applications to transparently and more easily communicate with image acquisition devices, such as digital cameras and scanners. WIA intended to improve the configuration and the user interface for interacting with scanners and such devices, (which were previously supported by the TWAIN standard) and simplify writing device drivers for developers. WIA also includes support for USB still image capture device classes such as scanners and cameras through the Picture Transfer Protocol. * Improved power management and suspend/resume operations: The OEM version of Windows Me supports OS- controlled ACPI S4 sleep state (hibernation) and other power management features without manufacturer-supplied drivers. * USB and FireWire support improvements: Windows Me is the only operating system in the Windows 9x series that includes generic drivers for USB mass storage devices and USB printers. Support for FireWire SBP-2 scanners and storage devices is also improved. * The waveOut, DirectSound, and DirectShow APIs support non-PCM formats such as AC-3 or WMA over S/PDIF. = Digital media = * Windows Movie Maker: This utility is based on DirectShow and Windows Media technologies to provide Microsoft Windows computer systems with basic video capture and edit capabilities. It provides users with the ability to capture, edit, and re- encode media content into the Windows Media format, a tightly compressed format which requires a minimal amount of storage space on the computer's hard disk, when compared to many other media formats. * Windows Media Player 7: The new version of the Windows multimedia player software introduces jukebox functionality featuring the Media Library, support for CD burning, an integrated media encoder, and the ability to transfer music directly to portable devices. Another new feature is its radio tuner that can be used to search for and connect to radio stations over the internet. Users can also customize the look and feel of the user interface through interactive skins. * Windows DVD Player: The software DVD player in Windows Me is a redesigned version of the one featured in Windows 98 SE which, unlike its predecessor, does not require a dedicated decoder card for DVD playback. Instead, it supports software decoding through a third-party decoder. * Image Preview: In Windows Me, images can be viewed by using the Image Preview utility. It allows users to rotate an image, print or zoom in/out an image. Image Preview supports images with .\`BMP\`, .\`DIB\`, .\`EMF\`, .\`GIF\`, .\`JPEG\`, .\`PNG\`, .\`TIF\` and .\`WMF\` file formats. The My Pictures folder also integrates previewing images. * Games: Windows Me includes version 7.1 of the DirectX API which introduced DirectPlay Voice, and also offers several new games: Internet Backgammon, Internet Checkers, Internet Hearts, Internet Reversi, Internet Spades. It also includes Spider Solitaire from Plus! 98 and Pinball from Plus! for Windows 95. = Networking technologies = * Net Crawler: Windows Me introduced a net crawling feature which automatically searches out and creates shortcuts to network shares and printers in My Network Places. This can be controlled using the Automatically search for network folders and printers option. Shortcuts that are added by the net crawler but not detected again on the network in a reasonable time period are aged out and deleted. * New TCP/IP Stack: Windows Me includes the Windows 2000 networking stack and architecture which was known to be more reliable, full-featured, stable and offered better performance. Support for networking over FireWire, improved infrared support, a network diagnostic troubleshooter and a new Home Networking wizard are also included. * The Home Networking Wizard is designed to help users to set up a computer that is running Windows Me for use on a small home network. This includes setting up Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) on a computer running Windows Me so the computer can share a connection to the Internet with other computers on the home network. * Dial-up Networking component was updated in Windows Me, and provides several enhancements while maintaining the desired features of prior releases of the operating system. The user interface had been reworked to provide all configurable parameters in one convenient location. The user interface now included three new tabs: Networking, Security and Dialing. To improve dial-up networking, Windows Me includes built-in support for the Connection Manager dial-up client. Using the Connection Manager Administration Kit (an optional networking component in Windows 2000 Server), network administrators can pre-configure and deploy dial-up networking connections, by means of a Connection Manager service profile, to Windows Me‚Äìbased client machines. * Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) version 5.0 for Windows Me was enhanced to provide programming interface parity with NDIS version 5.0 in Windows 2000. This means that the programming interfaces that the author of a network device driver uses are the same for both of these Windows platforms. * Universal Plug and Play: Windows Me introduced support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Universal Plug and Play and NAT traversal APIs can also be installed on Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE by installing the Windows XP Network Setup Wizard. = System utilities = * System Restore: Windows Me introduced the \\"System Restore\\" logging and reversion system, which was meant to simplify troubleshooting and solve problems. It was intended to work as a rollback and recovery feature so that if the installation of an application or a driver adversely affected the system, the user could undo the installation and return the system to a previously working state. It does this by monitoring changes to Windows system files and the registry. System Restore protects only the operating system files, not documents, and therefore is not a substitute for a backup program. * System File Protection: First introduced with Windows 2000 (as Windows File Protection), and expanding on the capabilities introduced with System File Checker in Windows 98, System File Protection aimed to protect system files from modification and corruption silently and automatically. When the file protection is in effect, replacing or deleting a system file causes Windows Me to silently restore the original copy. The original is taken from a hard drive backup folder (\`%WinDir%\\\\Options\\\\Install\`) or from the Windows Me installation CD, if the cached copy of files on the hard disk has been deleted. If no installation CD is in the drive, a dialog box alerts the user about the problem and requests that the CD be inserted. System File Protection is a different technology from System Restore and should not be confused with the latter. System Restore maintains a broad set of changed files including added applications and user configuration data stored repeatedly at specific points in time restored by the user, whereas System File Protection protects operating system files with no user input. * System Configuration Utility allows users to manually extract and restore individual system files from the Windows Me setup files. It has also been updated with three new tabs called \\"Static VxDs\\", \\"Environment\\" and \\"International\\". The Static VxDs tab allows users to enable or disable static virtual device drivers to be loaded at startup, the Environment tab allows users to enable or disable environment variables, and the International tab allows users to set international language keyboard layout settings that were formerly set via the real mode MS- DOS configuration files. A Cleanup button on the Startup tab allows cleaning up invalid or deleted startup entries. * System Monitor has been updated with a Dial-Up Adapter section. Users can now monitor items such as Connection Speeds, Bytes Received or Transmitted / Second. * SCANDISK runs from within Windows upon an improper shutdown before the Windows Shell loads. * Automatic Updates: The Automatic Updates utility automatically downloads and installs critical updates from the Windows Update Web site with little user interaction. It is set up to check Windows Update once every 24 hours by default. Users can choose to download which update they want, although high- priority updates must be downloaded and installed. * Compressed Folders: Windows Me includes support for ZIP files through a shell extension known as Compressed Folders. Originally introduced in the Plus! 98 pack for Windows 98, this feature allows users to create, access and extract files from ZIP archives similar to a regular folder in Windows. The user can also restrict access to files with a password. * A new Help and Support program has also been added, replacing the HTML Help-based documentation in Windows 2000 and Windows 98. The Help and Support Center is entirely HTML-based and takes advantage of a technology called Support Automation Framework (SAF), that can show support information from the internet, allows collecting data for troubleshooting via WMI and scripting and for third parties to plug into Windows Help and Support.Support Automation Framework Several other support tools also shipped with Windows Me. * Windows Me also includes Internet Explorer 5.5, which supports a new Print Preview feature. It also shipped with the MSN Messenger Service. = Accessibility features = * On-Screen Keyboard: Originally introduced with Windows 2000, a program called On-Screen Keyboard has been added, which makes it possible to input characters using the mouse instead of the keyboard. This feature is useful for computers that use a tablet as the primary pointing device or for accessibility purposes. * The Mouse Control Panel incorporates IntelliPoint features, namely ClickLock (selecting or dragging without continuously holding down the mouse button), hiding the pointer while typing and showing it by pressing Ctrl. * The cursor (system caret) can be set to a thicker width. * Increased Active Accessibility support in utilities such as Calculator and Magnifier.  Removed features  = Real mode DOS = Windows Me restricted support for real mode MS-DOS. As a result, \`IO.SYS\` in Windows Me disregards \`CONFIG.SYS\`, \`COMMAND.COM\` and \`WIN.COM\` and directly executes \`VMM32.VXD\`. In its default configuration the system would neither boot into an MS-DOS command prompt nor exit to DOS from Windows; real mode drivers such as \`ANSI.SYS\` could not be loaded and older applications that require real mode could not be run. Microsoft argued that the change improved the speed and reliability of the boot process. In Windows Me, the \`CONFIG.SYS\` and \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` files are used only to set global environment variables. The two files (if present) are scanned for settings relating to the environment variables, and any other commands present are moved into a Windows registry key (see below). The two files thus contain only settings and preferences which configure the \\"global environment\\" for the computer during the boot phase or when starting a new virtual DOS machine (VDM). To specify or edit other startup values (which, in Windows 98, would be present in the \`AUTOEXEC.BAT\` file) the user must edit the following Windows registry key: :\`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\System\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Control\\\\SessionManager\\\\Environment\` For troubleshooting and crash recovery, both the Windows Me CD-ROM and the Windows Me startup disk (a user-createable floppy disk, known as the Emergency Boot Disk (EBD)) allowed booting into real mode MS-DOS. It is possible to restore real mode DOS functionality through various unofficial means. Additionally, a registry setting exists that re-enables the \\"Restart in MS-DOS mode\\" option in the shutdown dialog box; however, unless patched unofficially with third party software, Windows Me cannot be booted to MS-DOS real mode. = Other components = Unlike past versions of Windows 9x, Windows Me was entirely aimed at home users, and thus had certain enterprise-oriented features removed. Several features of its predecessors did not work or were officially unsupported by Microsoft on Windows Me, including Automated Installation, Active Directory client services, System Policy Editor, Personal Web Server and ASP. These features were supported on its predecessors, Windows 98 and Windows 95. A Resource Kit publication, targeted towards system administrators, was never published for Windows Me. Other features that were removed or never updated to work with Windows Me included Microsoft Fax, QuickView and DriveSpace, as well as the GUI FAT32 conversion tool. Several Windows Explorer commands were also modified in Windows Me, matching the menu structure in Windows 2000. While some were simply moved to a different location, certain functionality of the Go menu, as well as the Find command on the Tools menu, are no longer available. For the latter change Microsoft recommends using a variety of similar functionality labeled Search.  Upgradeability  Windows Me could have its components upgraded or have new components installed up to the following versions: * Internet Explorer 6 SP1 and Outlook Express 6 SP1 * Windows Media Player 9 Series * MSN Messenger 7.0 * Windows Installer 2.0 * DirectX 9.0c (the latest compatible runtime is from October 2007.) * Microsoft .NET Framework up to and including version 2.0 (2.0 SP1 and higher versions are not supported.) *Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 runtime *Text Services Framework * Several other components such as MSXML 3.0 SP7, Microsoft Agent 2.0, NetMeeting 3.01, MSAA 2.0, ActiveSync 3.8, WSH 5.6, Microsoft Data Access Components 2.81 SP1, WMI 1.5 and Speech API 4.0. * Office XP was the last version of Microsoft Office to be compatible with Windows Me. * The Microsoft Layer for Unicode can be installed to allow certain Unicode applications to run on the operating system.  System requirements  Windows Me is not designed to handle more than 512 MB of RAM by default. Systems with larger RAM pools may lose stability; however, depending on the hardware and software configuration, it is sometimes possible to manually tweak the installation to continue working with somewhat larger amounts of RAM as well. Systems with 1.5 GB of RAM or more may reboot continuously during startup. The /nm setup switch can be used at the DOS command line to bypass the minimum requirements, allowing for installation on a CPU as low as the 16 MHz 80486SX. Support lifecycle Microsoft planned to end support for Windows Me on December 31, 2004. However, in order to give customers more time to migrate to newer Windows versions, particularly in developing or emerging markets, Microsoft decided to extend support until July 11, 2006. Microsoft ended support for Windows Me because the company considers Windows Me obsolete and prone to security risks, and recommended customers upgrade to Windows XP for the latest security improvements. Windows Me is no longer available in any form due to the terms of Java-related settlements Microsoft made with Sun Microsystems. In 2011, Microsoft removed the update website for Windows Me. Microsoft announced in July 2019 that the Microsoft Internet Games services on Windows Me (and XP) would end on July 31, 2019.  Reception  Windows Me was heavily panned by many users and critics, mainly due to stability issues. Due to its many bugs and glitches, Windows Me is considered one of the worst operating systems of all time. A PC World article dubbed Windows Me the \\"Mistake Edition\\" and placed it 4th in their \\"Worst Tech Products of All Time\\" feature in 2006. The article states: \\"Shortly after Me appeared in late 2000, users reported problems installing it, getting it to run, getting it to work with other hardware or software, and getting it to stop running.\\" Consequently, most home users remained with Windows 98 Second Edition, while some moved to Windows 2000 despite the latter being enterprise- oriented. System Restore suffered from a bug in the date-stamping functionality that could cause System Restore to date-stamp snapshots that were taken after September 8, 2001 incorrectly. This could prevent System Restore from locating these snapshots and cause the system restore process to fail. Microsoft released an update to fix this problem. Byron Hinson and Julien Jay, writing for ActiveWin, took an appreciative look on the operating system. On the removal of real mode DOS, they had noted \\"The removal of DOS has clearly made a difference in Windows Me in terms of stability (far less Blue Screens of Death are seen now) and booting speed has greatly increased.\\" In a recommendation of the operating system upgrade for users of Windows 95 and 98, they had stated \\"If Windows Me isn't a revolutionary OS it's clear that Microsoft has focused its efforts to make it more user-friendly, stable and packed full of multimedia options. The result is great and the enhancements added are really worth the wait.\\" The new features that Windows Me introduced were also praised and have since remained part of subsequent Windows generations. Along with Windows 2000 from the NT family, Windows Me was the last version of Windows that lacked product activation.

The polity was originally divided between Massylii in the east and Masaesyli in the west. During the Second Punic War (218‚Äì201 BC), Masinissa, king of the Massylii, defeated Syphax of the Masaesyli to unify Numidia into one kingdom. The kingdom began as a sovereign state and later alternated between being a Roman province and a Roman client state. Numidia, at its largest extent, was bordered by the Kingdom of Mauretania to the west, at the Moulouya River, Africa Proconsularis (now part of Tunisia) to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the north, and the Sahara to the south. It is considered to be one of the first major states in the history of Algeria and the Berber world. History =Independence= The Numidian mauseoleum of El-Khroub photographed in 2000 The Greek historians referred to these peoples as \\"ŒùŒøŒºŒ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ\\" (i.e. Nomads), which by Latin interpretation became \\"Numidae\\" (but cf. also the correct use of Nomades).Numida and Nomas Historian Gabriel Camps, however, disputes this claim, favoring instead an African origin for the term. The name appears first in Polybius (second century BC) to indicate the peoples and territory west of Carthage including the entire north of Algeria as far as the river Mulucha (Muluya), about west of Oran. The Numidians were composed of two great tribal groups: the Massylii in eastern Numidia, and the Masaesyli in the west. During the first part of the Second Punic War, the eastern Massylii, under their king Gala, were allied with Carthage (a 'Punic', i.e. Phoenician, Semitic, mercantile sea empire called after its capital in present-day Tunisia), while the western Masaesyli, under king Syphax, were allied with Rome. However, in 206 BC, the new king of the eastern Massylii, Masinissa, allied himself with Rome, and Syphax of the Masaesyli switched his allegiance to the Carthaginian side. At the end of the war, the victorious Romans gave all of Numidia to Masinissa of the Massylii. At the time of his death in 148 BC, Masinissa's territory extended from Mauretania to the boundary of the Carthaginian territory, and also southeast as far as Cyrenaica, so that Numidia entirely surrounded Carthage (Appian, Punica, 106) except towards the sea. After the death of the long-lived Masinissa around 148 BC, he was succeeded by his son Micipsa. When Micipsa died in 118 BC, he was succeeded jointly by his two sons Hiempsal I and Adherbal and Masinissa's illegitimate grandson, Jugurtha, of Ancient Libyan origin, who was very popular among the Numidians. Hiempsal and Jugurtha quarrelled immediately after the death of Micipsa. Jugurtha had Hiempsal killed, which led to open war with Adherbal. =War with Rome= By 112 BC, Jugurtha resumed his war with Adherbal. He incurred the wrath of Rome in the process by killing some Roman businessmen who were aiding Adherbal. After a brief war with Rome, Jugurtha surrendered and received a highly favourable peace treaty, which raised suspicions of bribery once more. The local Roman commander was summoned to Rome to face corruption charges brought by his political rival Gaius Memmius. Jugurtha was also forced to come to Rome to testify against the Roman commander, where Jugurtha was completely discredited once his violent and ruthless past became widely known, and after he had been suspected of murdering a Numidian rival. War broke out between Numidia and the Roman Republic and several legions were dispatched to North Africa under the command of the Consul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus. The war dragged out into a long and seemingly endless campaign as the Romans tried to defeat Jugurtha decisively. Frustrated at the apparent lack of action, Metellus' lieutenant Gaius Marius returned to Rome to seek election as Consul. Marius was elected, and then returned to Numidia to take control of the war. He sent his Quaestor Lucius Cornelius Sulla to neighbouring Mauretania in order to eliminate their support for Jugurtha. With the help of Bocchus I of Mauretania, Sulla captured Jugurtha and brought the war to a conclusive end. Jugurtha was brought to Rome in chains and was placed in the Tullianum. Jugurtha was executed by the Romans in 104 BC, after being paraded through the streets in Gaius Marius' Triumph. =Divided kingdom= After the death of Jugurtha, the far west of Numidia was added to the lands of Bocchus I, king of Mauretania. A rump kingdom continued to be governed by native princes. It appears that on the death of King Gauda in 88 BC, the kingdom was divided into a larger eastern kingdom and a smaller western kingdom (roughly the Petite Kabylie). The kings of the east minted coins, while no known coins of the western kings survive. The western kings may have been vassals of the eastern... The civil war between Caesar and Pompey brought an end to independent Numidia in 46 BC. The western kingdom between the Sava (Oued Soummam) and Ampsaga (Oued-el-Kebir) rivers passed to Bocchus II, while the eastern kingdom became a Roman province. The remainder of the western kingdom plus the city of Cirta, which may have belonged to either kingdom, became briefly an autonomous principality under Publius Sittius. Between 44 and 40 BC, the old western kingdom was once again under a Numidian king, Arabio, who killed Sittius and took his place. He involved himself in Rome's civil wars and was himself killed. =Roman provinces= Northern Africa under Roman rule After the death of Arabio, Numidia became the Roman province of Africa Nova except for a brief period when Augustus restored Juba II (son of Juba I) as a client king (29‚Äì27 BC). Eastern Numidia was annexed in 46 BC to create a new Roman province, Africa Nova. Western Numidia was also annexed after the death of its last king, Arabio, in 40 BC, and the two provinces were united with Tripolitana by Emperor Augustus, to create Africa Proconsularis. In AD 40, the western portion of Africa Proconsularis, including its legionary garrison, was placed under an imperial legatus, and in effect became a separate province of Numidia, though the legatus of Numidia remained nominally subordinate to the proconsul of Africa until AD 203. Under Septimius Severus (193 AD), Numidia was separated from Africa Proconsularis, and governed by an imperial procurator. Under the new organization of the empire by Diocletian, Numidia was divided in two provinces: the north became Numidia Cirtensis, with capital at Cirta, while the south, which included the Aur√®s Mountains and was threatened by raids, became Numidia Militiana, \\"Military Numidia\\", with capital at the legionary base of Lambaesis. Subsequently, however, Emperor Constantine the Great reunited the two provinces in a single one, administered from Cirta, which was now renamed Constantina (modern Constantine) in his honour. Its governor was raised to the rank of consularis in 320, and the province remained one of the six provinces of the Diocese of Africa until the invasion of the Vandals in 428, which began its slow decay, accompanied by desertification. It was restored to Roman rule after the Vandalic War, when it became part of the new Praetorian prefecture of Africa. Major cities Numidia became highly romanized and was studded with numerous towns. The chief towns of Roman Numidia were: in the north, Cirta or modern Constantine, the capital, with its port Russicada (Modern Skikda); and Hippo Regius (near B√¥ne), well known as the see of St. Augustine. To the south in the interior military roads led to Theveste (Tebessa) and Lambaesis (Lambessa) with extensive Roman remains, connected by military roads with Cirta and Hippo, respectively.Detailed map of Roman Numidia Lambaesis was the seat of the Legio III Augusta, and the most important strategic centre. It commanded the passes of the Aur√®s Mountains (Mons Aurasius), a mountain block that separated Numidia from the Gaetuli Berber tribes of the desert, and which was gradually occupied in its whole extent by the Romans under the Empire. Including these towns, there were altogether twenty that are known to have received at one time or another the title and status of Roman colonies; and in the 5th century, the Notitia Dignitatum enumerates no fewer than 123 sees whose bishops assembled at Carthage in 479.

It is bordered to the north by French Guiana and Suriname.  History  Tumucumaque was declared a national park on August 23, 2002, by the Government of Brazil, after collaboration with the WWF. It is part of the Amap√° Biodiversity Corridor, created in 2003. The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Its Management Plan was published on March 10, 2010.  Geography  Tumucumaque Mountains National Park has an area of more than , making it the world's largest tropical forest national park and larger than Belgium. This area even reaches when including the bordering Guiana Amazonian Park, a national park in French Guiana. This combination of protected areas is still smaller than the three national parks system in the Brazil-Venezuelan border, where the Parima-Tapirapeco, Serran√≠a de la Neblina and Pico da Neblina national parks have a combined area of over . But the latter is certainly smaller if the Tumucumaque Mountains National Park (Brazil) and the adjacent Guiana Amazonian Park (France) is combined with large neighbouring protected areas in northern Par√°, Brazil, such as Gr√£o-Par√° Ecological Station, Maicuru Biological Reserve, and many others. The importance is that this makes the Guiana Shield one of the best protected and largest ecological corridor of tropical rainforests in the world. It is an uninhabited region and is of high ecological value: most of its animal species, mainly fish and aquatic birds, are not found in any other place in the world. It is a habitat for jaguars, primates, aquatic turtles, and harpy eagles. The highest point of the Brazilian state of Amap√° is located there, reaching 701 meters.Portal Brasil = Climate = The climate is tropical monsoon (K√∂ppen: Am), common in areas of northern Brazil in transition from biomes to the Amazon Forest. It has an average temperature of 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F) and accumulated rainfall ranging from 2,000 (7.87 in) to 3,250 mm (127.95 in) per year.  Tourism  Tourism in the Park takes place in two different sectors: Amapari Sector and Oiapoque Sector. At Amapar√≠ Sector, the Park is accessed by Serra do Navio city (most common) or by a community in Pedra Branca do Amapari (usually in the summer). The trip is made by the Amapari River, using aluminum boats (90 km from Serra do Navio) to the park's rustic base, where it is possible to stay in a camping structure adapted to Amazonian conditions (hammocks) and do activities such as trails, bathing in rivers and animal and plants watching. At Oiapoque Sector, you can camp at Cachoeira do Anotaie, which is located on the Anotaie River, a tributary of the Oiapoque River. This waterfall is 40 km from the city of Oiapoque, on a trip using aluminum boats. There is also the possibility to visit Vila Brasil, a community located on the right bank of the Oiapoque River and located in front of the French-Guyanese indigenous community of Camopi. In this location there are small hotels and it is possible to understand its socio-cultural context, where the residents, mostly traders, provide services to the indigenous people of the neighboring country.

Formerly applied primarily to economic, political, or religious theories and policies, in a tradition going back to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, more recent use treats the term as mainly condemnatory. The term was coined by Antoine Destutt de Tracy, a French Enlightenment aristocrat and philosopher, who conceived it in 1796 as the \\"science of ideas\\" to develop a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational impulses of the mob. In political science, the term is used in a descriptive sense to refer to political belief systems. Etymology and history Antoine Destutt de Tracy (1754-1836) The term ideology originates from French id√©ologie, itself deriving from combining (; close to the Lockean sense of idea) and -log√≠ƒÅ (). The term word, and the system of ideas associated with it, was coined in 1796 by Antoine Destutt de Tracy while in prison pending trial during the Reign of Terror, where he read the works of Locke and Condillac. Hoping to form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences, Tracy devised the term for a \\"science of ideas,\\" basing such upon two things: # the sensations that people experience as they interact with the material world; and # the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. He conceived ideology as a liberal philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property, free markets, and constitutional limits on state power. He argues that, among these aspects, ideology is the most generic term because the 'science of ideas' also contains the study of their expression and deduction. The coup that overthrew Maximilien Robespierre allowed Tracy to pursue his work. Tracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution (during the Napoleonic regime) by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob impulses that had nearly destroyed him. Perhaps the most accessible source for the near-original meaning of ideology is Hippolyte Taine's work on the Ancien R√©gime, Origins of Contemporary France I. He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy via the Socratic method, though without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Destutt De Tracy, but also with his milieu, and includes Condillac as one of its precursors. Napoleon Bonaparte came to view ideology as a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy's Institutional. According to Karl Mannheim's historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology, the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as \\"the ideologues.\\" Tracy's major book, The Elements of Ideology, was soon translated into the major languages of Europe. In the century following Tracy, the term ideology moved back and forth between positive and negative connotations. During this next generation, when post-Napoleonic governments adopted a reactionary stance, influenced the Italian, Spanish and Russian thinkers who had begun to describe themselves as \\"liberals\\" and who attempted to reignite revolutionary activity in the early 1820s, including the Carlist rebels in Spain; the Carbonari societies in France and Italy; and the Decembrists in Russia. Karl Marx adopted Napoleon's negative sense of the term, using it in his writings, in which he once described Tracy as a (a 'fish-blooded bourgeois doctrine').de Tracy, Antoine Destutt. [1801] 1817. Les √âl√©ments d'id√©ologie, (3rd ed.). p. 4, as cited in Mannheim, Karl. 1929. \\"The problem of 'false consciousness.'\\" In Ideologie und Utopie. 2nd footnote. The term has since dropped some of its pejorative sting, and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups.Eagleton, Terry (1991) Ideology. An introduction, Verso, pg. 2 While Marx situated the term within class struggle and domination,Tucker, Robert C (1978). The Marx-Engels Reader, W. W. Norton & Company, pg. 3.Marx, MER, pg. 154 others believed it was a necessary part of institutional functioning and social integration.Susan Silbey, \\"Ideology\\" at Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology. Definitions and analysis There are many different kinds of ideologies, including political, social, epistemological, and ethical. Recent analysis tends to posit that ideology is a 'coherent system of ideas' that rely on a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis. Through this system, ideas become coherent, repeated patterns through the subjective ongoing choices that people make. These ideas serve as the seed around which further thought grows. Believers in ideology range from passive acceptance through fervent advocacy to true belief. According to most recent analysis, ideologies are neither necessarily right nor wrong. Definitions, such as by Manfred Steger and Paul James emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth:James, Paul, and Manfred Steger. 2010. Globalization and Culture, Vol. 4: Ideologies of Globalism. London: SAGE Publications. Studies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of systematic ideology in the works of George Walford and Harold Walsby, who attempt to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems. David W. Minar describes six different ways the word ideology has been used:Minar, David W. 1961. \\"Ideology and Political Behavior.\\" Midwest Journal of Political Science 5(4):317‚Äì31. . . # As a collection of certain ideas with certain kinds of content, usually normative; # As the form or internal logical structure that ideas have within a set; # By the role ideas play in human-social interaction; # By the role ideas play in the structure of an organization; # As meaning, whose purpose is persuasion; and # As the locus of social interaction. For Willard A. Mullins, an ideology should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of utopia and historical myth. An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:Mullins, Willard A. 1972. \\"On the Concept of Ideology in Political Science.\\" American Political Science Review 66(2):498‚Äì510. . # it must have power over cognition; # it must be capable of guiding one's evaluations; # it must provide guidance towards action; and # it must be logically coherent. Terry Eagleton outlines (more or less in no particular order) some definitions of ideology:Eagleton, Terry. 1991. Ideology: An Introduction. Verso. . # The process of production of meanings, signs and values in social life # A body of ideas characteristic of a particular social group or class # Ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power # False ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power # Systematically distorted communication # Ideas that offer a position for a subject # Forms of thought motivated by social interests # Identity thinking # Socially necessary illusion # The conjuncture of discourse and power # The medium in which conscious social actors make sense of their world # Action- oriented sets of beliefs # The confusion of linguistic and phenomenal reality #Semiotic closure # The indispensable medium in which individuals live out their relations to a social structure # The process that converts social life to a natural reality German philosopher Christian Duncker called for a \\"critical reflection of the ideology concept.\\"\\"Christian Duncker\\" (in German). Ideologie Forschung. 2006. In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of epistemology and history, defining ideology in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly claim to absolute truth. =Marxist interpretation= Karl Marx posits that a society's dominant ideology is integral to its superstructure. In the Marxist base and superstructure model of society, base denotes the relations of production and modes of production, and superstructure denotes the dominant ideology (i.e. religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology‚Äîactions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a feudal mode of production, religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as liberalism and social democracy dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via false consciousness. Some explanations have been presented. Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs proposes ideology as a projection of the class consciousness of the ruling class. Antonio Gramsci uses cultural hegemony to explain why the working-class have a false ideological conception of what their best interests are. Marx argued that \\"The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production.\\" The Marxist formulation of \\"ideology as an instrument of social reproduction\\" is conceptually important to the sociology of knowledge,In this discipline, there are lexical disputes over the meaning of the word \\"ideology\\" (\\"false consciousness\\" as advocated by Marx, or rather \\"false position\\" of a statement in itself is correct but irrelevant in the context in which it is produced, as in Max Weber's opinion): viz. Karl Mannheim, Daniel Bell, and J√ºrgen Habermas et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed, and progressed, from the \\"total\\" but \\"special\\" Marxist conception of ideology to a \\"general\\" and \\"total\\" ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including Marxism) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek and the earlier Frankfurt School added to the \\"general theory\\" of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious, but also unconscious ideas. = Ideological state apparatuses (Althusser) = French Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser proposed that ideology is \\"the imagined existence (or idea) of things as it relates to the real conditions of existence\\" and makes use of a lacunar discourse. A number of propositions, which are never untrue, suggest a number of other propositions, which are. In this way, the essence of the lacunar discourse is what is not told (but is suggested). For example, the statement \\"All are equal before the law,\\" which is a theoretical groundwork of current legal systems, suggests that all people may be of equal worth or have equal opportunities. This is not true, for the concept of private property and power over the means of production results in some people being able to own more (much more) than others. This power disparity contradicts the claim that all share both practical worth and future opportunity equally; for example, the rich can afford better legal representation, which practically privileges them before the law. Althusser also proffered the concept of the ideological state apparatus to explain his theory of ideology. His first thesis was \\"ideology has no history\\": while individual ideologies have histories, interleaved with the general class struggle of society, the general form of ideology is external to history. For Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. His thesis that \\"ideas are material\\" is illustrated by the \\"scandalous advice\\" of Pascal toward unbelievers: \\"Kneel and pray, and then you will believe.\\" What is ultimately ideological for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the conscious \\"minds\\" of human individuals, but rather discourses that produce these beliefs, the material institutions and rituals that individuals take part in without submitting it to conscious examination and so much more critical thinking. = Ideology and the Commodity (Debord) = The French Marxist theorist Guy Debord, founding member of the Situationist International, argued that when the commodity becomes the \\"essential category\\" of society, i.e. when the process of commodification has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of exchange value), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, The Society of the Spectacle. = Ideology and rationality (Vietta) = German cultural historian Silvio Vietta described the development and expansion of Western rationality from ancient times onward as often accompanied by and shaped by ideologies like that of the \\"just war,\\" the \\"true religion,\\" racism, nationalism, or the vision of future history as a kind of 'heaven on earth' in communism. He said that ideas like these became ideologies by giving hegemonic political actions an idealistic veneer and equipping their leaders with a higher and, in the \\"political religions\\" (Eric Voegelin), nearly God-like power, so that they became masters over the lives (and the deaths) of millions of people. He considered that ideologies therefore contributed to power politics irrational shields of ideas beneath which they could operate as manifestations of idealism. = Unifying agents (Hoffer) = The American philosopher Eric Hoffer identified several elements that unify followers of a particular ideology:Hoffer, Eric. 1951. The True Believer. Harper Perennial. p. 91, et seq. # Hatred: \\"Mass movements can rise and spread without a God, but never without belief in a devil.\\" The \\"ideal devil\\" is a foreigner. # Imitation: \\"The less satisfaction we derive from being ourselves, the greater is our desire to be like others‚Ä¶the more we mistrust our judgment and luck, the more are we ready to follow the example of others.\\" # Persuasion: The proselytizing zeal of propagandists derives from \\"a passionate search for something not yet found more than a desire to bestow something we already have.\\" # Coercion: Hoffer asserts that violence and fanaticism are interdependent. People forcibly converted to Islamic or communist beliefs become as fanatical as those who did the forcing. \\"It takes fanatical faith to rationalize our cowardice.\\" # Leadership: Without the leader, there is no movement. Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe. He calls for sacrifices in the present, to justify his vision of a breathtaking future. The skills required include: audacity, brazenness, iron will, fanatical conviction; passionate hatred, cunning, a delight in symbols; ability to inspire blind faith in the masses; and a group of able lieutenants. Charlatanism is indispensable, and the leader often imitates both friend and foe, \\"a single-minded fashioning after a model.\\" He will not lead followers towards the \\"promised land,\\" but only \\"away from their unwanted selves.\\" # Action: Original thoughts are suppressed, and unity encouraged, if the masses are kept occupied through great projects, marches, exploration and industry. # Suspicion: \\"There is prying and spying, tense watching and a tense awareness of being watched.\\" This pathological mistrust goes unchallenged and encourages conformity, not dissent. =Ronald Inglehart= Ronald Inglehart of the University of Michigan is author of the World Values Survey, which, since 1980, has mapped social attitudes in 100 countries representing 90% of global population. Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity. Political ideologies In social studies, a political ideology is a certain ethical set of ideals, principles, doctrines, myths, or symbols of a social movement, institution, class, or large group that explains how society should work, offering some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including (for example): the economy, education, health care, labor law, criminal law, the justice system, the provision of social security and social welfare, trade, the environment, minors, immigration, race, use of the military, patriotism, and established religion. Political ideologies have two dimensions: # Goals: how society should work; and # Methods : the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement. There are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies, each of these different methods generate a specific political spectrum. Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the spectrum (e.g. the left, the center or the right), though precision in this respect can often become controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from political strategies (e.g., populism) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. legalization of marijuana). Philosopher Michael Oakeshott defines such ideology as \\"the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition.\\" Moreover, Charles Blattberg offers an account that distinguishes political ideologies from political philosophies.Blattberg, Charles. [2001] 2009. \\"Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies (PDF).\\" Public Affairs Quarterly 15(3):193‚Äì217. . A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate power and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best form of government (e.g., democracy, demagogy, theocracy, caliphate etc.), and the best economic system (e.g. capitalism, socialism, etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, socialism may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system. Post 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age,Bell, D. 2000. The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties (2nd ed.). Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. p. 393. in which redemptive, all- encompassing ideologies have failed. This view is often associated with Francis Fukuyama's writings on the end of history.Fukuyama, Francis. 1992. The End of History and the Last Man. New York: Free Press. p. xi. Contrastly, Nienhueser (2011) sees research (in the field of human resource management) as ongoingly \\"generating ideology.\\" Slavoj Zizek has pointed out how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one's point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this \\"a post-modernist trap.\\" Peter Sloterdijk advanced the same idea already in 1988. There are also several studies that show that affinity to a specific political ideology is heritable.Bouchard, Thomas J., and Matt McGue. 2003. \\"Genetic and environmental influences on human psychological differences (ePDF).\\" Journal of Neurobiology 54(1):44‚Äì45. .

Different forms of government utilize ideology in various ways, not always restricted to politics and society. Certain ideas and schools of thought become favored, or rejected, over others, depending on their compatibility with or use for the reigning social order. As John Maynard Keynes expresses, \\"Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.\\"Keynes, John Maynard. The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. pp. 383‚Äì84. How do ideologies become part of government policy? In The Anatomy of Revolution, Crane Brinton said that new ideology spreads when there is discontent with an old regime.Brinton, Crane. 1938. \\"Chapter 2.\\" The Anatomy of Revolution. Extremists such as Lenin and Robespierre will overcome more moderate revolutionaries.Brinton, Crane. 1938. \\"Chapter 6.\\" The Anatomy of Revolution. This stage is soon followed by Thermidor, a reining back of revolutionary enthusiasm under pragmatists like Stalin and Napoleon Bonaparte, who bring \\"normalcy and equilibrium.\\"Brinton, Crane. 1938. \\"Chapter 8.\\" The Anatomy of Revolution. Briton's sequence (\\"men of ideas>fanatics>practical men of action\\") is reiterated by J. William Fulbright,Fulbright, J. William. 1967. The Arrogance of Power. ch. 3‚Äì7. while a similar form occurs in Eric Hoffer's The True Believer.Hoffer, Eric. 1951. The True Believer. ch. 15‚Äì17. The revolution thus becomes established as an ideocracy, though its rise is likely to be checked by a 'political midlife crisis.' Epistemological ideologies Even when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant paradigm or mindset can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced. A special case of science that has inspired ideology is ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. Perceptual psychologist James J. Gibson believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of self-awareness and cognition itself. Linguist George Lakoff has proposed a cognitive science of mathematics wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception‚Äîwhich is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology. Deep ecology and the modern ecology movement (and, to a lesser degree, Green parties) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology. Some accuse ecological economics of likewise turning scientific theory into political economy, although theses in that science can often be tested. The modern practice of green economics fuses both approaches and seems to be part science, part ideology. This is far from the only theory of economics raised to ideology status. Some notable economically based ideologies include neoliberalism, monetarism, mercantilism, mixed economy, social Darwinism, communism, laissez-faire economics, and free trade. There are also current theories of safe trade and fair trade that can be seen as ideologies.  Ideology and the social sciences  =Psychological research= A large amount of research in psychology is concerned with the causes, consequences and content of ideology. According to system justification theory, ideologies reflect (unconscious) motivational processes, as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking. Jost, Ledgerwood and Hardin (2008) propose that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world, avoid existential threat, and maintain valued interpersonal relationships.Jost, John T., Alison Ledgerwood, and Curtis D. Hardin. 2008. \\"Shared reality, system justification, and the relational basis of ideological beliefs.\\" Pp. 171‚Äì86 in Social and Personality Psychology Compass 2. The authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of system-justifying worldviews. Psychologists generally agree that personality traits, individual difference variables, needs, and ideological beliefs seem to have something in common. =Semiotic theory= According to semiotician Bob Hodge:Hodge, Bob. \\"Ideology.\\" Semiotics Encyclopedia Online. Retrieved 12 June 2020. > [Ideology] identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of > meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other > term captures this object as well as 'ideology'. Foucault's 'episteme' is > too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His 'discourse', popular because > it covers some of ideology's terrain with less baggage, is too confined to > verbal systems. 'Worldview' is too metaphysical, 'propaganda' too loaded. > Despite or because of its contradictions, 'ideology' still plays a key role > in semiotics oriented to social, political life. Authors such as Michael Freeden have also recently incorporated a semantic analysis to the study of ideologies. = Sociology = Sociologists define ideology as \\"cultural beliefs that justify particular social arrangements, including patterns of inequality.\\" Dominant groups use these sets of cultural beliefs and practices to justify the systems of inequality that maintain their group's social power over non-dominant groups. Ideologies use a society's symbol system to organize social relations in a hierarchy, with some social identities being superior to other social identities, which are considered inferior. The dominant ideology in a society is passed along through the society's major social institutions, such as the media, the family, education, and religion. As societies changed throughout history, so did the ideologies that justified systems of inequality. Sociological examples of ideologies include: racism; sexism; heterosexism; ableism; and ethnocentrism. Quotations * \\"We do not need‚Ä¶to believe in an ideology.

All the costs are usually discounted and total to a present- day value known as net present value (NPV). This example can be generalized on any type of material, product, or system. In order to perform an LCCA scoping is critical - what aspects are to be included and what not? If the scope becomes too large the tool may become impractical to use and of limited ability to help in decision-making and consideration of alternatives; if the scope is too small then the results may be skewed by the choice of factors considered such that the output becomes unreliable or partisan. Usually, the LCCA term implies that environmental costs are not included, whereas the similar Whole-Life Costing, or just Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), generally has a broader scope, including environmental costs. To help building and facility managers make sound decisions, the US Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) provides guidance and resources on applying LCCA that permits the cost- effectiveness of energy and water efficiency investments to be evaluated (see NIST Handbook 135). This document includes an introduction to LCCA. Life cycle cost can be conducted in two approaches: deterministic and probabilistic method. Example[1]: A building owner contemplates installing a photo-voltaic (PV) system on the roof of the building. The PV system comes with a 20-year labor and material warranty, but the current roof does not have another twenty years left in its service life, which means that if the PV system is installed on the existing roof, there will be an added cost ($4,000) of detaching and resetting the new PV system for a re-roofing scope within the time frame of the PV warranty. The building owner then gets three re-roofing bids from three different roofing contractors; a low bid, a medium bid and a high bid. The bids in this particular case are reflective of the quality of both workmanship and material. 1\\\\. The low bid is from an inexperienced roofer proposing the installation of the cheapest roofing materials on the market. (15 year life expectancy) $14,000 2\\\\. The medium bid is from a roofer with good reputation and trusted by material manufacturers. (25 year life expectancy) $16,000 3\\\\. The high bid is from a renowned roofing contractor who proposes a high quality roofing material. (35 year life expectancy) $18,000 When performing life-cycle cost analysis it should be apparent that the low bid is not the ideal bid for this particular situation, as the building owner will end up paying at least $18,000 ($14,000 for the first re-roofing + $4,000 detaching and resetting the new PV system for the second re-roofing + the costs of the second re-roofing) for a roof that will not exceed the life of the PV warranty and have half the life expectancy of the high bid roof. Either the medium or high bid should be chosen for a long-term economic solution.

As practiced today, it is a collaborative process that incorporates the input of many stakeholders including various government agencies, the public and private businesses. Transportation planners apply a multi-modal and/or comprehensive approach to analyzing the wide range of alternatives and impacts on the transportation system to influence beneficial outcomes. Transportation planning is also commonly referred to as transport planning internationally, and is involved with the evaluation, assessment, design, and siting of transport facilities (generally streets, highways, bike lanes, and public transport lines). Models and sustainability  Chicago Transit Authority Chicago 'L' trains use elevated tracks for a portion of the system, known as the Loop, which is in the Chicago Loop community area. It is an example of the siting of transportation facilities that results from transportation planning. A bypass the Old Town in Szczecin, Poland Transportation planning, or transport planning, has historically followed the rational planning model of defining goals and objectives, identifying problems, generating alternatives, evaluating alternatives, and developing plans. Other models for planning include rational actor, transit oriented development, satisficing, incremental planning, organizational process, collaborative planning, and political bargaining. Planners are increasingly expected to adopt a multidisciplinary approach, especially due to the rising importance of environmentalism. For example, the use of behavioural psychology to persuade drivers to abandon their automobiles and use public transport instead. The role of the transport planner is shifting from technical analysis to promoting sustainability through integrated transport policies.Southern, A. (2006), Modern-day transport planners need to be both technically proficient and politically astute, Local Transport Today, no. 448, 27 July 2006. For example, in Hanoi, the increasing number of motorcycles is responsible for not only environmental damage but also slowing down economic growth. In the long run, the plan is to reduce traffic through a change in urban planning. Through economic incentives and attractive alternatives experts hope to lighten traffic in the short run. While quantitative methods of observing transport patterns are considered foundation in transport planning, the role of qualitative and mixed-methods analysis and the use of critical analytical frameworks has increasingly been recognized as a key aspect of transport planning practice which integrates multiple planning criteria in generating, evaluating, and selection policy and project options.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, transport planning has traditionally been a branch of civil engineering. In the 1950s and the 1960s, it was generally believed that the motor car was an important element in the future of transport as economic growth spurred on car ownership figures. The role of the transport planner was to match motorway and rural road capacity against the demands of economic growth. Urban areas would need to be redesigned for the motor vehicle or impose traffic containment and demand management to mitigate congestion and environmental impacts. The policies were popularised in a 1963 government publication, Traffic in Towns. The contemporary Smeed Report on congestion pricing was initially promoted to manage demand but was deemed politically unacceptable. In more recent times, the approach has been caricatured as \\"predict and provide\\" to predict future transport demand and provide the network for it, usually by building more roads. The publication of Planning Policy Guidance 13 in 1994 (revised in 2001),Department for Communities and Local Government (2001), Planning Policy Guidance 13 followed by A New Deal for TransportDepartment for Transport (1998), A New Deal for Transport in 1998 and the white paper Transport Ten Year Plan 2000Department for Transport (2000), Transport Ten Year Plan 2000 again indicated an acceptance that unrestrained growth in road traffic was neither desirable nor feasible. The worries were threefold: concerns about congestion, concerns about the effect of road traffic on the environment (both natural and built) and concerns that an emphasis on road transport discriminates against vulnerable groups in society such as the poor, the elderly and the disabled. These documents reiterated the emphasis on integration: * integration within and between different modes of transport * integration with the environment * integration with land use planning * integration with policies for education, health and wealth creation. This attempt to reverse decades of underinvestment in the transport system has resulted in a severe shortage of transport planners. It was estimated in 2003 that 2,000 new planners would be required by 2010 to avoid jeopardising the success of the Transport Ten Year Plan . In 2006, the Transport Planning Society defined the key purpose of transport planning as: ::to plan, design, deliver, manage and review transport, balancing the needs of society, the economy and the environment. The following key roles must be performed by transport planners: * take account of the social, economic and environmental context of their work * understand the legal, regulatory policy and resource framework within which they work * understand and create transport policies, strategies and plans that contribute to meeting social, economic and environmental needs * design the necessary transport projects, systems and services * understand the commercial aspects of operating transport systems and services * know about and apply the relevant tools and techniques * must be competent in all aspects of management, in particular communications, personal skills and project management.Transport Planning Society (2006), Draft National Occupational Standards for Transport Plan The UK Treasury recognises and has published guidance on the systematic tendency for project appraisers to be overly optimistic in their initial estimates.  United States  A alt=A blue-grey map of a road, covered with assorted lines Transportation planning in the United States is in the midst of a shift similar to that taking place in the United Kingdom, away from the single goal of moving vehicular traffic and towards an approach that takes into consideration the communities and lands through which streets, roads, and highways pass (\\"the context\\"). More so, it places a greater emphasis on passenger rail networks, which had been neglected until recently. This new approach, known as Context Sensitive Solutions (CSS), seeks to balance the need to move people efficiently and safely with other desirable outcomes, including historic preservation, environmental sustainability, and the creation of vital public spaces. The initial guiding principles of CSS came out of the 1998 \\"Thinking Beyond the Pavement\\" conferenceState of Maryland (1998), Summary of Thinking Beyond the Pavement conference as a means to describe and foster transportation projects that preserve and enhance the natural and built environments, as well as the economic and social assets of the neighborhoods they pass through. CSS principles have since been adopted as guidelines for highway design in federal legislation.U.S. Senate (2005), Senate Report 109-053 - Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act OF 2005 Also, in 2003, the Federal Highway Administration announced that under one of its three Vital Few Objectives (Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining) they set the target of achieving CSS integration within all state Departments of Transportation by September 2007.Federal Highway Administration (2003) FHWA's Vital Few Goals ‚Äî Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining In recent years, there has been a movement to provide \\"complete\\" transportation corridors under the \\"complete streets\\" movement. In response to auto-centric design of transportation networks, complete streets encompass all users and modes of transportation in a more equitable manner. The complete streets movement entails many of the CSS principles as well as pedestrian, bicycle and older adult movements to improve transportation in the United States. These recent pushes for changes to the profession of transportation planning has led to the development of a professional certification program by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, the Professional Transportation Planner in 2007. In response an advanced form of certification - the Advanced Specialty Certification in Transportation Planning was developed by the American Planning Association thereafter in 2011. The Certified Transportation Planner credential is only available for those professional planners (AICP members) who have at a minimum of eight years of transportation planning experience. =Technical process= Most regional transport planners employ what is called the rational model of planning. The model views planning as a logical and technical process that uses the analysis of quantitative data to decide how to best invest resources in new and existing transport infrastructure.Levy, J. M. (2011). Contemporary Urban Planning. Boston: Longman. Since World War II, this attitude in planning has resulted in the widespread use of travel modelling as a key component of regional transport planning. The models‚Äô rise in popularity can also be attributed to a rapid increase in the number of automobiles on the road, widespread suburbanization and a large increase in federal or national government spending upon transport in urban areas. All of these phenomena dominated the planning culture in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Regional transport planning was needed because increasingly cities weren‚Äôt just cities anymore, but parts of a complex regional system.Johnston, R. A. (2004). The Urban Transportation Planning Process. In S. Hansen, & G. Guliano (Eds.), The Geography of Urban Transportation (pp. 115-138). The Guilford Press. The US process, according to Johnston (2004) and the FHWA and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) (2007), generally follows a pattern which can be divided into three different stages. Over the course of each of three phases, the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is also supposed to consider air quality and environmental issues, look at planning questions in a fiscally constrained way and involve the public. In the first stage, called preanalysis, the MPO considers what problems and issues the region faces and what goals and objectives it can set to help address those issues. During this phase the MPO also collects data on wide variety of regional characteristics, develops a set of different alternatives that will be explored as part of the planning process and creates a list of measurable outcomes that will be used to see whether goals and objectives have been achieved. Johnston notes that many MPOs perform weakly in this area, and though many of these activities seem like the ‚Äúsoft‚Äù aspects of planning that aren‚Äôt really necessary, they‚Äôre absolutely essential to ensuring that the models used in second phase are accurate and complete . The second phase is technical analysis. The process involves much technical maneuvering, but basically the development of the models can be broken down as follows. Before beginning, the MPO collects enormous amounts of data. This data can be thought of as falling into two categories: data about the transport system and data about adjacent land use. The best MPOs are constantly collecting this data. The actual analysis tool used in the US is called the Urban Transportation Modeling System (UTMS), though it is often referred to as the four-step process. As its nickname suggestions, UTMS has four steps: trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and trip/route assignment. In trip generation, the region is subdivided into a large number of smaller units of analysis called traffic analysis zones (TAZs). Based on the number and characteristics of the households in each zone, a certain number of trips is generated. In the second step, trip distribution, trips are separated out into categories based on their origin and purpose: generally, these categories are home-based work, home-based other and non-home based. In each of three categories, trips are matched to origin and destination zones using the data that has been collected. In mode choice, trips are assigned to a mode (usually auto or transit) based on what's available in a particular zone, the characteristics of the household within that zone and the cost of the mode for each mode in terms of money and time. Since most trips by bicycle or walking are generally shorter, they are assumed to have stayed within one zone and are not included in the analysis. Finally, in route assignment, trips are assigned to the network. As particular parts of the network are assigned trips, the vehicle speed slows down, so some trips are assigned to alternate routes in such a way that all trip times are equal. This is important because the ultimate goal is system-wide optimization, not optimization for any one individual. The finished product is traffic flows and speeds for each link in the network. Ideally, these models would include all the different behaviours that are associated with transport, including complex policy questions which are more qualitative in nature. Because of the complexity of transport issues, this is often not possible in practice. This results in models which may estimate future traffic conditions well, but are ultimately based on assumptions made on the part of the planner. Some planners carry out additional sub-system modelling on things like automobile ownership, time of travel, location of land development, location and firms and location of households to help to fill these knowledge gaps, but what are created are nevertheless models, and models always include some level of uncertainty. The post-analysis phase involves plan evaluation, programme implementation and monitoring of the results. Johnston notes that for evaluation to be meaningful it should be as comprehensive as possible. For example, rather than just looking at decreases in congestion, MPOs should consider economic, equity and environmental issues. =Intersection with politics= Although a transportation planning process may appear to be a rational process based on standard and objective methodologies, it is often influenced by political processes. Transportation planning is closely interrelated to the public nature of government works projects. As a result, transportation planners play both a technical and a coordinating role. Politicians often have vastly differing perspectives, goals and policy desires. Transportation planners help by providing information to decision makers, such as politicians, in a manner that produces beneficial outcomes. This role is similar to transportation engineers, who are often equally influenced by politics in the technical process of transportation engineering design. =Integration with urban planning= Transport isochrone maps are a measure of accessibility which can be used by urban planners to evaluate sites.

It is usually known as the Arche de la D√©fense or simply as La Grande Arche. A cube, La Grande Arche is part of the perspective from the Louvre to Arc de Triomphe. The distance from La Grande Arche to Arc de Triomphe is . Design and construction Grande Arche at night A great national design competition was launched in 1982 as the initiative of French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Danish architect Johan Otto von Spreckelsen (1929‚Äì1987) and Danish engineer Erik Reitzel (1941-2012) designed the winning entry to be a late-20th-century version of the Arc de Triomphe: a monument to humanity and humanitarian ideals rather than military victories. The construction of the monument began in 1985. Spreckelsen resigned in July 1986 and ratified the transfer of all his architectural responsibilities to his associate, French architect Paul Andreu. Reitzel continued his work until the monument was completed in 1989. The Grande Arche is in the approximate shape of a cube with a width, height and depth of ; it has been suggested that the structure looks like a hypercube (a tesseract) projected onto the three- dimensional world. It has a prestressed concrete frame covered with glass and is covered in Bethel Granite and was built by the French civil engineering company Bouygues. La Grande Arche was inaugurated in July 1989, with grand military parades that marked the bicentennial of the French Revolution. It completed the line of monuments that forms the Axe historique running through Paris. The Grande Arche is turned at an angle of 6.33¬∞ about the vertical axis. The most important reason for this turn was technical: with a M√©tro station, an RER station, and a motorway all situated directly underneath the Arche, the angle was the only way to accommodate the structure's giant foundations. In addition, from an architectural point of view, the turn emphasizes the depth of the monument and is similar to the turn of the Louvre at the other end of the Axe historique. In addition, the Arche is placed so that it forms a secondary axis with the two of the highest buildings in Paris at the time, the Tour Eiffel and the Tour Montparnasse. The two sides of the Arche house government offices. The roof section was closed in 2010 following an accident without injuryLemonde.fr, Le Monde (11 August 2010) and the marble tiles which had begun to peel off were replaced with granite ones. It opened again to the public in 2017 after seven years of renovation works. It features panoramic views of Paris and includes a restaurant and an exhibition area dedicated to photojournalism.

The Folktale. University of California Press. 1977. p. 257. that historically occurs in the folklore of various Northern European cultures. Wild Hunts typically involve a 'soul-raving' chase led by a mythological figure escorted by a ghostly or supernatural group of hunters passing in wild pursuit. The leader of the hunt is often a named figure associated with Odin in Germanic legends, but may variously be a historical or legendary figure like Theodoric the Great, the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag, the Welsh psychopomp Gwyn ap Nudd, biblical figures such as Herod, Cain, Gabriel or the Devil, or an unidentified lost soul or spirit either male or female. The hunters are generally the souls of the dead or ghostly dogs, sometimes fairies, Valkyries or elves. Seeing the Wild Hunt was thought to presage some catastrophe such as war or plague, or at best the death of the one who witnessed it.See, for example, Chambers's Encyclopaedia, 1901, s.v. \\"Wild Hunt\\": \\"[Gabriel's Hounds] ... portend death or calamity to the house over which they hang\\"; \\"the cry of the Seven Whistlers ... a death omen\\". People encountering the Hunt might also be abducted to the underworld or the fairy kingdom. In some instances, it was also believed that people's spirits could be pulled away during their sleep to join the cavalcade. The concept was developed based on comparative mythology by Jacob Grimm in Deutsche Mythologie (1835) as a folkloristic survival of Germanic pagan tradition, but comparable folk myths are found throughout Northern, Western and Central Europe. Grimm popularised the term Wilde Jagd (\\"Wild Hunt\\") for the phenomenon. Comparative evidence and terminology = Germanic Europe = Based on the comparative study of the German folklore, the phenomenon is often referred to as Wilde Jagd (German: 'Wild Hunt/chase') or W√ºtendes Heer ('Raging Host/army'). The term 'Hunt' was more common in northern Germany and 'Host' was more used in the south; with however no clear dividing line since parts of southern Germany know the 'Hunt', and parts of the north know the 'Host'. It was also known in Germany as the Wildes Heer ('Wild Army'), its leader was given various identities, including Wodan (or \\"Woden\\"), Knecht Ruprecht (cf. Krampus), Berchtold (or Berchta), and Holda (or \\"Holle\\"). The Wild Hunt is also known from post-medieval folklore. In England, it was known as Herla√æing (Old English: \\"Herla's assembly\\"), Woden's Hunt, Herod's Hunt, Cain's Hunt, the Devil's Dandy Dogs (in Cornwall), Gabriel's Hounds (in northern England), and Ghost Riders (in North America). In Scandinavia, the Wild Hunt is known as Oskoreia, a corruption of √Åsg√•rd-rei√∞, and as Oensjaegeren ('Odin's Hunters'). The names Asg√•rdsreia (originally oskurreia) (Norwegian: \\"noisy riders\\", \\"The Ride of Asgard\\"), and Odens jakt or Vilda jakten (Swedish: \\"the hunt of Odin\\" or \\"wild hunt\\") are also attested. = Rest of Europe = In France, the 'Host' was known in Latin sources as Familia Hellequini, and in Old French as Maisnie Hellequin (the 'household or retinue of Hellequin'). The Old French name 'Hellequin' was probably borrowed from Middle English 'Herla king' (*Herla-cyng; Old English *Herel-cyning) via the Romance-speaking Norman invaders of Britain. Other similar figures appear in the French folklore, such as 'Le Grand-Veneur', a hunter who chased with dogs in the forest of Fontainebleau, and a Poitou tradition where a hunter who have faulted by hunting on Sunday is condemned to redeem himself by hunting during the night, along with its French Canadian version the Chasse-galerie. In the Welsh folklore, Gwyn ap Nudd was depicted as a wild huntsman riding a demon horse who hunts souls at night along with a pack of white-bodied and red-eared 'dogs of hell'. In Arthurian legends, he is the king of the Underwold who makes sure that the imprisoned devils do not destroy human souls. In West Slavic Central Europe it is known as divok√Ω hon or ≈°tvan√≠ (Czech: \\"wild hunt\\", \\"baiting\\"), Dziki Gon or Dziki ≈Å√≥w (Polish), and Divja Jaga (Slovene: \\"the wild hunting party\\" or \\"wild hunt\\"). Other variations of the same folk myth are Caccia Morta (Dead hunt), Caccia infernale (infernal hunt), or Caccia selvaggia (wild hunt) in Italy; Estantiga (from Hoste Antiga, Galician: \\"the old army\\"), Hostia, Compa√±a and Santa Compa√±a (\\"troop, company\\") in Galicia; G√ºestia in Asturias; Hueste de √Ånimas (\\"troop of ghosts\\") in Le√≥n; and Hueste de Guerra (\\"war company\\") or Cortejo de Gente de Muerte (\\"deadly retinue\\") in Extremadura. In Wales, a comparable folk myth is known as C≈µn Annwn (Welsh: \\"hounds of Annwn\\"). Historiography The concept of the Wild Hunt was first documented by the German folklorist Jacob Grimm, who first published it in his 1835 book Deutsche Mythologie. It was in this work that he popularised the term Wilde Jagd (\\"Wild Hunt\\") for the phenomenon. Grimm's methodological approach was rooted in the idea ‚Äì common in nineteenth-century Europe ‚Äì that modern folklore represented a fossilized survival of the beliefs of the distant past. In developing his idea of the Wild Hunt, he mixed together recent folkloric sources with textual evidence dating to the Medieval and Early Modern periods. This approach came to be criticized within the field of folkloristics during the 20th century, as more emphasis was placed on the \\"dynamic and evolving nature of folklore\\". \\"Wodan's Wild Hunt\\" (1882) by Friedrich Wilhelm Heine Grimm interpreted the Wild Hunt phenomenon as having pre-Christian origins, arguing that the male figure who appeared in it was a survival of folk beliefs about the god Wodan, who had \\"lost his sociable character, his near familiar features, and assumed the aspect of a dark and dreadful power... a spectre and a devil.\\" Grimm believed that this male figure was sometimes replaced by a female counterpart, whom he referred to as Holda and Berchta. In his words, \\"not only Wuotan and other gods, but heathen goddesses too, may head the furious host: the wild hunter passes into the wood-wife, W√¥den into frau Gaude.\\" He added his opinion that this female figure was Woden's wife. Discussing martial elements of the Wild Hunt, Grimm commented that \\"it marches as an army, it portends the outbreak of war.\\" He added that a number of figures that had been recorded as leading the hunt, such as \\"Wuotan, Huckelbernd, Berholt, bestriding their white war-horse, armed and spurred, appear still as supreme directors of the war for which they, so to speak, give licence to mankind.\\" Grimm believed that in pre-Christian Europe, the hunt, led by a god and a goddess, either visited \\"the land at some holy tide, bringing welfare and blessing, accepting gifts and offerings of the people\\" or they alternately float \\"unseen through the air, perceptible in cloudy shapes, in the roar and howl of the winds, carrying on war, hunting or the game of ninepins, the chief employments of ancient heroes: an array which, less tied down to a definite time, explains more the natural phenomenon.\\" He believed that under the influence of Christianisation, the story was converted from being that of a \\"solemn march of gods\\" to being \\"a pack of horrid spectres, dashed with dark and devilish ingredients\\". A little earlier, in 1823, Felicia Hemans records this legend in her poem The Wild Huntsman, linking it here specifically to the castles of Rodenstein and Schnellerts, and to the Odenwald. In the influential book Kultische Geheimb√ºnde der Germanen (1934), Otto H√∂fler argued that the German motifs of the 'Wild Hunt' should be interpreted as the spectral troops led by the god Wuotan, which had a ritualistic counterpart in the living bands of ecstatic warriors (Old Norse berserkir), allegedly in a cultic union with the dead warriors of the past. Hans Peter Duerr (1985) noted that for modern readers, it \\"is generally difficult to decide, on the basis of the sources, whether what is involved in the reports about the appearance of the Wild Hunt is merely a demonic interpretation of natural phenomenon, or whether we are dealing with a description of ritual processions of humans changed into demons.\\" Historian Ronald Hutton noted that there was \\"a powerful and well-established international scholarly tradition\\" which argued that the Medieval Wild Hunt legends were an influence on the development of the Early Modern ideas of the Witches' Sabbath. Hutton nevertheless believed that this approach could be \\"fundamentally challenged\\". Attestations =Germany= An abundance of different tales of the Wild Hunt have been recorded in Germany. The leader, often called der Schimmelreiter, is generally identified with the god Wotan, but sometimes with a feminine figure: the wife of Wotan, Holda ('the friendly one'; also Holle or Holt), Fru Waur, or Fru Gode in Northern Germany; or Perchta (the bright one; also Berchta, Berhta or Berta) in Southern Germany. The leader also is sometimes an undead noble, most often called Count Hackelberg or Count Ebernburg, who is cursed to hunt eternally because of misbehaviour during his lifetime, and in some versions died from injuries of a slain boar's tusk. Dogs and wolves were generally involved. In some areas, werewolves were depicted as stealing beer and sometimes food in houses. Horses were portrayed as two-, three-, six-, and eight-legged, often with fiery eyes. In the 'Host' variants, principally found in southern Germany, a man went out in front, warning people to get out of the streets before the coming of the Host's armed men, who were sometimes depicted as doing battle with one another. A feature peculiar to the 'Hunt' version, generally encountered in northern Germany, was the pursuit and capture of one or more female demons, or a hart in some versions, while some others did not have a prey at all. Sometimes, the tales associate the hunter with a dragon or the devil. The lone hunter (der Wilde J√§ger) is most often riding a horse, seldom a horse-drawn carriage, and usually has several hounds in his company. If the prey is mentioned, it is most often a young woman, either guilty or innocent. Gottfried August B√ºrger's ballad Der wilde J√§ger describes the fate of a nobleman who dares to hunt on the Sabbath and finds both a curse and a pack of demons deep in the woods. The majority of the tales deal with some person encountering the Wild Hunt. If this person stands up against the hunters, he will be punished. If he helps the hunt, he will be awarded money, gold or, most often, a leg of a slain animal or human, which is often cursed in a way that makes it impossible to be rid of it. In this case, the person has to find a priest or magician able to ban it, or trick the Wild Hunt into taking the leg back by asking for salt, which the hunt can not deliver. In many versions, a person staying right in the middle of the road during the encounter is safe. The role of Wotan‚Äôs Wild Hunt during the Yuletide period has been theorized to have influenced the development of the Dutch Christmas figure Sinterklaas, and by extension his American counterpart Santa Claus, in a variety of facets. These include his long white beard and his gray horse for nightly rides.For example, see McKnight, George Harley (1917). St. Nicholas: His Legend and His Role in the Christmas Celebration and Other Popular Customs, pages 24‚Äì26, 138‚Äì139. G. P. Putman's sons. & Springwood, Charles Fruehling (2009). \\"If Santa Wuz Black: The Domestication of a White Myth\\", pages 243‚Äì244. As published in Studies in Symbolic Interaction: Volume 33 of Studies in Symbolic Interactions Series. Emerald Group Publishing. archive.org copy =Scandinavia= Norse myths. Illustration by August Malmstr√∂m. In Scandinavia, the leader of the hunt was Odin and the event was referred to as Odens jakt (Odin's hunt) and Oskoreien (from Asg√•rdsreien ‚Äì the Asgard Ride). Odin's hunt was heard but rarely seen, and a typical trait is that one of Odin's dogs was barking louder and a second one fainter. Beside one or two shots, these barks were the only sounds that were clearly identified. When Odin's hunt was heard, it meant changing weather in many regions, but it could also mean war and unrest. According to some reports, the forest turned silent and only a whining sound and dog barks could be heard. In western Sweden and sometimes in the east as well, it has been said that Odin was a nobleman or even a king who had hunted on Sundays and therefore was doomed to hunt down and kill supernatural beings until the end of time. According to certain accounts, Odin does not ride, but travels in a wheeled vehicle, specifically a one-wheeled cart. In parts of Sm√•land, it appears that people believed that Odin hunted with large birds when the dogs got tired. When it was needed, he could transform a bevy of sparrows into an armed host. If houses were built on former roads, they could be burnt down, because Odin did not change his plans if he had formerly travelled on a road there. Not even charcoal kilns could be built on disused roads, because if Odin was hunting the kiln would be ablaze. One tradition maintains that Odin did not travel further up than an ox wears his yoke, so if Odin was hunting, it was safest to throw oneself onto the ground in order to avoid being hit, a pourquoi story that evolved as an explanation for the popular belief that persons lying at ground level are safer from lightning strikes than are persons who are standing. In √Ñlghult in Sm√•land, it was safest to carry a piece of bread and a piece of steel when going to church and back during Yule. The reason was that if one met the rider with the broad-rimmed hat, one should throw the piece of steel in front of oneself, but if one met his dogs first, one should throw the pieces of bread instead. = Britain = In the Peterborough Chronicle, there is an account of the Wild Hunt's appearance at night, beginning with the appointment of a disastrous abbot for the monastery, Henry d'Angely, in 1127: Wistman's Wood in Devon, England. Reliable witnesses were said to have given the number of huntsmen as twenty or thirty, and it is said, in effect, that this went on for nine weeks, ending at Easter. Orderic Vitalis (1075‚Äìc. 1142), an English monk cloistered at St Evroul-en-Ouche, in Normandy, reported a similar cavalcade seen in January 1091, which he said were \\"Herlechin's troop\\" (familia Herlechini; cf. Harlequin). While these earlier reports of Wild Hunts were recorded by clerics and portrayed as diabolic, in late medieval romances, such as Sir Orfeo, the hunters are rather from a faery otherworld, where the Wild Hunt was the hosting of the fairies; its leaders also varied, but they included Gwydion, Gwynn ap Nudd, King Arthur, Nuada, King Herla, Woden, the Devil and Herne the Hunter. Many legends are told of their origins, as in that of \\"Dando and his dogs\\" or \\"the dandy dogs\\": Dando, wanting a drink but having exhausted what his huntsmen carried, declared he would go to hell for it. A stranger came and offered a drink, only to steal Dando's game and then Dando himself, with his dogs giving chase. The sight was long claimed to have been seen in the area. Another legend recounted how King Herla, having visited the Fairy King, was warned not to step down from his horse until the greyhound he carried jumped down; he found that three centuries had passed during his visit, and those of his men who dismounted crumbled to dust; he and his men are still riding, because the greyhound has yet to jump down. The myth of the Wild Hunt has through the ages been modified to accommodate other gods and folk heroes, among them King Arthur and, more recently, in a Dartmoor folk legend, Sir Francis Drake. At Cadbury Castle in Somerset an old lane near the castle was called King Arthur's Lane and even in the 19th century the idea survived that on wild winter nights the king and his hounds could be heard rushing along it. In certain parts of Britain, the hunt is said to be that of hell-hounds chasing sinners or the unbaptised. In Devon these are known as Yeth (Heath) or Wisht Hounds, in Cornwall Dando and his Dogs or the Devil and his Dandy Dogs, in Wales the Cwn Annwn, the Hounds of Hell, and in Somerset as Gabriel Ratchets or Retchets (dogs). In Devon the hunt is particularly associated with Wistman's Wood.

Modern influence = Cultural = The Wild Hunt is the subject of Transcendental √âtude No. 8 in C minor, \\"Wilde Jagd\\" (Wild Hunt) by Franz Liszt, and appears in Karl Maria von Weber's 1821 opera Der Freisch√ºtz and in Arnold Sch√∂nberg's oratorio Gurre-Lieder of 1911. C√©sar Franck's orchestral tone poem Le Chasseur maudit (The Accursed Huntsman) is based on Gottfried August B√ºrger's ballad Der wilde J√§ger. The Wild Hunt also appears in Marvel Comics, primarily the Thor series, and is led by Malekith the Accursed, the Dark Elf King of Svartalfheim and one of Thor's archenemies. The subject of Stan Jones' American country song \\"Ghost Riders in the Sky\\" of 1948, which tells of cowboys chasing the Devil's cattle through the night sky, resembles the European myth. Swedish folk musician The Tallest Man on Earth released an album in 2010 entitled The Wild Hunt, and in 2013 the black metal band Watain, also Swedish, released an album with the same title. In Mike Mignola's comic book series Hellboy two versions of the Wild Hunt myth are present. In The Wild Hunt the hero receives an invitation from British noblemen to partake in a giant hunting, \\"The Wild Hunt\\", which they call after the legend of \\"Herne, god of the Hunt\\". In King Vold, Hellboy encounters \\"King Vold, the flying huntsman\\" whose figure is based on the Norwegian folktale of \\"The Flying Huntsman (headless King Volmer and his hounds)\\" according to Mignola. In film, The Wild Hunt is a Canadian horror drama of 2009 by director Alexandre Franchi. The MTV series Teen Wolf features the Wild Hunt as the main villains of the first half of season 6. It takes the legend a bit further, claiming that the Wild Hunt erases people from existence, and those taken by the Wild Hunt become members after they are erased and forgotten. Œëustralian writer Tim Winton's 'The Riders,' shortlisted for the Booker Prize, mentions a vision of the Wild Hunt that becomes the basis for the main character's own 'wild hunt' of the story. In the Original Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (1st Edition) expansion \\"Deities and Demigods\\" the Wild Hunt is represented under the Celtic Mythos sections as the Huntsman and the Pack of the Wild Hunt where players can become either the hunted or be compelled to join the Hunt and participate in the slaughter of an innocent against their alignment and will. The Wild Hunt features in The Witcher series of fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski and CD Projekt Red's 2015 role-playing video game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, based on the books, after being referenced heavily during the events and flashbacks of The Witcher and The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. In The Elder Scrolls series of role-playing video games, the Wild Hunt is a ritual performed by the Bosmer (wood elves) for war, vengeance, or other times of desperation. The elves are transformed into a horde of horrific creatures that kill all in their path. The Daedric Lord Hircine is also inspired by the Wild Hunt, especially in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The Wild Hunt has appeared in various forms of literature, among them Alan Garner's 1963 novel The Moon of Gomrath, Penelope Lively's 1971 The Wild Hunt of Hagworthy, Susan Cooper's 1973 The Dark is Rising, Diana Wynne Jones' 1975 Dogsbody, Brian Bates' The Way of Wyrd, Guy Gavriel Kay's Fionavar trilogy, three of Jim Butcher's Dresden Files novels (2005 Dead Beat, 2006 Proven Guilty and 2012 Cold Days), the third issue of Seanan McGuire's series October Daye, An Artificial Night, Fred Vargas's 2011 The Ghost Riders of Ordebec, Laurell K. Hamilton‚Äôs book Mistral's Kiss, and Jane Yolen's 1995 The Wild Hunt. It also features in Cassandra Clare's book series, The Mortal instruments and The Dark Artifices, led by Gwyn ap Nudd. The Wicked Lovely series by Melissa Marr contains a modern Wild Hunt. It is also a major plot point in Peter S. Beagle's Tamsin. The Wild Hunt is a primary element of R. S. Belcher's novel The Brotherhood of the Wheel. The Wild Hunt has been depicted on two different cards in Magic: the Gathering. The \\"√Ösg√•rdsreien\\", Peter Nicolai Arbo's 1872 oil painting, depicts the Scandinavian version of the Wild Hunt, with Odin leading the hunting party. This painting is featured on the cover of Bathory's 1988 album, Blood Fire Death. The Wild Hunt was adapted for the Grace Note portion of The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II anime adaptation with the 4th and 5th episodes where Lord El-Melloi II (voiced by Daisuke Namikawa) helps a fellow magus teacher by the name of Wills Pelham Codrington (voiced by Tomoaki Maeno) in a case involving his father's home where the leylines have become unstable. It is there they encounter Black Dogs, the incarnation of lightning who have been killing people in the vicinity. With the help of his allies, Wills, and a fairy they encounter names Faye, Lord El-Melloi II manages to solve the case and avert the threat. =In modern Paganism= Various practitioners of the contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca have drawn upon folklore involving the Wild Hunt to inspire their own rites. In their context, the leader of the Wild Hunt is the goddess Hecate. The anthropologist Susan Greenwood provided an account of one such Wild Hunt ritual performed by a modern Pagan group in Norfolk during the late 1990s, stating that they used this mythology \\"as a means of confronting the dark of nature as a process of initiation.\\" Referred to as the \\"Wild Hunt Challenge\\" by those running it, it took place on Halloween and involved participants walking around a local area of woodland in the daytime, and then repeating that task as a timed competition at night, \\"to gain mastery over an area of Gwyn ap Nudd's hunting ground\\". If completed successfully, it was held that the participant had gained the trust of the wood's spirits, and they would be permitted to cut timber from its trees with which to make a staff. The anthropologist Rachel Morgain reported a \\"ritual recreation\\" of the Wild Hunt among the Reclaiming tradition of Wicca in San Francisco.

Material is removed from the work piece by a series of rapidly recurring current discharges between two electrodes, separated by a dielectric liquid and subject to an electric voltage. One of the electrodes is called the tool-electrode, or simply the or , while the other is called the workpiece-electrode, or . The process depends upon the tool and work piece not making physical contact. When the voltage between the two electrodes is increased, the intensity of the electric field in the volume between the electrodes becomes greater, causing dielectric break down of the liquid, and produces an electric arc. As a result, material is removed from the electrodes. Once the current stops (or is stopped, depending on the type of generator), new liquid dielectric is conveyed into the inter-electrode volume, enabling the solid particles (debris) to be carried away and the insulating properties of the dielectric to be restored. Adding new liquid dielectric in the inter-electrode volume is commonly referred to as . After a current flow, the voltage between the electrodes is restored to what it was before the breakdown, so that a new liquid dielectric breakdown can occur to repeat the cycle.  History  The erosive effect of electrical discharges was first noted in 1770 by English physicist Joseph Priestley. =Die-sink EDM= Two Russian scientists, B. R. Lazarenko and N. I. Lazarenko, were tasked in 1943 to investigate ways of preventing the erosion of tungsten electrical contacts due to sparking. They failed in this task but found that the erosion was more precisely controlled if the electrodes were immersed in a dielectric fluid. This led them to invent an EDM machine used for working difficult-to-machine materials such as tungsten. The Lazarenkos' machine is known as an R-C-type machine, after the resistor‚Äìcapacitor circuit (RC circuit) used to charge the electrodes. Simultaneously but independently, an American team, Harold Stark, Victor Harding, and Jack Beaver, developed an EDM machine for removing broken drills and taps from aluminium castings. Initially constructing their machines from under-powered electric-etching tools, they were not very successful. But more powerful sparking units, combined with automatic spark repetition and fluid replacement with an electromagnetic interrupter arrangement produced practical machines. Stark, Harding, and Beaver's machines were able to produce 60 sparks per second. Later machines based on their design used vacuum tube circuits that were able to produce thousands of sparks per second, significantly increasing the speed of cutting. =Wire-cut EDM= The wire-cut type of machine arose in the 1960s for making tools (dies) from hardened steel. The tool electrode in wire EDM is simply a wire. To avoid the erosion of the wire causing it to break, the wire is wound between two spools so that the active part of the wire is constantly changing. The earliest numerical controlled (NC) machines were conversions of punched- tape vertical milling machines. The first commercially available NC machine built as a wire-cut EDM machine was manufactured in the USSR in 1967. Machines that could optically follow lines on a master drawing were developed by David H. Dulebohn's group in the 1960s at Andrew Engineering CompanyDulebohn, \\"Tracer controlled machining by electrically induced erosion\\", , filed 4 December 1969, issued 19 October 1971. for milling and grinding machines. Master drawings were later produced by computer numerical controlled (CNC) plotters for greater accuracy. A wire-cut EDM machine using the CNC drawing plotter and optical line follower techniques was produced in 1974. Dulebohn later used the same plotter CNC program to directly control the EDM machine, and the first CNC EDM machine was produced in 1976. Commercial wire EDM capability and use has advanced substantially during recent decades. Feed rates have increased and surface finish can be finely controlled.

Electrical discharge machining is a machining method primarily used for hard metals or those that would be very difficult to machine with traditional techniques. EDM typically works with materials that are electrically conductive, although methods have also been proposed for using EDM to machine insulating ceramics. EDM can cut intricate contours or cavities in pre-hardened steel without the need for heat treatment to soften and re-harden them. This method can be used with any other metal or metal alloy such as titanium, hastelloy, kovar, and inconel. Also, applications of this process to shape polycrystalline diamond tools have been reported. EDM is often included in the \\"non-traditional\\" or \\"non-conventional\\" group of machining methods together with processes such as electrochemical machining (ECM), water jet cutting (WJ, AWJ), laser cutting and opposite to the \\"conventional\\" group (turning, milling, grinding, drilling and any other process whose material removal mechanism is essentially based on mechanical forces).McCarthy, Willard J. and McGeough, Joseph A. \\"Machine tool\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Ideally, EDM can be seen as a series of breakdown and restoration of the liquid dielectric in-between the electrodes. However, caution should be exerted in considering such a statement because it is an idealized model of the process, introduced to describe the fundamental ideas underlying the process. Yet, any practical application involves many aspects that may also need to be considered. For instance, the removal of the debris from the inter-electrode volume is likely to be always partial. Thus the electrical properties of the dielectric in the inter-electrodes volume can be different from their nominal values and can even vary with time. The inter- electrode distance, often also referred to as spark-gap, is the end result of the control algorithms of the specific machine used. The control of such a distance appears logically to be central to this process. Also, not all of the current between the dielectric is of the ideal type described above: the spark-gap can be short-circuited by the debris. The control system of the electrode may fail to react quickly enough to prevent the two electrodes (tool and workpiece) from coming into contact, with a consequent short circuit. This is unwanted because a short circuit contributes to material removal differently from the ideal case. The flushing action can be inadequate to restore the insulating properties of the dielectric so that the current always happens in the point of the inter-electrode volume (this is referred to as arcing), with a consequent unwanted change of shape (damage) of the tool- electrode and workpiece. Ultimately, a description of this process in a suitable way for the specific purpose at hand is what makes the EDM area such a rich field for further investigation and research.Descoeudres, Antoine (2006). Characterization of electrical discharge machining plasmas. Th√®se EPFL, no 3542. To obtain a specific geometry, the EDM tool is guided along the desired path very close to the work; ideally it should not touch the workpiece, although in reality this may happen due to the performance of the specific motion control in use. In this way, a large number of current discharges (colloquially also called sparks) happen, each contributing to the removal of material from both tool and workpiece, where small craters are formed. The size of the craters is a function of the technological parameters set for the specific job at hand. They can be with typical dimensions ranging from the nanoscale (in micro-EDM operations) to some hundreds of micrometers in roughing conditions. The presence of these small craters on the tool results in the gradual erosion of the electrode. This erosion of the tool- electrode is also referred to as wear. Strategies are needed to counteract the detrimental effect of the wear on the geometry of the workpiece. One possibility is that of continuously replacing the tool-electrode during a machining operation. This is what happens if a continuously replaced wire is used as electrode. In this case, the correspondent EDM process is also called wire EDM. The tool-electrode can also be used in such a way that only a small portion of it is actually engaged in the machining process and this portion is changed on a regular basis. This is, for instance, the case when using a rotating disk as a tool-electrode. The corresponding process is often also referred to as EDM grinding. A further strategy consists in using a set of electrodes with different sizes and shapes during the same EDM operation. This is often referred to as multiple electrode strategy, and is most common when the tool electrode replicates in negative the wanted shape and is advanced towards the blank along a single direction, usually the vertical direction (i.e. z-axis). This resembles the sink of the tool into the dielectric liquid in which the workpiece is immersed, so, not surprisingly, it is often referred to as die-sinking EDM (also called conventional EDM and ram EDM). The corresponding machines are often called sinker EDM. Usually, the electrodes of this type have quite complex forms. If the final geometry is obtained using a usually simple-shaped electrode which is moved along several directions and is possibly also subject to rotations, often the term EDM milling is used. In any case, the severity of the wear is strictly dependent on the technological parameters used in the operation (for instance: polarity, maximum current, open circuit voltage). For example, in micro-EDM, also known as Œº-EDM, these parameters are usually set at values which generates severe wear. Therefore, wear is a major problem in that area. The problem of wear to graphite electrodes is being addressed. In one approach, a digital generator, controllable within milliseconds, reverses polarity as electro-erosion takes place. That produces an effect similar to electroplating that continuously deposits the eroded graphite back on the electrode. In another method, a so- called \\"Zero Wear\\" circuit reduces how often the discharge starts and stops, keeping it on for as long a time as possible.Koelsch, James (October 2009). \\"EDM: A Changing Competitive Calculus,\\" Manufacturing Engineering, Society of Manufacturing Engineers Definition of the technological parameters Difficulties have been encountered in the definition of the technological parameters that drive the process. Two broad categories of generators, also known as power supplies, are in use on EDM machines commercially available: the group based on RC circuits and the group based on transistor controlled pulses. In the both categories, the primary parameters at setup are the current and frequency delivered. In RC circuits, however, little control is expected over the time duration of the discharge, which is likely to depend on the actual spark-gap conditions (size and pollution) at the moment of the discharge. Also, the open circuit voltage (i.e. the voltage between the electrodes when the dielectric is not yet broken) can be identified as steady state voltage of the RC circuit. In generators based on transistor control, the user is usually able to deliver a train of pulses of voltage to the electrodes. Each pulse can be controlled in shape, for instance, quasi- rectangular. In particular, the time between two consecutive pulses and the duration of each pulse can be set. The amplitude of each pulse constitutes the open circuit voltage. Thus, the maximum duration of discharge is equal to the duration of a pulse of voltage in the train. Two pulses of current are then expected not to occur for a duration equal or larger than the time interval between two consecutive pulses of voltage. The maximum current during a discharge that the generator delivers can also be controlled. Because other sorts of generators may also be used by different machine builders, the parameters that may actually be set on a particular machine will depend on the generator manufacturer. The details of the generators and control systems on their machines are not always easily available to their user. This is a barrier to describing unequivocally the technological parameters of the EDM process. Moreover, the parameters affecting the phenomena occurring between tool and electrode are also related to the controller of the motion of the electrodes. A framework to define and measure the electrical parameters during an EDM operation directly on inter-electrode volume with an oscilloscope external to the machine has been recently proposed by Ferri et al. These authors conducted their research in the field of Œº-EDM, but the same approach can be used in any EDM operation. This would enable the user to estimate directly the electrical parameters that affect their operations without relying upon machine manufacturer's claims. When machining different materials in the same setup conditions, the actual electrical parameters of the process are significantly different. Material removal mechanism The first serious attempt of providing a physical explanation of the material removal during electric discharge machining is perhaps that of Van Dijck.Van Dijck, Frans (1973). Physico-mathematical analysis of the electro discharge machining process. PhD Thesis Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Van Dijck presented a thermal model together with a computational simulation to explain the phenomena between the electrodes during electric discharge machining. However, as Van Dijck himself admitted in his study, the number of assumptions made to overcome the lack of experimental data at that time was quite significant. Further models of what occurs during electric discharge machining in terms of heat transfer were developed in the late eighties and early nineties, including an investigation at Texas A&M; University with the support of AGIE, now Agiecharmilles. It resulted in three scholarly papers: the first presenting a thermal model of material removal on the cathode, the second presenting a thermal model for the erosion occurring on the anode and the third introducing a model describing the plasma channel formed during the passage of the discharge current through the dielectric liquid. Validation of these models is supported by experimental data provided by AGIE. These models give the most authoritative support for the claim that EDM is a thermal process, removing material from the two electrodes because of melting or vaporization, along with pressure dynamics established in the spark-gap by the collapsing of the plasma channel. However, for small discharge energies the models are inadequate to explain the experimental data. All these models hinge on a number of assumptions from such disparate research areas as submarine explosions, discharges in gases, and failure of transformers, so it is not surprising that alternative models have been proposed more recently in the literature trying to explain the EDM process. Among these, the model from Singh and Ghosh reconnects the removal of material from the electrode to the presence of an electrical force on the surface of the electrode that could mechanically remove material and create the craters. This would be possible because the material on the surface has altered mechanical properties due to an increased temperature caused by the passage of electric current. The authors' simulations showed how they might explain EDM better than a thermal model (melting or evaporation), especially for small discharge energies, which are typically used in Œº-EDM and in finishing operations. Given the many available models, it appears that the material removal mechanism in EDM is not yet well understood and that further investigation is necessary to clarify it, especially considering the lack of experimental scientific evidence to build and validate the current EDM models. This explains an increased current research effort in related experimental techniques. In this conclusion, there are following major factors are achieved during machining operations: * Resulting foremost conclusions can be stated from review of work in this area that EDM performance is generally evaluated on the basis of TWR, MRR, Ra and hardness. * In material removal rate (MRR) from all selected parameters, spark current (I) is the most significant input factor affecting the machining of workpiece. * The performance is affected by discharge current, pulse on time, pulse off time, duty cycle, voltage for EDM. * For tool wear rate (TWR) from the all selected parameters, spark current (I) is the most significant input factor affecting the machining of workpiece followed by spark time and voltage. * Innovative technology in the EDM is unceasingly progressing to make this procedure further appropriate for the Machining. In the field of manufacturing additional attention is on the optimization of the method by dropping the number of Electrode. Vishal Kumar Jaiswal (2018) Literature Review on Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM).\\"International Journal for Scientific Research and Development 6.5 (2018): 239-241, IJSRD http://www.ijsrd.com/articles/IJSRDV6I50198.pdf. Types =Sinker EDM= J-2 rocket engine, six of which were needed for each trip to the moon. Sinker EDM, also called ram EDM, cavity type EDM or volume EDM, consists of an electrode and workpiece submerged in an insulating liquid such as, more typically, oil or, less frequently, other dielectric fluids. The electrode and workpiece are connected to a suitable power supply. The power supply generates an electrical potential between the two parts. As the electrode approaches the workpiece, dielectric breakdown occurs in the fluid, forming a plasma channel, and a small spark jumps. These sparks usually strike one at a time, because it is very unlikely that different locations in the inter-electrode space have the identical local electrical characteristics which would enable a spark to occur simultaneously in all such locations. These sparks happen in huge numbers at seemingly random locations between the electrode and the workpiece. As the base metal is eroded, and the spark gap subsequently increased, the electrode is lowered automatically by the machine so that the process can continue uninterrupted. Several hundred thousand sparks occur per second, with the actual duty cycle carefully controlled by the setup parameters. These controlling cycles are sometimes known as \\"on time\\" and \\"off time\\", which are more formally defined in the literature. The on time setting determines the length or duration of the spark. Hence, a longer on time produces a deeper cavity from each spark, creating a rougher finish on the workpiece. The reverse is true for a shorter on time. Off time is the period of time between sparks. Although not directly affecting the machining of the part, the off time allows the flushing of dielectric fluid through a nozzle to clean out the eroded debris. Insufficient debris removal can cause repeated strikes in the same location which can lead to a short circuit. Modern controllers monitor the characteristics of the arcs and can alter parameters in microseconds to compensate. The typical part geometry is a complex 3D shape, often with small or odd shaped angles. Vertical, orbital, vectorial, directional, helical, conical, rotational, spin and indexing machining cycles are also used. =Wire EDM= CNC Wire-cut EDM machine 1 Wire. 2 Electrical discharge erosion (Electric arc). 3 Electrical potential. 4 Workpiece. In wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM), also known as wire-cut EDM and wire cutting, a thin single-strand metal wire, usually brass, is fed through the workpiece, submerged in a tank of dielectric fluid, typically deionized water. Wire-cut EDM is typically used to cut plates as thick as 300mm and to make punches, tools, and dies from hard metals that are difficult to machine with other methods. The wire, which is constantly fed from a spool, is held between upper and lower diamond guides which is centered in a water nozzle head. The Charmilles Robofill 300 uses carbide guides. The guides, usually CNC- controlled, move in the x‚Äìy plane. On most machines, the upper guide can also move independently in the z‚Äìu‚Äìv axis, giving rise to the ability to cut tapered and transitioning shapes (circle on the bottom, square at the top for example). The upper guide can control axis movements in the GCode standard, x‚Äìy‚Äìu‚Äìv‚Äìi‚Äìj‚Äìk‚Äìl‚Äì. This allows the wire-cut EDM to be programmed to cut very intricate and delicate shapes. The upper and lower diamond guides are usually accurate to , and can have a cutting path or kerf as small as using √ò wire, though the average cutting kerf that achieves the best economic cost and machining time is using √ò brass wire. The reason that the cutting width is greater than the width of the wire is because sparking occurs from the sides of the wire to the work piece, causing erosion. This \\"overcut\\" is necessary, for many applications it is adequately predictable and therefore can be compensated for (for instance in micro-EDM this is not often the case). Spools of wire are long ‚Äî an 8 kg spool of 0.25 mm wire is just over 19 kilometers in length. Wire diameter can be as small as and the geometry precision is not far from ¬± . The wire-cut process uses water as its dielectric fluid, controlling its resistivity and other electrical properties with filters and PID controlled de-ionizer units. The water flushes the cut debris away from the cutting zone. Flushing is an important factor in determining the maximum feed rate for a given material thickness. Along with tighter tolerances, multi axis EDM wire-cutting machining centers have added features such as multi heads for cutting two parts at the same time, controls for preventing wire breakage, automatic self-threading features in case of wire breakage, and programmable machining strategies to optimize the operation. Wire-cutting EDM is commonly used when low residual stresses are desired, because it does not require high cutting forces for removal of material. If the energy/power per pulse is relatively low (as in finishing operations), little change in the mechanical properties of a material is expected due to these low residual stresses, although material that hasn't been stress-relieved can distort in the machining process. The work piece may undergo a significant thermal cycle, its severity depending on the technological parameters used. Such thermal cycles may cause formation of a recast layer on the part and residual tensile stresses on the work piece. If machining takes place after heat treatment, dimensional accuracy will not be affected by heat treat distortion.ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE MACHINING (EDM). header.com =Fast hole drilling EDM= Fast hole drilling EDM was designed for producing fast, accurate, small, and deep holes. It is conceptually akin to sinker EDM but the electrode is a rotating tube conveying a pressurized jet of dielectric fluid. It can make a hole an inch deep in about a minute and is a good way to machine holes in materials too hard for twist-drill machining. This EDM drilling type is used largely in the aerospace industry, producing cooling holes into aero blades and other components. It is also used to drill holes in industrial gas turbine blades, in molds and dies, and in bearings. Applications =Prototype production= The EDM process is most widely used by the mold-making, tool, and die industries, but is becoming a common method of making prototype and production parts, especially in the aerospace, automobile and electronics industries in which production quantities are relatively low. In sinker EDM, a graphite, copper tungsten, or pure copper electrode is machined into the desired (negative) shape and fed into the workpiece on the end of a vertical ram. =Coinage die making= Master at top, badge die workpiece at bottom, oil jets at left (oil has been drained). Initial flat stamping will be \\"dapped\\", see sinking (metalworking), to give a curved surface. For the creation of dies for producing jewelry and badges, or blanking and piercing (through use of a pancake die) by the coinage (stamping) process, the positive master may be made from sterling silver, since (with appropriate machine settings) the master is significantly eroded and is used only once. The resultant negative die is then hardened and used in a drop hammer to produce stamped flats from cutout sheet blanks of bronze, silver, or low proof gold alloy. For badges these flats may be further shaped to a curved surface by another die. This type of EDM is usually performed submerged in an oil-based dielectric. The finished object may be further refined by hard (glass) or soft (paint) enameling, or electroplated with pure gold or nickel. Softer materials such as silver may be hand engraved as a refinement. EDM control panel (Hansvedt machine). Machine may be adjusted for a refined surface (electropolish) at end of process. =Small hole drilling= A turbine blade with internal cooling as applied in the high-pressure turbine. Small hole drilling EDM machines. Small hole drilling EDM is used in a variety of applications. On wire-cut EDM machines, small hole drilling EDM is used to make a through hole in a workpiece through which to thread the wire for the wire-cut EDM operation. A separate EDM head specifically for small hole drilling is mounted on a wire-cut machine and allows large hardened plates to have finished parts eroded from them as needed and without pre-drilling. Small hole EDM is used to drill rows of holes into the leading and trailing edges of turbine blades used in jet engines. Gas flow through these small holes allows the engines to use higher temperatures than otherwise possible. The high- temperature, very hard, single crystal alloys employed in these blades makes conventional machining of these holes with high aspect ratio extremely difficult, if not impossible. Small hole EDM is also used to create microscopic orifices for fuel system components, spinnerets for synthetic fibers such as rayon, and other applications. There are also stand-alone small hole drilling EDM machines with an x‚Äìy axis also known as a super drill or hole popper that can machine blind or through holes. EDM drills bore holes with a long brass or copper tube electrode that rotates in a chuck with a constant flow of distilled or deionized water flowing through the electrode as a flushing agent and dielectric. The electrode tubes operate like the wire in wire-cut EDM machines, having a spark gap and wear rate. Some small-hole drilling EDMs are able to drill through 100 mm of soft or hardened steel in less than 10 seconds, averaging 50% to 80% wear rate. Holes of 0.3 mm to 6.1 mm can be achieved in this drilling operation. Brass electrodes are easier to machine but are not recommended for wire-cut operations due to eroded brass particles causing \\"brass on brass\\" wire breakage, therefore copper is recommended. =Metal disintegration machining= Several manufacturers produce EDM machines for the specific purpose of removing broken tools (drill bits, taps, bolts and studs) from work pieces. In this application, the process is termed \\"metal disintegration machining\\" or MDM. The metal disintegration process removes only the center of the tap, bolt or stud leaving the hole intact and allowing a part to be reclaimed. = Closed loop manufacturing = Closed loop manufacturing can improve the accuracy and reduce the tool costs Advantages and disadvantages Advantages of EDM include machining of: *Complex shapes that would otherwise be difficult to produce with conventional cutting tools. *Extremely hard material to very close tolerances. *Very small work pieces where conventional cutting tools may damage the part from excess cutting tool pressure. *There is no direct contact between tool and work piece. Therefore, delicate sections and weak materials can be machined without perceivable distortion. *A good surface finish can be obtained; a very good surface may be obtained by redundant finishing paths. *Very fine holes can be attained. *Tapered holes may be produced. *Pipe or container internal contours and internal corners down to R .001\\". Disadvantages of EDM include: * Difficulty finding expert machinists. *The slow rate of material removal. *Potential fire hazard associated with use of combustible oil based dielectrics. *The additional time and cost used for creating electrodes for ram/sinker EDM. *Reproducing sharp corners on the workpiece is difficult due to electrode wear. *Specific power consumption is very high. *Power consumption is high. *\\"Overcut\\" is formed. *Excessive tool wear occurs during machining. *Electrically non-conductive materials can be machined only with specific set-up of the process. (2010).  Custom/DIY EDM machines  Commercial EDM machines are not considered suitable for hobby/garage use, as the cost of a commercial machine is even a substantial investment for most companies, let alone individuals. Next to the cost, commercial machines require a lot of floor space and industrial 3-phase mains power. However, the versatility of EDM has been recognized by the DIY maker community and custom designed wire EDM machines have been rising in popularity, of which several examples can be seen on YouTube. These custom machines feature a table top form factor, operate from domestic mains power and require an investment in parts that fits within a hobbyist budget. This rise in popularity is mainly due to the widespread availability of required parts. In particular, the release of an EDM arc generator in 2018, which was designed specifically for easy integration into custom EDM machines, signaled this change. Prior to this release, all components required to build a custom EDM machine were available however the arc generator itself still required a custom design, which is a real engineering challenge.

Project planning can be done manually or by the use of project management software.  Description  Initially, the project scope is defined and the appropriate methods for completing the project are determined. Following this step, the durations for the various tasks necessary to complete the work are listed and grouped into a work breakdown structure. Project planning is often used to organize different areas of a project, including project plans, work loads and the management of teams and individuals. The logical dependencies between tasks are defined using an activity network diagram that enables identification of the critical path. Project planning is inherently uncertain as it must be done before the project is actually started. Therefore, the duration of the tasks is often estimated through a weighted average of optimistic, normal, and pessimistic cases. The critical chain method adds \\"buffers\\" in the planning to anticipate potential delays in project execution. Float or slack time in the schedule can be calculated using project management software. Then the necessary resources can be estimated and costs for each activity can be allocated to each resource, giving the total project cost. At this stage, the project schedule may be optimized to achieve the appropriate balance between resource usage and project duration to comply with the project objectives. Once established and agreed, the project schedule becomes what is known as the baseline schedule. Progress will be measured against the baseline schedule throughout the life of the project. Analyzing progress compared to the baseline schedule is known as earned value management. The inputs of the project planning phase 2 include the project charter and the concept proposal. The outputs of the project planning phase include the project requirements, the project schedule, and the project management plan.Filicetti, John, Project Planning Overview, PM Hut (Last accessed 8 November 2009).

It is often cooked or served with added flavorings such as sugar, honey, (dried) fruit or syrup to make a sweet cereal, or it can be mixed with spices, meat or vegetables to make a savoury dish. It is usually served hot in a bowl, depending on its consistency. Oat porridge, or oatmeal, is one of the most common types of porridge. Gruel is a thinner version of porridge. Type of grains Cooked oatmeal in a bowl The term \\"porridge\\" is often used specifically for oat porridge (oatmeal), which is typically eaten for breakfast with salt, sugar, fruit, milk, cream or butter and sometimes other flavorings. Oat porridge is also sold in ready-made or partly cooked form as an instant breakfast. Other grains used for porridge include rice, wheat, barley, corn, triticale and buckwheat. Many types of porridge have their own names, such as polenta, grits and kasha. Origins Historically, porridge was a staple food in much of the world, including Europe and Africa, and it remains a staple food in many parts of the world. Porridge was first produced during the paleolithic by hunter- gatherers, but would become common place during the neolithic. The dish has traditionally been closely associated with Scotland, possibly because oats can be successfully cultivated on marginal upland soils. In 1775, Dr. Samuel Johnson wrote that oats were \\"a grain which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland supports the people\\". Oats were introduced to Scotland in about 600 AD, but traces of barley porridge have been found in pots excavated in the Outer Hebrides which have been dated to 2,500 years ago. Conventional uses As well as a breakfast cereal, porridge is used in many cultures as a common snack, and is often eaten by athletes. Nutrition Unenriched porridge (as oatmeal), cooked by boiling or microwave, is 84% water, and contains 12% carbohydrates, including 2% dietary fiber, and 2% each of protein and fat (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, cooked porridge provides 71 Calories and contains 29% of the Daily Value (DV) for manganese and moderate content of phosphorus and zinc (11% DV each), with no other micronutrients in significant content (table). =Health effect= A 2014 review found that daily intake of at least 3 grams of oat beta-glucan lowers total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 5-10% in people with normal or elevated blood cholesterol levels. Beta-glucan lowers cholesterol by inhibiting cholesterol production, although cholesterol reduction is greater in people with higher total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in their blood. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration issued a final ruling in 2015 stating that food companies can make health claims on food labels for products containing soluble fiber from whole oats (oat bran, oat flour and rolled oats), noting that 3.0 grams of soluble fiber daily from these foods may reduce the risk of heart disease. To qualify for the health claim, the food that contains the oats must provide at least 0.75 grams of soluble fiber per serving. Varieties Porridge as sold in German supermarkets =Maize= * Maize porridge: Atole, a Mexican dish of corn flour in water or milk.  Champurrado (a chocolate-based atole), a Mexican blend of sugar, milk, chocolate and corn dough or corn flour. The Philippine dish tsampurado is similar, with rice instead of maize.

Suppawn, also called, and better known as, hasty pudding, was common in American colonial times and consisted of cornmeal boiled with milk into a thick porridge. Still eaten in modern times, it is no longer necessarily corn-based.  Uji, a thick East African porridge made most commonly from corn flour mixed with sorghum and many other different ground cereals, with milk or butter and sugar or salt. Ugali, a more solid meal, is also made from maize flour, likewise often mixed with other cereals. These two, under various names, are staple foods over a wide part of the African continent, e.g., pap in South Africa, sadza in Zimbabwe, nshima in Zambia, tuwo or ogi in Nigeria, etc., though some of these may also be made from sorghum.  ≈Ωganci, a maize porridge prepared in the Kajkavian countries and Slovenia.

In his comments (1883) about the development of foods, he highlights porridge as one of the oldest Nordic meals. No other meal is described as frequently as this \\"from the moment the written sources begun.\\" See: Oat porridge has been found in the stomachs of 5,000-year-old Neolithic bog bodies in Central Europe and Scandinavia. Varieties of oat porridge include:  Groats, a porridge made from unprocessed oats or wheat.  Gruel, very thin porridge, often drunk rather than eaten.  Yod Kerc'h, a traditional oat porridge from the north-west of France, primarily Brittany, made with oats, butter and water or milk.  Owsianka, an east European (Russia, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine) traditional breakfast made with hot milk, oats and sometimes with sugar and butter.  Porridge made from rolled oats or ground oatmeal is common in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, North America, Finland and Scandinavia. It is known as simply \\"porridge\\" or, more commonly in the United States and Canada, \\"oatmeal\\". In the US, oat and wheat porridge can both be called \\"hot cereal\\". Rolled oats are commonly used in England, oatmeal in Scotland and steel-cut oats in Ireland. In the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, cooks made burgoo for the men for breakfast, from coarse oatmeal and water.  Porridge (Parrige) ‚Äì Anglophone Caribbean (Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad etc.) Also known as Pap. The most common type is corn meal, and they are always made with milk. Varieties include oatmeal, grated green plantain, barley, cream of wheat, sago (tapioca). Oatmeal porridge is often flavored with cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar or almond essence.  Stirabout ‚Äì Irish porridge, traditionally made by stirring oats into boiling water  Terci de ovƒÉz, traditional oatmeal in Romania.  Zabk√°sa, traditional oatmeal in Hungary. Types of oats William Hemsley (1893) Oats for porridge may be whole (groats), cut into two or three pieces (called \\"pinhead\\", \\"steel-cut\\" or \\"coarse\\" oatmeal), ground into medium or fine oatmeal or steamed and rolled into flakes of varying sizes and thicknesses (called \\"rolled oats\\", the largest size being \\"jumbo\\"). The larger the pieces of oat used, the more textured the resulting porridge. It is said that, because of their size and shape, the body breaks steel-cut oats down more slowly than rolled oats, reducing spikes in blood sugar and making the eater feel full longer. The US Consumer Reports Web site found that the more cooking required, the stronger the oat flavor and the less mushy the texture. Oats are a good source of dietary fibre; health benefits are claimed for oat bran in particular, which is part of the grain. Preparation The oats are cooked in milk, water or a mixture of the two. Scottish traditionalists allow only oats, water and salt.How to cook perfect porridge, Felicity Cloake, The Guardian, 10 November 2011. There are techniques suggested by cooks, such as presoaking, but a comparative test found little difference in the end result.

History =Northern Europe= Estonian rustic porridge Mulgipuder made with potatoes, groats and meat is known as national dish of Estonia Latvian barley grit porridge with milk, potatoes and speck (buksti≈Üputra) Historically, porridge was a staple food in much of Northern Europe and Russia. It was often made from barley, though other grains and yellow peas could be used, depending on local conditions. It was primarily a savoury dish, with meats, root crops, vegetables and herbs added for flavor. Porridge could be cooked in a large metal kettle over hot coals or heated in a cheaper earthenware container by adding hot stones until boiling hot. Until leavened bread and baking ovens became commonplace in Europe, porridge was a typical means of preparing cereal crops for the table. Porridge was also commonly used as prison breakfast for inmates in the British prison system during the 19th century and early 20th century, and so \\"doing porridge\\" became a slang term for a sentence in prison.

King Edward I had them erected between 1291 and about 1295 in memory of his beloved wife Eleanor of Castile, who died in November 1290, marking the nightly resting-places along the route taken when her body was transported to London. The crosses stood at Lincoln, Grantham and Stamford, all in Lincolnshire; Geddington and Hardingstone in Northamptonshire; Stony Stratford in Buckinghamshire; Woburn and Dunstable in Bedfordshire; St Albans and Waltham (now Waltham Cross) in Hertfordshire; Cheapside in London; and Charing (now Charing Cross) in Westminster. Three ‚Äì those at Geddington, Hardingstone and Waltham Cross ‚Äì survive more or less intact; but the other nine, other than a few fragments, are lost. The largest and most ornate of the twelve was Charing Cross. Background =Procession and burials= Eleanor of Castile, Queen Consort of England 1272‚Äì90 Eleanor of Castile died on 28 November 1290 at Harby, Nottinghamshire. Edward and Eleanor loved each other and much like his father, Edward was very devoted to his wife and remained faithful to her throughout their married lives. He was deeply affected by her death and displayed his grief by erecting twelve so-called Eleanor crosses, one at each place where her funeral cort√®ge stopped for the night. Following her death the body of Queen Eleanor was carried to Lincoln, about away, where she was embalmed ‚Äì probably either at the Gilbertine priory of St Catherine in the south of the city, or at the priory of the Dominicans.Powrie 1990, pp. 32‚Äì34. Her viscera, less her heart, were buried in the Angel Choir of Lincoln Cathedral on 3 December.Cockerill 2014, p. 344. Eleanor's other remains were carried to London, a journey of about , that lasted 12 days. Her body was buried in Westminster Abbey, at the feet of her father-in-law King Henry III on 17 December; while her heart was buried in the church of the London Dominicans' priory at Blackfriars (a house that she and Edward had heavily patronised) on 19 December, along with those of her young son Alphonso, Earl of Chester, who had died in 1284, and of John de Vesci, who had died in 1289.Cockerill 2014, p. 344. =Commemoration= Tomb monuments Both the burial of Eleanor's body at Westminster and her visceral burial at Lincoln were subsequently marked by ornate effigial monuments, both with similar life- sized gilt bronze effigies cast by the goldsmith William Torell.Colvin 1963, pp. 481‚Äì82.Alexander and Binski 1987, pp. 364‚Äì66. Her heart burial at the Blackfriars was marked by another elaborate monument, but probably not with a life-sized effigy.Colvin 1963, pp. 482‚Äì83.Hunter 1842, pp. 186‚Äì87.Galloway 1914, pp. 79‚Äì80. The Blackfriars monument was lost following the priory's dissolution in 1538. The Lincoln monument was destroyed in the 17th century, but was replaced in 1891 with a reconstruction, not on the site of the original.Parsons 1995, p. 208.Galloway 1914, pp. 68‚Äì69 (gives the erroneous date of 1901). The Westminster Abbey monument survives. Crosses Illumination from the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (‚Äì1416) depicting a cross possibly representing one of the montjoies of Louis IX The twelve crosses were erected to mark the places where Eleanor's funeral procession had stopped overnight. Their construction is documented in the executors' account rolls, which survive from 1291 to March 1294, but not thereafter.Botfield and Turner 1841. By the end of that period, the crosses at Lincoln, Hardingstone, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans and Waltham were complete or nearly so, and those at Cheapside and Charing in progress; but those at Grantham, Stamford and Geddington apparently not yet begun. It is assumed that these last three were erected in 1294 or 1295, and that they were certainly finished before the financial crisis of 1297 which brought a halt to royal building works.Colvin 1963, pp. 483‚Äì4. A number of artists worked on the crosses, as the account rolls show, with a distinction generally drawn between the main structures, made locally under the direction of master masons appointed by the King, and the statues of Eleanor, made of Caen stone, and other sculptural details, brought from London. Master masons included Richard of Crundale, Roger of Crundale (probably Richard's brother), Michael of Canterbury, Richard of Stow, John of Battle and Nicholas Dymenge. Sculptors included Alexander of Abingdon and William of Ireland, both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, who were paid ¬£3 6s. 8d. apiece for the statues; and Ralph of Chichester.Hastings 1955, pp. 20‚Äì21.Powrie 1990, p. 65.Cockerill 2014, p. 357.Liversidge 1989. =Purpose and parallels= Eleanor's crosses appear to have been intended in part as expressions of royal power; and in part as cenotaphs to encourage prayers for her soul from travellers.Chronicle of St Albans.Colvin 1963, p. 485.Cockerill 2014, pp. 351‚Äì52. On the pedestal of each was inscribed the phrase Orate pro anima (\\"Pray for [her] soul\\").Hunter 1842, p. 180. It was not unknown for memorial crosses to be constructed in the middle ages, although they were normally isolated instances and relatively simple in design. A cross in the Strand, near London, was said to have been erected by William II in memory of his mother, Queen Matilda (d. 1083). Henry III erected one at Merton, Surrey, for his cousin the Earl of Surrey (d. 1240). Another was erected at Reading for Edward I's sister Beatrice (d. 1275). Yet another, almost contemporary with the Eleanor crosses, was erected near Windsor for Edward's mother, Eleanor of Provence (d.1291).Colvin 1963, pp. 484‚Äì85.Parsons 1991, pp. 18, 60.Parsons 1995, p. 209. The closest precedent for the Eleanor crosses, and almost certainly their model, was the series of nine crosses known as montjoies erected along the funeral route of King Louis IX of France in 1271. These were elaborate structures incorporating sculptural representations of the King, and were erected in part to promote his canonisation (a campaign that in 1297 succeeded). Eleanor's crosses never aspired to this last purpose, but in design were even larger and more ornate than the montjoies, being of at least three rather than two tiers.Cockerill 2014, p. 351. Locations =Lincoln= The surviving fragment of the Lincoln cross () Eleanor rested on the first night of the journey at The Priory of Saint Katherine without Lincoln and her viscera were buried in Lincoln Cathedral on 3 December 1290. The Lincoln cross was built between 1291 and 1293 by Richard of Stow at a total recorded cost of over ¬£120, with sculptures by William of Ireland.Colvin 1963, p. 483.Galloway 1914, p. 68. John Leland, in the early 1540s, noted that \\"a litle without Barre [gate] is a very fair crosse and large\\". It stood at Swine Green, St Catherine's, an area just outside the city at the southern end of the High Street, but had disappeared by the early 18th century. The only surviving piece is the lower half of one of the statues, rediscovered in the 19th century and now in the grounds of Lincoln Castle.Powrie 1990, pp. 65‚Äì67. =Grantham= 2015 plaque in Grantham () Eleanor's bier spent the night of 4 December 1290 in Grantham, Lincolnshire.Powrie 1990, p. 194.Cockerill 2014, p. 345. The master mason for the cross here is not known: it was probably constructed in 1294 or 1295. It stood at the upper end of the High Street. It was pulled down during the Civil War, but in February 1647 Grantham Corporation ordered that any stones that could be traced should be recovered for public use. No part is known to survive, but it is conceivable that the substantial steps of the standing Market Cross comprise stones that originally belonged to the Eleanor Cross. A letter from the 18th-century antiquary William Stukeley (now untraceable) is alleged to have stated that he had one of the lions from Eleanor's coats of arms in his garden.Powrie 1990, pp. 80‚Äì81. A modern relief stone plaque to Eleanor was installed at the Grantham Guildhall in 2015. =Stamford= () Eleanor's bier spent the night of 5 December 1290, and possibly also that of 6 December, in Stamford, Lincolnshire. The master mason for the cross here is not known: it was probably constructed in 1294 or 1295. There is conflicting evidence about its precise location, but it is now generally agreed that it stood just outside the town on the Great North Road (modern Casterton Road, the B1081), in what is today the Foxdale area. The cross was in decay by the early 17th century, and in 1621 the town council ordered some restoration work, although it is unclear whether this was carried out.Powrie 1990, p. 83. Richard Symonds reported in 1645: \\"In the hill before ye come into the towne, stands a lofty large crosse built by Edward III, in memory of Elianor his queene, whose corps rested there coming from the North.\\" In 1646 Richard Butcher, the Town Clerk, described it as \\"so defaced, that only the Ruins appeare to my eye\\".Galloway 1914, p. 69. It had probably been destroyed by 1659, and certainly by the early 18th century.Powrie 1990, pp. 82‚Äì84. In 1745, William Stukeley attempted to excavate the remains of the cross, and succeeded in finding its hexagonal baseStukeley notes the base in different places as both hexagonal and octagonal (see Smith 1994, p. 311, n. 10); but his ground plan at Bodleian Library, MS Eng. misc. e. 126, fol. 18, confirms that what he found was hexagonal. and recovering several fragments of the superstructure. His sketch of the top portion, which seems to have stylistically resembled the Geddington Cross, is found in his diaries in the Bodleian Library, Oxford.Cockerill 2014, pp. 355, 367, plate 46. A single small fragment from among Stukeley's finds, a carved Purbeck marble rose, was rediscovered in about 1976, and identified as part of the cross in 1993. Following the closure of Stamford Museum in 2011, this fragment is now displayed in the Discover Stamford area at the town's library. A modern monument was erected in Stamford in 2009 in commemoration of Eleanor: see Replicas and imitations below. =Geddington= The Geddington cross () Eleanor's bier spent the night of either 6 or 7 December 1290, or possibly both, in Geddington, Northamptonshire. The master mason for the cross here is not known: it was probably constructed in 1294 or 1295. It was recorded by William Camden in 1607; and still stands in the centre of the village, the best-preserved of the three survivors.Powrie 1990, 105‚Äì6. It is unique among the three in having a triangular plan, and a taller and more slender profile with a lower tier entirely covered with rosette diapering, instead of the arch-and-gable motif with tracery which appears on both the others; and canopied statues surmounted by a slender hexagonal pinnacle. It is possible that the other northern crosses (Lincoln, Grantham and Stamford) were in a similar relatively simple style; and that this reflects either the need to cut back expenditure in the latter stages of the project for financial reasons,Liversidge 1989, p. 100. or a decision taken at the planning stage to make the crosses progressively larger and more ornate as the sequence proceeded south.Cockerill 2014, p. 357. An engraving of the Geddington cross (drawn by Jacob Schnebbelie and engraved by James Basire) was published by the Society of Antiquaries in its Vetusta Monumenta series in 1791.Alexander and Binski 1987, p. 362. It was \\"discreetly\\" restored in 1892. =Hardingstone, Northampton= The Hardingstone cross () Eleanor's bier spent the night of 8 December 1290, and perhaps also that of 7 December, at Hardingstone, on the outskirts of Northampton. The cross here was constructed between 1291 and 1292 by John of Battle, at a total recorded cost of over ¬£100. William of Ireland and Ralph of Chichester carved the statues.Galloway 1914, pp. 72‚Äì73.Powrie 1990, pp. 124‚Äì26. A causeway leading from the town to the cross was constructed by Robert son of Henry.Hunter 1842, p. 183. The cross is still standing, close to Delapr√© Abbey, on the side of the A508 leading out of Northampton, and just north of the junction with the A45. The King stayed nearby at Northampton Castle. The monument is octagonal in shape and set on steps; the present steps are replacements. It is built in three tiers, and originally had a crowning terminal, presumably a cross. The terminal appears to have gone by 1460: there is mention of a \\"headless cross\\" at the site from which Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, watched Margaret of Anjou's flight following the Battle of Northampton. The monument was restored in 1713, to mark the Peace of Utrecht and the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, and this work included the fitting of a new terminal in the form of a Maltese cross.Lovell 1892, pp. 27‚Äì28.Warrington 2018, pp. 110‚Äì12. Further repairs were undertaken in 1762.Galloway 1914, p. 72. At a later restoration in 1840, under the direction of Edward Blore, the Maltese cross was replaced by the picturesque broken shaft which is seen today. Later, less intrusive restorations were undertaken in 1877 and 1986. Further restoration work was completed in 2019. The bottom tier of the monument features open books. These probably included painted inscriptions of Eleanor's biography and of prayers for her soul to be said by viewers, now lost. John Leland, in the early 1540s, recorded it as \\"a right goodly crosse, caullid, as I remembre, the Quenes Crosse\\", although he seems to have associated it with the 1460 Battle of Northampton. It is also referred to by Daniel Defoe in his Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain, in reporting the Great Fire of Northampton in 1675: \\"... a townsman being at Queen's Cross upon a hill on the south side of the town, about two miles () off, saw the fire at one end of the town then newly begun, and that before he could get to the town it was burning at the remotest end, opposite where he first saw it.\\" Celia Fiennes in 1697 describes it as \\"a Cross, a mile off the town call'd High-Cross ‚Äì it stands just in the middle of England ‚Äì its all stone 12 stepps which runs round it, above that is the stone carv'd finely and there are 4 large Nitches about the middle, in each is the statue of some queen at length which encompasses it with other carvings as garnish, and so it rises less and less to the top like a tower or Piramidy.\\" An engraving of the Hardingstone cross (drawn by Jacob Schnebbelie and engraved by James Basire) was published by the Society of Antiquaries in its Vetusta Monumenta series in 1791. =Stony Stratford= Plaque in Stony Stratford (plaque at ) Eleanor's bier spent the night of 9 December 1290 at Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire. The cross here was built between 1291 and 1293 by John of Battle at a total recorded cost of over ¬£100. The supplier of the statues is uncertain, but some smaller carvings were provided by Ralph of Chichester. The cross stood at the lower end of the town, towards the River Ouse, on Watling Street (now the High Street), although its exact location is debated. It is said to have been of a tall elegant design (perhaps similar to that at Geddington). It was described by William Camden in 1607 as minus elegantem (\\"none of the fairest\\"), suggesting that it was by this date in a state of decay. It is said to have been demolished in about 1643. In 1735, William Hartley, a man of nearly 80, could remember only the base still standing.Galloway 1914, p. 73.Powrie 1990, pp. 129‚Äì30. Any trace has now vanished. The cross is commemorated by a brass plaque on the wall of 157 High Street. =Woburn= (approximately at ) Eleanor's bier spent the night of 10 December 1290 at Woburn, Bedfordshire. Work on the cross here started in 1292, later than some of the others, and was completed in the spring of 1293. It was built by John of Battle, at a total recorded cost of over ¬£100. As at Stony Stratford, the supplier of the statues is uncertain, but some of the carvings were provided by Ralph of Chichester.Powrie 1990, p. 130. No part of the cross survives. Its precise location, and its fate, are unknown. =Dunstable= () Eleanor's bier spent the night of 11 December 1290 at Dunstable, Bedfordshire. It rested first in the market place, before being carried into Dunstable Priory church, where the canons prayed in an overnight vigil.Cockerill 2014, p. 347. The cross was built between 1291 and 1293 by John of Battle at a total recorded cost of over ¬£100. Some of the sculpture was supplied by Ralph of Chichester.Hunter 1842, p. 184. It is thought to have been located in the middle of the town, probably in the market place, and was reported by William Camden as still standing in 1586. It is said to have been demolished in 1643 by troops under the Earl of Essex.Lovell 1892, p. 32. No part survives, although some of the foundations are reported to have been discovered during roadworks at the beginning of the 20th century.Galloway 1914, pp. 73‚Äì74.Powrie 1990, pp. 135‚Äì36. The Eleanor's Cross Shopping Precinct in High Street North contains a modern statue of Eleanor, erected in 1985.Dunstable cross on the Bedfordshire website.] =St Albans= Plaque on the Clock Tower, St Albans () Eleanor's bier spent the night of 12 December 1290 at St Albans, Hertfordshire. The cross here was built between 1291 and 1293 by John of Battle at a total recorded cost of over ¬£100, with some of the sculpture supplied by Ralph of Chichester.Powrie 1990, p. 141.Galloway 1914, p. 74. It was erected at the south end of the Market Place, and for many years stood in front of the fifteenth-century Clock Tower in the High Street, opposite the Waxhouse Gateway entrance to the Abbey. In 1596, it was described as \\"verie stately\\". However, having fallen into decay, and having probably been further damaged during the Civil War, it was eventually demolished in 1701‚Äì02, to be replaced by a market cross. This was demolished in turn in 1810, although the town pump it contained survived a little longer. A drinking fountain was erected on the site by philanthropist Isabella Worley in 1874: this was relocated to Victoria Square nearby in the late 20th century. A late 19th-century ceramic plaque on the Clock Tower commemorates the Eleanor cross. =Waltham (now Waltham Cross)= The Waltham cross () Eleanor's bier spent the night of 13 December 1290 in the parish of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire. The cross here was built in about 1291 by Roger of Crundale and Nicholas Dymenge at a total recorded cost of over ¬£110. It probably became known as Waltham Cross because it stood at the way to Waltham Abbey, across the River Lea in Essex, which was clearly visible from its site. The sculpture was by Alexander of Abingdon, with some items supplied by Robert of Corfe.Image of the cross at Waltham.Powrie 1990, pp. 148‚Äì49. The cross was located outside the village of Waltham, but as the village grew into a town in the 17th and 18th centuries, it began to suffer damage from passing traffic. In 1721, at the instigation of William Stukeley and at the expense of the Society of Antiquaries, two oak bollards were erected \\"to secure Waltham Cross from injury by carriages\\".Powrie 1990, pp. 149‚Äì50. The bollards were subsequently removed by the turnpike commissioners, and in 1757 Stukeley arranged for a protective brick plinth to be erected instead, at the expense of Lord Monson.Alexander and Binski 1987, p. 363.Galloway 1914, p. 75. The cross is still standing, but has been restored on several occasions, in 1832‚Äì34, 1885‚Äì92, 1950‚Äì53, and 1989‚Äì90.Powrie 1990, pp. 151‚Äì52. The Society of Antiquaries published an engraving of the cross by George Vertue from a drawing by Stukeley in its Vetusta Monumenta series in 1721; and another, engraved by James Basire from a drawing by Jacob Schnebbelie, in the same series in 1791. The original statues of Eleanor, which were extremely weathered, were replaced by replicas at the 1950s restoration. The originals were kept for some years at Cheshunt Public Library; but they were removed, possibly in the 1980s, and are now held by the Victoria & Albert Museum. A photograph formerly on the Lowewood Museum website shows one of the original statues in front of a staircase at the library. =Westcheap (now Cheapside)= Edward VI passing the Cheapside cross in 1547: a 19th-century wood engraving based on a lost mural at Cowdray House, Sussex () Eleanor's bier reached the City of London on 14 December 1290, and a site for the cross was selected in Westcheap (now Cheapside). Her heart was buried in the Blackfriars priory on 19 December. The Cheapside cross was built from 1291 onwards by Michael of Canterbury at a total recorded cost of ¬£226 13s. 4d.Powrie 1990, p. 165. Under a licence granted by Henry VI in 1441, the cross was extensively restored or rebuilt in 1484‚Äì86.Powrie 1990, p. 166. It was subsequently regilded several times in the 16th century on the occasion of coronations and royal visits to the City.Powrie 1990, pp. 165‚Äì66. John Stow included a detailed account of the cross and its history in his Survay of London of 1598, updating it in 1603. Although a number of images of the cross and its eventual destruction are known, these all postdate its various refurbishments, and so provide no certain guide to its original appearance. However, the chronicler Walter of Guisborough refers to this and Charing Cross as being fashioned of \\"marble\\"; and it is likely that it was similar to the Hardingstone and Waltham Crosses, but even more ornate and boasting some Purbeck marble facings.Cockerill 2014, p. 356. The cross came to be regarded as something of a public hazard, both as a traffic obstruction and because of concerns about fragments of stone falling off; while in the post-Reformation period some of its Catholic imagery aroused resentment, and elements were defaced in 1581, 1599 and 1600‚Äì01.Galloway 1914, pp. 76‚Äì77. Matters came to a head during the years leading up to the Civil War. To puritanical reformers, it was identified with Dagon, the ancient god of the Philistines, and was seen as the embodiment of royal and Catholic tradition. At least one riot was fought in its shadow, as opponents of the cross descended upon it to pull it down, and supporters rallied to stop them. After Charles I had fled London to raise an army, the destruction of the cross was almost the first order of business for the Parliamentary Committee for the Demolition of Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry, led by Sir Robert Harley, and it was demolished on 2 May 1643.Cockerill 2014, p. 368.Galloway 1914, p. 77. The downfall of the Cheapside Cross is an important episode of iconoclasm in English history. Two Purbeck marble fragments of the original cross, displaying shields bearing the royal arms of England and of Castile and Le√≥n, were recovered in 1838 during reconstruction of the sewer in Cheapside. They are now held by the Museum of London.Alexander and Binski 1987, p. 364. = Charing Cross = The cross at Charing Cross, Westminster () Eleanor's bier spent the final night of its journey, 16 December 1290, in the Royal Mews at Charing, Westminster, a few hundred yards north of Westminster Abbey. The area subsequently became known as Charing Cross. The cross here was the most expensive of the twelve, built of Purbeck marble from 1291 onwards by Richard of Crundale, the senior royal mason, with the sculptures supplied by Alexander of Abingdon, and some items by Ralph de Chichester. Richard died in the autumn of 1293, and the work was completed by Roger of Crundale, probably his brother. The total recorded cost was over ¬£700.Powrie 1990, pp. 177‚Äì78.Hunter 1842, pp. 184‚Äì85.Galloway 1914, pp. 77‚Äì78. The cross stood outside the Royal Mews, at the top of what is now Whitehall, and on the south side of what is now Trafalgar Square. John Norden in about 1590 described it as the \\"most stately\\" of the series, but by this date so \\"defaced by antiquity\\" as to have become \\"an old weather-beaten monument\\".Galloway 1914, p. 78. It was also noted by William Camden in 1607. It was ordered to be taken down by Parliament in 1643, and was eventually demolished in 1647.Powrie 1990, pp. 177‚Äì79.Galloway 1914, p. 79. Following the demolition, a contemporary ballad ran: > Undone! undone! the lawyers cry, They ramble up and down; We know not the > way to Westminster Now Charing-Cross is down. After the Restoration of Charles II, an equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur was erected on the site of the cross in 1675, and this still stands. The location is still known as Charing Cross, and since the early 19th century this point has been regarded as the official centre of London, in legislation and when measuring distances from London. A new Eleanor cross was erected in 1865 outside Charing Cross railway station, several hundred yards from the original site: see Replicas and imitations below. A mural by David Gentleman on the platform walls of Charing Cross underground station, commissioned by London Transport in 1978, depicts, in the form of wood engravings, the story of the building of the medieval cross by stonemasons and sculptors.Gentleman 1979. Folk etymology holds that the name Charing derives from French ' (dear queen); but the name \\"Charing\\" for the area in fact pre- dates Eleanor's death and probably comes from the Anglo-Saxon word ', meaning a bend, as it stands on the outside of a sharp bend in the River Thames (compare Charing in Kent). Replicas and imitations During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries several replica Eleanor crosses, or monuments more loosely inspired by them, were erected. *The cross at Ilam, Staffordshire, was built in 1840 by Jesse Watts-Russell of Ilam Hall to commemorate his wife, Mary.Ilam photograph *The Martyrs' Memorial in Oxford, commemorating the 16th-century Oxford Martyrs, was erected in 1841‚Äì43 to the designs of George Gilbert Scott. *The Glastonbury Market Cross, Somerset, was erected in 1846 to the designs of Benjamin Ferrey. *Banbury Cross, Oxfordshire, was erected in 1859 to commemorate the marriage of Victoria, Princess Royal to Prince Frederick of Prussia: it was designed by John Gibbs. *The Queen Eleanor Memorial Cross at Charing Cross in London was erected in 1865 outside Charing Cross railway station on the Strand, a few hundred yards to the east of the site of the medieval cross. It does not pretend to be a faithful copy of the original, being larger and more ornate. It stands high and was commissioned by the South Eastern Railway Company for their newly opened Charing Cross Hotel. The cross was designed by the hotel architect, E. M. Barry, who is also known for his work on Covent Garden. It was constructed by Thomas Earp of Lambeth from Portland stone, Mansfield stone (a fine sandstone) and Aberdeen granite.\\"Charing Cross\\". Network Rail. Retrieved 22 January 2011. It was restored to a substantial extent in 2009‚Äì10. *The Ellesmere Memorial at Walkden, Lancashire, was erected in 1868 to the designs of T. G. Jackson to commemorate Harriet (d. 1866), wife of the 1st Earl of Ellesmere. It originally stood at a road junction, but was moved into the churchyard in 1968. *The Albert Memorial, in Kensington Gardens, London, commissioned by Queen Victoria in memory of her husband Prince Albert, and opened in 1872, was a far larger structure than any of the Eleanor crosses, but took inspiration from them. Its architect, Sir Gilbert Scott, claimed to have \\"adopt[ed] in my design the style at once most congenial with my own feelings, and that of the most touching monuments ever erected in this country to a Royal Consort ‚Äì the exquisite 'Eleanor Crosses'\\". * The Loudoun Monument, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, was designed by Sir Gilbert Scott and erected in 1879 to commemorate Edith Rawdon-Hastings, 10th Countess of Loudoun (d. 1874), wife of Charles Frederick Abney-Hastings. *The Sledmere Cross was erected in Sledmere, East Riding of Yorkshire, in 1896‚Äì8, commissioned by Sir Tatton Sykes and designed by Temple Lushington Moore. Sir Tatton's son, Sir Mark Sykes, later added engraved brasses to turn it into a war memorial. *The Queen Victoria Monument, Birkenhead, Wirral, Merseyside, designed by Edmund Kirby, was unveiled in 1905. *A modern monument inspired by the lost medieval cross was erected in Stamford in 2009. It was designed by Wolfgang Buttress and sponsored by the Smith of Derby Group; and it stands in Sheepmarket, rather than at the original location. The carved detail is based on the single surviving fragment of the medieval cross. =Gallery= Ilam.jpgIlam Cross, 1840 Martyrs' Memorial, Oxford, UK - 20130709.JPGMartyrs' Memorial, Oxford, 1841 Glastonbury.

The main plantation house, built in 1730, was the home of President John Tyler (1790‚Äì1862) for the last twenty years of his life. It is located on State Route 5, a scenic byway which runs between the independent cities of Richmond and Williamsburg. The house is located approximately from the river. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.  History  Sherwood Forest is the only private residence in the United States to have been owned by two unrelated U.S. Presidents. William Henry Harrison inherited the plantation, then named Walnut Grove, in 1790 and held it for three years. He sold the property in 1793 having never lived in the house. Harrison's Vice President and successor John Tyler purchased the plantation, which by then had been reduced to , in 1842 and lived there after leaving the White House. John Tyler renamed the plantation Sherwood Forest in 1842. He said it signified that he had been \\"outlawed\\" by the Whig party. He was attracted to the plantation because it was near his birthplace at Greenway Plantation. He retired there when he left the White House in 1845 and spent the rest of his life there with his second wife Julia Gardiner Tyler and some of his children - he had eight with his first wife, and seven with his second wife. Pearl, the youngest, was born in 1860, when Tyler was 70 years old; she died in 1947. As regional hostilities in the United States escalated to become the American Civil War in 1861, Tyler backed Virginia's secession, although he died in January 1862. Later that spring, the house was occupied by Union soldiers during McClellan's Peninsula Campaign of 1862 and again during Grant's Overland Campaign in 1864. During the latter, the Battle of Wilson's Wharf was fought nearby. When an Ohio regiment vacated the house in 1864, they attempted to raze it with fire as a punishment for Tyler's support of the Confederacy. The fire was quickly extinguished by a loyal slave and did little damage to the house. Owners of the house who started restoring it in the mid 1970s started removing some home-made storm windows and then discovered from old records that Tyler had built them himself, so they kept them. One of the house's claims to fame is its length; 301 feet (91 m). It is also noted for its long, skinny ballroom, a \\"hyphen\\" Tyler had added to the house to accommodate the style of dancing popular then - what is today called \\"line dancing\\" but was then the \\"Virginia reel.\\" The house has been in the Tyler family since it was purchased in 1842. The house is currently owned by Harrison Ruffin Tyler, President Tyler's grandson, and the son of Lyon Gardiner Tyler; he and his wife, Frances Payne Bouknight Tyler, restored the home and grounds based on information gathered from over 47,000 letters describing the decor, furnishings, and landscape. It is open to the public for tours by appointment. The grounds are open daily for self-guided tours from 9am-5pm excepting Thanksgiving and Christmas days. Cemetery A pet cemetery is located on the property, where Tyler family pets were and still are buried, most notably, John Tyler's horse, The General.

It lies on the North Sea coast, around ENE of Dundee and SSW of Aberdeen. While there is evidence for settlement of the area now occupied by the town that dates back to the Iron Age, Arbroath's history as a town begins in the High Middle Ages with the founding of Arbroath Abbey in 1178. Arbroath grew considerably during the Industrial Revolution owing to the expansion of firstly the flax and secondly the jute industries and the engineering sector. A new harbour was built in 1839 and by the 20th century, Arbroath had become one of the larger fishing ports in Scotland. The town is notable as the home of the Declaration of Arbroath, as well as the Arbroath smokie. The town's football team, Arbroath Football Club, hold the world record for the highest number of goals scored in a professional football match. They won 36‚Äì0 against Aberdeen Bon Accord in the Scottish Cup in 1885. History =Toponymy= The earliest recorded name for the town was 'Aberbrothock', a reference to the Brothock Burn which runs through the town, the prefix 'Aber' coming either from the Gaelic 'Obair', or the earlier Brythonic term 'Aber' for 'confluence' or 'river mouth'. The name 'Aberbrothock' can be found in numerous spelling variations. In the earliest manuscripts available, it is seen as 'Abirbrothoke' (in the letter to Edward I confirming the Treaty of Salisbury, which agreed that the Queen regnant, Margaret, Maid of Norway would marry Edward IVarious authors (1290) Letters: confirmation of the treaty of Salisbury , www.rps.ac.uk; Retrieved 12 December 2008) and 'Aberbrothok' (in the subsequent letter giving consent for the marriageVarious authors (1290) Letter: from the guardians, bishops, earls, abbots and barons of Scotland to Edward I of England, giving consent for the marriage of Queen Margaret to Edward, the king's son , www.rps.ac.uk; Retrieved 12 December 2008).

Bronze Age archaeology is to be found in abundance in the surrounding area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a mile to the North of the town.

The area appears to have been of some importance in the early Christian period, as evidenced by the Pictish stone carvings found during the restoration of St Vigeans Church, and now housed in the small museum there. The stones had been used in the building of the old church and many had been badly damaged. One of the stones, the 9th century Drosten Stone, has the distinction of being one of the few Pictish artefacts to have an inscription in Latin text: 'DROSTEN: IREUORET [E]TTFOR CUS', which has been interpreted in various ways, but it is thought to refer to the Pictish King Uurad, who reigned between 839 and 842 AD.Clancy, T.O.

It received consecration in 1197 with a dedication to Saint Thomas Becket. It was the King's only personal foundation, and he was buried within its precincts in 1214. The Abbey was not finally completed until 1233. Also in the 13th century, King John exempted Arbroath from ‚Äútoll and custom‚Äù in every part of England excepting London. Arbroath was the location of the Battle of Arbroath in 1446. A series of disagreements between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath, Alexander Lindsay, third Earl of Crawford and Bishop James Kennedy of St Andrews resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop's lands and burning his properties. Lindsay was excommunicated for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.Jervise, A. (1853) The history and traditions of the land of the Lindsays in Angus and Mearnes, with notices of Alyth and Meigle, Sutherland & Knox, Edinburgh The abbey relatively quickly fell into disuse and eventual disrepair after its dissolution at the Reformation, the lead from the roof rumoured to have been used in the 16th century civil wars and the stonework plundered for housebuilding throughout the town. The ruins were a popular site for travellers during the 17th and 18th centuries, and finally in 1815 the remains were taken into the care of the State for preservation. The remains are now administered by Historic Scotland. On 6 April 1320 the Scottish Parliament met at Arbroath Abbey and addressed to the Pope the Declaration of Arbroath, drafted by the Abbot of the time, Bernard. This document detailed the services which their \\"lord and sovereign\\" Robert the Bruce had rendered to Scotland, and affirmed in eloquent terms the independence of the Scots. Arbroath was created a royal burgh in 1599 by James VI. In the 17th century, at the church of St Vigeans, near Arbroath, communion was not held for several years because the villagers believed there was a curse on the church. The curse said that if communion were held then the church would fall into a large subterranean lake. =Modern history= During the Jacobite rising known as the Forty-Five, Arbroath was a Jacobite town. A large portion of its able bodied men joined the Jacobite army.C. Duffy, The 45 (2003), pp 83, 86. It was one of the principal ports where men and supplies could be landed from France. It and other Jacobite ports along the north-east coast collectively formed ‚Äòan asset of almost incalculable value‚Äô to the Jacobite cause.C. Duffy, The 45, p. 366. During the Industrial Revolution, Arbroath's economy expanded and the population of the town expanded, with new housing having to be constructed to house the influx of workers. Arbroath became moderately well known for jute and sailcloth production, with 34 mills employing 1,400 looms and producing over one million yards of osnaburg cloth and 450,000 yards of sailcloth in 1875. Arbroath is believed to be the source of the sails used on the Cutty Sark. In 1867, the mills in Arbroath employed 4,620 people. Arbroath was also prominent in the manufacture of shoes and lawnmowers; local firm Alexander Shanks founded in 1840 and based at Dens Iron Works, supplied mowers to the Old Course at St Andrews and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. Shanks was taken over in the 1960s by another major local firm, Giddings & Lewis-Fraser Ltd. This company had evolved from the business of Douglas Fraser, established in 1832 and mainly concerned with manufacturing flax and canvas. In later 19th century the firm, by now known as Douglas Fraser & Sons moved to focus its activities onto machine manufacture, following the success of a braiding machine designed by Norman Fraser. The firm had significant interests in South America and India. In 1959 the family run firms was taken over by the American company Giddings & Lewis and renamed Giddings & Lewis-Fraser. Its headquarters was Wellgate Works in Arbroath. Arbroath today is mostly known for its connection with the Scottish fishing industry. After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish. There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but fish for processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland. The 19th century saw major development in healthcare in Arbroath. In 1836 a dispensary was set up by public subscription to provide medical care for the poor. In 1842 a typhus epidemic in the town led to the creation of a small fever ward to keep patients in isolation. The following year subscriptions began to be taken to develop this into Arbroath Infirmary, which opened in 1845, and moved to new premises in 1916. Governance Royal Burgh of Arbroath's Coat of Arms Arbroath was made a royal burgh in 1178 by King William the Lion at the same time as the Abbey was established. The burgh of regality permitted the monks to hold a weekly market, dispense basic justice and to establish a harbour. In 1559, the town's burgh of regality was reconfirmed in 1599 by King James VI of Scotland. A provost and a town council were appointed and it was at this point Aberbrothock became a fully fledged royal burgh. In 1922, Lord Inchcape became burgess of the town. To commemorate the occasion he was presented with his ticket to the office in a silver casket engraved with the burgh coat-of-arms and views of the locality. Arbroath was controlled by Arbroath Town Council from the time of King James VI through to 1975, when Arbroath (and the county of Angus) were amalgamated with the counties of Perthshire and Dundee City into Tayside, under the control of Tayside Regional Council. Angus, together with Dundee City and Perth & Kinross were re-established following reorganisation under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. =Local government= Arbroath is represented within Angus Council by two wards: Arbroath West & Letham; and Arbroath East & Lunan. Four councillors are elected. The members elected from each ward. At the 2012 local elections, the councillors elected from Arbroath West & Letham were Alex King (Scottish National Party), David Lumgair (Scottish Conservative and Unionist), David Fairweather (Independent) and Ewan Smith (Scottish National Party). Those elected from the Arbroath East & Lunan ward were Donald Morrison (Scottish National Party), Bob Spink (Independent), Sheena Welsh (Scottish National Party) and Martyn Geddes (Scottish Conservative and Unionist). =Parliamentary representation= For elections to the House of Commons, Arbroath forms part of the Angus constituency and since 2001 has been represented by Michael Weir (SNP) who held the seat again, with an increased majority of 3800 votes at the 2010 General Election. Arbroath is also part of the Angus South constituency of the Scottish Parliament (having been part of the Angus constituency until its abolition in 2011), which has significantly different boundaries to the Westminster constituency. The constituency returns a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) to Holyrood directly, and is part of the North East Scotland electoral region with regards to additional Members of the Scottish Parliament. The constituency's MSP is currently Graeme Dey of the Scottish National Party. Geography At , Arbroath is located on the North Sea coast in eastern Scotland northeast of Dundee, within the Angus region. Geologically, Arbroath sits predominantly on Old Red Sandstone. Lower-lying parts of the town were below sea level during and immediately after the last ice age. Arbroath is located northeast of Glasgow, southwest of Aberdeen and from Edinburgh. The neighbouring villages of St Vigeans, Carmyllie, Friockheim, Colliston and Inverkeilor are considered part of Arbroath for the purposes of council representation, and together with Carnoustie, share the 01241 telephone area code with Arbroath. Climate Arbroath has a typical British marine climate, that is heavily influenced by its position by the sea. There are narrow differences in temperature between seasons. January has an average high of and July has . The climate is somewhat dry and sunny compared to Scottish standards with of precipitation and 1538.4 hours of sunshine. All data is sourced from the 1981-2010 averages from the Met Office weather station in Arbroath. Demography Residents of Arbroath are called Arbroathians but often refer to themselves as Red Lichties after the red lamp that shone from the harbour light and foghorn tower at the entrance to the harbour as an aid to shipping entering the aforementioned harbour. At the 2001 census, the population of Arbroath was 22,785. Approximately 88.9% were born in Scotland, while 97.7% were born in the United Kingdom as a whole. Most Arbroath residents are between 16 and 65, with 19.8% under 16, 59.5% between 16 and 65 with those over 65 making up 20.7% of the population. There are 47.1% males to 52.9% females. Arbroath has a moderate rate of unemploymentaround 2.7% of the population are claiming unemployment-related social welfare benefits. Economy Arbroath has no sizeable employers outside of the public sector, with most workers commuting to Dundee. Arbroath itself has an economically active population of 9,192 people, with the public sector (21.8%) the largest employer of Arbroath residents closely followed by the manufacturing (16%) and retail sector (15.4%). The fishing industry accounts for 0.4% (fewer than 50 people) although the processing sector is considered separately under manufacturing and the figure of 50 people relates directly to the catching and support sectors. =History= Arbroath's prospects originally revolved around the harbour. The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This gave way to a more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of ¬£58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade. Bark, flax, hemp, hides, oak and fir timber, and guano for manure, groceries from London, and numerous articles of Baltic produce were imported via Arbroath, with manufactured goods (mainly sailcloth) exported via Arbroath. Arbroath Harbour Driven by the needs of the fishing and commercial sailing industry, in 1795 Arbroath-based sailmaker Francis Webster Ltd had perfected the art of adding linseed oil to flax sails, creating an oiled flax. This developed in the late-19th century into waxed cotton, which drove Arbroath as a manufacturing centre, until the early 1970s manufacturing began to decline. A major employer, Keith & Blackman, closed in 1985 and Giddings and Lewis-Fraser wound down its operations at about the same time, with the entire plant eventually demolished to make way for a Safeway (now Morrisons) supermarket. Alps Electric Co. was a large employer in Arbroath from 1990 to 2001, employing 180 staff. Following the closure of the plant, all 180 staff were made redundant =Armed forces= Arbroath is home to 45 Commando of the Royal Marines, who have been based at RM Condor since 1971. The barracks were originally built in 1940 and commissioned as RNAS Arbroath/HMS Condor, a Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) until 1971. The Royal Marines moved to Arbroath in 1971 and remain a major contributor to the local economy; in addition to the Marines stationed at Arbroath, around 600 residents are employed by the Ministry of Defence. In 2004, there was speculation that RM Condor would be transferred to the Army as a replacement for Fort George and that the barracks would become a permanent base for a battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland. These plans never went beyond the planning stage and in 2005 it was confirmed the Royal Marines would remain based at the site. =Housing= House prices in Arbroath are very close to the national average and in April‚ÄìJune 2006 were ¬£99 below the national average, local prices averaging ¬£113,646 compared to the national average of ¬£113,745. The average house price across Angus has risen by 14.9% in the past year (to November 2006) and now stands at ¬£124,451. Angus Council suggests the recent upgrading of the A92 between Arbroath and Dundee to dual carriageway has lured Dundonians to Arbroath and this may be driving up house prices. =Tourism= Tourism plays some part in the Arbroath economy, with Arbroath Abbey attracting over 14,000 visitors each year. Attractions during the summer months include the Seafront Spectacular, which includes an airshow, and the Seafest which is themed around Arbroath's maritime heritage. There is also a re-enactment of the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath (the declaration of Scottish independence) and in past years there has been a mock Viking invasion culminating in the burning of a longship. Arbroath is home to Kerr's Miniature Railway, the oldest miniature railway in Scotland, which has been operating since 1935 and which at its height, in 1955, saw 60,000 visitors. Today, the railway is operated as a hobby by a group of volunteers and remains popular with locals, tourists and railway enthusiasts. The town also features a multimillion-pound Harbour Visitor Centre, located close to the Town Quay. The centre features a multimedia experience for its visitors, and is maintained by the Scottish tourist company VisitScotland and explains the town's fishing history, as well as hosting a restaurant and gift shop. Transport Arbroath railway station The A92 road connects Arbroath to Dundee and Fife to the south west, and Stonehaven in the north east. The A92 joins the A90 north of Stonehaven and leads to Aberdeen further north.

Culture Arbroath's Webster Theatre has featured among others Harry Lauder, Jimmy Tarbuck, Charlie Landsborough, the Illegal Eagles, the Drifters and the Chuckle Brothers and was the first venue the Alexander Brothers, a Scottish easy listening act, performed in as a professional duo. The Webster Theatre recently went through a multi-million pounds refurbishment and opened in February 2008. There are several amateur theatre and musical companies based in and around Arbroath, the best known being the Angus Minstrels group, the last group in Britain to regularly perform blackface. In 2005, following pressure from Angus Council, who feared legal action, the show began performing with normal stage makeup, and the group changed its name from \\"The Angus Black and White Minstrels\\" to simply \\"The Angus Minstrels\\". The decision to stop performing the show in blackface received widespread press coverage in the UK. Beginning in 1947, a pageant commemorating the signing of the Declaration has been held within the roofless remains of the abbey (last full- scale event 2005). This was run by the local Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society, now Arbroath Abbey Timethemes, a registered charity, and re-enacts the story and history of the signing. The group also spearhead Scotland's Tartan Day celebrations on 6 April in association with Angus Council as well as educational visits to local schools. Arbroath Male Voice Choir was established in 1934 and is now one of only a few male voice choirs left in Scotland. At 2012 the choir has over 45 members drawn not just from Arbroath but also Angus and Dundee. The choir's musical director is Sheena Guthrie. They sing a mix of songs from classical, through Scottish, showtunes to pop. The ensemble perform two main concerts each year (one at Christmas and another in spring) and several smaller events for good causes. The choir are notable for attracting well known, often international singers to their annual spring concert as guests. In recent years these have included, Jamie McDougall, Karen Cargill, Gordon Cree, Cheryl Forbes and Colette Ruddy. March 2012 saw international diva Lesley Garrett as the choir's special guest. The author Sir Walter Scott is famous for the Waverley series of novels, including Rob Roy and Ivanhoe. Scott is known to have visited Arbroath three times, and his personal favourite in the series, The Antiquary (1816) features affectionately fictionalised versions of both Arbroath (\\"Fairport\\") and Auchmithie (\\"Musselcrag\\"). Arbroath has one museum, the former Bell Rock Lighthouse Signal Tower. In 1807 Arbroath became the base of operations for the building of the Bell Rock Lighthouse. The shore station for the lighthouse ‚Äì the Bell Rock Signal Tower ‚Äì was completed in 1813 and acted as a lifeline for the keepers offshore. Signal Tower Museum was opened in 1974 as a visitor centre detailing the history of the lighthouse and the town of Arbroath.Arbroath Signal Tower Museum Arbroath Art Gallery occupies two galleries above Arbroath Library.

Smokies are made from haddock using traditional methods dating back to the late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen. Sport Arbroath has one professional football team, Arbroath, who play in Scottish Championship, the second tier of the Scottish Professional Football League. Arbroath play their home matches at Gayfield Park, which holds the record for being the closest stadium to the sea in European football (around 5¬Ω yards from the high tide line). Arbroath holds the world record for the largest winning margin in a senior football match, 36‚Äì0, in their Scottish Cup match against Bon Accord (a scratch team from Aberdeen) on 12 September 1885. Further goals were disallowed either for offside, or because it was not clear whether the ball had gone into the goal. For this reason the AFC supporters' club is called the 36‚Äì0 club in memory of this event. Arbroath are nicknamed the Red Lichties, owing to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the harbour (Lichtie being a Scots word for light). Arbroath and the surrounding areas are home to several amateur senior and junior teams competing in the various amateur leagues, such as Arbroath Victoria and Arbroath SC. Arbroath has an outdoor tennis court called the Arbroath Lawn Tennis Club. It has been upgraded between 2014-2015 using money from fundraising and a grant provided by Sportscotland.

He became a Founding Father of the United States and also was elected as Virginia's governor (1781‚Äì1784). Harrison worked an aggregate of three decades in the Virginia House of Burgesses, representing Surry County and Charles City County. He was among the early patriots to formally protest tyrannical measures which King George and the British Parliament imposed upon the American colonies leading to the American Revolution. This was in stark contrast to Harrison's personal acceptance and practice of slaveholding, though he joined a 1772 petition to the King, requesting that he abolish the slave trade. As a Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress, and chairman of its Committee of the Whole, Harrison attended and presided over the final debate of the Declaration of Independence. He was one of its signers in 1776. The Declaration included a foundational philosophy of the United States: \\"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\\" Harrison was elected as Virginia's fifth governor; his administration was marked by its futile struggle with a state treasury decimated by the revolutionary war. He later returned to the Virginia House for two final terms. In disagreement with his normal ally George Washington, Harrison in 1788 cast one of his last votes in opposition to the nation's Constitution, for its lack of a bill of rights. Benjamin V was a member of the Harrison family of Virginia. Two of his descendants became United States Presidents‚Äîson William Henry Harrison and great-grandson Benjamin Harrison. Family =Parents and siblings= Harrison was born April 5, 1726, in Charles City County, Virginia; he was the oldest of ten children of Benjamin Harrison IV and Anne Carter; Anne was a daughter of Robert Carter I. The first Benjamin Harrison arrived in the colonies around 1630, and by 1633 began a family tradition of public service, when he was recorded as Clerk of the Virginia Governor's Council. Benjamin II and Benjamin III followed this example, serving as delegates in the Virginia House of Burgesses. Benjamin IV and wife Anne built the family's manor house at Berkeley Plantation; he served as a Justice of the Peace and represented Charles City County in the Virginia House of Burgesses. (Biographer Clifford Dowdey notes that the family did not employ the roman numeral suffixes, which have been assigned by historians.) Benjamin V in his youth was \\"tall and powerfully built,\\" with \\"features that were clearly defined, and a well-shaped mouth above a strong pointed chin.\\" He graduated from the College of William and Mary. His brother Carter Henry became a leader in Cumberland County. Brother Nathaniel was elected to the House of Burgesses, then to the Virginia Senate. Brother Henry fought in the French and Indian War and brother Charles became a brigadier general in the Continental Army. =Inheritance and slaveholding= Harrison's father, at age 51, and with a child in hand, was struck by lightning as he shut an upstairs window during a storm on July 12, 1745; he and daughter Hannah were killed. Benjamin V inherited the bulk of his father's estate, including Berkeley and a number of surrounding plantations, as well as thousands of acres extending to Surry County and the falls of the James River. Also among his holdings was a fishery on the river and a grist mill in Henrico County. He also assumed ownership and responsibility for the manor house's equipment, stock, and numerous slaves. His siblings inherited another six plantations, possessions, and slaves, as the father chose to depart from the tradition of leaving the entire estate to the eldest son. Among Harrison and his ancestors, the family enslaved as many as 80 to 100 people. Harrison's father was adamant about not breaking up slave families in the distribution of his estate. As with all planters, the Harrisons provided for the sustenance of slaves on their plantations. Nevertheless, the slaves‚Äô status was typically involuntary, and according to Dowdey, \\"among the worst aspects of their slaveholding is the assumption that the men in the Harrison family, most likely the younger, unmarried ones, and the overseers, made night trips to the slaves' quarters for carnal purposes.\\" Benjamin Harrison V owned mullatoes, though no record has been revealed as to their parentage. Dowdey portrays the Harrisons' further incongruity, saying the slaves in some ways \\"were respected as families, and there developed a sense of duty about indoctrinating them in Christianity, though other slaveholders had reservations about baptizing children who were considered property.\\" =Marriage and children= Harrison in 1748 married Elizabeth Bassett of New Kent County; she was the daughter of Col. William Bassett and Elizabeth Churchill. Harrison and wife had eight children during their 40-year marriage. Among them was eldest daughter Lucy Bassett (1749‚Äì1809) who married Peyton Randolph. Another daughter, Anne Bassett (1753‚Äì1821), married David Coupland. The eldest son was Benjamin Harrison VI (1755‚Äì1799), a briefly successful merchant who served in the Virginia House of Delegates, but who died a self- indulgent, troubled, young widower. Another was Carter Bassett Harrison (c.1756‚Äì1808) who served in the Virginia House of Delegates and the U. S. House of Representatives. The youngest child was General William Henry Harrison (1773‚Äì1841), who became a congressional delegate for the Northwest Territory, and also was Governor of the Indiana Territory. In the 1840 United States presidential election, William Henry defeated incumbent Martin Van Buren, but fell ill and died just one month into his presidency. Vice President John Tyler (1790‚Äì1862), a fellow Virginian and Berkeley neighbor, succeeded him. William Henry's grandson, Benjamin Harrison (1833‚Äì1901), was a brigadier general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Benjamin also served in the U.S. Senate (1881‚Äì1887) and was elected president in 1888 after defeating incumbent Grover Cleveland (1837‚Äì1908). Virginia delegate Benjamin Harrison V in 1749 first took the path of his father in being elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, initially for Surry County; however, he was not then of legal age to assume his burgesses seat, which was delayed until 1752. His county representations in the Burgesses were as follows: * 1752‚Äì1761 ‚Äì Surry County * 1766‚Äì1781 ‚Äì Charles City County * 1785‚Äì1786 ‚Äì Surry County * 1787‚Äì1790 ‚Äì Charles City County In his first year in the House of Burgesses in 1752, Harrison was appointed to the Committee of Propositions and Grievances, and thereby participated in a confrontation with King George and his Parliament and their appointed Governor of Virginia, Robert Dinwiddie. There developed a dispute with the governor over his levy of a pistole (a Spanish gold coin) upon all land patents, which presaged the core issue of the American Revolution two decades later‚Äîtaxation without representation. Harrison assisted in drafting a complaint to the governor and the Crown, which read that the payment of any such levy would be, \\"deemed a betrayal of the rights and privileges of the people.\\" When the British Privy Council received the complaint, it replied \\"that the lower house is a subordinate lawmaking body, and where the King's decisions are concerned, it counts for nothing.\\" On this occasion a compromise was reached, allowing the governor's levy on parcels of less than 100 acres lying east of the mountains. Williamsburg Courthouse‚ÄîHarrison helped raise the funds to purchase the courthouse for the city. Harrison once again joined the fray with Britain after its adoption of the Townsend Acts, which formally asserted the Parliament's right to tax the colonies. He was appointed in 1768 to a special committee to draft a response for the colony. A resolution resulted that asserted the right of British subjects to be taxed only by their elected representatives. The American colonies achieved their objective with a repeal of the Townsend Acts, through the action of Lord North, who nevertheless continued the tax on tea. Harrison was a signer in 1770 of an association of Virginia lawmakers and merchants boycotting British imports until the British Parliament repealed its tea tax. He also joined in sponsoring a bill which declared that Parliament's laws were illegal if passed without the consent of the colonists. Harrison at this time also served as a justice in Charles City County. When the city of Williamsburg lacked the funds for construction of a courthouse, he and fellow delegate James Littlepage organized a group of \\"Gentlemen Subscribers\\" who purchased an unused building and presented it to the city in 1771. Early in 1772, Harrison and Thomas Jefferson were among a group of six Virginia house delegates assigned to prepare and deliver an address to the King which called for an end to the importation of slaves from Africa. Biographer Howard Smith indicates that the request was delivered and was unambiguous in its object to close the slave trade; the King rejected it. Congressional delegate in Philadelphia In 1773, colonists protested the British tax on tea by destroying a shipment during the Boston Tea Party. While all of the colonies were inspired by the news, some patriots, including Harrison, had misgivings, and believed the Bostonians had a duty to reimburse the East India Company for its losses at their hands. The British Parliament responded to the protest by enacting more punitive measures, which colonists called the Intolerable Acts. Despite his qualms, Harrison was among 89 members of the Virginia Burgesses who signed a new association on May 24, 1774 condemning Parliament's action. The group also invited other colonies to convene a Continental Congress, and called for a convention to select its Virginia delegates. At the First Virginia Convention, Harrison was selected on August 5, 1774 as one of seven delegates to represent Virginia at the Congress, to be located in Philadelphia. Harrison set out that month, leaving his home state for the first time. He was armed with a positive reputation built in the House of Burgesses, which Edmund Randolph articulated to the Congress: \\"A favorite of the day was Benjamin Harrison. With strong sense and a temper not disposed to compromise with ministerial power, he scruples not to utter any untruth. During a long service in the House of Burgesses, his frankness, though sometimes tinctured with bitterness, has been the source of considerable attachment.\\" Carpenters' Hall, location of the First Continental Congress Harrison arrived in Philadelphia on September 2, 1774 for the First Continental Congress. According to biographer Smith, he gravitated to the older and more conservative delegates in Philadelphia, and was more distant with the New Englanders and the more radical, particularly John and Samuel Adams. The genuine and mutual enmity between the Adams cousins and Harrison also stemmed from their puritan upbringing in aversion to human pleasures and Harrison's appreciation for bold storytelling, fine food, and wine. John Adams described Harrison in his diary as \\"another Sir John Falstaff,\\" as \\"obscene,\\" \\"profane,\\" and \\"impious.\\" However, he also recalled Harrison's comment that he was so eager to participate in the congress that \\"he would have come on foot.\\" Politically, Harrison aligned with John Hancock, and Adams with Richard Henry Lee, whom Harrison had adamantly opposed in the House of Burgesses. Harrison in October 1774 signed an association with the other delegates dictating a boycott of both exports and imports with Britain, effective immediately. The First Congress concluded that month with a Petition to the King, signed by all delegates, requesting the King's attention to the colonies' grievances, and restoration of harmony with the crown. Upon his return home, Harrison received a letter from Thomas Jefferson advising of the latter's order for 14 sash windows in London just prior to the passage of the boycott, and apologizing for his inability to cancel the order. In March of 1775, Harrison attended a convention at St. John's Parish in Richmond, Virginia, made famous by Patrick Henry's \\"Give me liberty, or give me death!\\" speech. A defense resolution was passed by a vote of 65‚Äì60 for the raising of a military force. It represented a substantial step for Virginia in its transition from a colony to a commonwealth. Biographer Smith indicates Harrison was probably in the minority, though he was named to a committee to carry the resolution into effect. He was also re-elected as a delegate to the new session of the Continental Congress. Second Continental Congress and Declaration of Independence Independence Hall hosted the Second Continental Congress. When the Second Continental Congress convened in May 1775, Harrison took up residence in north Philadelphia with two roommates‚Äîhis brother-in-law Peyton Randolph and George Washington. The two men left him to reside on his own when Randolph suddenly died, and Washington assumed command of the Continental Army. Harrison was kept busy with the issues of funding and supplying Washington's army, and corresponded with him at length. In the spring of 1775 an effort was made in the Congress to seek reconciliation with the King of Britain, through the Olive Branch Petition, authored by John Dickinson. A heated debate ensued with Dickinson‚Äôs remark that he disapproved of only one word in the petition, and that was the word \\"Congress.\\" Harrison angrily rose from his seat and replied, \\"There is but one word in the paper, Mr. President, of which I do approve, and that is the word 'Congress.'\\" The petition passed and was submitted to the Crown, but remained unread by the King as he formally declared the colonists to be traitors. In November of 1775, Harrison was appointed to a select committee to review the needs of the army. He went to Cambridge, Massachusetts with Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Lynch to assess the needs, as well as the morale, of the forces. After a 10-day inspection, the committee concluded that the pay for the troops should be improved and the ranks should be increased to over 20,000 men. Harrison then returned to Philadelphia to work closely with fellow delegates for the defense of his state as well as South Carolina, Georgia, and New York. Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull, Benjamin Harrison V is seated at the table far left Harrison was in attendance until the session's end in July 1776, serving frequently as chairman of the Committee of the Whole. As such, he presided over the final debates of the Lee Resolution offered by Virginia delegate Richard Henry Lee. This was the Congress' first expression of its objective of freedom from the Crown. Harrison oversaw as well the final debates and amendments of the Declaration of Independence. The Committee of Five presented Thomas Jefferson's draft of the Declaration on June 28, 1776, and the Congress resolved on July 1 that the Committee of the Whole should debate its content. The Committee amended it on July 2 and 3, then adopted it in final form on Thursday, July 4. Harrison duly reported this to the Congress, and gave a final reading of the Declaration. The Congress unanimously resolved to have the Declaration engrossed and signed by those then present. Harrison was known for an audacious sense of humor. Even detractor John Adams conceded in his diary that \\"Harrison's contributions and many pleasantries steadied rough sessions.\\" Pennsylvania Delegate Benjamin Rush in particular recalled the Congress' atmosphere during a signing of the Declaration on August 2, 1776. He described a scene of \\"pensive and awful silence,\\" and said that Harrison singularly interrupted \\"the silence and gloom of the morning,\\" as delegates filed forward to inscribe what they thought was their ensuing death warrant. Rush said that the rotund Harrison approached the diminutive Elbridge Gerry, who was about to sign the Declaration, and said, \\"I shall have a great advantage over you, Mr. Gerry, when we are all hung for what we are now doing. From the size and weight of my body I shall die in a few minutes and be with the Angels, but from the lightness of your body you will dance in the air an hour or two before you are dead.\\" Revolutionary War From December 1775 until March 1777, the Congress was on two occasions threatened by British forces, and forced to remove itself‚Äîfirst to Baltimore and later to York, Pennsylvania‚Äìcircumstances that Harrison distinctly disliked. This has been attributed to some unspecified ill-health he was experiencing at the time. In 1777 Harrison became a member of the newly- created Committee of Secret Correspondence for the Congress. The committee's primary objective was to establish secure communication with American agents in Britain concerning the interests of the colonies. Harrison was also named as Chairman of the Board of War, whose initial purpose was to review the movements of the army in the north, and the exchange of prisoners. Seal of the U. S. Board of War At that time Harrison found himself at odds with Washington over Marquis de Lafayette's commission, which Harrison insisted was honorary only and without pay. He also stirred controversy by endorsing the rights of Quakers not to bear arms in accordance with their religion. He unsuccessfully argued throughout the formation of the Articles of Confederation that Virginia should be given greater representation than other states, based on its population and land mass. His Congressional membership permanently ended in October 1777; biographer John Sanderson indicates that when Harrison retired from Congress, \\"his estates had been ravaged\\" and \\"his fortune had been impaired.\\" Harrison returned to Virginia where he quickly renewed his efforts in the Virginia legislature. In May of 1776, the House of Burgesses had ended and was replaced by the House of Delegates, according to Virginia's new constitution. He was elected Speaker in 1777, defeating Thomas Jefferson by a vote of 51‚Äì23; he returned to the speakership on several occasions. He concerned himself in the ensuing years with many issues, including Virginia's western land interests, the condition of Continental forces, and the defense of the commonwealth. In January 1781, a British force of 1,600 was positioned at the mouth of the James River, led by turncoat Benedict Arnold, and Harrison was called upon to return immediately to Philadelphia to request military support for his state. He knew that Berkeley was one of Arnold's primary targets, so he relocated his family before setting out. In Philadelphia, his pleas for Virginia were heard, and he obtained increased gunpowder, supplies, and troops, but only on a delayed basis. Meanwhile, Arnold advanced up the James, wreaking havoc on both sides of the river. The Harrison family avoided capture in Arnold's January raid on Berkeley, but Arnold, intent that no likeness of the family survive, removed and burned all the family portraits there. Most of Harrison's other possessions were destroyed, along with a large portion of the house. Other signers were similarly targeted, with more horrific consequences. Harrison took up the rehabilitation of his home, returned to his correspondence with Washington, and continued efforts to obtain armaments, troops, and clothing supplies for other southern states. Governor of Virginia Berkeley Plantation, Harrison family homestead in Charles City County, Virginia The new nation secured its Revolutionary War victory in October 1781 at Yorktown, Virginia‚Äìthis provided only brief respite for Harrison, who began to serve a month later as the fifth Governor of Virginia. He was also the fourth governor to assume the office in that year‚Äìthe multiple successions were occasioned by wartime events in Virginia. Money was the primary problem that he confronted, as the war had drained the coffers of the Virginia treasury, and the government was plagued by creditors, both domestic and foreign. Hence, there was no capacity for military action outside of the immediate area, so Harrison steadfastly opposed offensive action against combative Indians in the Kentucky and Illinois country. He instead pursued a policy of treating with the Cherokee, Chickasaw, and Creek Indian tribes, which allowed peace to last for the remainder of his term. The situation resulted in some contentious exchanges with General George Rogers Clark who urged aggressive operations in the west. As Harrison's term was ending, Washington accepted an invitation to visit with the Harrisons in Richmond, saying, \\"And I shall feel an additional pleasure, in offering this tribute of friendship and respect to you, by having the company of Marsqs. de la Fayette\\". The general made his visit in November 1784, though Lafayette was unable to accompany him. Harrison's service as governor was lauded, despite his inability to solve the financial problems that plagued his administration. Return to legislature and death In 1786, Harrison and other members of the legislature were deeply divided over the issue of state aid to religion. He joined with his brother and fellow delegate, Carter Henry Harrison, in supporting a measure offered by Patrick Henry to provide funds for teachers of the Christian religion. The proposal failed, and the assembly instead enacted Thomas Jefferson's famous Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which established a complete separation of church and state. Harrison participated as a member of the Virginia Ratifying Convention for the United States Constitution in 1788. However, along with Patrick Henry, George Mason, and others, he was skeptical of a large central government and opposed the Constitution because of the absence of a Bill of Rights. He was in the minority when the constitution won ratification with a margin of 5 out of 170 votes cast. He overcame his ill health sufficiently to address those who opposed the result, imploring them to seek redress through the legitimate channels of amendments to the Constitution. Though Washington had promoted the Constitution, he praised Harrison, saying, \\"Your individual endeavors to prevent inflammatory measures from being adopted redound greatly to your credit.\\" Despite his chronic gout and weakened financial condition, Harrison continued his work in the House. He died on April 24, 1791 at his home, after celebrating a re-election. His cause of death is unknown, though his persistent corpulence has been documented. His son William Henry, then aged 18, had just begun medical studies in Philadelphia, but adequate funds were lacking, so he soon abandoned medicine for military service, and his own path of leadership. =Memorials= A residence hall at the College of William and Mary is named for Harrison.

This is particularly used in the representation of text in computer languages, which are generally stored in a tree structure as an abstract syntax tree. Abstract syntax, which only consists of the structure of data, is contrasted with concrete syntax, which also includes information about the representation. For example, concrete syntax includes features like parentheses (for grouping) or commas (for lists) which are not included in the abstract syntax, as they are implicit in the structure. Abstract syntaxes are classified as first-order abstract syntax (FOAS), if the structure is abstract but names (identifiers) are still concrete (and thus requires name resolution), and higher-order abstract syntax, if the names themselves are abstract. Uses To be implemented either for computation or communications, a mapping from the abstract syntax to specific machine representations and encodings must be defined; these may be called the \\"concrete syntax\\" (in language implementation) or the \\"transfer syntax\\" (in communications). A compiler's internal representation of a program will typically be specified by an abstract syntax in terms of categories such as \\"statement\\", \\"expression\\" and \\"identifier\\". This is independent of the source syntax (concrete syntax) of the language being compiled (though it will often be very similar). A parse tree is similar to an abstract syntax tree but it will typically also contain features such as parentheses which are syntactically significant but which are implicit in the structure of the abstract syntax tree. Algebraic data types are particularly well-suited to the implementation of abstract syntax.

Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code. The syntax is \\"abstract\\" in the sense that it does not represent every detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural or content-related details. For instance, grouping parentheses are implicit in the tree structure, so these do not have to be represented as separate nodes. Likewise, a syntactic construct like an if-condition-then expression may be denoted by means of a single node with three branches. This distinguishes abstract syntax trees from concrete syntax trees, traditionally designated parse trees. Parse trees are typically built by a parser during the source code translation and compiling process. Once built, additional information is added to the AST by means of subsequent processing, e.g., contextual analysis. Abstract syntax trees are also used in program analysis and program transformation systems.  Application in compilers  Abstract syntax trees are data structures widely used in compilers to represent the structure of program code. An AST is usually the result of the syntax analysis phase of a compiler. It often serves as an intermediate representation of the program through several stages that the compiler requires, and has a strong impact on the final output of the compiler. = Motivation = An AST has several properties that aid the further steps of the compilation process: * An AST can be edited and enhanced with information such as properties and annotations for every element it contains. Such editing and annotation is impossible with the source code of a program, since it would imply changing it. * Compared to the source code, an AST does not include inessential punctuation and delimiters (braces, semicolons, parentheses, etc.). * An AST usually contains extra information about the program, due to the consecutive stages of analysis by the compiler. For example, it may store the position of each element in the source code, allowing the compiler to print useful error messages. ASTs are needed because of the inherent nature of programming languages and their documentation. Languages are often ambiguous by nature. In order to avoid this ambiguity, programming languages are often specified as a context-free grammar (CFG). However, there are often aspects of programming languages that a CFG can't express, but are part of the language and are documented in its specification. These are details that require a context to determine their validity and behaviour. For example, if a language allows new types to be declared, a CFG cannot predict the names of such types nor the way in which they should be used. Even if a language has a predefined set of types, enforcing proper usage usually requires some context. Another example is duck typing, where the type of an element can change depending on context. Operator overloading is yet another case where correct usage and final function are determined based on the context. Java provides an excellent example, where the '+' operator is both numerical addition and concatenation of strings. Although there are other data structures involved in the inner workings of a compiler, the AST performs a unique function. During the first stage, the syntax analysis stage, a compiler produces a parse tree. This parse tree can be used to perform almost all functions of a compiler by means of syntax-directed translation. Although this method can lead to a more efficient compiler, it goes against the software engineering principles of writing and maintaining programs. Another advantage that the AST has over a parse tree is the size, particularly the smaller height of the AST and the smaller number of elements. = Design = The design of an AST is often closely linked with the design of a compiler and its expected features. Core requirements include the following: * Variable types must be preserved, as well as the location of each declaration in source code. * The order of executable statements must be explicitly represented and well defined. * Left and right components of binary operations must be stored and correctly identified. * Identifiers and their assigned values must be stored for assignment statements. These requirements can be used to design the data structure for the AST. Some operations will always require two elements, such as the two terms for addition. However, some language constructs require an arbitrarily large number of children, such as argument lists passed to programs from the command shell. As a result, an AST used to represent code written in such a language has to also be flexible enough to allow for quick addition of an unknown quantity of children. To support compiler verification it should be possible to unparse an AST into source code form. The source code produced should be sufficiently similar to the original in appearance and identical in execution, upon recompilation. = Usage = The AST is used intensively during semantic analysis, where the compiler checks for correct usage of the elements of the program and the language. The compiler also generates symbol tables based on the AST during semantic analysis. A complete traversal of the tree allows verification of the correctness of the program. After verifying correctness, the AST serves as the base for code generation. The AST is often used to generate an intermediate representation (IR), sometimes called an intermediate language, for the code generation.

She was a founding member of the German Green Party, the first Green party to rise to prominence both nationally in Germany and worldwide. In 1982, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \\"forging and implementing a new vision uniting ecological concerns with disarmament, social justice and human rights.\\"  Early life and education  Petra Karin Lehmann was born in G√ºnzburg, Bavaria (then the American Zone of Occupation, Germany), in 1947. She changed her name to Kelly after her mother married John E. Kelly, a US Army officer. She was educated in a Roman Catholic convent in G√ºnzburg and later attended school in Georgia and Virginia after her family relocated to the United States in 1959. She lived and studied in the United States until her return to West Germany in 1970. She retained her (West) German citizenship throughout her life. An admirer of Martin Luther King, Jr., she campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 U.S. elections. She studied political science at the School of International Service at American University (Washington, D.C.), from which she graduated in 1970 with a bachelor's degree. She also graduated from the European Institute at the University of Amsterdam in 1971 with a master's degree. Career While working at the European Commission (Brussels, Belgium, 1971-83), she participated in numerous peace and environmental campaigns in Germany and other countries. After working for two years at the European Commission, she moved to an administrative post at the Economic and Social Committee, where she championed women's rights.Petra Kelly By Josh Kamrar = German Green Party = Kelly was one of the founders of Die Gr√ºnen, the German Green Party in 1979. In 1983 she was elected to the Bundestag via the Electoral list as a Member of the Bundestag representing Bavaria. She was subsequently re-elected in 1987 with a higher share of the vote. In 1981, Kelly was involved in a protest of 400,000 people in Bonn against nuclear weapons. In 1982, Gerhard Schr√∂der wrote a contribution in Die Zeit for the book Prinzip Leben, edited by Kelly and Jo Leinen, which discussed ecological problems and a possible nuclear war. In the same year, Kelly received the Right Livelihood Award \\"...for forging and implementing a new vision uniting ecological concerns with disarmament, social justice, and human rights.\\" On 12 May 1983, Kelly, Gert Bastian and three other Green Bundestag members unfurled a banner on Alexanderplatz in East Berlin, which said \\"The Greens ‚Äì Swords to Ploughshares\\". After being briefly arrested, they met with East German opposition parties. The East German authorities tolerated this since the West German Greens repudiated the NATO Double-Track Decision. In October 1983, Erich Honecker, the leader of the German Democratic Republic, met Petra Kelly, Gert Bastian and other Greens. Kelly wore a pullover with the words \\"Swords to Ploughshares\\" on it. She demanded the release of all prisoners of the East German peace movement and asked Honecker why he repressed something in the GDR which he supported in the West. Kelly wrote the book Fighting for Hope in 1984, published by South End Press. The book is an urgent call for a world free from violence between North and South, men and women, ourselves and our environment. In the final years of her life, Kelly became increasingly estranged from most of her party colleagues owing to the pragmatic turn taken by the Greens at the time, while she continued to oppose any alliance with traditional political parties. Murder On 19 October 1992, the decomposed bodies of Kelly and her partner, ex-general and Green politician Gert Bastian (born 1923), were discovered in the bedroom of her house in Bonn by police officials after they received a call from both Bastian's wife and Kelly's grandmother who reported that they had not heard from either Bastian or Kelly for a few weeks. The police determined that Kelly was shot dead while sleeping by Bastian, who then killed himself. She was 44, he was 69. The last time anyone heard from the couple was on 30 September 1992 when Kelly sent a parcel to her grandmother. Police estimated the deaths had most likely occurred on 1 October but the exact time of death could not be pinpointed owing to the delay in finding the bodies and their resultant state of decomposition. Kelly was buried in the Waldfriedhof (forest cemetery) in W√ºrzburg, near the village of Heidingsfeld in Lower Franconia, Bavaria.

The first three were co-authored with his friend and fellow journalist William Montalbano: Powder Burn (1981), Trap Line (1982), and A Death in China (1984). His first solo novel, Tourist Season (1986), featured a group of ragged eco-warriors who kidnap the Orange Bowl Queen in Miami. The book's main character was whimsically memorialized by Jimmy Buffett in a song called \\"The Ballad of Skip Wiley,\\" which appeared on his Barometer Soup album. In all, twenty of Hiaasen's novels and nonfiction books have been on the New York Times Best Seller lists. His work has been translated into 34 languages. His first venture into writing for younger readers was the 2002 novel Hoot, which was named a Newbery Medal honor book. It was adapted as a 2006 film of the same name (starring Logan Lerman, Brie Larson and Luke Wilson). The movie was written and directed by Wil Shriner. Jimmy Buffett provided songs for the soundtrack, and appeared in the role of Mr. Ryan, a middle-school teacher. Hiaasen's subsequent children's novels were Flush, Scat; Chomp and, Skink No Surrender, which introduces one of his most popular adult characters to teen readers. In 2014, Skink was long-listed for a National Book Award in Young People's Literature. All of Hiaasen's books for young readers feature environmental themes, eccentric casts and adventure-filled plots. His newest, Squirm, which is set in Florida and Montana, was published in the fall of 2018 and opened at #4 on the New York Times bestseller list for middle-grade novels. His previous novel for adults, Razor Girl, was published by Alfred A. Knopf in September 2016, and opened at #2 on the New York Times bestseller list. In England it was short-listed for the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse award for comic fiction. His latest adult book, Squeeze Me, was published on August 25, 2020 and debuted at #2 on the New York Times Combined Print and E-Book Print Best Sellers List. The novel takes place during the glitzy Palm Beach social season, and features wild pythons and a fictional, well-fed U.S. president who has a vacation mansion on the island. Hiaasen's most recent nonfiction work is Assume the Worst: The Graduation Speech You'll Never Hear, which was published in April 2018 and illustrated by Roz Chast, who is well- known for her cartoons in the New Yorker magazine. During the 1990s Hiaasen co-wrote the lyrics of three songs with his good friend and famed L.A. rocker, the late Warren Zevon. \\"Rottweiler Blues\\" and \\"Seminole Bingo\\" appeared on Zevon's Mutineer album in 1995. The third song they wrote together, \\"Basket Case,\\" was done in conjunction with Hiaasen's novel of the same name, and appeared in 2001 on Zevon's album My Ride's Here.

Tampere, the third largest city of Finland, has been officially declared the \\"Sauna Capital of the World\\".Tampere is the Sauna Capital of the WorldFinnish Sauna Society and International Sauna Association: ‚ÄúTampere is the Sauna Capital‚ÄùTampere ‚Äì the sauna capital of the worldTampere University ‚Äì ISEP Study AbroadTampere ‚Äì the Sauna Capital of the World ~ Sauna from Finland History A Finnish smoke sauna The oldest-known saunas in Finland were made from pits dug in a slope in the ground and primarily used as dwellings in winter. The sauna featured a fireplace where stones were heated to a high temperature. Water was thrown on the hot stones to produce steam and to give a sensation of increased heat. This would raise the apparent temperature so high that people could take off their clothes. The first Finnish saunas are what nowadays are called savusaunas, or smoke saunas. These differed from present-day saunas in that they were heated by heating a pile of rocks called kiuas by burning large amounts of wood about 6 to 8 hours and then letting the smoke out before enjoying the l√∂yly, or sauna heat. A properly heated \\"savusauna\\" gives heat up to 12 hours. Bain Finlandais. Illustration of Finnish Sauna in 1804 by Giuseppe Acerbi . As a result of the Industrial Revolution, the sauna evolved to use a metal woodstove, or kiuas , with a chimney. Air temperatures averaged around but sometimes exceeded in a traditional Finnish sauna. When the Finns migrated to other areas of the globe they brought their sauna designs and traditions with them. This led to further evolution of the sauna, including the electric sauna stove, which was introduced in 1938 by Metos Ltd in Vaasa.Metos Ltd (in Finnish) Although the culture of sauna nowadays is more or less related to Finnish culture, the evolution of sauna happened around the same time both in Finland and the Baltic countries sharing the same meaning and importance of sauna in daily life, shared still to this day. The Sauna became very popular especially in Scandinavia and the German speaking regions of Europe after the Second World War. German soldiers had experienced Finnish saunas during their fight against the Soviet Union on the Soviet-Finnish front of WWII, where they fought on the same side. Saunas were so important to Finnish soldiers that they built saunas not only in mobile tents, but even in bunkers.Manfred Scheuch: Nackt; Kulturgeschichte eines Tabus im 20. Jahrhundert; Christian Brandst√§tter Verlag; Wien 2004; pages 156ff After the war, the German soldiers brought the habit back to Germany and Austria, where it became popular in the second half of the 20th century. The German sauna culture also became popular in neighbouring countries such as Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Traditional Latvian sauna from Spirƒìni, Nƒ´ca, Courland built in 1862, currently located at The Ethnographic Open-Air Museum of Latvia Archaeological sites in Greenland and Newfoundland have uncovered structures very similar to traditional Scandinavian farm saunas, some with bathing platforms and \\"enormous quantities of badly scorched stones\\".Nordskog, M., Hautala, A (2010)The Opposite of Cold-The Northwoods Finnish Sauna Tradition; University of Minnesota Press Areas of the Nordic diaspora, such as the rocky shores of the Orkney islands of Scotland, have many stone structures for normal habitation, some of which incorporate areas for fire and bathing. It is possible some of these structures also incorporated the use of steam, in a way similar to the sauna, but this is a matter of speculation. The sites are from the Neolithic age, dating to approximately 4000 B.C.E.Bronze age ‚Äòsauna‚Äô unearthed on Orkney Vihtas in the beginning of 20th century in Helsinki, Finland.alt= The traditional Korean sauna, called the hanjeungmak, is a domed structure constructed of stone that was first mentioned in the Sejong Sillok of the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty in the 15th century. Supported by Sejong the Great, the hanjeungmak was touted for its health benefits and used to treat illnesses. In the early 15th century, Buddhist monks maintained hanjeungmak clinics, called hanjeungso, to treat sick poor people; these clinics maintained separate facilities for men and women due to high demand. Korean sauna culture and kiln saunas are still popular today, and Korean saunas are ubiquitous. =Etymology= Originally borrowed from the early Proto-Germanic *stakna- whose descendants include English stack, the word sauna is an ancient Finnish word referring to the traditional Finnish bath and to the bathhouse itself. In Finnic languages other than Finnish and Estonian, sauna and cognates do not necessarily mean a building or space built for bathing. It can also mean a small cabin or cottage, such as a cabin for a fisherman. Modern saunas alt= The sauna known in the western world today originates from Northern Europe. In Finland, there are built-in saunas in almost every house.Finland in Figures, Buildings and summer cottages, Statistics Finland, 2011-06-22 Under many circumstances, temperatures approaching and exceeding would be completely intolerable and possibly fatal if exposed to long periods of time. Saunas overcome this problem by controlling the humidity. The hottest Finnish saunas have relatively low humidity levels in which steam is generated by pouring water on the hot stones. This allows air temperatures that could boil water to be tolerated and even enjoyed for longer periods of time. Steam baths, such as the Turkish bath, where the humidity approaches 100%, will be set to a much lower temperature of around to compensate. The \\"wet heat\\" would cause scalding if the temperature were set much higher. In a typical Finnish sauna, the temperature of the air, the room and the benches is above the dew point even when water is thrown on the hot stones and vaporised. Thus, they remain dry. In contrast, the sauna bathers are at about , which is below the dew point, so that water is condensed on the bathers' skin. This process releases heat and makes the steam feel hot. Finer control over the temperature experienced can be achieved by choosing a higher-level bench for those wishing a hotter experience or a lower-level bench for a more moderate temperature. A good sauna has a relatively small temperature gradient between the various seating levels. Doors need to be kept closed and used quickly to maintain the temperature inside. Some North American, Western European, Japanese, Russian, and South African public sport centres and gyms include sauna facilities. They may also be present at public and private swimming pools. As an additional facility, a sauna may have one or more Jacuzzis. In some spa centers, there are the so-called special \\"snow rooms,\\" also known as a cold sauna or cryotherapy. Operating at a temperature of , the user is in the sauna for a period of only about 3 minutes. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the world's largest sauna is the Koi Sauna in the Thermen & Badewelt Sinsheim, Germany. It measures 166 square meters, holds 150 people and sports a Koi aquarium.

Some users prefer taking a warm shower beforehand to speed up perspiration in the sauna. When in the sauna users often sit on a towel for hygiene and put a towel over the head if the face feels too hot but the body feels comfortable. In Russia, a felt \\"banya hat\\" may be worn to shield the head from the heat; this allows the wearer to increase the heat on the rest of the body. Most adjustment of temperature in a sauna comes from, *amount of water thrown on the heater, this increases humidity, so that sauna bathers perspire more copiously. *length of stay in the sauna *positioning when in the sauna Heating caused by direct radiation will be greatest closest to the stove. Heating from the air will be lower on the lower benches as the hot air rises. Provided the sauna is not crowded, lying on a bench is considered preferable as it gives more even temperature over the body. Heating caused by fresh steam can be very different in different parts of the sauna. As the steam rises directly upwards it will spread across the roof and travel out towards the corners, where it will then be forced downwards. Consequently, the heat of fresh steam may sometimes be felt most strongly in the furthest corners of the sauna. Users increase duration and the heat gradually over time as they adapt to sauna. When pouring water onto the heater, it will cool down the heater, but carry more heat into the air via advection, making the sauna warmer. Perspiration is a sign of autonomic responses trying to cool the body. Users are advised to leave the sauna if the heat becomes unbearable, or if they feel faint or ill. Some saunas have a thermostat to adjust temperature, but management and other users expect to be consulted before changes are made. The sauna heater and rocks are very hot‚Äîone must stay well clear to avoid injury, particularly when water is poured on the sauna rocks, which creates an immediate blast of steam. Combustibles on or near the heater have been known to result in fire. Contact lenses dry out in the heat. Jewelry or anything metallic, including glasses, will get hot in the sauna and can cause discomfort or burning. Temperature on different parts of the body can be adjusted by shielding from the steam radiator with a towel. Shielding the face with a towel has been found to reduce the perception of heat. It may be advisable to put an additional towel or special cap on the hair to avoid dryness. Few people can sit directly in front of the heater without feeling too hot from radiant heat, but their overall body temperature may be insufficient. As the person's body is often the coolest object in a sauna room, steam will condense into water on the skin; this can be confused with perspiration. Cooling down is a part of the sauna cycle and is as important as the heating. Among users it is considered good practice to take a few moments after exiting a sauna before entering a cold plunge, and to enter a plunge pool by stepping into it gradually, rather than immediately immersing fully. However, it is advisable that healthy people and heart patients alike should take some precautions because the rapid cooling of the body, via plunging into cold water, produces considerable amount of circulatory stress. In summer, a session is often started with a cold shower. Therapeutic sauna has been shown to aid adaptation, reduce stress hormones, lower blood pressure and improve cardiovascular conditions. =Health effects= Sauna bather in winter Increased frequency of sauna bathing is associated with a reduced risk of sudden cardiac death, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. Its usage is also associated with lower markers of inflammation in the blood and a reduced risk of high blood pressure. In addition, it is associated with a decreased risk of pneumonia and may temporarily relieve symptoms of the common cold. It is also associated with a reduced risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. It has been pointed out that many of the positive health effects reported with sauna usage, in particular its cardiovascular benefits, may be non-causal - e.g., sauna users tend to have other habits that are health- promoting. Saunas may not be safe in cases of unstable angina pectoris, recent heart attack, or severe aortic stenosis. Additionally, there is risk of heat prostration, hyperthermia, heat stroke and even death. Children and older persons who have heart disease or seizure disorders or those who use alcohol or cocaine are especially vulnerable. Sauna use can affect spermatogenesis, and has been associated with loss of fertility in men lasting up to two months. Prolonged stay in a sauna may lead to the loss of electrolytes from the body, as after vigorous exercise. The risk of dehydration leading to heat stroke may be reduced by regular sipping of water or isotonic drinks, but not alcohol, during the sauna. Sauna bathing with heavy drinking of alcoholic beverages or during alcohol withdrawal phase can have serious adverse health effects. With sauna-associated deaths in Finland, individuals usually had an underlying chronic illness. More than 50% were men over the age of 50, and 30% were over 70. Most were also intoxicated.\\"Suomessa kuolee saunaan kymmeni√§ vuodessa\\", Iltalehti, 17 June 2012 In some countries the closest and most convenient access to a sauna is at a gymnasium. Some pool, major sport, and resort complexes also contain a sauna. Therapeutic sauna sessions are often carried out in conjunction with physiotherapy or hydrotherapy, gentle exercises that do not exacerbate symptoms. Technologies Smoke sauna stove Smoke sauna stones Electric sauna stove, with stones Today there are a wide variety of sauna options. Heat sources include wood, electricity, gas and other more unconventional methods such as solar power. There are wet saunas, dry saunas, infrared saunas, smoke saunas, and steam saunas. There are two main types of stoves: continuous heating and heat storage type. Continuously heating stoves have a small heat capacity and can be heated up on a fast on- demand basis, whereas a heat storage stove has a large heat (stone) capacity and can take much longer to heat. =Heat storage-type= Smoke sauna Smoke sauna (Finnish savusauna, Estonian suitsusaun, V√µro savvusann) is one of the earliest forms of the sauna. It is simply a room containing a pile of rocks, but without a chimney. A fire is lit directly under the rocks and after a while the fire is extinguished. The heat retained in the rocks, and the earlier fire, becomes the main source for heating the sauna. Following this process, the ashes and embers are removed from the hearth, the benches and floor are cleaned, and the room is allowed to air out and freshen for a period of time. The smoke deposits a layer of soot on every surface, so if the benches and back-rests can be removed while the fire is alight the amount of cleaning necessary is reduced. Depending on size of the stove and the airing time, the temperature may be low, about , while the humidity is relatively high. The tradition almost died out, but was revived by enthusiasts in the 1980s. These are still used in present-day Finland by some enthusiasts, but usually only on special occasions such as Christmas, New Year's, Easter, and juhannus (Midsummer). Heat storage-sauna The smoke-sauna stove is also used with a sealed stone compartment and chimney (a heat storage-stove) which eliminates the smoke odour and eye irritation of the smoke sauna. A heat storage stove does not give up much heat in the sauna before bathing since the stone compartment has an insulated lid. When the sauna bath is started and the l√∂yly shutter opened a soft warmth flow into the otherwise relatively cold () sauna. This heat is soft and clean because, thanks to combustion, the stove stones glow red, even white-hot, and are freed of dust at the same time. When bathing the heat-storage sauna will become as hot as a continuous fire-type sauna () but more humid. The stones are usually durable heat proof and heat- retaining peridotite. The upper part of the stove is often insulated with rock wool and firebricks. Heat-storing stoves are also found with electric heating, with similar service but no need to maintain a fire. =Continuous heat- type= Continuous fire sauna A continuous fire stove, instead of stored heat, is a relatively recent invention. There is a firebox and a smokestack, and stones are placed in a compartment directly above the firebox. It takes shorter time to heat than the heat-storage sauna, about one hour. A fire-heated sauna requires manual labor in the form of maintaining the fire during bathing; the fire can also be seen as a hazard. Fire-heated saunas are common in cottages, where the extra work of maintaining the fire is not a problem.  Electric stove sauna  The most common modern sauna types are those with electric stoves. The stones are heated up and kept on temperature using electric heating elements. There is thermostat and a timer (typically with eight hours' maximum delay time, followed by one hour's continuous heating time) on the stove. This type of heating is generally used only in urban saunas. Other sweat bathing facilities Many cultures have sweat baths, though some have more spiritual uses while others are purely secular. In Ancient Rome there was the thermae or balneae (from Greek Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒΩŒµ·øñŒøŒΩ balane√Æon), traits of which survive in the Turkish or Arab hammam. In the Americas there is the Nahuatl (Aztec) temƒÅzcalli , Maya zumpul-ch√©, and the Mixtec √ëihi; in Canada and the United States, a number of First Nations and Native American cultures have various kinds of spiritual sweat lodges (Lakota: inipi, Anishinaabemowin madoodiswan). In Europe we find the Estonian saun (almost identical to the Finnish sauna), Russian banya, Latvian pirts, the European Jews' shvitz, and the Swedish bastu. In Asia the Japanese Mushi-Buro and the Korean jjimjilbang. The Karo people of Indonesia have the oukup. In some parts of Africa there is the sifutu. Around the world Although cultures in all corners of the world have imported and adapted the sauna, many of the traditional customs have not survived the journey. Today, public perception of saunas, sauna \\"etiquette\\" and sauna customs vary hugely from country to country. In many countries sauna going is a recent fashion and attitudes towards saunas are changing, while in others traditions have survived over generations. =Africa= In Africa, the majority of sauna facilities are found in more upmarket hotel, spa and health club environments and predominantly share both sauna heater technology and design concepts as applied in Europe. Even though outdoor temperatures remain warmer and more humid, this does not affect the general application or intended sauna experience offered within these commercial environments offering a traditional sauna and or steam shower experience. =Asia= In Iran, most gyms, hotels and almost all public swimming pools have indoor saunas. It is very common for swimming pools to have two saunas which are known in Persian as ÿ≥ŸàŸÜÿß€å ÿÆÿ¥⁄© \\"dry sauna\\" and ÿ≥ŸàŸÜÿß€å ÿ®ÿÆÿßÿ± \\"steam sauna\\", with the dry type customarily boasting a higher temperature. A cold-water pool (and/or more recently a cold Jacuzzi) is almost always accompanied and towels are usually provided. Adding therapeutic or relaxing essential oils to the rocks is common. In Iran, unlike Finland, sitting in sauna is mostly seen as part of the spa/club culture, rather than a bathing ritual. It is most usually perceived as a means for relaxation or detoxification (through perspiration). Having a sauna room on a private property is considered a luxury rather than a necessity. Public saunas are segregated and nudity is prohibited. In Japan, many saunas exist at sports centers and public bathhouses (sent≈ç). The saunas are almost always gender separated, often required by law, and nudity is a required part of proper sauna etiquette. While right after World War II, public bathhouses were commonplace in Japan, the number of customers have dwindled as more people were able to afford houses and apartments equipped with their own private baths as the nation became wealthier. As a result, many sent≈çs have added more features such as saunas in order to survive. In Korea, saunas are essentially public bathhouses. Various names are used to describe them, such as the smaller mogyoktang, outdoor oncheon, and the elaborate jjimjilbang. The word \\"sauna\\" is used a lot for its 'English appeal'; however, it does not strictly refer to the original Fennoscandian steam rooms that have become popular throughout the world. The konglish word sauna (ÏÇ¨Ïö∞ÎÇò) usually refers to bathhouses with Jacuzzis, hot tubs, showers, steam rooms, and related facilities. In Laos, herbal steam sauna or hom yaa in Lao language, is very popular especially with women, and is available in every village. Many women apply yogurt or a paste blend based on tamarind on their skin as beauty treatment. The sauna is always heated by wood fire and herbs are added either directly to the boiling water or steam jet in the room. The sitting lounge is mix gender but the steam rooms are gender separated. Bael fruit tea known in lao as muktam tea is usually served. =Australia and Canada= In Australia and Canada, saunas are found mainly in hotels, swimming pools, and health clubs and if used by both men and women, nudity is forbidden. In gyms or health clubs with separate male and female change rooms, nudity is permitted; however, members are usually asked to shower before using the sauna and to sit on a towel. =Europe= Dutch-speaking regions Public saunas can be found throughout the Netherlands and Flanders, both in major cities and in smaller municipalities, mixed-gender nudity is the generally accepted rule. Some saunas might offer women-only (or \\"bathing suit only\\") times for people who are less comfortable with mixed-gender nudity; Algemeen Dagblad reported in 2008 that women-only, bathing suit-required times are drawing Muslim women in the Netherlands to the sauna. Finnish and Estonian sauna A sauna session can be a social affair in which the participants disrobe and sit or recline in temperatures typically between . This induces relaxation and promotes sweating. The Finns use a bundle of birch twigs with fresh leaves (Finnish: vihta or vasta), to slap the skin and create further stimulation of the pores and cells. The sauna is an important part of daily life, and families bathe together in the home sauna. There are at least 2 million saunas according to official registers. The Finnish Sauna Society believes the number can actually be as high as 3.2 million saunas (population 5.5 million). Many Finns take at least one a week, and much more when they visit their summer cottage in the countryside. Here the pattern of life tends to revolve around the sauna, and a nearby lake used for cooling off. Rajaportin sauna 2017-03-04 15.01.56.jpgRajaportin sauna in Tampere, the oldest working public sauna in Finland Sauna-pool.JPGA modern sauna in Finland Hinni talu saun.jpgFinnish sauna Sauna of Kapelo.JPGSauna building in Finland Sunset sauna, Saadj√§rv.jpgEstonian sauna on a lake Sauna traditions in Estonia are almost identical to Finland as saunas have traditionally held a central role in the life of an individual. Ancient Estonians believed saunas were inhabited by spirits. In folk tradition sauna was not only the place where one washed, but also used as the place where brides were ceremoniously washed, where women gave birth and the place the dying made their final bed. The folk tradition related to the Estonian sauna is mostly identical to that surrounding the Finnish sauna. On New Year's Eve a sauna would be held before midnight to cleanse the body and spirit for the upcoming year. the United Kingdom and Mediterranean Europe Pedra formosa-lusitanian sauna front stone In the United Kingdom and much of Southern Europe, single-gender saunas are the most common type. Nudity is expected in the segregated saunas but usually forbidden in the mixed saunas. This is a source of confusion when residents of these nations visit the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Austria or vice versa. Sauna sessions tend to be shorter and cold showers are shunned by most. In the United Kingdom, where public saunas are becoming increasingly fashionable, the practice of alternating between the sauna and the Jacuzzi in short seatings (considered a faux pas in Northern Europe) has emerged. Foreign visitors should also be aware that some small establishments advertised as 'saunas' are in fact brothels, and it is rare to have a legitimate sauna with no other health spa or gym facilities in the UK. In Portugal, the steam baths were commonly used by the Castrejos people, prior to the arrival of the Romans in the western part of the Iberian Peninsula. The historian Strabo spoke of Lusitans traditions that consisted of having steam bath sessions followed by cold water baths. Pedra Formosa is the original name given to the central piece of the steam bath in pre-Roman times. German-speaking countries Sauna in Freiberg, Germany In Germany, Austria, Luxembourg and South Tyrol (but rarely in the remainder of Italy), most public swimming pool complexes have sauna areas; in these locales, nudity is the generally accepted rule, and benches are expected to be covered by patrons' towels. These rules are strictly enforced in some public saunas. Separate single-sex saunas for both genders are rare, most places offer women-only and mixed-gender saunas, or organise women-only days for the sauna once a week. Loud conversation is not usual as the sauna is seen as a place of healing rather than socialising. Contrary to Russia and Nordic countries, pouring water on hot stones to increase humidity (Aufguss, lit: \\"Onpouring\\") is not normally done by the sauna visitors themselves; larger sauna areas have a person in charge (the Saunameister) for that, either an employee of the sauna complex or a volunteer. Aufguss sessions can take up to 10 minutes, and take place according to a schedule. During an Aufguss session the Saunameister uses a large towel to circulate the hot air through the sauna, intensifying sweating and the perception of heat. Once the Aufguss session has started it is not considered good manners to enter the sauna, as opening the door would cause loss of heat (Sauna guests are expected to enter the sauna just in time before the Aufguss. Leaving the session is allowed, but grudgingly tolerated). Aufguss sessions are usually announced by a schedule on the sauna door. An Aufguss session in progress might be indicated by a light or sign hung above the sauna entrance. Cold showers or baths shortly after a sauna, as well as exposure to fresh air in a special balcony, garden or open-air room (Frischluftraum) are considered a must. In German-speaking Switzerland, customs are generally the same as in Germany and Austria, although you tend to see more families (parents with their children) and young people. Also in respect to socialising in the sauna the Swiss tend more to be like the Finns, Scandinavians or Russians. Also in German-speaking countries, there are many facilities for washing after using the sauna, with 'dunking pools' (pools of very cold water in which a person dips themselves after using the sauna) or showers. In some saunas and steam rooms, scented salts are given out which can be rubbed into the skin for extra aroma and cleaning effects. Hungary Swedish sauna house on the lake Hungarians see the sauna as part of a wider spa culture. Mixed genders use the sauna together and wear swimsuits. Single- sex saunas are rare, as well as those which tolerate nudity. Some Hungarian saunas have so-called \\"snow rooms\\" that look like little cages with snow and icicles, where visitors can cool down for a couple of minutes after each sauna session. Czech republic and Slovakia In Czech Republic and Slovakia saunas have long tradition and are often found as part of recreational facilities, as well as public swimming pools. Many people are regular goers, while many never go. Saunas became more popular after about the year 2000, when large aquaparks and wellness centers included them. Nudity is increasingly tolerated, and many places prohibit the use of swimsuits; however, most people cover themselves with a towel. Showers are typically semi-private. Having men and women only days was the norm in the past, but today, men-only facilities are rare, while women-only hours are sometimes provided. Norway and Sweden In Norway and Sweden saunas are found in many places, and are known as 'badstu' or 'bastu' (from 'badstuga' \\"bath cabin, bath house\\"). In Norway and Sweden, saunas are common in almost every public swimming pool and gym. The public saunas are generally single-sex and may or may not permit use of swimwear. Rules for swimwear and towels for sitting on or covering yourself differ between saunas. Removing body hair in the sauna, staring at other's nudity or spreading odors is considered impolite. Russia, the Baltics and Eastern Europe Latvian sauna covered by snow Russian sauna in Antarctica Polish sauna In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia sauna-going plays a central social role. These countries also have the tradition of massaging fellow sauna-goers with leafy, wet birch bunches: vasta or vihta in Finnish, viht in Estonian, slota in Latvian, vanta in Lithuanian, venik (–≤–µ–Ω–∏–∫) in Russian. In Latvian, sauna is pirts, in Lithuanian, it is pirtis. In Russophone nations the word banya (Russian: –ë–∞–Ω—è) is widely used also when referring to a public bath. In Russia, public saunas are strictly single-sex, while in Finland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, both types occur. During wintertime, Finns often run outdoors for either ice swimming or, in the absence of lake, just to roll around in the snow naked and then go back inside. This is popular in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia as well. Finnish sauna is traditionally the same as Russian banya despite the popular misconception that Finnish sauna is very dry. In ex-USSR there are three different types of saunas. The first one, previously very popular especially during the Soviet Era, is the public sauna or the banya, (also known as the Russian banya), as it is referred to among the locals, is similar in context to public bath houses in Russia and in all ex-Soviet nations. The banya is a large setting with many different rooms. There is at least one sauna (Finnish style), one cold pool of water, a relaxation area, another sauna where fellow-sauna goers beat other fellow-sauna goers with the leafy birch, a shower area, a small cafeteria with a TV and drinks, and a large common area that leads to the other areas. In this large area, there are marble bed-like structures where people lie down and receive a massage either by another sauna-member or by a designated masseur. In the resting area, there are also other bed-like structures made of marble or stone attached to the ground where people lie down to rest between different rounds of sauna or at the very end of their banya session. There is also a large public locker area where one keeps one's clothes as well as two other more private locker areas with individual doors that can lock these two separate locker rooms. The second type of sauna is the Finnish sauna type one can find in any gym throughout the world or a hotel. It could be in the locker room or mixed (i. e. male and female together). Attitudes towards nudity are very liberal and people are less self-conscious about their nude bodies. The third type of sauna is one that is rented by a group of friends. It is similar to the public banya bath house type, except that it is usually more modern and luxurious, and is often rented by groups of friends by the hour for the use of partying and socialising. Here it can be single-sex or mixed-sex. =North America and Central America= Wood-heated floating sauna on Iowa farm pond In the United States, the earliest saunas that arrived with the colonists were Swedish bastus in the colony New Sweden around the Delaware River. The Swedish Governor at the time had a bathhouse on Tinicum Island. Today sauna culture enjoys its greatest popularity in the Lake Superior Region, specifically the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, especially the Keweenaw Peninsula, and parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, which are home to large populations of Swedish and particularly Finnish Americans. Duluth, Minnesota, at its peak, had as many as 14 public saunas. Indeed, among Finnish farms in Great Lakes \\"sauna country\\", the cultural geographer Matti Kaups, found that 90% had sauna structures-more even than the farms in Finland. Elsewhere, sauna facilities are normally provided at health clubs and at hotels, but there is no tradition or ritual to their use. To avoid liability, many saunas operate at only moderate temperatures and do not allow pouring water on the rocks. A wider range of sauna etiquette is usually acceptable in the United States compared to other countries, with the exception that most mixed-sex saunas usually require some clothing such as a bathing suit to be worn. These are uncommon, however, as most saunas are either small private rooms or in the changing rooms of health clubs or gyms. There are few restrictions and their use is casual; bathers may enter and exit the sauna as they please, be it nude, with a towel, dripping wet in swimsuits or even in workout clothes (the latter being very unusual). Like many aspects of US culture, there are few prescribed conventions and the bather should remain astute to \\"read\\" the specific family or community's expectations. Besides the Finnish Americans, the older generation of Korean-Americans still uses the saunas as it is available to them. Sauna societies are beginning to emerge in colleges across America, with the first one being formed at Gustavus Adolphus College. A cultural legacy of Eastern European Jews in America is the culture of 'shvitz', which used to be widespread in the East Coast and occasionally in the Pacific West Coast. The sweat lodge, used by a number of Native American and First Nations traditional ceremonial cultures, is a location for a spiritual ceremony. The focus is on the ceremony, and the sweating is only secondary. Unlike sauna traditions, and most forcefully in the case of the Inipi, the sweat lodge ceremonies have been robustly defended as an exclusively Native expression of spirituality rather than a recreational activity.Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (10 June 1993) \\"Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality.\\" \\"At the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a \\"Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality\\". The following declaration was unanimously passed.\\" Traditions and old beliefs Banya (1913), by Zinaida Serebriakova (State Russian Museum, Saint Petersburg) In a Russian Banya (1916), by Vitaly Tikhov In the sauna (1925), by Pekka Halonen A Finnish word l√∂yly is strictly connected to the sauna. It can be translated as \\"sauna steam\\" and refers to the steam vapour created by splashing water on the heated rocks. In many languages related to Finnish, there is a word corresponding to l√∂yly. The same approximate meaning is used across the Finnic languages such as in Estonian leil. Originally this word meant \\"spirit\\" or \\"life\\", as in e. g. Hungarian l√©lek and Khanty lil, which both mean \\"soul\\", referring to the sauna's old, spiritual essence. The same dual meaning of both \\"spirit\\" and \\"(sauna) steam\\" is also preserved in the Latvian word gars. There is an old Finnish saying, \\"saunassa ollaan kuin kirkossa,\\"‚Äîone should behave in the sauna as in church. Saunatonttu, literally translated as \\"sauna elf\\", is a little gnome or tutelary spirit that was believed to live in the sauna. He was always treated with respect, otherwise he might cause much trouble for people. It was customary to warm up the sauna just for the tonttu every now and then, or to leave some food outside for him. It is said that he warned the people if a fire was threatening the sauna, or punished people who behaved improperly in it‚Äîfor example, slept, or played games, argued, were generally noisy or behaved otherwise immorally there. Such creatures are believed to exist in different cultures. The Russian banya has an entirely corresponding character called a bannik. In Thailand, women spend hours in a makeshift sauna tent during a month following childbirth. The steam is typically infused with several herbs. It is believed that the sauna helps the new mother's body return to its normal condition more quickly. Communal sweat lodges were commonplace in Ireland until the 19th century. The structure was a low stone mound with a small entrance. After the lodge was heated, participants entered and the door was sealed shut from the outside with a stone slab, typically for five hours before the participants were let out.

This Latin word continued in use through the 18th century as an alternative to the vernacular names of various musical instruments. Roman ritual wand The lituus was a crooked wand (similar in shape to the top part of some Western European crosiers) used as a cult instrument in ancient Roman religion by augurs to mark out a ritual space in the sky (a templum). The passage of birds through this templum indicated divine favor or disfavor for a given undertaking. The lituus was also used as a symbol of office for the college of the augurs to mark them out as a priestly group. Music instrument Etrusco-Roman lituus (instrument) =Antiquity= The ancient lituus was an Etruscan high-pitched brass instrument, which was straight but bent at the end, in the shape of a letter J, similar to the Gallic carnyx. It was later used by the Romans, especially for processional music and as a signalling horn in the army. For the Roman military it may have been particular to the cavalry, and both the Etruscan and Roman versions were always used in pairs, like the prehistoric lurer. Unlike the Roman litui, the Etruscan instruments had detachable mouthpieces and in general appear to have been longer.Sibyl Marcuse, \\"Lituus\\", Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary, corrected edition, The Norton Library N758 (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1975): 312 ; Anthony Baines, Brass Instruments: Their History and Development (London: Faber and Faber; New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1976): 58, 60, 65. . The name lituus is Latin, thought to have been derived from an Etruscan cultic word describing a soothsayer's wand modelled on a shepherd's crook and associated with sacrifice and favourable omens. Earlier Roman and Etruscan depictions show the instrument used in processions, especially funeral processions. Players of the lituus were called liticines, though the name of the instrument appears to have been loosely used (by poets, not likely by soldiers) to describe other military brass instruments, such as the tuba or the buccina.James W. McKinnon, \\"Lituus\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001); Anthony Baines, Brass Instruments: Their History and Development (London: Faber and Faber; New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1976): 65‚Äì66. . In 17th- century Germany a variant of the bent ancient lituus was still used as a signalling horn by nightwatchmen. =Medieval period= From the end of the 10th through the 13th centuries, chroniclers of the Crusades used the word lituus vaguely‚Äîalong with the Classical Latin names for other Roman military trumpets and horns, such as the tuba, cornu, and buccina and the more up-to- date French term trompe‚Äîto describe various instruments employed in the Christian armies. However, it is impossible to determine just what sort of instrument might have been meant, and it is unlikely there litui were the same as the Etrusco-Roman instrument.John Wallace and Alexander McGrattan, The Trumpet (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2012): 73. In the early 15th century, Jean de Gerson listed the lituus among those string instruments that were sounded by beating or striking, either with the fingernails, a plectrum, or a stick. Other instruments Gerson names in this category are the cythara, guiterna, psalterium, timpanum, and campanula.Christopher Page, \\"Early 15th-Century Instruments in Jean de Gerson's 'Tractatus de Canticis'\\", Early Music 6, no. 3 (July 1978): 339‚Äì49. Citation on 344. =Modern era= Throughout the postclassical era the name lituus continued to be used when discussing ancient and Biblical instruments, but with reference to contemporary musical practice in the Renaissance it usually referred to \\"bent horns\\" made of wood, particularly the crumhorn and the cornett.Don Michael Randel, \\"Lituus\\", The Harvard Dictionary of Music, fourth edition (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2003). The crumhorn was especially associated with the lituus because of the similarity of its shape. The equation of the crumhorn with the lituus was especially strong among German writers.Kenton Terry Meyer, \\"The Crumhorn\\", PhD thesis (Iowa City: University of Iowa, 1981): 10, 20. A 1585 English translation of Hadrianus Junius's Nomenclator defines lituus as \\"a writhen or crooked trumpet winding in and out; a shaulme\\" (i.e., shawm), but a polyglot edition of the same book published in 1606 demonstrates how differently the term might have been understood in various languages at that time: German Schalmey, Krumme Trommeten, Krumhorn; Dutch Schalmeye; French Claron, ou cleron; Italian Trombetta bastarda; Spanish Trompeta curua, √≤ bastarda.Kenton Terry Meyer, \\"The Crumhorn\\", PhD thesis (Iowa City: University of Iowa, 1981): 21‚Äì22. The early Baroque composer and author Michael Praetorius used the word as a Latin equivalent of the German \\"Schallmeye\\" (shawm) or for the \\"Krumbhoerner\\" (crumhorns)‚Äîin the latter case also offering the Italian translations storti, and cornamuti torti.Michael Praetorius, Syntagmatis Musici, Tomus Secundus: De Organographia (Wolffenb√ºttel: Elias Holwein, 1619): 3, 40. A more particular term, lituus alpinus, was used in 1555 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner when he published the earliest detailed description of the Alphorn: \\"nearly eleven feet long, made from two pieces of wood slightly curved and hollowed out, fitted together and skillfully bound with osiers\\".\\"longum fer√® ad pedes undecim, duobus lignis modic√® incuruis & excauatis compactum, & uiminibus scit√® obligatum\\" (Conrad Gessner, De raris et admirandis herbis qvae sive qvod noctv luceant, siue alias ob causas, lunariae nominantur, commentariolus : & obiter de alijs etiam rebus qu√¶ in tenebris lucent : inferunter & icones quedam herbarum nove : eivsdem descriptio Montis Fracti, siue Montis Pilati, iuxta Lucernam in Heluetia : his accedvnt Io.

A study made of Swedish dictionaries found that during the seventeenth century lituus was variously translated as sinka (= German Zink, cornett), krumhorn, krum trometa (curved trumpet), claret, or horn.Kenton Terry Meyer, \\"The Crumhorn\\", PhD thesis (Iowa City: University of Iowa, 1981): 20‚Äì21, citing Stig Walin, \\"Musikinstrumenttermer i √§ldre svenska lexikon\\", Svensk tidskrift f√∂r musikforskning 30 (1948): 5‚Äì40; 31 (1949), 5‚Äì82. In the eighteenth century the word once again came to describe contemporary brass instruments, such as in a 1706 inventory from the Ossegg monastery in Bohemia, which equates it with the hunting horn: \\"litui vulgo Waldh√∂rner duo ex tono G\\".James W. McKinnon, \\"Lituus\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001); Sibyl Marcuse, \\"Lituus\\", Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary, corrected edition, The Norton Library N758 (New York: W. W. Norton & Company Inc., 1975. . Nevertheless, in 1732 Johann Gottfried Walther referred back to Renaissance and Medieval definitions, defining lituus as \\"a cornett, formerly it also signified a shawm or, in Italian tubam curvam, a HeerHorn\\".Johann Gottfried Walther, Musicalisches Lexicon Oder Musicalische Bibliothec: Darinnen nicht allein Die Musici, welche so wol in alten als neuern Zeiten, ... durch Theorie und Praxis sich hervor gethan, ... angef√ºhret, Sondern auch Die in Griechischer, Lateinischer, Itali√§nischer und Frantz√∂sischer Sprache gebr√§uchliche Musicalische Kunst- oder sonst dahin geh√∂rige W√∂rter, ... vorgetragen und erkl√§ret (Leipzig: Wolffgang Deer, 1732): 367.

In the second half of the 18th century the lituus was described in one source as a Latin name for the trumpet or horn.Ignaz Franz Xaver K√ºrzinger, Getreuer Unterricht zum Singen mit Manieren, und die Violin zu spielen (Augsburg: Johann Jacob Lotter, 1763): 84. A number of musical compositions from the Baroque era specify an instrument by the Latin name lituus, including Bach's motet O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht (BWV 118), a partita attributed to Jan Josef Ign√°c Brentner, as well as several masses and concertos by Johann Valentin Rathgeber. Scientists from Edinburgh University tried to recreate the lituus used by Bach in May 2009, in the form of a long wooden trumpet, assuming the word does not refer to the horn and the instrument had been out of use for 300 years.Pallab Ghosh, \\"'Lost' Music Instrument Recreated\\", BBC News (30 May 2009; accessed 30 May 2009).

The person's body produces or absorbs more heat than it dissipates. When extreme temperature elevation occurs, it becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death. Almost half a million deaths are recorded every year from hyperthermia. The most common causes include heat stroke and adverse reactions to drugs. Heatstroke is an acute temperature elevation caused by exposure to excessive heat, or combination of heat and humidity, that overwhelms the heat-regulating mechanisms of the body. The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs, particularly those that affect the central nervous system. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare complication of some types of general anesthesia. Hyperthermia differs from fever in that the body's temperature set point remains unchanged. The opposite is hypothermia, which occurs when the temperature drops below that required to maintain normal metabolism. The term is from Greek ·ΩëœÄŒ≠œÅ, hyper, meaning \\"above\\" or \\"over\\", and Œ∏Œ≠œÅŒºŒøœÇ, thermos, meaning \\"hot\\". Classification In humans, hyperthermia is defined as a temperature greater than , depending on the reference used, that occurs without a change in the body's temperature set point. The normal human body temperature can be as high as in the late afternoon. Hyperthermia requires an elevation from the temperature that would otherwise be expected. Such elevations range from mild to extreme; body temperatures above can be life- threatening. Signs and symptoms An early stage of hyperthermia can be \\"heat exhaustion\\" (or \\"heat prostration\\" or \\"heat stress\\"), whose symptoms can include heavy sweating, rapid breathing and a fast, weak pulse. If the condition progresses to heat stroke, then hot, dry skin is typical as blood vessels dilate in an attempt to increase heat loss. An inability to cool the body through perspiration may cause the skin to feel dry. Hyperthermia from neurological disease may include little or no sweating, lack of heart rate change, and confusion or delirium. Other signs and symptoms vary. Accompanying dehydration can produce nausea, vomiting, headaches, and low blood pressure and the latter can lead to fainting or dizziness, especially if the standing position is assumed quickly. In severe heat stroke, they may be confused, hostile, or seemingly intoxicated behavior. Heart rate and respiration rate will increase (tachycardia and tachypnea) as blood pressure drops and the heart attempts to maintain adequate circulation. The decrease in blood pressure can then cause blood vessels to contract reflexively, resulting in a pale or bluish skin color in advanced cases. Young children, in particular, may have seizures. Eventually, organ failure, unconsciousness and death will result. Causes Heat stroke occurs when thermoregulation is overwhelmed by a combination of excessive metabolic production of heat (exertion), excessive environmental heat, and insufficient or impaired heat loss, resulting in an abnormally high body temperature. In severe cases, temperatures can exceed . Heat stroke may be non-exertional (classic) or exertional. =Exertional= Significant physical exertion in hot conditions can generate heat beyond the ability to cool, because, in addition to the heat, humidity of the environment may reduce the efficiency of the body's normal cooling mechanisms. Human heat- loss mechanisms are limited primarily to sweating (which dissipates heat by evaporation, assuming sufficiently low humidity) and vasodilation of skin vessels (which dissipates heat by convection proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings, according to Newton's law of cooling). Other factors, such as insufficient water intake, consuming alcohol, or lack of air conditioning, can worsen the problem. The increase in body temperature that results from a breakdown in thermoregulation affects the body biochemically. Enzymes involved in metabolic pathways within the body such as cellular respiration fail to work effectively at higher temperatures, and further increases can lead them to denature, reducing their ability to catalyse essential chemical reactions. This loss of enzymatic control affects the functioning of major organs with high energy demands such as the heart and brain. =Situational= thumb Situational heat stroke occurs in the absence of exertion. It mostly affects the young and elderly. In the elderly in particular, it can be precipitated by medications that reduce vasodilation and sweating, such as anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, and diuretics. In this situation, the body's tolerance for high environmental temperature may be insufficient, even at rest. Heat waves are often followed by a rise in the death rate, and these 'classical hyperthermia' deaths typically involve the elderly and infirm. This is partly because thermoregulation involves cardiovascular, respiratory and renal systems which may be inadequate for the additional stress because of the existing burden of aging and disease, further compromised by medications. During the July 1995 heatwave in Chicago, there were at least 700 heat-related deaths. The strongest risk factors were being confined to bed, and living alone, while the risk was reduced for those with working air conditioners and those with access to transportation. Even then, reported deaths may be underestimates as diagnosis can be misclassified as stroke or heart attack. =Drugs= Some drugs cause excessive internal heat production. The rate of drug-induced hyperthermia is higher where use of these drugs is higher. * Many psychotropic medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and tricyclic antidepressants, can cause hyperthermia. Serotonin syndrome is a rare adverse reaction to overdose of these medications or the use of several simultaneously. Similarly, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an uncommon reaction to neuroleptic agents. These syndromes are differentiated by other associated symptoms, such as tremor in serotonin syndrome and \\"lead-pipe\\" muscle rigidity in neuroleptic malignant syndrome. * Various stimulant drugs, including amphetamines and cocaine, and hallucinogenic drugs, including PCP, LSD, and MDMA can produce hyperthermia as an adverse effect. * Malignant hyperthermia is a rare reaction to common anesthetic agents (such as halothane) or the paralytic agent succinylcholine. Those who have this reaction, which is potentially fatal, have a genetic predisposition. * The use of anticholinergics, more specifically muscarinic antagonists are thought to cause mild hyperthermic episodes due to its parasympatholytic effects. The sympathetic nervous system, also known as the \\"fight-or-flight response\\", dominates by raising catecholamine levels by the blocked action of the \\"rest and digest system\\". * Drugs that decouple oxidative phosphorylation may also cause hyperthermia. From this group of drugs the most well-known is 2,4-dinitrophenol which was used as a weight loss drug until dangers from its use became apparent. =Personal protective equipment= Those working in industry, in the military, or as first responders may be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) against hazards such as chemical agents, gases, fire, small arms and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). PPE includes a range of hazmat suits, firefighting turnout gear, body armor and bomb suits, among others. Depending on design, the wearer may be encapsulated in a microclimate, due to an increase in thermal resistance and decrease in vapor permeability. As physical work is performed, the body‚Äôs natural thermoregulation (i.e., sweating) becomes ineffective. This is compounded by increased work rates, high ambient temperature and humidity levels, and direct exposure to the sun. The net effect is that desired protection from some environmental threats inadvertently increases the threat of heat stress. The effect of PPE on hyperthermia has been noted in fighting the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic in Western Africa. Doctors and healthcare workers were only able to work for 40 minutes at a time in their protective suits, fearing heat stroke. =Other= Other rare causes of hyperthermia include thyrotoxicosis and an adrenal gland tumor, called pheochromocytoma, both of which can cause increased heat production. Damage to the central nervous system from brain hemorrhage, status epilepticus, and other kinds of injury to the hypothalamus can also cause hyperthermia. Pathophysiology A summary of the differences between hyperthermia, hypothermia, and fever. Hyperthermia: Characterized on the left. Normal body temperature (thermoregulatory set-point) is shown in green, while the hyperthermic temperature is shown in red. As can be seen, hyperthermia can be considered an increase above the thermoregulatory set-point. Hypothermia: Characterized in the center: Normal body temperature is shown in green, while hypothermic temperature is shown in blue. As can be seen, hypothermia can be conceptualized as a decrease below the thermoregulatory set-point. Fever: Characterized on the right: Normal body temperature is shown in green. It reads \\"New Normal\\" because the thermoregulatory set-point has risen. This has caused what was the normal body temperature (in blue) to be considered hypothermic. A fever occurs when the core temperature is set higher, through the action of the pre-optic region of the anterior hypothalamus. For example, in response to a bacterial or viral infection, certain white blood cells within the blood will release pyrogens which have a direct effect on the anterior hypothalamus, causing body temperature to rise, much like raising the temperature setting on a thermostat. In contrast, hyperthermia occurs when the body temperature rises without a change in the heat control centers. Some of the gastrointestinal symptoms of acute exertional heatstroke, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding, may be caused by barrier dysfunction and subsequent endotoxemia. Ultraendurance athletes have been found to have significantly increased plasma endotoxin levels. Endotoxin stimulates many inflammatory cytokines, which in turn may cause multiorgan dysfunction. Experimentally, monkeys treated with oral antibiotics prior to induction of heat stroke do not become endotoxemic.Lambert, Patrick. \\"Role of gastrointestinal permeability in exertional heatstroke\\". Exercise and Sport Science Reviews. 32(4): 185-190. 2004 There is scientific support for the concept of a temperature set point; that is, maintenance of an optimal temperature for the metabolic processes that life depends on. Nervous activity in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamus of the brain triggers heat losing (sweating, etc.) or heat generating (shivering and muscle contraction, etc.) activities through stimulation of the autonomic nervous system. The pre-optic anterior hypothalamus has been shown to contain warm sensitive, cool sensitive, and temperature insensitive neurons, to determine the body's temperature setpoint. As the temperature that these neurons are exposed to rises above , the rate of electrical discharge of the warm-sensitive neurons increases progressively. Cold-sensitive neurons increase their rate of electrical discharge progressively below . Diagnosis Hyperthermia is generally diagnosed by the combination of unexpectedly high body temperature and a history that supports hyperthermia instead of a fever. Most commonly this means that the elevated temperature has occurred in a hot, humid environment (heat stroke) or in someone taking a drug for which hyperthermia is a known side effect (drug-induced hyperthermia). The presence of signs and symptoms related to hyperthermia syndromes, such as extrapyramidal symptoms characteristic of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and the absence of signs and symptoms more commonly related to infection-related fevers, are also considered in making the diagnosis. If fever-reducing drugs lower the body temperature, even if the temperature does not return entirely to normal, then hyperthermia is excluded. Prevention When ambient temperature is excessive, humans and many other animals cool themselves below ambient by evaporative cooling of sweat (or other aqueous liquid; saliva in dogs, for example); this helps prevent potentially fatal hyperthermia. The effectiveness of evaporative cooling depends upon humidity. Wet-bulb temperature, which takes humidity into account, or more complex calculated quantities such as wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), which also takes solar radiation into account, give useful indications of the degree of heat stress and are used by several agencies as the basis for heat-stress prevention guidelines. (Wet-bulb temperature is essentially the lowest skin temperature attainable by evaporative cooling at a given ambient temperature and humidity.) A sustained wet-bulb temperature exceeding is likely to be fatal even to fit and healthy people unclothed in the shade next to a fan; at this temperature, environmental heat gain instead of loss occurs. , wet-bulb temperatures only very rarely exceeded anywhere, although significant global warming may change this. In cases of heat stress caused by physical exertion, hot environments, or protective equipment, prevention or mitigation by frequent rest breaks, careful hydration, and monitoring body temperature should be attempted. However, in situations demanding one is exposed to a hot environment for a prolonged period or must wear protective equipment, a personal cooling system is required as a matter of health and safety. There are a variety of active or passive personal cooling systems; these can be categorized by their power sources and whether they are person- or vehicle-mounted. Because of the broad variety of operating conditions, these devices must meet specific requirements concerning their rate and duration of cooling, their power source, and their adherence to health and safety regulations. Among other criteria are the user's need for physical mobility and autonomy. For example, active-liquid systems operate by chilling water and circulating it through a garment; the skin surface area is thereby cooled through conduction. This type of system has proven successful in certain military, law enforcement, and industrial applications. Bomb-disposal technicians wearing special suits to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs) use a small, ice-based chiller unit that is strapped to one leg; a liquid-circulating garment, usually a vest, is worn over the torso to maintain a safe core body temperature. By contrast, soldiers traveling in combat vehicles can face microclimate temperatures in excess of and require a multiple-user, vehicle-powered cooling system with rapid connection capabilities. Requirements for hazmat teams, the medical community, and workers in heavy industry vary further. Treatment The underlying cause must be removed. Mild hyperthemia caused by exertion on a hot day may be adequately treated through self-care measures, such as increased water consumption and resting in a cool place. Hyperthermia that results from drug exposure requires prompt cessation of that drug, and occasionally the use of other drugs as counter measures. Antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have no role in the treatment of heatstroke because antipyretics interrupt the change in the hypothalamic set point caused by pyrogens; they are not expected to work on a healthy hypothalamus that has been overloaded, as in the case of heatstroke. In this situation, antipyretics actually may be harmful in patients who develop hepatic, hematologic, and renal complications because they may aggravate bleeding tendencies. When body temperature is significantly elevated, mechanical cooling methods are used to remove heat and to restore the body's ability to regulate its own temperatures. Passive cooling techniques, such as resting in a cool, shady area and removing clothing can be applied immediately. Active cooling methods, such as sponging the head, neck, and trunk with cool water, remove heat from the body and thereby speed the body's return to normal temperatures. Drinking water and turning a fan or dehumidifying air conditioning unit on the affected person may improve the effectiveness of the body's evaporative cooling mechanisms (sweating). Sitting in a bathtub of tepid or cool water (immersion method) can remove a significant amount of heat in a relatively short period of time. It was once thought that immersion in very cold water is counterproductive, as it causes vasoconstriction in the skin and thereby prevents heat from escaping the body core. However, a British analysis of various studies stated: \\"this has never been proven experimentally. Indeed, a recent study using normal volunteers has shown that cooling rates were fastest when the coldest water was used.\\" The analysis concluded that iced water immersion is the most-effective cooling technique for exertional heat stroke. No superior cooling method has been found for non-exertional heat stroke. Thus, aggressive ice-water immersion remains the gold standard for life-threatening heat stroke. When the body temperature reaches about , or if the affected person is unconscious or showing signs of confusion, hyperthermia is considered a medical emergency that requires treatment in a proper medical facility. In a hospital, more aggressive cooling measures are available, including intravenous hydration, gastric lavage with iced saline, and even hemodialysis to cool the blood. Epidemiology Hyperthermia affects those who are unable to regulate their body heat, mainly due to environmental conditions. The main risk factor for hyperthermia is the lack of ability to sweat. People who are dehydrated or who are older may not produce the sweat they need to regulate their body temperature. High heat conditions can put certain groups at risk for hyperthermia including: physically active individuals, soldiers, construction workers, landscapers and factory workers. Some people that do not have access to cooler living conditions, like people with lower socioeconomic status, may have a difficult time fighting the heat. People are at risk for hyperthermia during high heat and dry conditions, most commonly seen in the summer. Various cases of different types of hyperthermia have been reported. A research study was published in March of 2019 that looked into multiple case reports of drug induced hyperthermia. The study concluded that psychotropic drugs such as anti-psychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics were associated with an increased heat-related mortality as opposed to the other drugs researched (anticholinergics, diuretics, cardiovascular agents, etc.). A different study was published in June of 2019 that examined the association between hyperthermia in older adults and the temperatures in the United States. Hospitalization records of elderly patients in the US between 1991 and 2006 were analyzed and concluded that cases of hyperthermia were observed to be highest in regions with arid climates. The study discussed finding a disproportionately high number of cases of hyperthermia in early seasonal heat waves indicating that people were not yet practicing proper techniques to stay cool and prevent overheating in the early presence of warm, dry weather. In urban areas people are at an increased susceptibility to hyperthermia. This is due to a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect. Since the 20th century in the United States, the north-central region (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska) was the region with the highest morbidity resulting from hyperthermia. Northeastern states had the next highest. Regions least affected by heat wave-related hyperthermia causing death were Southern and Pacific Coastal states. Northern cities in the United States are at greater risk of hyperthermia during heat waves due to the fact that people tend to have a lower minimum mortality temperature at higher latitudes. In contrast, cities residing in lower latitudes within the continental US typically have higher thresholds for ambient temperatures. In India, hundreds die every year from summer heat waves, including more than 2,500 in the year 2015. Later that same summer, the 2015 Pakistani heat wave killed about 2,000 people. An extreme 2003 European heat wave caused tens of thousands of deaths. Causes of hyperthermia include dehydration, use of certain medications, using cocaine and amphetamines or alcohol abuse. Bodily temperatures greater than 37.5‚Äì38.3¬∞C (99.5-101.0¬∞F) can be diagnosed as a hyperthermic case. As body temperatures increase or excessive body temperatures persist, individuals are at a heightened risk of developing progressive conditions. Greater risk complications of hyperthermia include heat stroke, organ malfunction, organ failure, and death. There are two forms of heat stroke; classical heatstroke and exertional heatstroke. Classical heatstroke occurs from extreme environmental conditions, such as heat waves. Those who are most commonly affected by classical heatstroke are very young, elderly or chronically ill. Exertional heatstroke appears in individuals after vigorous physical activity. Exertional heatstroke is displayed most commonly in healthy 15-50 year old people. Sweating is often present in exertional heatstroke. The associated mortality rate of heatstroke is 40 to 64%.. Research Hyperthermia can also be deliberately induced using drugs or medical devices and is being studied and applied in clinical routine as a treatment of some kinds of cancer.

Many different methods of classifying games exist.  Physical education  There are four basic approaches to classifying the games used in physical education: ;Game categories:This is a classification scheme proposed by Nicols, who classifies games according to three major categories: the game's physical requirements (i.e. what the game requires in addition to the players  equipment, size and nature of playing field, and so forth), the structure of the game (i.e. number of players, groupings of players, strategies, and so forth), and the game's personal requirements (i.e. what the game requires of the player  motor skills, fitness levels, numeracy, social skills, and so forth). ;Games for understanding:This is a classification scheme proposed by Werner and Alomond that classifies games according to their strategies. It divides games into target games (e.g. archery); net or wall games (e.g. tennis); striking and field games (e.g. cricket); and invasion games (e.g. football). ;Core content:This is a classification scheme proposed by Allison and Barrett that categorizes games by their form (i.e. whether they are novel games proposed by the teacher or children, or whether they are existing games already widely played), by the movement skills that they require, by the \\"movement concepts\\" and game tactics that they require, and by the educational results of the game. ;Developmental games:This is a classification scheme proposed by Gallahue and Celand that classifies games into four developmental levels, as part of an overall educational strategy of applying, reinforcing, and implementing movement and sports skills. The levels, in ascending order, are \\"low-level\\", \\"complex\\", \\"lead-up\\", and \\"official sports\\".  Video games  There are several methods of classifying video games. Solomon puts forward a \\"commonsense, but broad\\" classification of video games, into simulations (the game reflects reality), abstract games (the game itself is the focus of interest), and sports. In addition to these he points out that games (in general, not just video games) fall into classes according to numbers of players. Games with two players encompass board games such as chess. Games with multiple players encompass card games such as poker, and marketed family games such as Monopoly and Scrabble. Puzzles and Solitaire are one-player games. He also includes zero-player games, such as Conway's Game of Life, although acknowledging that others argue that such games do not constitute a game, because they lack any element of competition. He asserts that such zero- player games are nonetheless games because they are used recreationally. Another method, developed by Wright, divides games into the following categories: educational or informative, sports, sensorimotor (e.g. action games, video games, fighting and shoot 'em up games, and driving and racing simulators), other vehicular simulators (not covered by driving and racing), strategy games (e.g. adventure games, war games, strategic simulations, role- playing games, and puzzles), and \\"other\\". A third method, developed by Funk and Buchman, and refined by others, classifies electronic games into six categories: general entertainment (no fighting or destruction), educational (learning or problem solving), fantasy violence (cartoon characters that must fight or destroy things, and risk being killed, in order to achieve a goal), human violence (like fantasy violence, but with human rather than cartoon characters), nonviolent sports (no fighting or destruction), and sports violence (fighting or destruction involved).  Classification by causes of uncertainty  Causes of uncertainty in a game Games can be categorized by the source of uncertainty which confront the players: * Chance * Combinatorics (the large number of sequences of moves) * Different states of information among the players (each player knows only his own cards) Based on these three causes three classes of games arise: * Games of chance * Combinatorial games * Games of bluffing and strategy  Game theory  Game theory classifies games according to several criteria: whether a game is a symmetric game or an asymmetric one, what a game's \\"sum\\" is (zero-sum, constant sum, and so forth), whether a game is a sequential game or a simultaneous one, whether a game comprises perfect information or imperfect information, and whether a game is determinate.

It took place on 25 April 1707 between the forces of Philip V of Spain, Bourbon, claimant to the Spanish throne, and his Habsburg rival, Archduke Charles of Austria. The result was a decisive Bourbon victory that reclaimed most of eastern Spain for Philip. The Bourbon army was commanded by the Duke of Berwick, illegitimate son of James II of England, while Habsburg forces were led by Henri de Massue, Earl of Galway, an exiled French Huguenot. This makes it \\"probably the only battle in history in which the English forces were commanded by a Frenchman, the French by an Englishman.\\" Background Campaigning in Spain and size of the armies involved were limited by logistics to a greater extent than Flanders or Italy. Reliance on local sources for forage and other supplies limited operations in arid areas like Northern Spain, while until the advent of railways in the 19th century, goods and supplies were largely transported by water. Control of the seas allowed the Allies to successfully conduct short-term offensives outside the coastal areas but lack of popular support meant they could not hold territory. The Grand Alliance secured an operations base in Lisbon when Peter II of Portugal changed sides in May 1703, and the following March, Archduke Charles arrived to head a land campaign. The Bourbons won a series of minor victories along the Spain/Portugal border, offset by the British capture of Gibraltar; attempts to retake it were defeated at the naval Battle of M√°laga in August 1704, with a land siege being abandoned in April 1705. The 1705 'Pact of Genoa' between Catalan representatives and England opened a second front in the north-east; the Allied capture of Barcelona and Valencia left Toulon as the only major port available to the Bourbons in the Western Mediterranean.Lynn, p.302. Philip's attempt to retake Barcelona in May 1706 failed, while his absence allowed an Allied force to take Madrid and Zaragossa but they could not be resupplied so far from their bases and were forced to withdraw. By November 1706, Philip controlled the Crown of Castile, Murcia and parts of the Kingdom of Valencia. Allied victories at Ramillies in May 1706 and Turin in September forced the French onto the defensive and Galway sought to take advantage by launching a new offensive in 1707. However, the Earl of Peterborough, Allied commander in Spain, ordered his forces in Catalonia to consolidate their position, rather than combine; when Berwick began his advance on the city of Valencia, Galway moved to intercept him but was badly outnumbered. The battle The Bourbon army of about 25,000 contained roughly equal numbers of Spanish and French troops, as well as an Irish regiment. The bulk of Galway's army of about 16,000 were Portuguese or British with Dutch, German, and French Huguenot elements. The Allies broke camp early on 25 April and after a long and tiring march reached the town of Almansa. Berwick had drawn up his army in two lines, just in front of the town, his infantry in the centre and the French and Spanish cavalry on the wings. Although Galway was clearly outnumbered, he commenced his attack in mid-afternoon after a short artillery exchange. His infantry successfully drove back the Bourbon centre but a gap opened between them and Portuguese troops on the right, under the 80-year-old Marquess of Minas. Seeing this, the Franco-Spanish cavalry attacked; Berwick's account states the Portuguese fought bravely for some time but eventually collapsed and fled. Their retreat was covered by a few squadrons under Das Minas' personal command, including his mistress, who fought dressed as a man and was killed. The Allied centre was now attacked on three sides; using his remaining cavalry, Galway successfully withdrew some of his troops but 13 battalions lost contact with the rest of the army. Pursued by the Spanish cavalry, they took up a defensive position some 8 miles (12 km) from the battlefield but surrendered the next morning; two days later, Berwick invited the captured officers to a banquet. Generally accepted figures put Franco-Spanish losses at around 3,000 killed, with the same number wounded, while the Allies suffered 4,000 casualties and 5,000 prisoners. Peninsular Spain, showing Crowns of Castile and Aragon. Aftermath Victory cemented the Bourbon position in Spain and gave them control of North-East Spain; by the end of 1707, the Allies were once again restricted to Catalonia and the Balearic Islands. As a result, Almansa has been described as \\"the single most important battle fought in Spain\\".Lynn, p.316. The Bourbon army followed this up by besieging X√†tiva; when it surrendered in June, much of the town was destroyed and the name changed to 'San Felipe.' In memory of these events, a portrait of the monarch still hangs upside down in the local museum. Legacy Berwick's tactics at Almansa were admired by many, including Frederick the Great who described it as the most impressive battle of the century. In addition, there is a Museo Batalla de Almansa on the site which includes a regular Battle of Almansa reenactment. The defeat and its consequences for the autonomy of the Kingdom of Valencia and Catalonia gave rise to two modern proverbs; \\"De ponent, ni vent ni gent,\\" ('From the west, neither wind nor people') and Quan el mal ve d'Almansa, a tots alcan√ßa, ('Bad news from Almansa reaches everybody').

The structure is the lodge, and the ceremony performed within the structure may be called a purification ceremony or simply a sweat. Traditionally the structure is simple, constructed of saplings covered with blankets and sometimes animal skins. Originally, it was only used by some of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, notably the Plains Indians, but with the rise of pan-Indianism, numerous nations that did not originally have the sweat lodge ceremony have adopted it. This has been controversial. In all cases, the sweat is intended as a religious ceremony ‚Äì it is for prayer and healing, and the ceremony is only to be led by elders who know the associated language, songs, traditions, and safety protocols. Otherwise, the ceremony can be dangerous if performed improperly. Sweat lodges have also been imitated by some non-natives in North America and internationally, resulting in responses like the Lakota Declaration of War and similar statements from Indigenous Elders declaring that these imitations are dangerous and disrespectful misappropriations and need to stop.Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (June 10, 1993) \\"Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality.\\" \\"At the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a \\"Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality.\\" The following declaration was unanimously passed.\\"Taliman, Valerie (1993) \\"Article On The 'Lakota Declaration of War'.\\"Yellowtail, Tom, et al; \\"Resolution of the 5th Annual Meeting of the Traditional Elders Circle\\" Northern Cheyenne Nation, Two Moons' Camp, Rosebud Creek, Montana; October 5, 1980. Inter-tribal council of Navajo, Hopi, Muskogee, Chippewa-Cree, Northern Cheyenne, Haudenosaunee and Lakota Elders: \\"Therefore, be warned that these individuals are moving about playing upon the spiritual needs and ignorance of our non-Indian brothers and sisters. The value of these instructions and ceremonies are questionable, maybe meaningless, and hurtful to the individual carrying false messages.\\"  Traditions  Hupa Indian underground building covered with wood plank roof and surrounded by a wall of large rocks Native Americans in many regions have sweat lodge ceremonies. For example, Chumash peoples of the central coast of California build sweat lodges in coastal areas in association with habitation sites. The ancient Mesoamerican tribes of Mexico, such as the Aztec and Olmec, practiced a sweat bath ceremony known as temazcal as a religious rite of penance and purification. Traditions associated with sweating vary regionally and culturally. Ceremonies often include traditional prayers and songs. In some cultures drumming and offerings to the spirit world may be part of the ceremony, or a sweat lodge ceremony may be a part of another, longer ceremony such as a Sun Dance. Some common practices and key elements associated with sweat lodges include: * Training ‚Äì Indigenous cultures with sweatlodge traditions require that someone go through intensive training for many years to be allowed to lead a lodge. One of the requirements is that the leader be able to pray and communicate fluently in the indigenous language of that culture, and that they understand how to conduct the ceremony safely. This leadership role is granted by the Elders of the community, not self- designated. This leadership is only entrusted to those who are full members of the community, and who live in community. It is never given to outsiders who then leave to sell ceremony. * Orientation ‚Äì The door may face a sacred fire. The cardinal directions may have symbolism in the culture that is holding the sweating ceremony. The lodge may be oriented within its environment for a specific purpose. Placement and orientation of the lodge within its environment are often considered to facilitate the ceremony's connection with the spirit world, as well as practical considerations of usage. * Construction ‚Äì The lodge is generally built with great care and knowledge, and with respect for the environment and for the materials being used. * Clothing ‚Äì In Native American lodges participants usually wear a simple garment such as shorts or a loose dress. Modesty is important, rather than display.  Risks  = Physical effects = Even people who are experienced with sweats, and attending a ceremony led by a properly trained and authorized traditional Native American ceremonial leader, could suddenly experience problems due to underlying health issues. It is recommended by Lakota spiritual leaders that people only attend lodges with authorized, traditional spiritual leaders. There have been reports of lodge-related deaths resulting from overexposure to heat, dehydration, smoke inhalation, or improper lodge construction leading to suffocation. If rocks are used, it is important not to use river rocks, or other kinds of rocks with air pockets inside them. Rocks must be completely dry before heating. Rocks with air pockets or excessive moisture could crack and possibly explode in the fire or when hit by water. Previously used rocks may absorb humidity or moisture leading to cracks or shattering. = Deaths = The following is a list of reported deaths related to non-traditional \\"New Age\\" sweat rituals: * Gordon Reynolds, 43 (died November 21, 1996) * Kirsten Babcock, 34 (died 2002) * David Thomas Hawker, 36 (died 2002) * Rowen Cooke, 37 (died 2004) * Paige Martin, 57 (died July 17, 2009) * Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, NY (died October 9, 2009)Arizona sweat lodge sentencing, CNN * Lizbeth Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, MN (died October 17, 2009) * James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, WI (died October 9, 2009) = Sedona deaths and Lakota Nation lawsuit = In October 2009, during a New Age retreat organized by James Arthur Ray, three people died and 21 more became ill while attending an overcrowded and improperly set up sweat lodge containing some 60 people and located near Sedona, Arizona. Ray was arrested by the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office in connection with the deaths on February 3, 2010, and bond was set at $5 million. In response to these deaths, Lakota spiritual leader Arvol Looking Horse issued a statement reading in part: On November 2, 2009, the Lakota Nation filed a lawsuit against the United States, Arizona State, James Arthur Ray, and Angel Valley Retreat Center site owners, to have Ray and the site owners arrested and punished under the Sioux Treaty of 1868 between the United States and the Lakota Nation.Rehfeld, Nina.\\"Lakota Nation files lawsuit against parties in sweat lodge incident\\" , sedona.biz, 12 November 2009. That treaty states that ‚Äúif bad men among the whites or other people subject to the authority of the United States shall commit any wrong upon the person or the property of the Indians, the United States will (...) proceed at once to cause the offender to be arrested and punished according to the laws of the United States, and also reimburse the injured person for the loss sustained.‚Äù The Lakota Nation holds that James Arthur Ray and the Angel Valley Retreat Center have ‚Äúviolated the peace between the United States and the Lakota Nation‚Äù and have caused the ‚Äúdesecration of our Sacred Oinikiga (purification ceremony) by causing the death of Liz Neuman, Kirby Brown and James Shore‚Äù. As well, the Lakota claim that James Arthur Ray and the Angel Valley Retreat Center fraudulently impersonated Indians and must be held responsible for causing the deaths and injuries, and for evidence destruction through dismantling of the sweat lodge. The lawsuit seeks to have the treaty enforced and does not seek monetary compensation. Preceding the lawsuit, Native American experts on sweat lodges criticized the reported construction and conduct of the lodge as not meeting traditional ways (\\"bastardized\\", \\"mocked\\" and \\"desecrated\\"). Indian leaders expressed concerns and prayers for the dead and injured. The leaders said the ceremony is their way of life and not a religion, as white men see it. It is Native American property protected by U.S. law and United Nations declaration. The ceremony should only be in sanctioned lodge carriers' hands from legitimate nations. Traditionally, a typical leader has 4 to 8 years of apprenticeship before being allowed to care for people in a lodge, and have been officially named as ceremonial leaders before the community. Participants are instructed to call out whenever they feel uncomfortable, and the ceremony is usually stopped to help them. The lodge was said to be unusually built from non-breathable materials. Charging for the ceremony was said to be inappropriate. The number of participants was criticized as too high and the ceremony length was said to be too long. Respect to elders' oversight was said to be important for avoiding unfortunate events. The tragedy was characterized as \\"plain carelessness\\", with a disregard for the participants' safety and outright negligence. The Native American community actively seeks to prevent abuses of their traditions. Organizers have been discussing ways to formalize guidance and oversight to authentic or independent lodge leaders.  Similar structures and rites in other cultures  There are examples of ritual sweating in other cultures, though often without any ceremonial or mystical significance. Secular uses around the world include many forms of Ancient Roman baths, steambath, sauna, Russian banya, and the Islamic variants called haman or Turkish bath in English. Other varieties are used by indigenous people around the Bering Strait, ancient Greeks, the northern Finns and Laplanders. Some European cultures have historically used sweating for cleansing. In most cases the usage is primarily for physical cleansing and warmth, but in others prayer and songs may be involved. Scandinavian, Baltic and Eastern European cultures incorporate sweat baths in their sauna traditions, which are held within a permanent, wooden hut. While modern-day saunas are wholly secular, there are older traditions of songs and rituals in the sauna, and the acknowledgement of a spirit-being who lives in the sauna. \\"Vapour baths were in use among the Celtic tribes, and the sweat-house was in general use in Ireland down to the 18th, and even survived into the 19th century. It was of beehive shape and was covered with clay. It was especially resorted to as a cure for rheumatism.\\" These permanent structures were built of stone, and square or corbelled \\"beehive\\" versions are often found, mostly in the Irish and Gaelic-speaking areas of Ireland and Scotland, though most seem of relatively recent date. The method of construction, heating the structure, and usage was different from the North American examples, and they seem to have been regarded as therapeutic in function, like the sauna, and perhaps typically used by one person at a time, given their small size.See, for example, \\"Sweat House, Co.

Popular poker variants The three most popular poker variants are spread in casinos and poker rooms worldwide and can be divided into the following groups: * Draw poker: Games in which players are dealt a complete hand, hidden, and then improve it by replacing cards. The most common of these is five-card draw. * Stud poker: Games in which each player receives a combination of face-up cards and face-down cards in multiple betting rounds. The most common of these are five-card stud and seven-card stud. These two variants are further played in other different formats. * Community card poker: Games in which each player's incomplete hidden hand is combined with shared face-up cards. The most common of these are Texas hold 'em and Omaha hold 'em. Here are more common rule variations: #Lowball: The lowest hand wins the pot. There are different rules about whether or not aces count as low, and the effects of straights and flushes. The most common variants are Razz and 2-7 Triple Draw #High-low split: the highest and lowest hands split the pot. Generally there is a qualifier for the low hand. For example, the low hand must have 5 cards with ranks of 8 or less. In most high-low games the usual rank of poker hands is observed, so that an unsuited broken straight (7-5-4-3-2) wins low (see Morehead, Official Rules of Card Games). In a variant, based on Lowball, where only the low hand wins, a straight or a flush does not matter for a low hand. So the best low hand is 5-4-3-2-A, suited or not. #Players can pass cards to each other. An example of this would be Anaconda. #Kill game: When a fixed limit game is played and a player wins two pots in a row, the stakes are doubled. In some split-pot games, a player winning both halves of the pot may also cause a kill. In some variants of Lowball, a player may choose to kill by placing a double bet after seeing his first two cards. #Wild cards are added. This can range from simply making deuces wild to the 7-card stud variant named baseball. #A twist round in which players can buy another card from the deck. If a player does not like the purchased card, the player can purchase another one by adding money to the pot. This is sometimes called a \\"tittle.\\" #A stripped deck may be used. Poker was first played with only 20 cards. In the spirit of poker history, players will sometimes only play with a stripped deck. A popular poker game in Spain is played with cards 8-A. It is played similar to hold'em, except that one card is dealt at a time and a player must use both hole cards. #Roll your own is played in stud games, and allows the player to determine which of his or her cards are turned up and visible to the other players. In a game like Seven-card Stud, the \\"roll\\" action only applies to the first 3 cards, all of which are dealt face down. Each player then determines which card to expose. Play then continues as with regular Seven- card Stud. But a game like Mexican stud applies the roll option throughout the game. Two cards are dealt face down, and the players roll one card up. The game continues just as in Five-card Stud, except the cards are dealt face down, and each player then decides which of the two down cards is exposed.Pagat.com: Roll Your Own =Mixed poker games= Poker can be played in a mixed game format, for example one half-hour of Texas hold 'em followed by one half-hour of Seven-card stud. There are many types of mixed poker games. The most notable mixed poker variation is H.O.R.S.E. poker. H.O.R.S.E. is a mix of Texas hold 'em, Omaha high-low, Razz, Seven-card stud and Seven- card stud Eight-or-better. Each game will usually be played for a fixed number of hands or time and then the players will move on to the next game. Other mixed games include: *H.O.S.E. ‚Äì same as H.O.R.S.E., except without Razz. *H.O.E. ‚Äì same as H.O.R.S.E, except no Razz or Seven-card stud. *H.O. ‚Äì Texas hold 'em and Omaha high-low *O.E. ‚Äì Omaha high-low and Seven-card Stud Eight or better. *H.A. ‚Äì Pot limit Texas hold 'em and pot limit Omaha. *Omaha High- low Mixed ‚Äì Fixed limit Omaha and pot limit Omaha high-low *Holdem Mixed ‚Äì Fixed limit and no limit Texas hold 'em. *Eight Game Mix ‚Äì Fixed limit 2-7 Triple Draw, fixed limit Texas hold 'em, fixed limit Omaha Hi-Low Eight or better, Razz, fixed limit Seven-card stud, fixed limit Seven-card stud Hi-Low eight or better, no limit Texas hold 'em and pot limit Omaha. *Ten Game Mix (introduced at 2011 World Series of Poker) ‚Äì No limit Hold'em, fixed limit Seven-card Razz, fixed limit Hold'em, fixed limit Badugi, fixed limit Seven- card Stud, no limit 2-7 Single Draw, fixed limit Omaha Hi-Low eight or better, pot limit Omaha, fixed limit 2-7 Triple Draw and fixed limit Seven-card stud Hi-Low eight or better (played with 6 players on a table). Specific poker variant games Some poker games don't fit neatly into the above categories, and some have features of more than one of these categories. These variants are most often played in home games, usually as part of a dealer's choice format. =High Chicago or Low Chicago= Either of these two versions can be played in any stud high game. In High Chicago, or sometimes simply called Chicago, the player with the highest spade face down (referred to as in the hole) receives half the pot. In Low Chicago, the player with the lowest spade in the hole receives half of the pot, with the A‚ô† being the lowest. If the player with the highest hand also has the highest/lowest spade in the hole, then that player receives the entire pot - having won both sides of the bet. =Follow the Queen= This 7-card stud game uses a wild-card designated as whichever card is immediately dealt (exposed, or face-up) after any queen previously dealt (exposed). In the event that the final card dealt (exposed) is itself a queen, then all queens are wild. If no queens are dealt (exposed), then there are no wilds for that hand. Betting is the same as in normal 7-card stud games. Follow the Queen is a typical game variant in Dealer's Choice poker games.Pokernews.com: Fun Home Poker Game Rules - Follow the QueenPokerrules.net: How to Play Follow the Queen =Countdown= In this 5-card game, the dealer gives each player 5 cards face down. After the first round of betting, each player may choose to replace zero to three cards. A second round of betting follows and then players may opt to replace zero to two cards. Upon completing another round of betting, each player may replace one card of the cards in their hand. After a final round of betting, any remaining players show their hands, and the highest 5 card hand wins. The cost of cards doubles each round. For example, if the dealer says each replacement card costs $10 in the first round, then each card costs $20 in the second round, and $40 in the final round. When players purchase cards to replace ones in their hand, they put the cost of the cards in the pot.Pokerrules.net: How to Play Countdown Poker This game will only work with 4 players (or fewer) otherwise you will run out of cards. =Billabong and Shanghai= Just as Oxford stud is a mixed stud/community card version of Texas hold 'em, Billabong is a mixed version of Manila. Each player is dealt two down-cards and one up-card. Low up-card starts the betting with a Bring-in if you are playing with one, otherwise high card starts the betting. Next, two community cards are dealt, followed by a second betting round, beginning with the player with the best exposed partial poker hand (counting the community cards, as in Oxford stud). Then a third community card is dealt, followed by a third betting round. Finally a fourth community card is dealt, followed by a fourth betting round and showdown. Each player plays the best five-card hand he can make from the three in his hand plus the four on the board in any combination. Shanghai is the same game with an extra hole card, but no more than two hole cards play. That is, the game begins with each player being dealt three down- cards and one up-card; each player must discard one of his hole cards at some point during the game as determined ahead of time. The most common variation is to discard immediately as in Pineapple; the second most common is to discard just before showdown as in Tahoe. = Guts = Guts is a family of games that are cousins of poker rather than poker variants. They usually involve hands of 3 or fewer cards, ranked similarly to hands in poker, and multiple successive rounds of betting each of which consist of the decision to be \\"in\\" or \\"out\\", and each with its own showdown. The losers of rounds of guts generally match or double the pot, which grows rapidly. = Five-O poker = Five-O Poker is a heads-up poker variant in which both players must play five hands of five cards simultaneously. Four of the five cards in each hand are face-up. Once all five hands are down, there is a single round of betting. The winner is determined by matching each hand to the corresponding hand of the opponent. The player with the stronger poker hand in three (or more) out of the five columns, wins, unless a player folds on a bet that was made. If a player beats their opponent with all five hands, this is called a ‚ÄúFive-O‚Äù win. =Chinese poker= Chinese poker is a 2-4 player poker game with thirteen cards. The idea is to make three poker hands with increasing rank : two with five cards and one with three cards. If one of the hands does not adhere to increasing rank (i.e. is mis-set), the hand is declared dead and results in some sort of penalty. =Kuhn poker= Kuhn poker, using a three card deck, is more of game theory problem than an actual game people play, but it can be played by two players.

It is still a popular game in parts of the world, especially in Finland where a specific variant of five-card stud called S√∂k√∂ (also known as Canadian stud or Scandinavian stud) is played.Soko: Poker game review The word s√∂k√∂ is also used for checking in Finland (\\"I check\\" = \\"min√§ s√∂k√∂t√§n\\"). The description below assumes that one is familiar with the general game play of poker, and with hand values (both high and low variations). The description also makes no assumptions about what betting structure is used. Five-card stud is sometimes played no limit and pot limit, though fixed limit and spread limit games are common (with higher limits in the later betting rounds). It is typical to use a small ante and a bring-in. Description of play Play begins with each player being dealt one card face down, followed by one card face up (beginning, as usual, with the player to the dealer's left). If played with a bring-in, the player with the lowest-ranking upcard must pay the bring in, and betting proceeds after that. If two players have equally ranked low cards, suit rankings may be used to break the tie. If there is no bring-in, then the first betting round begins with the player showing the highest-ranking upcard, who may check. In this case, suit should not be used to break ties; if two players have the same high upcard, the one first in clockwise rotation from the dealer acts first. After the first betting round is complete, another face-up card is dealt to each player (after a burn card, starting with the player to the dealer's left, as with all subsequent rounds). Betting now begins with the player whose upcards make the best poker hand (since fewer than five cards are face up, this means no straights, flushes, or full houses). On this and subsequent betting rounds, the player to act first may check or bet up to the game's limit. The second betting round is followed by a third upcard to each player and a third betting round, again starting with the player with the best poker hand showing (thus, the first player to act on each round may change). A fourth face-up card and fourth betting round is followed by a showdown, if necessary (it usually won't be ‚Äì most deals of five-card stud end early when a player bets and gets no calls). =Example= Assume that a game is being played by four players: Alice, who is dealing; Bob, who is sitting to her left; Carol to his left; David to Carol's left. Alice deals one card face down to each player, followed by one card face up to each player, beginning with Bob and ending with herself. Bob is dealt the ', Carol the ', David the ', and Alice the '. Because they had earlier agreed to play with a $1 bring-in, David is required to start the betting with a $1 bring-in (his ' is lower than Bob's ' by suit). He has the option to open the betting for more, but he chooses to bet only the required $1. The bring-in sets the current bet amount to $1, so Alice cannot check. She decides to call. Bob folds, indicating this by turning his upcard face down and discarding his cards. Carol raises to $3. David folds (forfeiting his bring-in), and Alice calls. Third street Alice now deals a second face-up card to each remaining player: Carol is dealt the ', and Alice the '. Alice's two face-up cards make a poker hand of no pair, Q-9 high, and Carol has Q-J high, so it is Carol's turn to bet. She checks, as does Alice, ending the betting round. Fourth street Another face up card is dealt: Carol gets the ', and Alice gets the '. Alice now has a pair of queens showing, and Carol still has no pair, so Alice bets first. She bets $5, and Carol calls. Fifth Street The final card is dealt face up: Carol gets the ' and Alice gets the '. Carol still only has no pair showing, thus resulting in Alice, with her pair of queens showing, set to start the betting. Alice bets $5 and is raised to $10 by Carol. Alice calls and the two must now enter into a showdown - where both players compare their best five-card poker hand. Since Carol was the last player to take aggressive action, she shows first - flipping over her hole card, the ' - thus giving her a pair of aces. Since she is the last to act, Alice is allowed to muck her cards and does so. Therefore, the pot of $37 goes to Carol. Popularity Since its popularity during the American Civil War, five-card stud has seen a gradual decline in its popularity. Despite this drop in status, it is still enjoyed by many players. =Major tournaments= Five-card stud was one of the preliminary events in the World Series of Poker in 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1974. All four of these events were won by Bill Boyd (he won a total of $80,000 from these four events) ‚Äì the only WSOP bracelets he won.Hendon Mob Database: Bill Boyd Due to the declining popularity of five- card stud, it was left out of the 1975 World Series of Poker and has been absent from all subsequent World Series of Poker schedules. Although five-card stud has not been featured in major tournaments since the 70s, it was occasionally still offered in the 1990s in both EuropeHendon Mob Database: $500 Five card stud - Ottoman Championship Event and North America.Hendon Mob Database: 1992 L.A. Poker Classic Schedule =Cash games= Five-card stud was limited to small home games and small casino games until becoming available at some online poker cardrooms.Paradise Poker: 5 card stud poker Variants Traditional five-card stud involves one hole card with four cards face-up, making it simple for even a novice to read the possible hand strength of an opponent effectively. The transparency of a player's hand cuts out much of the element of uncertainty found in more popular games like Texas hold 'em, Omaha hold 'em and Seven-card stud. In order to enlarge that element of uncertainty variants increase the number of hole cards, add a high-low split, play with a stripped deck, introduce a twist round, enable the player to do a 'roll your own' game or even create new and interesting hand rankings. =High-Low= The game can be played with low hand values, in which case the best low hand showing starts each betting round instead of the best high hand showing. Also, the highest-ranking card must pay the bring-in if it is played with a bring-in. At the end of all betting rounds, the total pot is split into two - one for low-ranking hands, the other for high-ranking hands - and the hands are evaluated based on both low-ranking criteria (for the low pot) and high-ranking criteria (for the high pot). When playing High-Low it is common to use the Ace-to-five low hand ranking to evaluate the low hands and use the standard hand ranking when evaluating high hands. In the United Kingdom, however, the use of Ace-to-six low hand ranking is common when evaluating low hands.Chilcoot's Poker Page: Five Card Stud =Canadian Stud/Scandinavian Stud/S√∂k√∂= This variant of five-card stud is almost identical to the traditional format - the only difference being the introduction of two new hands into the hand ranking. Due to the sparse nature of flushes and straights in five-card stud, this variant counts four-card straights and four-card flushes as poker hands. A four-card straight is ranked higher than a pair, a four-card flush is ranked higher than a four-card straight, and a two-pair is ranked higher than a four-card flush. =Two Down, Three up/2-3= Instead of dealing the players one hole card and one upcard, in this variant the players are dealt two hole cards. All subsequent cards are dealt face up, resulting in the fairly self-explanatory name.Poker.com: Basic Five Card Stud =Three Down, Two Up/3-2= Instead of dealing the players one hole card and one upcard, in this variant players are dealt three cards face down. The next two cards are dealt face up. As a result of the high number of cards dealt initially, this variant only has 3 rounds of betting and is thus best played with no limit or pot limit betting structure. The name is again fairly self- explanatory. =One Down, Three Up, One Down/1-3-1= This variant differs from traditional five-card stud only in the way the final card is dealt. Rather than being face up, in this variant the river is dealt face down‚Äîas a hole card. The name, yet again, derives from how a hand looks after all betting rounds are done. This is also a common variant in Finland, where the action of players looking to their hole river card secretly from the others is called \\"pihist√§minen\\", (Engl. \\"petty theft\\"). =Mexican stud/Stud Loco/Mexican poker= Mexican stud is a roll your own game where the player receives five face down cards, and has to reveal four of them. The player is dealt two cards (as in traditional five-card stud), and that he/she must expose one of them. The player then receives a third card, and must immediately expose another card in his/her hand. The player exposes another one after receiving a fourth card, and again after a fifth card. Sometimes a stripped deck is used. Mexican stud is also a variant of Seven-card stud, employing the same roll your own rules. Shifting sands This game's only difference in relation to Mexican stud is that the player's hole card, and all cards of that rank, are considered wild cards for that player only. =Telesina/Teresina= Telesina,Rules of Telesina with origins in Sanremo, is often described as a variant of five-card stud. The initial four rounds are identical to five-card stud, the players receiving two cards (one face down) and then 3 more face-up cards interspersed with betting rounds. However, a final round is added where all the players are dealt a single community card. The other main difference is the use of a stripped deck - with all cards of rank 2 to 6 inclusive taken out of the deck. As a result, this variant is often played shorthanded - usually with 6 players per table. As with most stripped deck games, in Telesina flushes are ranked above full-houses.Telesina Review :: Poker - by Reviewed Online PokerCompatible Poker: Telesina Rules - 5-Stud Variation In addition, unlike in traditional poker, suits are used to break ties. If players have an identical straight flush or straight, the high suit wins. If both players have the same pair or two pair, the suit of the highest kicker determines the winner. The order of suits, strongest to weakest, is hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades.Poker Rules - Rules of Telesina Another unique rule states if two players have a flush the highest ranking card is not used to determine a winner; instead, the Telesina suit order is used to resolve the situation. The final Telesina-specific rule states if there are only two players left in the pot, the highest straight flush (A, K, Q, J, T in hearts) is beaten by the lowest straight flush (T, 9, 8, 7, A in spades).Telesina Hand Ranking Note that these rules are as the game has been played on several online poker sites, but Telesina may generically refer to any stripped deck five-card stud variation.Rules of Card Games: Telesina =Asian five-card stud / Americana= Regular five-card stud played with a stripped deck - with all cards of rank 2 to 6 inclusive removed from the deck.Pokernews.com: Definition of Asian five-card stud This variant has been played in a tournament format in California.PokerPages: 1992 LA Poker Classic Called Americana, the game has been available on online poker sites.Americana Poker Rules ‚Äì Poker Rooms with Americana As with other stripped deck games, a flush is ranked higher than a full house. This is different from the game Asian stud which is played against the house.

Until the recent increase in popularity of Texas hold 'em, seven-card stud was the most widely played poker variant in home games across the United States, and in casinos in the eastern part of the country. Two to eight players is common, though eight may require special rules for the last cards dealt if no players fold. With experienced players who fold often, even playing with nine players is possible. In casino play, it is common to use a small ante and bring-in. In home games, it is typical to use an ante only. Seven-card stud is the \\"S\\" game in HORSE and similar mixed game formats.  Rules  The game begins with each player being dealt two cards face down and one card face up. The player with the lowest-ranking upcard pays the bring-in, and betting proceeds after that in normal clockwise order. The bring-in is considered an open, so the next player in turn may not check. If two players have equally ranked low cards, suit may be used to break the tie and assign the bring-in (see high card by suit). If there is no bring-in, then the first betting round begins with the player showing the highest-ranking upcard, who may check. In this case, suit is not used to break ties. If two players have the same high upcard, the one first in clockwise rotation from the dealer acts first. After the first betting round, another upcard is dealt to each player (after a burn card, and starting at the dealer's left as will all subsequent rounds), followed by a second betting round beginning with the player whose upcards make the best poker hand. Since fewer than five cards are face up, this means no straights, flushes, or full houses will count for this purpose. On this and all subsequent betting rounds, the player whose face-up cards make the best poker hand will act first, and may check or bet up to the game's limit. The second round is followed by a third upcard and betting round, a fourth upcard and betting round, and finally a downcard, a fifth betting round, and showdown if necessary. Seven-card stud can be summarized therefore as \\"two down, four up, one down\\". Upon showdown, each player makes the best five-card poker hand they can out of the seven cards they were dealt. Seven cards to eight players plus four burn cards makes 60 cards, and there are only 52 in the deck. In most games this is not a problem because several players will have folded in early betting rounds. If the deck does become exhausted during play, previously-dealt burn cards can be used when only a few cards are needed to complete the deal. If even those are not sufficient, then on the final round instead of dealing a downcard to each player, a single community card is dealt to the center of the table, and is shared by everyone. Discarded cards from a folded hand are not reused. Unlike draw poker, where no cards are ever seen before showdown, stud poker players use the information they get from face-up cards to make strategic decisions, and so a player who sees a certain card folded is able to make decisions knowing that the card will never appear in another opponent's hand. Variants There are several variations of 7 Card Stud Poker in which each player is dealt a set number of cards. Not all of these variations can be found at poker rooms but they can be fun to play at home. # \\"Down the River\\" is the basic variation of 7 Card Stud Poker and this is the game played in poker rooms. # \\"Mississippi\\" removes the betting round between fourth and fifth streets, making only four betting rounds. This game also deals the fourth and fifth cards face up. This makes the game more closely resemble Texas Hold'em by having the same betting structure and the same number of down and up cards. # Another is \\"roll your own\\", in which four rounds of two cards each are dealt down, and each player must \\"roll\\" one card to face up, followed by a round of betting. Except for the first round, the card rolled may or may not be from the round just dealt. # \\"Queens and after\\": in this variant, all Queens are wild, and so is whatever card that is dealt face up that follows the Queen. All cards of that kind are now wild, both showing and in the hole. The fun part is that if another Queen is dealt face-up, the wild card will change to whatever follows this Queen. The former card is no longer wild. # \\"Baseball\\": in this variant 3s and 9s are wild, and a 4 dealt face up gets an extra card. # \\"Low Chicago\\": Low spade in the hole gets half the pot. Similarly, \\"High Chicago\\" means high spade instead of low. Just \\"Chicago\\" can mean either. # \\"Acey Ducey\\": aces and twos are wild. # One-eyed Jacks or Suicide King can be specified as wild. # Razz is a lowball form of Seven Card Stud, with the objective being to get the lowest hand possible. # In the variation called \\"Seven-Card Stud High-Low\\", the pot is split between the holder of the highest and lowest hand if the low hand is topped by at least an 8. Alternative names to this variation are Seven Card Stud/8 and Seven Card Stud Split.https://www.fulltilt.com/poker/games/stud/high-low/?no_redirect=1 Sample deal The sample deal below assumes that a game is being played by four players: Alice, who is dealing in the examples; Bob, who is sitting to her left; Carol to his left; and David to Carol's left. All players ante 25¬¢. Alice deals each player two downcards and one upcard, beginning with Bob and ending with herself. Bob is dealt the 4‚ô†, Carol the K‚ô¶, David the 4‚ô¶, and Alice the 9‚ô£. Because they are playing with a $1 bring-in, David is required to start the betting with a $1 bring-in (his 4‚ô¶ is lower than Bob's 4‚ô† by suit). He had the option to open the betting for more, but he chose to bet only the required $1. The bring-in sets the current bet amount to $1, so Alice cannot check. She decides to call. Bob folds, indicating this by turning his upcard face down and discarding his cards. Carol raises to $3. David folds, and Alice calls. Alice now deals a second face-up card to each remaining player: Carol is dealt the J‚ô£, and Alice the K‚ô•. Alice's two upcards make a poker hand of no pair, K-9-high, and Carol has K-J-high, so it is Carol's turn to bet. She checks, as does Alice, ending the betting round. Another face up card is dealt: Carol gets the 10‚ô• and Alice gets the K‚ô£. Alice now has a pair of kings showing, and Carol still has no pair, so Alice bets first. She bets $5, and Carol calls. On the next round, Carol receives the 10‚ô¶, making her upcards K-J-10-10. Alice receives the 3‚ô†. Alice's upcards are 9-K-K-3; the pair of kings is still higher than Carol's pair of tens, so she bets $5 and Carol calls. Each player now receives a downcard. It is still Alice's turn to bet because the downcard did not change either hand. She checks, Carol bets $10, and Alice calls. That closes the last betting round, and both players remain, so there is a showdown. Since Alice called Carol's bet, Carol shows her cards first: Q‚ô† 2‚ô• K‚ô¶ J‚ô£ 10‚ô• 10‚ô¶ A‚ô¶. She can play A-K-Q-J-10, making an ace-high straight. Alice shows (or, seeing she cannot beat Carol's straight, mucks her cards): 9‚ô• 5‚ô¶ 9‚ô£ K‚ô• K‚ô£ 3‚ô† 5‚ô†. The best five-card poker hand she can play is K-K-9-9-5, making two pair, kings and nines. Carol wins the pot. In Popular Culture The game is played in Season Two, Episode 6 of The Sopranos, where Frank Sinatra Jr. guest starred as one of the players, said to be a friend of one of Tony Soprano's uncles. In the Tennessee Williams play A Streetcar Named Desire Stanley Kowalski and his friends play seven-card stud throughout. The last line of the play is \\"This game is seven-card stud.\\" References Category:Stud poker ","title":"Seven-card stud"},{"id":"75696","text":"In law and in religion, testimony is a solemn attestation as to the truth of a matter. Etymology The words \\"testimony\\" and \\"testify\\" both derive from the Latin word testis, referring to the notion of a disinterested third-party witness. Law In the law, testimony is a form of evidence that is obtained from a witness who makes a solemn statement or declaration of fact. Testimony may be oral or written, and it is usually made by oath or affirmation under penalty of perjury. To be admissible in court and for maximum reliability and validity, written testimony is usually witnessed by one or more persons who swear or affirm its authenticity also under penalty of perjury. Unless a witness is testifying as an expert witness, testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is generally limited to those opinions or inferences that are rationally based on the perceptions of the witness and are helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony. Legitimate expert witnesses with a genuine understanding of legal process and the inherent dangers of false or misleading testimony refrain from making statements of fact. They also recognize that they are in fact not witnesses to an alleged crime or other event in any way, shape or form. Their expertise is in the examination of evidence or relevant facts in the case. They should make no firm judgement or claim or accusation about any aspect of the case outside their narrow range of expertise. They also should not allege any fact they can't immediately and credibly prove scientifically. For example, a hair sample from a crime scene entered as evidence by the prosecution should be described by an expert witness as \\"consistent with\\" a sample collected from the defendant, rather than being described as a \\"match\\". A wide range of factors make it physically impossible to prove for certain that two hair or tissue samples came from a common source. Having not actually witnessed the defendant at the scene, the expert witness can not state for a fact that the sample is a match to the defendant, particularly when the samples were collected at different times and different places by different collectors using different collection methods. Ultimately, the testimony of expert witnesses is regarded as supportive of evidence rather than evidence in and of itself, and a good defense attorney will point out that the expert witness is not in fact a witness to anything, but rather an observer. When a witness is asked a question, the opposing attorney can raise an objection, which is a legal move to disallow or prevent an improper question to others, preferably before the witness answers, and mentioning one of the standard reasons, including: * argumentative * asked and answered * best evidence rule * calls for speculation * calls for a conclusion * compound question or narrative * hearsay * inflammatory * incompetent witness (e.g., child, mental or physical impairment, intoxicated) * irrelevant, immaterial (the words \\"irrelevant\\" and \\"immaterial\\" have the same meaning under the Federal Rules of Evidence. Historically, irrelevant evidence referred to evidence that has no probative value, i.e., does not tend to prove any fact. Immaterial refers to evidence that is probative, but not as to any fact material to the case. See Black's Law Dictionary, 7th Ed.). * lack of foundation * leading question * privilege * vague * ultimate issue testimony There may also be an objection to the answer, including: * non-responsive Up until the mid-20th century, in much of the United States, an attorney often had to follow an objection with an exception to preserve the issue for appeal. If an attorney failed to \\"take an exception\\" immediately after the court's ruling on the objection, he waived his client's right to appeal the issue. Exceptions have since been abolished, due to the widespread recognition that forcing lawyers to take them was a waste of time. When a party uses the testimony of a witness to show proof, the opposing party often attempts to impeach the witness. This may be done using cross-examination, calling into question the witness's competence, or by attacking the character or habit of the witness. So, for example, if a witness testifies that he remembers seeing a person at 2:00 pm on a Tuesday and his habit is to be at his desk job on Tuesday, then the opposing party would try to impeach his testimony related to that event. Religion Christians in general, especially within the Evangelical tradition, use the term \\"to testify\\" or \\"to give one's testimony\\" to mean \\"to tell the story of how one became a Christian\\". Commonly it may refer to a specific event in a Christian's life in which God did something deemed particularly worth sharing. Christians often give their testimony at their own baptism or at evangelistic events. Many Christians have also published their testimonies on the internet. =Types= Many holiness churches devote a portion of their mid-week service to allow members to give a personal testimony about their faith and experiences in living the Christian life. In the Religious Society of Friends, the word testimony is used to refer to the ways in which Friends testify or bear witness to their beliefs in their everyday lives. In this context, the word testimony refers not to the underlying belief, but the committed action which arises out of their beliefs, which testifies to their beliefs. Common areas in which modern Friends are said to testify include testimony towards peace, testimony to simplicity, testimony to truth and integrity, and testimony to equality. In some religions (most notably Mormonism and Islam) many adherents testify as a profession of their faith, often to a congregation of believers. In Mormonism, testifying is also referred to as \\"bearing one's testimony\\", and often involves the sharing of personal experience‚Äîranging from a simple anecdote to an account of personal revelation‚Äîfollowed by a statement of belief that has been confirmed by this experience. Within Mormon culture, the word \\"testimony\\" has become synonymous with \\"belief\\". Although \\"testimony\\" and \\"belief\\" are often used interchangeably, they are inherently different. Most Mormons believe that when faith is acted upon, individuals can receive a spiritual witness which solidifies belief into testimony. Mormons are taught that if the exercise of faith brings forth good works, they can know their religious principles are true. An individual who no longer believes in the religion is referred to as having \\"lost their testimony\\".  Large-group awareness training  In the context of large-group awareness training, anecdotal testimony may operate in the forms of \\"sharing\\" or delivering a \\"share\\". Literature Bataan Death March Testimonies Some published oral or written autobiographical narratives are considered \\"testimonial literature\\" particularly when they present evidence or first person accounts of human rights abuses, violence and war, and living under conditions of social oppression. This usage of the term comes originally from Latin America and the Spanish term \\"testimonio\\" when it emerged from human rights tribunals, truth commissions, and other international human rights instruments in countries such as Chile and Argentina. One of the most famous, though controversial, of these works to be translated into English is I, Rigoberta Mench√∫. The autobiographies of Frederick Douglass can be considered among the earliest significant English- language works in this genre. Philosophy In philosophy, testimony is a proposition conveyed by one entity (person or group) to another entity, whether through speech or writing or through facial expression, that is based on the entity's knowledge base. The proposition believed on the basis of a testimony is justified if conditions are met which assess, among other things, the speaker's reliability (whether her testimony is true often) and the hearer's possession of positive reasons (for instance, that the speaker is unbiased). We can also, rationally accept a claim on the basis of another person's testimony unless at least one of the following is found to be true: # The claim is implausible; # The person or the source in which the claim is quoted lacks credibility; # The claim goes beyond what the person could know from his or her own experience and competence. For the notion of testimony in general, and especially after David Hume, see the seminal research by C. A. J. Coady, Testimony: A Philosophical Study, Oxford 1992.

Plot summary Robert Clapley, a former drug smuggler-turned-real estate developer, plans to build high-rise condominiums and golf courses on Toad Island, the home to a large population of oak toads. The project requires the construction of a massive new bridge to the mainland to accommodate Clapley's cement trucks. On the recommendation of Richard \\"Dick\\" Artemus, a corrupt governor of Florida to whom Clapley has given major campaign contributions, Clapley hires lobbyist Palmer Stoat to expedite the government funding for the bridge construction. By random happenstance, Stoat becomes subject to the obsessive wrath of ecoterrorist Twilly Spree after he witnesses him litter the highway from his luxury Range Rover. He tracks him back to the Fort Lauderdale residence he shares with his wife, Desirata. Twilly arranges ironic pranks - hijacking a garbage truck and dumping its load into Desi's convertible, and filling Stoat's Range Rover with dung beetles - but is aggravated when Stoat continues to litter. When he breaks into Stoat's home, he is confronted by his massive Labrador Retriever and by Desi herself. Desi, who is increasingly unhappy with her marriage, tells Twilly that he is \\"aiming low\\" if he is trying to correct Stoat's misbehavior. She guides him to Toad Island, where Clapley's construction crew has deliberately buried thousands of oak toads to avoid later protest by environmentalists. Twilly orders Desi to tell Stoat that he will kill the dog if he doesn't stop the bridge project. Stoat dismisses the threat until Twilly sends him a roadkill Labrador's severed ear via FedEx. The actual dog becomes Twilly's companion after he changes his name to \\"McGuinn.\\" Stoat convinces Artemus to veto funding for the bridge but has no intention of letting the project fail. He tells Clapley and Artemus that the funding can be put back into the budget later, through a special session of the Florida legislature. Clapley sends a hit man, Mr. Gash, to kill Twilly, while Artemus, in an effort to avoid the bridge project being tainted by a violent death, locates ex- governor Clinton Tyree, a.k.a. \\"Skink\\", who vanished in the mid-1970s after a short term of office and is said to be hiding in the remaining wilderness of Florida. Artemus knows that Skink's mentally disturbed elder brother, Doyle, is still on the state's payroll as the keeper of an abandoned lighthouse, and threatens to put him on the street if Skink doesn't apprehend Twilly. Artemus fails to realize the dire consequences of threatening a man with Skink's volcanic temper, or of putting him and Twilly in contact with each other. Desi becomes attracted to Twilly, and the two eventually develop a relationship. The Stoat is disgusted and washes his hands of her and McGuinn, telling Twilly that the bridge is going up no matter what he does. A violent confrontation with Twilly, Desi, and Skink on Toad Island leaves Mr. Gash mortally wounded. Twilly is left in Skink's care while Desi returns to her parents' home in Atlanta. Despite her pleadings, Twilly is still committed to stopping the Toad Island project. Accompanied by Skink, Twilly trails Stoat, Clapley, and Artemus to a private canned hunting reserve in northern Florida, where Stoat has arranged for Clapley to shoot a black rhinoceros and win over Willie Vasquez-Washington, a crucial member of the Florida House who is opposed to the special session. Twilly is on the verge of shooting Clapley with a rifle, but McGuinn runs into the preserve and nips playfully at the rhino's tail. The rhino - so ancient that it has hardly moved since it arrived at the ranch - goes berserk and charges at the hunting party. Clapley is gored to death on the rhino's horn, and Stoat is trampled flat. Artemus escapes the chaos but is mortified to learn that Willie snapped plenty of pictures of the fiasco. Clapley's death dooms the Toad Island project. Apart from his many lobbying clients and crony politicians, only a few friends and family members show up at Stoat's funeral. Desi is among the mourners, during which she is approached by McGuinn, holding a note with Twilly's new address on it. Meanwhile, Twilly and Skink are driving along the highway when they see another group of litterbugs. They immediately agree they have to teach them a lesson.

The main character Twilly and himself both had attorney forebears who lived in Southern Florida, but the development in this area came as a surprise to him and his attorney father and grandfather. Allusions to actual history, science, and current events *One of Stoat's most annoying (to his wife) habits is using snippets from classic rock songs in everyday conversation, especially because he always gets the lyrics wrong: \\"I read the newspaper today, oh boy.\\" (A Day in the Life by The Beatles) \\"Come on, baby, light my candle.\\" (Light My Fire by The Doors) \\"I'm having a tough day's night.\\" (A Hard Day's Night by The Beatles) \\"You're thick as a stick.\\" (Thick as a Brick by Jethro Tull) \\"Blond sugar, like the song says.\\" (Brown Sugar by The Rolling Stones) \\"He's a no-place man.\\" (Nowhere Man by The Beatles) \\"Wouldn't It Be Great\\" (Wouldn't It Be Nice by The Beach Boys) \\"Happiness is a hot gun.\\" (Happiness Is a Warm Gun by The Beatles) \\"You can't always do who you want.\\" (You Can't Always Get What You Want by The Rolling Stones) *Krimmler, Clapley's project manager, justifies his decision to bury the oak toad habitat on the island by referring to the Snail darter controversy. *Twilly renames Stoat's dog after guitarist Roger McGuinn, one of the founding members of The Byrds.

Other reviews praised the novel's harder edges. In his review of Hiaasen's later novel Skinny Dip, Michael Grunwald made several references to the characters of Sick Puppy: Cultural influence *The title of the book inspired the name of Australian rock band Sick Puppies.

It is the opposite of fast playing. A flat call can be a form of slow playing. The objective of slow playing is to lure opponents into a pot who might fold to a raise, or to cause them to bet more strongly than they would if the player had played aggressively (bet or raised). Slow playing sacrifices protection against hands that may improve and risks losing the pot-building value of a bet if the opponent also checks. David Sklansky defines the following conditions for profitable slow plays: * A player must have a very strong hand. * The free card or cheap card the player is allowing to his opponents must have good possibilities of making them a second-best hand. * That same free card must have little chance of giving an opponent a better hand or even giving them a draw to a better hand on the next round with sufficient pot odds to justify a call. * The player must believe that he will drive out opponents by showing aggression, but can win a big pot if the opponents stay in the pot. * The pot must not yet be very large. :Seven-card stud example :In a seven- card stud game, Ted's first three cards are all fours. Alice with a king showing bets first, Ted raises and Alice calls. On the next round, Alice catches another king, and Ted miraculously catches the last four (making four- of-a-kind). Ted suspects Alice has two pair or three kings, and Alice suspects that Ted has two pair or three fours. Alice bets again, and Ted just flat calls. Ted decides to just call for next round or two, and maybe even check if Alice doesn't bet, rather than raising, for several reasons. Ted's hand is so strong that the chance of getting beaten is negligible, so he doesn't need protection. If Alice just has two pair and Ted acts strongly, Alice may think Ted has three fours and fold if she doesn't improve. By allowing Alice to continue for smaller stakes, Ted hopes that Alice will improve to a very strong (but second best) hand that will induce her to bet, raise, or at least call in the later betting rounds. Relationship between slow playing and bluffing Against observant opponents, the frequency of bluffing affects the effectiveness of slow playing, and vice versa. If a player's table image is that of an aggressive bluffer, slow playing is less important because his opponents will be more willing to call his usual bets and raises. Similarly, if a player is perceived as a \\"trappy\\" player (uses frequent slow plays), his bluffs are less likely to be respected (i.e., more likely to be called) because his opponents expect him to slow play his strong hands. Check raising as a slow play A check-raise is not necessarily a slow play. Often, the purpose of a check-raise is to drive out opponents from a pot, which is the opposite of the goal of a slow play. However, within the context of a single betting round, check-raising can be employed as a slow play. :Draw poker example :Alice, Bob, Carol, and David are playing draw poker. After anteing, Alice starts with a pair of aces, and opens the betting for $2. Bob raises an additional $2, bringing the bet to $4. Carol folds. David calls the $4, and Alice puts in an additional $2 to match the raise. Drawing three cards, she receives another ace, and a pair of fives. Since her aces-full is almost certain to be unbeatable, it does not need the protection of a bet. Also, Bob earlier raised, and David called a raise, so they likely have strong hands and one of them will bet if Alice doesn't. Finally, since Bob and David earlier showed strength, and they know that Alice knows this, Alice betting into them would be seen as a bold move likely to scare one or both of them off, especially if they weren't as strong as they seem. Alice decides conditions are right for a slow play: Alice checks. As she hoped, Bob bets $2. David thinks for a minute, then calls the $2. Alice now springs the trap and raises $2. Bob calls the additional $2, and David (who now realizes that he is probably beaten) folds. Bob reveals three sixes, and surrenders the pot to Alice. If Alice had just bet her hand on the second round, it is likely that Bob would just have called and David may or may not have called, earning Alice $2 to $4 on the second round. But with the slow play, she earned $6. Even in games (such as California lowball) where the check-raise is not allowed, one can make other sandbagging plays such as just flat calling instead of raising with a very strong hand and then later raising. Fishing for the overcall Fishing for the overcall occurs when the last card a player is dealt makes him a very strong hand, an opponent in front of him bets, and there are more opponents yet to act behind him. While the player might normally raise with his hand, just calling may encourage the opponents behind him to overcall when they would have folded to a raise. For this play to be used profitably, one or more conditions like the following must be met: * The original bettor is all- in and therefore has no money to call a raise. * The player is confident that the original bettor was bluffing and would not call a raise. * There are several opponents yet to act. If there is only one opponent yet to act, then getting the overcall would gain no more money than raising and having the initial bettor call. * The opponents are likely to overcall the initial bet, but not a raise. This play sacrifices the profit that might have been made from opponents who would have overcalled a raise. A common example of fishing for overcalls occurs in High-low split games like Omaha hold 'em. If John is confident that Mary is betting a high hand, then John might flat call with his low hand to fish for overcalls rather than make it more difficult for opponents to call. If John were to raise, he and Mary would gain no profit at all if no other opponents called.

Types of cheating Cheating can be done many ways, including collusion, sleight-of-hand (such as bottom dealing or stacking the deck), or the use of physical objects such as marked cards or holdout devices or using AI and high tech electromechanical devices like shuffling machines to manipulate the deck. Cheating occurs in both friendly games and casinos. Cheats may operate alone, or may operate in teams or small groups. Following is a list of terms used to categorize specific card cheats: *card mechanic: A card cheat who specializes in sleight-of-hand and manipulation of cards, a card sharp. *base dealer: Also called a bottom dealer, or a second dealer, this relies on two related methods that manipulate the dealing of cards. *deadlock deck: Use of computer and AI to manipulate the game either with manipulation of RNG in online games by hacking or use of electromechanical devices like shuffling machines to manipulate the deck. *paper player: A card cheat that exploits the use of marked cards. *hand mucker: A card cheat that specializes in switching cards. *machine player: A card cheat that uses mechanical holdouts. *double deal: dealing a player two or more cards during one round of a deal. Minimal-skill methods The easiest and most common types of cheating require no skill of manipulation, but rather merely the nerve. Such methods include shorting the pot, avoiding house fees, and peeking at other players' cards. However, it is very difficult to prove because when confronted, at least the first time, the cheat often calls the cheating an honest mistake. One minimal-skill method that occurs in non-casino and casino games happens when a player who has folded appoints themselves the tender of the pot, stacking chips, counting them, and delivering them to the winning player. Check-chopping is when such a \\"helpful\\" player palms a chip. Odorless adhesive can be used for this purpose. Another minimal-skill method is going south (also known as \\"ratholing\\"), where a player covertly removes a portion of their chips from play while remaining in the game, normally in order to preserve the winnings as profit, or prevent a major loss in \\"big bet\\" games. Skilled methods  A cheat may hand-muck a card or more than one card. When a cheat is \\"mucking\\" the cheat is cleverly hiding cards in their hand, to later switch their hand for. This may also be done with a confederate. A skilled cheat can deal the second card, the bottom card, the second from bottom card, and the middle card. The idea is to cull, or to find the cards one needs, place them at the bottom, top, or any other place the cheat wants, then false deal them to oneself or one's confederate. One sign of false dealing could be when a dealer grips the deck with the index finger in front of it or their pinky and pointing finger on both short sides of the deck while the other fingers support the deck while the cards are being beveled slightly. This is referred to as the \\"Mechanic's Grip\\". It not only allows better control of the cards, but provides cover by showing the back of the top card, and without moving the hand holding the deck. A cheat can place certain cards in a position favorable to the card cheat. This is called \\"Stacking\\". Stacking is more often done than \\"False dealing\\" because it doesn't look suspicious. There are a couple of techniques for \\"Stacking\\" cards. The most famous are: Riffle Stacking and Overhand Stacking. By Riffle Stacking the cheat stacks the card(s) while doing a Riffle shuffle. This form of stacking is the most difficult to master and the most respected under the card sharps and magicians. The Overhand Stacking method takes little practice, and is more likely to be done in a situation with a cheat. The cheat does a (what looks like) normal Overhand Shuffle. But while the cheat is shuffling they keep track of the cards they want to stack, and with a little practice they can manage to put the exact number of cards in between the cards they want to stack to make the next round of dealing favorable for the cheat. Even if a cheat deals themselves a powerful hand, they may not win much money if every other player has nothing, so often the cheat will stack two hands, with one player receiving a strong hand and the cheater getting an even stronger one. This is called a \\"double duke\\". A slight advantage for a cheat can be to know what cards are placed both on the top of the deck as well as the bottom card, so that information can then later be used to bottom deal or second deal themselves that card. The looking at the top or bottom card without the other players knowing or seeing it is called \\"Glimpsing\\" or \\"Peeking\\". There are a lot of methods for reaching the same goal. A method that is used most is called the \\"Shiner\\". A Shiner is a reflective object (such as coffee, a lighter, a blade etc.) that is placed under the deck, so when the cheat is looking into the shiner the bottom card is exposed, and every card that is dealt over the shiner can easily be peeked by looking in the shiner. One method of cheating that involves both great risk and great potential pay-off is the cold deck‚Äîso called because it has not been \\"warmed up\\" by play (and thus randomised). Such decks are usually pre-stacked, and are introduced either at the deal, after the real deck has been shuffled, or before the deal, where a card sharp will make a false shuffle using sleight of hand. The latter method may require collusion or a pass if the style of play or house rules call for a cut. The skill lies both in convincing other players that the shuffle is legitimate and in ensuring that other players receive hands that are good enough to entice them into play, but not too good to arouse suspicion. = Marked cards = Marked cards are printed or altered so that the cheater can know the value of specific cards while only looking at the back. Ways of marking are too numerous to mention, but there are certain broad types. A common way of marking cards involves marks on a round design on the card so as to be read like a clock (an ace is marked at one o'clock, and so on until the king, which is not marked). Shading a card by putting it in the sun or scratching the surface with a razor are ways to mark an already printed deck. Juice and \\"daub\\" are two kinds of substances that can be used to mark cards in a subtle way so as to avoid detection, when done properly. While a \\"juice\\" deck is premarked and introduced into play by the cheater, \\"daub\\" is applied during play to any deck. Once trained, cheaters can read the cards from across the table. Decks can be marked while playing using fingernails, poker chips or by bending or crimping the cards in a position that the cheat can read from across the table. The practice of burning the top card, or cards, is to prevent a cheat from knowing that top card and dealing \\"seconds\\" to either give a confederate a card that helps their hand or an opponent a card that hurts theirs.  Collusion  Collusion is two or more players acting with a secret, common strategy.T. Hayes, \\"Collusion Strategy and Analysis for Texas Hold'em\\", 2017 Some common forms of collusion are: soft play, that is, failing to bet or raise in a situation that would normally merit it, to avoid costing one's partner or friend money; whipsawing, where partners raise and re-raise each other to trap players in between; dumping, where a cheater will deliberately lose to a partner; and signalling, or trading information between partners via signals of some sort, like arranging their chips in a certain manner. In a poker tournament, when one player is all in and two other players are active in the pot, it is common for the two players with chips left to \\"check it down\\", or check on each round of betting through the end of the hand. Unless they explicitly communicate an agreement about checking it down, this is not collusion.Is \\"checking it down\\" in a tournament implicit collusion? Online specific Online play has allowed for new methods of cheating while other methods based on physical objects such as cards or chips are impossible. One new form of cheating is the use of bots. These are programs that play instead of a real human. Though their accuracy and their ability to win are disputed, their use normally violates the rules of online cardrooms, so using them is, by definition, cheating.PokerStars.com: End User License AgreementPartyPoker.com: PartyGaming‚Äôs Unfair Advantage Policy Collusion in online poker is relatively easy and much more difficult to immediately spot if executed well. Cheaters can engage in telephone calls or instant messaging, discussing their cards, since nobody can see them. Sometimes one person may be using two or more computers to play multiple hands at the same table under different aliases (since many broadband plans offer customers multiple IP addresses, this can conveniently and cheaply be done without the likelihood of immediate detection). Such tactics can give cheaters an advantage that is difficult to work against. However, online poker cardrooms keep records of every hand played, and collusion can often be detected by finding any of several detectable patterns (such as folding good hands to a small bet, as it is known that another player has a better hand). Users who frequently sit at the same tables will be flagged by poker rooms and their play will be closely monitored. Often, such users will be warned they have been flagged, in an effort to deter collusion. Another online method of cheating is \\"multiaccounting\\", where a player will register several accounts to their name (or, perhaps more commonly, to non-poker-playing friends and family members). This might be done to help enable the collusion previously mentioned, or perhaps to simply enable a well-known player to play incognito. However, another common motive for multi-accounting is to facilitate chip dumping and other methods of equity maximization in online tournaments. A major difference between cash games and tournaments is that tournament winnings tend to be much less consistent over the short to medium term. Because tournaments tend to pay prize money only to the top ten percent of entrants on average and tend to pay the majority of prize money to a very small number of top finishers, in tournament play even the best players are prone to relatively long streaks of overall net losses (or even no winnings at all) between sizable wins. Therefore, for high-stakes players who specialize in tournament play, multi-accounting is one possible means to allow a player to play more entries in major tournaments than they would otherwise be able to, potentially multiplying the player's earnings and, just as importantly, making earnings more consistent over a shorter period of time. However, the risk is that a large win by hitherto unknown \\"player\\" may attract scrutiny from the host (and other players), especially if the winner has no known previous poker experience but does have clear ties to a better-known player. In addition, some sites now offer multi-table tournaments where the same player can enter multiple times under their own name, so as to reduce the incentive to multi-account. Another concern is datamining. This is the systematic collection of hand histories, enough of which can be used to profile opponents using specially designed software. Two or more players may agree to share their individual hand histories amongst themselves; alternatively some websites offer large quantities of previously-played hands (even millions) for a fee. Using software to analyze one's own histories is generally accepted, however acquiring histories of hands in which a player did not participate violates the rules of most cardrooms. Poker software, like all software, cannot be assumed to be reliable. It is always possible that a person is exploiting the software to win money from victims. The software may even contain a backdoor which allows a person, perhaps an employee, to view cards. Absolute Poker was engaged in such a scandal along with site consultant and notable poker player Russ Hamilton. As of 2007, Ultimate Bet faces a lawsuit with allegations of employees exploiting the software.Online poker cheating blamed on employee, by Mike Brunker, at NBC News; published October 19, 2007; retrieved November 25, 2018 The user agreement of the two online poker sites owned by Tokwiro Enterprises, Absolute Poker and UltimateBet, state they reserve the right to cancel an account if a player plays \\"in a professional sense\\" (and not for personal entertainment only).AbsolutePoker: End-User License Agreement Ultimatebet.com: End User License Agreement However, this is not a standard prohibition. For example, it is not in the end-user agreements of the three largest online cardrooms: PokerStars, PartyPoker, and Full Tilt Poker. Angle shooting Angle shooting is engaging in actions that may technically be within the scope of the rules of the game, but that are considered unethical or unfair to exploit or take advantage of another player. For example, an angle shooter might motion as if they were folding their hand to induce other players to fold theirs out of turn. One form of angle shooting which is exclusive to online poker is to abuse the disconnect protection (DP) rules most sites have in place. DP is a rule exclusive to online poker whereby if a player is disconnected from the site in the middle of the hand their hand is played out as if they were all-in without the player actually having to put any more money in the pot. The online poker rooms that offer DP usually have specific tables set aside for this so that all players at the table are aware that the special DP rules will apply.Bill Rini: The Definitive Guide to Online Poker Cheating How this is used by angle shooters is if a player is in a hand that they are unsure if they have the best cards and don't want to invest any more money to find out. They can unplug their internet connection and then wait for the hand to play itself out.

It was part of the former royal palace, the Palais de la Cit√©, which consisted of the Conciergerie, Palais de Justice and the Sainte- Chapelle. Hundreds of prisoners during the French Revolution were taken from the Conciergerie to be executed by guillotine at a number of locations around Paris. The Middle Ages The Hall of the Guards, one of the largest surviving medieval parts of the Conciergerie. The west part of the island was originally the site of a Merovingian palace, and was known initially as the Palais de la Cit√©. From the 10th to the 14th centuries, it was the main palace of the medieval Kings of France. During the reigns of Louis IX (Saint Louis) (1214‚Äì1270) and Philippe IV (Philip the Fair) (1284‚Äì1314) the Merovingian palace was extended and fortified more extensively. Louis IX added the Sainte- Chapelle and associated galleries, while Philippe IV created the towered facade on the Seine river side and a large hall. Both are excellent examples of French religious and secular architecture of the period. The Sainte- Chapelle was built in the French royal style to house the crown of thorns that was brought back from the Crusades and to serve as a royal chapel. The \\"Grande Salle\\" (Great Hall) was one of the largest in Europe, and its lower story, known as \\"La Salle des Gens d'Armes\\" (The Hall of the Soldiers) survives at 64m long, 27.5m wide and 8.5m high. It was used as a dining room for the 2,000 staff members who worked in the palace. It was heated with four large fireplaces and lit by many windows, now blocked. It was also used for royal banquets and judicial proceedings. The neighboring Salle des Gardes was used as an antechamber to the Great Hall immediately above, where the king held his lit de justice (a session of parliament in the king's presence). The early Valois kings continued to modify the palace during the 14th century, but Charles V abandoned the palace during 1358, relocating across the river to the Louvre Palace. The palace continued to serve an administrative function and still included the chancellery and French Parliament. In the king's absence, he appointed a concierge to command of the palace, a fact which gave the palace its eventual name. During 1391, part of the building was converted for use as a prison and took its name from the ruling office. Its prisoners were a mixture of common criminals and political prisoners. In common with other prisons of the time, the treatment of prisoners was dependent on their wealth, status and associates. Wealthy or influential prisoners usually got their own cells with a bed, desk and materials for reading and writing. Less-well-off prisoners could afford to pay for simply furnished cells known as pistoles, which would be equipped with a rough bed and perhaps a table. The poorest would be confined to dark, damp, vermin-infested cells known as oubliettes (literally \\"forgotten places\\"). In keeping with the name, they were left to live or die in conditions that were ideal for the plague and other infectious diseases, which were rife in the unsanitary conditions of the prison. Three towers survive from the medieval Conciergerie: the Caesar Tower, named in honor of the Roman Emperors; the Silver Tower, named for its alleged use as the store for the royal treasure; and the Bonbec (\\"good beak\\") Tower, named for the torture chamber that it housed, in which victims were encouraged to \\"sing\\". The building was extended during the reigns of later kings with France's first public clock being installed about 1370. The current clock dates from 1535. The Conciergerie and the Reign of Terror Conciergerie closeup The Palais de Justice, the Conciergerie and the Tour de l'Horloge, by Adrien Dauzats, after 1858. Marie Antoinette's cell in the Conciergerie. The ten month Reign of Terror (September 1793 ‚Äì July 1794) had a profound effect on France. More than 40,000 people died from execution and imprisonment, and France would not be a republic again for nearly half a century. The National Convention enacted the Law of Suspects on September 17, 1793. This act declared that anyone considered a counter-revolutionary or enemy of the republic was guilty of treason and, thus, condemned to death. The Revolutionary Tribunal was set up in the Palace of Justice. The two fates for those sent before the tribunal were acquittal or death, with no possibility of appeal. Antoine Quentin Fouquier-Tinville, a radical, was named public prosecutor. The Tribunal sat in the Great Hall between 2 April 1793 and 31 May 1795 and sent nearly 2,600 prisoners to the guillotine. The Conciergerie prison became the main penitentiary of a network of prisons throughout Paris, and was the last place of housing for more than 2,700 people, who were summarily executed by guillotine. The dank dungeons were a stark contrast to the beautiful architecture of the palace above. The quality of life of the prisoners was based mainly on their personal wealth and the whims of the jailers. The revolutionary period continued the prison's tradition of interning prisoners based on wealth, such that wealthier prisoners could rent a bed for 27 livres 12 sous for the first month, 22 livres 10 sous for subsequent months. Even when the price was decreased to 15 livres, the commanders of the prison made a fortune: as the Terror escalated, a prisoner could pay for a bed and be executed a few days later, freeing the bed for a new inmate who would then pay as well. One memoirist termed the Conciergerie \\"the most lucrative furnished lodgings in Paris\\".Riouffe, Honor√©, ed. Revolutionary Justice Displayed: Or, An inside View of the Various Prisons of Paris, under the Government of Robespierre and the Jacobins. Philadelphia: Printed for Benjamin Davies, No. 68, High-Street, by Richard Folwell, No. 33, Mulberry-Street, 1796. Print. Only celebrity prisoners were assigned cells to themselves. Most of the pistole inmates were stuffed into a single room that abutted a local hospital, making disease an inevitability. The cramped cells were infested with rats, and the stench of urine permeated every room. All the prisoners, except those locked in the dungeons, were allowed to walk about the prisoners' gallery from 8 a.m. to an hour before sunset. Roll call was always a tortuous proceeding because many of the jailers were illiterate and it could take hours for them to confirm that all of the prisoners were accounted for. A principal jailer, who sat by the door, determined whether visitors would be allowed inside the prison. His decision depended more on his mood than any set proceedings. He was also in charge of resolving disputes between jailers and their charges. Trials and executions progressed in a rapid, unpredictable manner; one could be tried by the court and executed before the next morning. The condemned would be walked through the Salle de la Toilette, where their personal belongings were confiscated. Carts loaded them in the May Courtyard and brought them to guillotines throughout Paris. Prisoners held at the Conciergerie included Marie Antoinette, poet Andr√© Ch√©nier, Charlotte Corday, Madame √âlisabeth, Madame du Barry and the 21 Girondins, purged at the beginning of the Terror. Georges Danton later awaited his execution here, and, during the Thermidorian Reaction, Robespierre himself was interned for a brief time before his execution. Post-Revolution and present The Conciergerie seen from the Rive Droite After the Restoration of the Bourbons during the 19th century, the Conciergerie continued to be used as a prison for high-value prisoners, most notably the future Napoleon III. Marie Antoinette's cell was converted into a chapel dedicated to her memory. The Conciergerie and Palais de Justice underwent major rebuilding during the mid-19th century, drastically altering their external appearance. While the building looks like a brooding medieval fortress, this appearance actually only dates from about 1858. A description from 1825 gives this impression of the structure before the rebuilding: The Conciergerie was decommissioned during 1914 and opened to the public as a national historical monument. It is presently a popular tourist attraction, although only a relatively small part of the building is open to public access; much of it is still used for the Paris law courts. It has been listed since 1862 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. Palais de Justice ou Conciergerie References Sources \\"The Conciergerie.\\" Ministere De La Justice.

Originally developed in the 1970s (as VME/B, later VME 2900) to drive ICL's then new 2900 Series mainframes, the operating system is now known as OpenVME incorporating a Unix subsystem, and runs on ICL Series 39 and Trimetrahttp://www.fujitsu.com/downloads/EU/uk/pdflite/VME_brochure.pdf#page=3 mainframe computers, as well as industry-standard x64 servers.  Origins  The development program for the New Range system started on the merger of International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) and English Electric Computers in 1968. One of the fundamental decisions was that it would feature a new operating system. A number of different feasibility and design studies were carried out within ICL, the three most notable being: * VME/B (originally System B), targeted at large processors such as the 2970/2980 and developed in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire and West Gorton, Manchester * VME/K (originally System T), targeted at the mid-range systems such as the 2960 and developed at Bracknell after the original design for these small processors, System D, was dropped. VME/K was developed and introduced to the market but was eventually replaced by VME/B * VME/T, which was never actually launched, but warrants a mention as it was conceived to support \\"fault tolerance\\", and predated the efforts of the successful American startup company Tandem Computers in this area. The chief architect of VME/B was Brian Warboys, who subsequently became professor of software engineering at the University of Manchester. A number of influences can be seen in its design, for example Multics and ICL's earlier George 3 operating system; however it was essentially designed from scratch. Comparisons VME was viewed as primarily competing with the System/370 IBM mainframe as a commercial operating system, and adopted the EBCDIC character encoding. As a creation of the mid-1970s, with no constraints to be compatible with earlier operating systems, VME is in many ways more modern in its architecture than today's Unix derivatives (Unix was designed in the 1960s) or Microsoft Windows (which started as an operating system for single-user computers, and still betrays those origins). Nomenclature When New Range was first launched in October 1974, its operating system was referred to as \\"System B\\". By the time it was first delivered it had become \\"VME/B\\". VME/K was developed independently (according to Campbell-Kelly, \\"on a whim of Ed Mack\\"), and was delivered later with the smaller mainframes such as the 2960. Following a financial crisis in 1980, new management was brought into ICL (Christopher Laidlaw as chairman, and Robb Wilmot as managing director). An early decision of the new management was to drop VME/K. Thus in July 1981 \\"VME2900\\" was launched: although presented to the customer base as a merger of VME/B and VME/K, it was in reality the VME/B base with a few selected features from VME/K grafted on. This provided the opportunity to drop some obsolescent features, which remained available to customers who needed them in the form of the \\"BONVME\\" option. The \\"2900\\" suffix was dropped at System Version 213 (SV213) when ICL launched Series 39 in 1985 as the successor to the original 2900 series; and the \\"Open\\" prefix was added after SV294. VME became capable of hosting applications written originally for Unix through a UNIX System V Release 3 based subsystem, called VME/X, adapted to run under VME and using the ASCII character encoding. In 2007 Fujitsu announced a VME version run as a hosted subsystem, called superNova, within Microsoft Windows, or SUSE or Red Hat Enterprise Linux on x86-64 hardware. In 2012 the VME user group, AXiS, announced that after almost 40 years it would be disbanding because of the reduced user base. Architecture VME is structured as a set of layers, each layer having access to resources at different levels of abstraction. Virtual resources provided by one layer are constructed from the virtual resources offered by the layer below. Access to the resources of each layer is controlled through a set of Access Levels: in order for a process to use a resource at a particular access level, it must have an access key offering access to that level. The concept is similar to the \\"rings of protection\\" in Multics. The architecture allows 16 access levels, of which the outer 6 are reserved for user-level code. Orthogonally to the access levels, the operating system makes resources available to applications in the form of a Virtual Machine. A Virtual Machine can run multiple processes. In practice, a VME Virtual Machine is closer to the concept of a process on other operating systems, while a VME process is more like a thread. The allocation of resources to a virtual machine uses a stack model: when the stack is popped, all resources allocated at that stack level are released. Calls from an application to the operating system are therefore made by a call that retains the same process stack, but with a change in protection level; the resulting efficiency of system calls is one of the features that makes the architecture competitive. Communication between Virtual Machines is achieved by means of Events (named communication channels) and shared memory areas. The hardware architecture also provides semaphore instructions INCT (increment-and-test) and TDEC (test-and-decrement). Files and other persistent objects are recorded in a repository called the Catalogue. Unlike other operating systems, the file naming hierarchy is independent of the location of a file on a particular tape or disk volume. In days where there was more need for offline storage, this made it easy to keep track of files regardless of their location, and to move files between locations without renaming them. As well as files, the Catalogue keeps track of users and user groups, volumes, devices, network connections, and many other resources. Metadata for files can be held in an object called a File Description. The Catalogue was probably the first example of what would later be called an entity-relationship database. Interrupts are handled by creating a new stack frame on the stack for the relevant process, handling the interrupt using this new environment, and then popping the stack to return to the interrupted process. Run-time exceptions, referred to as contingencies, are captured by the Object Program Error Handler (OPEH), which can produce a report (equivalent to a stack trace), either interactively or written to a journal. =OMF= Compiled object code is maintained in a format called OMF (Object Module Format). Unlike in many other operating systems, this is also the format used by the loader. Various compilers are available, as well as utilities, notably the Collector, which links the code in several OMF modules into a single module, for more efficient loading at run-time, and the Module Amender, which allows patching of the instructions in an OMF module to fix bugs, using assembly language syntax. =SCL= The command language for VME is known as SCL (System Control Language). This is much more recognizably a typed high-level programming language than the job control or shell languages found in most other operating systems: it can be likened to scripting languages such as JavaScript, though its surface syntax is derived from Algol 68. SCL is designed to allow both line-at-a-time interactive use from a console or from a command file, and creation of executable scripts or programs (when the language is compiled into object module format in the same way as any other VME programming language). The declaration of a procedure within SCL also acts as the definition of a simple form or template allowing the procedure to be invoked from an interactive terminal, with fields validated according to the data types of the underlying procedure parameters or using the default procedure parameter values. The built-in command vocabulary uses a consistent naming convention with an imperative verb followed by a noun: for example DELETE_FILE or DISPLAY_LIBRARY_DETAILS. The command can be written in full, or in an abbreviated form that combines standard abbreviations for the verb and noun: for example XF (X for DELETE, F for FILE) or DLBD (D for DISPLAY, LB for LIBRARY, D for DETAILS). SCL is block-structured, with begin/end blocks serving the dual and complementary roles of defining the lexical scope of variable declarations, and defining the points at which resources acquired from the operating system should be released. Variables in the language (which are accessible from applications in the form of environment variables) can have a number of simple types such as strings, superstrings (sequences of strings), booleans, and integers, and are also used to contain references to system resources such as files and network connections. It is possible to \\"disassemble\\" an SCL program from OMF back into SCL source code using the READ_SCL (or RSCL) command. However the output is not always perfect, and will often include errors that would stop re- compilation without user intervention. A simple code example can be seen on the 99 bottles of beer website.SCL code example on the 99 bottles of beer website A more realistic example, where SCL is used to compile a program written in S3, is shown below.

The COLLECT command combines different object code modules into a single module, and is driven by its own local command file which is incorporated inline in the SCL between the delimiters \\"\\" and \\"++++\\". The sub-commands INPUT and NEWMODULE identify the names of the input and output modules; SUPPRESS and RETAIN determine the external visibility of named procedures within the collected module; and LISTMODULE requests a report describing the output module. Note that \\".\\" is used to separate the parts of a hierarchic file name. A leading asterisk denotes a local name for a library, bound using the ASSIGN_LIBRARY command. The number in parentheses after a file name is a version number. The operating system associates a version number with every file, and requests for a file get the latest version unless specified otherwise. Creating a new file will by default create the next version and leave the previous version intact; this program however is deliberately choosing to create version 101, to identify a public release. =Enhanced security variants= As a result of ICL's heavy involvement with delivery of computer services to the UK Public Sector, in particular those with special security requirements such as OPCON CCIS, it was an early entrant into the market for Secure Systems. VME formed a core of ICL's activities in the Secure Systems arena. It had the advantage that as the last large-scale operating system ever designed, and one built from scratch, its underlying architecture encompassed many of the primitives needed to develop a Secure System, in particular the hardware assisted Access Control Registers (ACR) to limit to privileges that could be taken by any process (including Users). This led to the UK Government's Central Computing and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) funding Project Spaceman in the mid 1980s for ICL Defence Technology Centre (DTC) to develop an enhanced security variant of VME. ICL launched this as a pair of complementary products, with the commercial release being called High Security Option (HSO), and the public sector release, including Government Furnished Encryption (GFE) technologies, being called Government Security Option (GSO). HSO and GSO were formally tested under the CESG UK (Security) Evaluation Scheme, one of the predecessors to ITSEC and Common Criteria, and in doing so became the first mainstream operating system to be formally Certified. =Series 39= The Series 39 range introduced Nodal Architecture, a novel implementation of distributed shared memory that can be seen as a hybrid of a multiprocessor system and a cluster design. Each machine consists of a number of nodes, and each node contains its own order-code processor (CPU) and main memory. Virtual machines are typically located (at any one time) on one node, but have the capability to run on any node and to be relocated from one node to another. Discs and other peripherals are shared between nodes. Nodes are connected using a high-speed optical bus, which is used to provide applications with a virtual shared memory. Memory segments that are marked as shared (public or global segments) are replicated to each node, with updates being broadcast over the inter-node network. Processes which use unshared memory segments (nodal or local) run in complete isolation from other nodes and processes. Development process VME was originally written almost entirely in S3, a specially-designed system programming language based on Algol 68R (however, VME/K was written primarily in the SFL assembly language). Although a high-level language is used, the operating system is not designed to be independent of the underlying hardware architecture: on the contrary, the software and hardware architecture are closely integrated. From the early 1990s onwards, some entirely new VME subsystems were written partly or wholly in the C programming language. From its earliest days, VME was developed with the aid of a software engineering repository system known as CADES, originally designed and managed by David Pearson (computer scientist) and built for the purpose using an underlying IDMS database. CADES is not merely a version control system for code modules: it manages all aspects of the software lifecycle from requirements capture, design methodology and specification through to field maintenance. CADES was used in VME module development to hold separate definitions of data structures (Modes), constants (Literals), procedural interfaces and the core algorithms. Multiple versions ('Lives') of each of these components could exist. The algorithms were written in System Development Language (SDL), which was then converted to S3 source by a pre-processor. Multiple versions of the same modules could be generated. Application development tools The application development tools offered with VME fall into two categories: * third- generation programming languages * fourth-generation QuickBuild toolset. The toolset on VME is unusually homogeneous, with most customers using the same core set of languages and tools. As a result, the tools are also very well integrated. Third-party tools have made relatively little impression. For many years the large majority of VME users wrote applications in COBOL, usually making use of the IDMS database and the TPMS transaction processing monitor. Other programming languages included Fortran, Pascal, ALGOL 68RS, Coral 66 and RPG2, but these served minority interests. Later, in the mid 1980s, compilers for C became available, both within and outside the Unix subsystem, largely to enable porting of software such as relational database systems. It is interesting that a PL/I subset compiler was written by the EEC, to assist in porting programs from IBM to ICL hardware. The compilers developed within ICL share a common architecture, and in some cases share components such as code- generators. Many of the compilers used a module named ALICE [Assembly Language Internal Common Environment] and produced an early form of precompiled code (P-Code) termed ROSE, making compiled Object Module Format (OMF) libraries loadable on any machine in the range. . =System Programming Languages: S3 and SFL= The primary language used for developing both the VME operating system itself and other system software such as compilers and transaction processing monitors is S3. This is a high level language based in many ways on Algol 68, but with data types and low-level functions and operators aligned closely with the architecture of the 2900 series. An assembly language SFL (System Function Language) is also available. This was used for the development of VME/K, whose designers were not confident that a high-level language could give adequate performance, and also for the IDMS database system on account of its origins as a third-party product. SFL was originally called Macro Assembler Programming LanguagE (MAPLE), but as the 2900 architecture was being positioned as consisting of high level language machines the name was changed at the request of ICL Marketing. It had been developed as a part of the toolkit for System D, which was subsequently cancelled. Related families of assemblers for other architectures (CALM-xx running under VME, PALM-xx developed in Pascal and running on various hosts) were developed for internal use. Neither S3 nor SFL was ever promoted as a commercial development tool for end-user applications, as neither were normally delivered as a standard part of the operating system, nor were they explicitly marketed as products in their own right. Both SFL and S3 were however available as options to user organisations and third parties who had a specific need for them. =QuickBuild= The QuickBuild application development environment on VME has been highly successful despite the fact that applications are largely locked into the VME environment. This environment is centred on the Data Dictionary System (DDS, also called OpenDDS), an early and very successful attempt to build a comprehensive repository supporting all the other tools, with full support for the development lifecycle. As well as database schemas and file and record descriptions, the dictionary keeps track of objects such as reports and queries, screen designs, and 4GL code; it also supports a variety of models at the requirements capture level, such as entity-relationship models and process models. The QuickBuild 4GL is packaged in two forms: * ApplicationMaster for the creation of online TP applications * ReportMaster for batch reporting. Both are high-level declarative languages, using Jackson Structured Programming as their design paradigm. ApplicationMaster is unusual in its approach to application design in that it focuses on the user session as if it were running in a single conversational process, completely hiding the complexity of maintaining state across user interactions. Because the 4GL and other tools such as the screen designer work only with the DDS dictionary, which also holds the database schemas, there is considerable reuse of metadata that is rarely achieved with other 4GLs.

The second oldest university in Queensland, JCU is a teaching and research institution. The university's main campuses are located in the tropical cities of Cairns and Townsville, and one in the city state of Singapore. JCU also has study centres in Mount Isa, Mackay and Thursday Island. A Brisbane campus, operated by Russo Higher Education, delivers undergraduate and postgraduate courses to international students. The University‚Äôs main fields of research include marine sciences, biodiversity, sustainable management of tropical ecosystems, genetics and genomics, tropical health care, tourism and engineering. History James Cook University, Cairns In 1957, Professor John Douglas Story, Vice Chancellor of the University of Queensland proposed a regional university college be established to cater to the people of North Queensland. At that time, the only higher education providers were located in the state capital, Brisbane. On 27 February 1961, the University College of Townsville was opened. After being proclaimed on 20 April 1970 as an Act of Queensland Parliament, the University College of Townsville became James Cook University of North Queensland on 29 April 1970.On reverse side of all JCU official Statement of Academic Record sheets printed after January 1998. The official opening of the university was conducted by Queen Elizabeth II. The namesake is British sea captain James Cook, who is best known for being the first European to explore the eastern coast of Australia. A year after JCU's proclamation, Cyclone Althea struck the Townsville region. This, together with the destruction caused by Cyclone Tracy in Darwin 1974, prompted the establishment of a cyclone research facility. The Cyclone Testing Station started out as a small project of Professor Hugh Trollope and began its operations on 1 November 1977 as James Cook Cyclone Structural Testing Station. The Cyclone Testing Station operates as a self funded unit of the College of Science, Technology and Engineering, and serves as an advising member to the Australian Standards committee in areas of structural design, specifically wind actions. On 1 January 1982, JCU amalgamated with The Townsville College of Advanced Education located adjacent to the main campus in Douglas. The university established a presence in Cairns in 1987 and moved to its current location in the suburb of Smithfield in 1995. On 1 January 1991, the School of Art and Design of the Townsville College of TAFE was transferred to JCU. The current name of James Cook University became official on 1 January 1998. In 2003 the University opened an international campus in Singapore. The university further expanded its presence by establishing another campus in Brisbane, Queensland in 2006. JCU Singapore moved campuses in February 2015. The Hon. Tony Abbott MP, Prime Minister of Australia officially opened the new JCU Singapore campus at 149 Sims Drive on 28 June 2015.  Coat of Arms  As a corporate body, James Cook University bears arms comprising four main elements ‚Äì shield, crest (Captain James Cook‚Äôs ship, HMS Endeavour, in full sail), supporters (a pair of brolgas with open wings), and motto. The University motto is Cresente Luce, which means light ever increasing. This motto was first proposed by Professor Frederick Walter Robinson (Doc Robbie), professor of English at the University of Queensland, in 1962 for the then University College of Townsville. The university college was established as a college of the University of Queensland. Adopted in 1963, the motto remained unchanged after James Cook University of North Queensland was established and incorporated in April 1970, and later became James Cook University. Campuses and other facilities James Cook University operates three main campuses, located in the tropical cities of Cairns and Townsville in Australia, and the international city of Singapore. Russo Higher Education delivers JCU courses at its Brisbane centre on behalf of the University. The University also operates study centres in Mackay, Mount Isa and Thursday Island. These study centres provide programs and support for students living in rural and remote areas. =Cairns Campus= The Cairns Campus of James Cook University is located 15 kilometres north of the Cairns central business district, in the suburb of Smithfield. JCU moved to this location from its original inner-city site in 1995. Also located on the campus grounds are Queensland Tropical Health Alliance (QTHA) facilities, Australian Tropical Herbarium (ATH), the Australian Tropical Forest Institute (ATFI), JCU Dental, and The Cairns Institute. Over 4,000 students study at JCU Cairns, including about 385 international students. =Townsville Campus= JCU's Townsville campus is the University‚Äôs largest campus and is located on 386 hectares in the suburb of Douglas, near the army base and the lee of Mount Stuart. Over 13,000 students study at JCU Townsville, including over 1,100 international students. Adjacent to the university is the Townsville Hospital and Tropical North Queensland Institute of TAFE. Originally located in the suburb of Pimlico, the University moved to its current site in 1967. The Discovery Rise project was announced in September 2007. The $1 billion project is aimed at redeveloping the University's Townsville campus. The project was completed in 2015. A second campus, JCU Townsville City, opened in 2015 and is located in Townsville's CBD. The campus delivers a diverse range of progressive facilities and services for the university, business and community organisations. = Singapore International Campus = James Cook University's Singapore campus (JCUS) was opened in 2003. In February 2015, James Cook University Singapore relocated to a new campus at 149 Sims Drive, ceasing operations at its previous campus on Upper Thomson Road, where it had been operating since July 2008. In 2018 there were over 3,000 students studying with JCU Singapore. Courses offered include business, education, information technology, psychology, environmental science, and tourism and hospitality, to international and domestic students. All degrees awarded are accredited by JCU Australia. Unlike its parent institution in Australia, James Cook University Singapore is classified as a private institution under the Ministry of Education's Private Education Act and is accredited by both EduTrust and the Council for Private Education. JCUS was given a \\"Edutrust Star\\" rating by EduTrust in 2015, the first private school to attain this benchmark. =Other facilities= JCU Brisbane, operated by Russo Higher Education, delivers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in business and information technology to international students, on behalf of James Cook University. JCU‚Äôs study centre in Mackay is called the Mackay Education and Research Centre (MERC) and is located at the Mackay Base Hospital. It accommodates the teaching of the Bachelor of Social Work and Bachelor of Nursing Science (pre registration) as well as providing facilities for medical and dental placements. The Mount Isa Centre for Rural and Remote Health (MICRRH) provides training, development and support of the rural and remote health workforce and the management of key health issues in the rural and remote setting. The Centre offers the Bachelor of Nursing Science with a special emphasis on rural, remote and Indigenous health care. There is also a study centre is located in the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine (AITHM) building on Thursday Island, providing teaching and learning facilities for nursing, education and diploma of higher education students in the Torres Strait region, including the northern tip of Australia. The Thursday Island study centre opened in 2003. In 2015, the JCU Townsville City campus was opened in the heart of Townsville City, Flinders Street. The campus provides a unique and progressive blend of teaching and study space, as well as meeting, networking and consultation facilities, where advanced design, technology and ongoing support services on- site all add to the quality of the environment and study experience. The Cairns City campus, located in Shields Street, provides similar facilities and opportunities as those available at the Townsville City campus. Academia The university serves as a catchment area for students from this region and beyond. In 2017, JCU‚Äôs student population was at 21,975, which includes 6,639 International students. In 2001 the university took in its first medical students in its newly formed School of Medicine. An undergraduate veterinary degree was added to the university for the first time in 2006 and in 2009 the Bachelor of Dental Surgery commenced. Today the university offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in arts, humanities and social work; business, law and governance; creative media; education; engineering and planning; healthcare, rehabilitation and psychology; medicine, dentistry and pharmacy; public health; science, including marine biology and environmental science; and veterinary science. Some courses are available externally. In 2007 James Cook University became a member of Innovative Research Universities Australia (now called Innovative Research Universities). Innovative Research Universities (IRU) is a network of seven comprehensive universities committed to conducting research of national and international standing. =School of Law= The School of Law is the only regional law school in Queensland. The JCU Law School offers a comprehensive course that provides entry to the legal profession. The first-year experience has four compulsory non-substantive courses and two substantive courses designed for a staggered introduction to the LLB. The establishment of the School of Law was championed by Sir Joseph Kneipp. =Division of Tropical Health and Medicine= This was formed by a merger of James Cook University and the North Queensland Clinical School in 2000. The library at Douglas Campus University Drive at Douglas Campus Rankings JCU is ranked 138th (sixth in Australia) in the CWTS Leiden ranking. As of 2019, JCU has been awarded five stars for job success by the Good Universities Guide. In 2015, JCU Singapore earned the distinction of being the first private education institution to attain the EduTrust Star quality mark from the Singapore Government. JCU was ranked within the top 300 academic universities worldwide in 2018, and has consistently ranked in the top 400 since 2010, as measured by the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) JCU achieved position 367 in the QS World Rankings in 2016. For 2018, JCU ranked in the top two percent of universities in the world by ARWU. In 2017, JCU was ranked No. 1 in the world for Marine & Freshwater Biology and No. 2 in the world for Biodiversity Conservation In 2018, JCU was ranked 28th of the world‚Äôs universities aged 50 years or under . In the Commonwealth Government's Excellence in Research for Australia 2015 National Report, JCU research received the highest ranking of 'well above world standard' (rating 5) in the areas of environmental sciences, geology, physical geography and environmental geoscience, ecology, plant biology, medical microbiology, and neurosciences. The University also received an 'above world standard' (rating 4) ranking for research in the areas of Earth Sciences, Biological Sciences, and History and Archaeology. Residential colleges St Marks' College University Hall James Cook University's Townsville campus, situated in the suburb of Douglas, has six on-campus residential halls and colleges, which can accommodate 1,231 students. Services offered by these facilities vary from self-catered to fully catered. James Cook University's Cairns campus, situated in the outer northern suburb of Smithfield, has one on-campus self-catered residential hall which can accommodate 300 students. = Townsville = Affiliated colleges Saints Catholic College, first founded in 1964 and run by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Townsville, was formed in 2011 with the amalgamation of the Catholic Colleges of St Raphael and St Paul and the addition of a third wing, St Mary MacKillop Wing, in honour of Australia‚Äôs first Saint. Saints Catholic College provides fully catered accommodation to 298 students. Saint Mark's College, run by the Anglican Diocese of North Queensland, accommodated 154 male and female students until its closure in 2017 due to financial difficulties. The John Flynn College was established in 1968 and is named after Australian Presbyterian minister John Flynn. The college provides fully catered accommodation for more than 200 students. Halls of Residence James Cook University manages three non- denominational halls in Townsville for 621 students. University Hall was the first residence to be established at the University in the 1960s, and is at present the largest of the student residences with 291 fully catered rooms. University Hall opened for student accommodation in 1967 as a co-educational hall of residence and lays claim to being the first co-educational university hall of residence in Australia. George Roberts Hall opened in 2002 with 250 residents in unit style fully catered accommodation. Rotary International House, containing 80 self-catered beds, was established in 1990 with the assistance of Rotary Clubs. Western Halls and Western Courts, former Halls of Residence colleges, closed in 2008 and 2018 respectively. = Cairns = John Grey Hall John Grey Hall, named after Lt. Gen. John Grey, opened in 2018 to meet the need for on-campus accommodation in Cairns. The residential hall, which is managed by UniLodge, accommodates 300 students in self-catered accommodation with plans to expand to accommodate 1000 students. Controversy =Unfair dismissal= In September 2019, the university was ordered to pay $1.2 million in compensation to marine physicist Peter Ridd for being wrongly dismissed of employment, as ruled by the Federal Circuit Court. It followed a ruling by the Federal Circuit Court that the actions of the university, including the repeated censure and ultimate dismissal, were unlawful. JCU had been found to be in violation of the Fair Work Act 2009. The Justice of the Federal Circuit Court stated that the academic institution (JCU) failed to respect the rights to intellectual freedom as per the enterprise agreement. Peter Ridd, a long-term professor whom had been the head of the Physics department from 2009 to 2016, and head of the Marine Geophysical Laboratory at JCU for 15 years, had been critical of the accuracy of studies by the JCU marine studies centre. =Reports of on-campus sexual harassment and assault= The 2017 Australian Human Rights Commission's national survey on campus abuse surveyed 833 JCU students, and showed that the university had the 2nd highest reported proportion of students sexually harassed by a staff member (4.6%), and the 6th highest reported campus sexual harassment overall (25%). Under a 2016 FOI request, JCU had previously said that between 2011 and 2016 there were 9 officially reported cases of sexual abuse and harassment on campus, resulting in no expulsions, no suspensions and 1 person removed from a college. This included a report in 2015 where three males attempted to gang-rape a female student. In 2015 the university promoted a staff member from research officer to academic adviser after he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a student. The acting vice-chancellor claimed \\"there has been a failure of our internal processes\\" and ‚Äúif senior management had been aware that (the staff member had) pleaded guilty he would have been immediately dismissed‚Äù. News Limited published findings contradicting the university's claims alleging that senior management, including the Vice- Chancellor and the University Secretary, were made aware of the guilty plea at the time and prior to the perpetrator's promotion. =University Hall fire and housing crisis= In the early hours of 4 April 2019, a large fire broke out in the A Wing of University Hall requiring the evacuation of over 200 students. There were no serious injuries, although several students were treated for smoke inhalation. Immediately following the fire, the University rushed to find emergency housing for the residents affected. The renovation of the closed Clark Wing at St. Mark's College and construction of the new 'The Village' housing precinct began, and are set to provide replacement housing for all residents from the A and B Wings of University Hall. =Scientific misconduct= An investigation by the UK scientific journal Nature published on January 8, 2020, found that eight JCU studies on the effect of climate change on coral reef fish, one of the studies of which was authored by the JCU educated discredited scientist Oona L√∂nnstedt, had a 100 percent replication failure and thus none of the findings of the original eight studies were found to be correct. Concerns raised about a study L√∂nnstedt published while at JCU included an improbable number of lionfish claimed to have been used in this study, and images of 50 fish provided which clearly appeared to include multiple images of some biological specimens, and two images that had been flipped making two fish appear to be four. A further investigative team of seven scientists led by an aquatic physiologist from Victoria‚Äôs Deakin University conducted an investigation into the discredited scientist educated at JCU between 2010 and 2014, biologist Oona L√∂nnstedt, whom was undertaking PhD studies at the Queensland institution. The investigation was launched after Dr L√∂nnstedt had been found guilty of fabricating data underpinning a study at a Swedish university following her departure from JCU.

During World War II, he negotiated the release of about 31,000 prisoners from German concentration camps, including 450 Danish Jews from the Theresienstadt camp. They were released on 14 April 1945.A Jew talks to Himmler Frank Fox.

Levine (eds.), Bystanders to the Holocaust: A Re-evaluation (Routledge, 2002). The precise number is nowhere officially recorded. A count of the first 21,000 included 8,000 Danes and Norwegians, 5,911 Poles, 2,629 French, 1,615 stateless Jews and 1,124 Germans. The total number of Jews was 6,500 to 11,000 depending on definitions. Also see A. Ilan, Bernadotte in Palestine, 1948 (Macmillan, 1989), p. 37. In 1945, he received a German surrender offer from Heinrich Himmler, though the offer was ultimately rejected. After the war, Bernadotte was unanimously chosen to be the United Nations Security Council mediator in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict of 1947‚Äì1948. He was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1948 by the paramilitary Zionist group Lehi while pursuing his official duties. Upon his death, Ralph Bunche took up his work at the UN, successfully mediating the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and Egypt. Early life Folke Bernadotte was born in Stockholm into the House of Bernadotte, the Swedish royal family. His father, Prince Oscar Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg (formerly Prince Oscar of Sweden, Duke of Gotland), was the second son of King Oscar II of Sweden; his mother, Ebba Munck af Fulkila, had been a lady in waiting to Victoria of Baden, the wife of Crown Prince Gustaf. Oscar had married Ebba without the consent of the King, and so was forced to renounce his Swedish titles; in 1892, he was granted the titles of Prince Bernadotte and Count of Wisborg by his uncle, Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg.original decreeDocumentation by Government of Luxembourg 1892-04-02 Bernadotte attended school in Stockholm, after which he entered training to become a cavalry officer at the Royal Military Academy. He took the officer's exam in 1915, was commissioned a lieutenant in 1918, and subsequently was promoted to the rank of major. Bernadotte represented Sweden in 1933 at the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition, and later served as Swedish commissioner general at the New York World's Fair in 1939‚Äì40. Bernadotte had long been involved with the Swedish Boy Scouts (Sveriges Scoutf√∂rbund), and took over as director of the organization in 1937. At the outbreak of World War II, Bernadotte worked to integrate the scouts into Sweden's defense plan, training them in anti-aircraft work and as medical assistants. Bernadotte was appointed vice chairman of the Swedish Red Cross in 1943.Jewish Virtual Library, Folke Bernadotte Biography. Retrieved 22 March 2007. Diplomatic career =World War II= Count Folke Bernadotte (left) talking to Australian prisoners of war in Sweden during a prisoners exchange, 1943 During the autumns of 1943 and 1944, he organized prisoner exchanges which brought home 11,000 prisoners from Germany via Sweden. While vice-president of the Swedish Red Cross in 1945, Bernadotte attempted to negotiate an armistice between Germany and the Allies. He also led several rescue missions in Germany for the Red Cross. In April 1945, Heinrich Himmler asked Bernadotte to convey a peace proposal to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Harry S. Truman without the knowledge of Adolf Hitler. The main point of the proposal was that Germany would surrender only to the Western Allies (the United Kingdom and the United States), but would be allowed to continue resisting the Soviet Union. According to Bernadotte, he told Himmler that the proposal had no chance of acceptance, but nevertheless he passed it on to the Swedish government and the Western Allies. It had no lasting effect.F. Bernadotte, The fall of the curtain : last days of the Third Reich, English Edition: Cassell 1945.Ilan, pp. 36‚Äì38. =White Buses= A White Bus passes through Odense, Denmark, 17 April 1945Upon the initiative of the Norwegian diplomat Niels Christian Ditleff in the final months of the war, Bernadotte acted as the negotiator for a rescue operation transporting interned Norwegians, Danes and other western European inmates from German concentration camps to hospitals in Sweden. In the spring of 1945, Bernadotte was in Germany when he met Heinrich Himmler, who was briefly appointed commander of an entire German army following the assassination attempt on Hitler the year before. Bernadotte had originally been assigned to retrieve Norwegian and Danish POWs in Germany. He returned on 1 May 1945, the day after Hitler's death. Following an interview, the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet wrote that Bernadotte succeeded in rescuing 15,000 people from German concentration camps, including about 8,000 Danes and Norwegians and 7,000 women of French, Polish, Czech, British, American, Argentinian, and Chinese nationalities. The missions took around two months, and exposed the Swedish Red Cross staff to significant danger, both due to political difficulties and by taking them through areas under Allied bombing. The mission became known for its buses, painted entirely white except for the Red Cross emblem on the side, so that they would not be mistaken for military targets. In total it included 308 personnel (about 20 medics and the rest volunteer soldiers), 36 hospital buses, 19 trucks, seven passenger cars, seven motorcycles, a tow truck, a field kitchen, and full supplies for the entire trip, including food and gasoline, none of which was permitted to be obtained in Germany. A count of 21,000 people rescued included 8,000 Danes and Norwegians, 5,911 Poles, 2,629 French, 1,615 Jews, and 1,124 Germans. After Germany's surrender, the White Buses mission continued in May and June and about 10,000 additional liberated prisoners were thus evacuated. Bernadotte recounted the White Buses mission in his book The End. My Humanitarian Negotiations in Germany in 1945 and Their Political Consequences, published on June 15, 1945 in Swedish. In the book, Bernadotte recounts his negotiations with Himmler and others, and his experience at the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. =Felix Kersten and the White Buses controversy= Following the war, some controversies arose regarding Bernadotte's leadership of the White Buses expedition, some personal and some as to the mission itself. One aspect involved a long-standing feud between Bernadotte and Himmler's personal masseur, Felix Kersten, who had played some role in facilitating Bernadotte's access to Himmler,Raymond Palmer. Felix Kersten and Count Bernadotte: A Question of Rescue, Journal of Contemporary History, vol. 29 (1994) pp. 39‚Äì51. Yehuda Bauer, Jews for Sale? Nazi-Jewish Negotiations, 1933‚Äì1945. Yale University Press, 1994. pp. 241‚Äì149. but whom Bernadotte resisted crediting after the war.Palmer, pp. 46‚Äì48. The resulting feud between Bernadotte and Kersten came to public attention through British historian Hugh Trevor- Roper.Amitzur Ilan. Bernadotte in Palestine, 1948, MacMillan 1989, p. 41. In 1953, Trevor-Roper published an article based on an interview and documents originating with Kersten.H. R. Trevor-Roper. Kersten, Himmler and Count Bernadotte, The Atlantic, vol 7 (1953), pp. 43‚Äì45. The article stated that Bernadotte's role in the rescue operations was that of \\"transport officer, no more\\". Kersten was quoted as saying that, according to Himmler, Bernadotte was opposed to the rescue of Jews and understood \\"the necessity of our fight against World Jewry\\". Shortly following the publication of his article, Trevor-Roper began to retreat from these charges. At the time of his article, Kersten had just been nominated by the Dutch government for the Nobel Peace Prize for thwarting a Nazi plan to deport the entire Dutch population, based primarily on Kersten's own claims to this effect.Trevor-Roper (1953). A later investigation by Dutch historian Louis de Jong concluded that no such plan had existed, however, and that Kersten's documents were partly fabricated.Louis de Jong, 1972, reprinted in German translation: H-H. Wilhelm and L. de Jong. Zwei Legenden aus dem dritten Reich : quellenkritische Studien, Deutsche Verlags- Anstalt 1974, pp. 79‚Äì142. Following these revelations and others, Trevor-Roper told journalist Barbara Amiel in 1995 that he was no longer certain about the allegations, and that Bernadotte may merely have been following his orders to rescue Danish and Norwegian prisoners.Trevor-Roper stated, \\"I am not certain that Bernadotte refused to take Jews. I have some reservations about the documentation here. If he did, it may well have been that he simply had no instructions except in respect of Norwegians and Danes.\\" Barbara Amiel. A Death in Jerusalem (book review), The National Interest, Summer 1995. ; also see Ilan, p. 262, for earlier concessions by Trevor-Roper. See also H. R. Trevor-Roper.

The Strange Case of Himmler's Doctor, Commentary, vol. 23 (1957) pp. 356‚Äì364. A number of other historians have also questioned Kersten's account, concluding that the accusations were based on a forgery or a distortion devised by Kersten.Ilan, pp. 43‚Äì45.G. Fleming. Die Herkunft des 'Bernadotte-Briefs' an Himmler vom 10. M√§rz 1945, Vierteljahrshefte f√ºr Zeitgeschichte, vol. 24, 1978, pp. 571‚Äì600. Some controversy regarding the White Buses trip has also arisen in Scandinavia, particularly regarding the priority given to Scandinavian prisoners.Sune Persson, Folke Bernadotte and the White Buses, J.

Political scientist Sune Persson judged these doubts to be contradicted by the documentary evidence. He concluded, \\"The accusations against Count Bernadotte ... to the effect that he refused to save Jews from the concentration camps are obvious lies\\" and listed many prominent eyewitnesses who testified on Bernadotte's behalf, including the World Jewish Congress representative in Stockholm in 1945.Persson, p. 264. =UN mediator= Folke Bernadotte in 1948 On 20 May 1948, Folke Bernadotte was appointed \\"United Nations Mediator in Palestine\\", in accordance with UN- resolution 186 of 14 May 1948.UNGA@unispal, Resolution 186 (S-2). Appointment and terms of reference of a United Nations Mediator in Palestine (doc.nr. A/RES/186 (S-2)), 14 May 1948 It was the first official mediation in the UN's history. This was necessitated by the immediate violence that followed the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the subsequent unilateral Israeli Declaration of Independence. In this capacity, he succeeded in achieving an initial truce during the subsequent 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and laid the groundwork for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The specific proposals showed the influence of the previously responsible British government, and to a lesser extent the U.S. government. First proposal On 28 June 1948, Bernadotte submitted his first formal proposal in secret to the various parties. He presented the following suggestions to discuss:UNSC@unispal, TEXT OF SUGGESTIONS PRESENTED BY THE UNITED NATIONS MEDIATOR ON PALESTINE TO THE TWO PARTIES ON 28 JUNE 1948 (doc.nr. S/863) *Palestine and Transjordan be reformed as \\"a Union, comprising two Members, one Arab and one Jewish\\", each member with full control over its own affairs, including its foreign relations *Economic union *Fix boundaries by negotiation *Immigration within its own borders should be within the competence of each member *Full protection of religious and minority rights *Guarantees for Holy Places, religious buildings and sites *Return of residents, displaced by the conflict As far as the boundaries of the two Members were concerned, Bernadotte proposed the following for consideration: #Inclusion of the whole or part of the Negev in Arab territory #Inclusion of the whole or part of Western Galilee in the Jewish territory #Inclusion of the City of Jerusalem in Arab territory, with municipal autonomy for the Jewish community and special arrangements for the protection of the Holy Places #Consideration of the status of Jaffa #Establishment of a free port at Haifa, the area of the free port to include the refineries and terminals #Establishment of a free airport at Lydda Historian Elad Ben-Dror asserts that the person who was really responsible for the first Bernadotte Plan was Bernadotte's deputy, Ralph Bunche. Bunche made a major effort to imbue it with his own thinking about the appropriate political solution. He was influenced by the ideas of Dr. Judah Magnes and incorporated them into the plan, chiefly in its basic scheme, which called for a confederation in Palestine rather than a Jewish state and an Arab state.Elad Ben-Dror, Ralph Bunche and the Arab-Israeli Conflict: Mediation and the UN 1947‚Äì1949, pp 70‚Äì71, Routledge Second proposal After the unsuccessful first proposal, Bernadotte continued with a more complex proposal that abandoned the idea of a union and proposed two independent states. This proposal was completed on 16 September 1948, and had as its basis seven \\"basic premises\\" (verbatim):Bernadotte, Folke. To Jerusalem, pp. 238‚Äì239; full report at Unispal: #Peace must return to Palestine and every feasible measure should be taken to ensure that hostilities will not be resumed and that harmonious relations between Arab and Jew will ultimately be restored. #A Jewish State called Israel exists in Palestine and there are no sound reasons for assuming that it will not continue to do so. #The boundaries of this new State must finally be fixed either by formal agreement between the parties concerned or failing that, by the United Nations. #Adherence to the principle of geographical homogeneity and integration, which should be the major objective of the boundary arrangements, should apply equally to Arab and Jewish territories, whose frontiers should not therefore, be rigidly controlled by the territorial arrangements envisaged in the resolution of 29 November. #The right of innocent people, uprooted from their homes by the present terror and ravages of war, to return to their homes, should be affirmed and made effective, with assurance of adequate compensation for the property of those who may choose not to return. #The City of Jerusalem, because of its religious and international significance and the complexity of interests involved, should be accorded special and separate treatment. #International responsibility should be expressed where desirable and necessary in the form of international guarantees, as a means of allaying existing fears, and particularly with regard to boundaries and human rights. The proposal then made specific suggestions that included (extracts): #The existing indefinite truce should be superseded by a formal peace, or at the minimum, an armistice. #The frontiers between the Arab and Jewish territories, in the absence of agreement between Arabs and Jews, should be established by the United Nations. #The Negev should be defined as Arab territory. #The frontier should run from Al-Faluja north northeast to Ramleh and Lydda (both of which places would be in Arab territory). #Galilee should be defined as Jewish territory. #Haifa should be declared a free port, and Lydda airport should be declared a free airport. #The City of Jerusalem, which should be understood as covering the area defined in the resolution of the General Assembly of 29 November, should be treated separately and should be placed under effective United Nations control with maximum feasible local autonomy for its Arab and Jewish communities with full safeguards for the protection of the Holy Places and sites and free access to them and for religious freedom. #The United Nations should establish a Palestine conciliation commission. #The right of the Arab refugees to return to their homes in Jewish-controlled territory at the earliest possible date should be affirmed by the United Nations, and their repatriation, resettlement and economic and social rehabilitation, and payment of adequate compensation for the property of those choosing not to return, should be supervised and assisted by the United Nations conciliation commission. With respect to the refugee issue, Bernadotte said, > It is ... undeniable that no settlement can be just and complete if > recognition is not accorded to the right of the Arab refugee to return to > the home from which he has been dislodged by the hazards and strategy of the > armed conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. The majority of these > refugees have come from territory which ... was to be included in the Jewish > State. The exodus of Palestinian Arabs resulted from panic created by > fighting in their communities, by rumours concerning real or alleged acts of > terrorism, or expulsion. It would be an offence against the principles of > elemental justice if these innocent victims of the conflict were denied the > right to return to their homes while Jewish immigrants flow into Palestine, > and, indeed, at least offer the threat of permanent replacement of the Arab > refugees who have been rooted in the land for centuries.From the \\"Progress > Report of the United Nations Mediator on Palestine by Folke Bernadotte. 16 > September 1948. United Nations General Assembly Doc. A/648. Part one, > section V, paragraph 6. Bernadotte's second proposal was prepared in consultation with British and American emissaries. The degree to which they influenced the proposal is poorly known, since the meetings were kept strictly secret and all documents were destroyed,Ilan, pp. 186‚Äì191. but Bernadotte apparently \\"found that the U.S.-U.K., proposals were very much in accord with his own views\\" and the two emissaries expressed the same opinion.Gazit, Mordechai. American and British Diplomacy and the Bernadotte Mission. The Historical Journal, vol. 29, 1986, pp. 677‚Äì696. The secret meetings were publicly exposed in October, only nine days before the U.S. presidential elections, causing U.S. President Harry S. Truman great embarrassment. Truman reacted by making a strongly pro-Zionist declaration, which contributed to the defeat of the Bernadotte plan in the UN during the next two months. Also contributing was the failure of the cease- fire and continuation of the fighting.Ilan, pp. 244‚Äì247. Count Bernadotte street sign in Gaza City, Gaza Strip After Bernadotte's death, his assistant American mediator Ralph Bunche was appointed to replace him. Bunche eventually negotiated a ceasefire, signed on the Greek island of Rhodes. See 1949 Armistice Agreements. Criticism The Israeli government criticized Bernadotte's participation in the negotiations. In July 1948, Bernadotte said that the Arab nations were reluctant to resume the fighting in Palestine and that the conflict now consisted of \\"incidents.\\" A spokesman for the Israeli government replied: \\"Count Bernadotte has described the renewed Arab attacks as 'incidents.' When human lives are lost, when the truce is flagrantly violated and the SC defied, it shows a lack of sensitivity to describe all these as incidents, or to suggest as Count Bernadotte does, that the Arabs had some reason for saying no... Such an apology for aggression does not augur well for any successful resumption by the mediator of his mission.\\"The Palestine Post, 12 July 1948. Other views by Bernadotte Bernadotte wrote that: \\"in putting forward any proposal for the solution of the Palestine problem, one must bear in mind the aspirations of the Jews, the political difficulties and differences of opinion of the Arab leaders, the strategic interests of Great Britain, the financial commitment of the United States and the Soviet Union, the outcome of the war, and finally the authority and prestige of the United Nations.\\"Diary of Folke Bernadotte, To Jerusalem, Hodder & Stoughton, 1951, pp. 114‚Äì115 Assassination Prince Oscar Bernadotte's family tomb at the Northern Cemetery in Stockholm where the remains of Folke Bernadotte also are interred Bernadotte was assassinated on Friday 17 September 1948 by members of the armed Jewish Zionist group Lehi, better known outside Israel as the Stern Gang or Stern Group. Immediately after Bernadotte was pronounced dead, his body was moved to the YMCA, before being taken to Haifa and then flown back to Sweden, where the state funeral was attended by Abba Eban on behalf of Israel. Bernadotte was survived by a widow and two sons, a 12-year-old and a 17-year-old. He was buried in Prince Oscar Bernadotte's family tomb at the Northern Cemetery in Stockholm.Norra begravningsplatsen =Planning and background= The Lehi group regarded Bernadotte as a stooge of the British and their Arab allies and therefore as a serious threat to the emerging state of Israel.Heller, pp, 239‚Äì255. Most immediately, a truce was in force, and Lehi feared that the Israeli leadership would agree to Bernadotte's peace proposals, which they considered disastrous.Heller, passim.Ben-Yehuda, Nachman. Political Assassinations by Jews. SUNY Press 1993 , pp. 267‚Äì274. They did not know that the Israeli leaders had already decided to reject Bernadotte's plans and to take the military option.Ilan, Amitzur. Bernadotte in Palestine. MacMillan 1989 , pp. 200‚Äì201.Shamir, loc. cit., p. 241. The killing was approved by the three-man 'center' of Lehi: Yitzhak Yezernitsky (the future Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak Shamir), Nathan Friedmann (also called Natan Yellin-Mor) and Yisrael Eldad (also known as Scheib). A fourth leader, Emmanuel Strassberg (Hanegbi) was also suspected by the Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion of being part of the group that had decided on the assassination.A. Ilan, Bernadotte in Palestine, 1948 (Macmillan, 1989) p. 194. J. Bowyer Bell, Assassination in International Politics, International Studies Quarterly, vol 16, March 1972, 59‚Äî82. Review of Kati Marton's biography. The assassination was planned by the Lehi operations chief in Jerusalem, Yehoshua Zettler. =The attack= A four-man team, consisting of Yehoshua Cohen, Yitzhak Ben-Moshe (Markovitz), Avraham Steinberg, and Meshulam Makover, ambushed Bernadotte's motorcade in Jerusalem's Katamon neighborhood. The team left a Lehi base in a jeep and set up a makeshift roadblock at Ben Zion Guini Square, off Hapalmach Street, and waited in the jeep. When Bernadotte's motorcade approached, Cohen, Ben-Moshe, and Steinberg got out and approached it, while Makover, the driver, remained in the jeep. Captain Moshe Hillman, the motorcade's Israeli liaison officer, who was sitting in the leading UN vehicle, called out in Hebrew to let them through, but was ignored. Cohen came up to Bernadotte's sedan and fired through an open window, hitting Bernadotte and a French officer who was sitting beside him, Colonel Andr√© Serot. Both Bernadotte and Serot were killed. Ben-Moshe and Steinberg shot at the tires of the UN vehicles, while Cohen finished the magazine by firing at the radiator. The driver of the sedan, Colonel Begley, got out and tried to grapple with Cohen as he fired his last shots, but was burned in the face by the gun flashes. Ben-Moshe and Steinberg then rushed back and mounted the jeep, which quickly accelerated down a side road, while Cohen ran away from the scene across a roadside field. \\"A murder waiting to happen\\" book review in Haaretz, 1 October 2006. Verified 23 October 2008.Bell, Bowyer J.: Terror out of Zion (1976), p. 338‚Äì339 Following the shooting, Bernadotte's sedan sped to the Hadassah Mount Scopus Hospital, despite damage to the radiator; the lead vehicle followed as its tires came apart. At the hospital, Bernadotte was pronounced dead. General √Öge Lundstr√∂m, who was in the UN vehicle, described the incident as follows: > In the Katamon quarter, we were held up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in > a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same > moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of > this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint.

Press Release, Doc.nr. PAL/298. All four members of the hit team made it to the religious community of Shaarei Pina, where they hid with local Haredi Lehi sympathizers. After a few days in hiding, they fled to Tel Aviv in the back of a furniture truck. =Investigation= Lehi leaders initially denied responsibility for the attack. Only later did Lehi take responsibility for the killings in the name of Hazit Hamoledet (the National Front), a name they copied from a war-time Bulgarian resistance group.Heller, Joseph. The Stern Gang; Ideology, Politics and Terror 1940‚Äì1949. Frank Cass 1995 , pp. 252‚Äì253. For the text of the announcement, see: Stanger, C.D. A haunting legacy: The assassination of Count Bernadotte. Middle East Journal, vol. 42, 1988, pp 260‚Äì272. Lehi was forcibly disarmed and many members were arrested, but nobody was charged with the killings. The Israel Police, along with the military police and security services, investigated the assassination, but failed to identify any of the participants in the assassination, and the case was eventually closed without any of the participants having been identified. It has been suggested that the reasons for the failure of the investigation were poor coordination between these bodies, which resulted in information that may have assisted the police not being turned over to them, and the lack of proficiency among police officers and investigators in the early days of the Israel Police. The murder case was identified as 148/48 in Israeli police records. Nathan Yellin-Mor (center) and Matityahu Shmueliwitz in front of the Acre prison, after their release in 1949 Yellin-Mor and another Lehi member, Mattityahu Shmulevitz, were charged with belonging to a terrorist organization. They were found guilty but immediately released and pardoned. Yellin-Mor had meanwhile been elected to the first Knesset.Heller, pp. 261‚Äì270. Betty Knut-Lazarus, a Lehi militant, and the granddaughter of composer Alexander Scriabin, was also imprisoned for being allegedly involved in the killing, before being subsequently released.Lazaris, V. (2000). –¢—Ä–∏ –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω—ã. Tel Aviv: Lado, pp. 363‚Äì368 Years later, Cohen's role was uncovered by David Ben-Gurion's biographer Michael Bar Zohar, while Cohen was working as Ben-Gurion's personal bodyguard. The first public admission of Lehi's role in the killing was made on the anniversary of the assassination in 1977.Yair Amikam, Yediot Aharonot, 28 February 1977: interview with Yehoshua Zetler and Yisrael Eldad. English translation in Journal of Palestine Studies, vol 6, no. 4 (1977) 145‚Äì147. The statute of limitations for the murder had expired in 1971.Ilan, p. 193. In 1988, two years after Cohen's death, Zettler and Makover publicly confessed their role in the assassination and confirmed that Cohen had killed Bernadotte. The weapon which was used in the assassination (a Schmeisser, serial number 2581) was lost, and was only found again in 2018 during an inventory check in the Heritage house of the Israel Police, when an unidentified box was found to contain a Schmeisser gun and the curator, Shlomi Shitrit, decided to identify the history of the weapon. Prior to the finding it was believed that it had been destroyed. =Diplomatic fallout= Sir Alexander Cadogan, Ernest Bevin, George Marshall, William Lyon Mackenzie King The day after the murders, the United Nations Security Council condemned the killing of Bernadotte as \\"a cowardly act which appears to have been committed by a criminal group of terrorists in Jerusalem while the United Nations representative was fulfilling his peace-seeking mission in the Holy Land.\\"Security Council 57 (1948) Resolution of 18 September 1948. The Swedish government believed that Bernadotte had been assassinated by Israeli government agents.Ilan, p. 224. They publicly attacked the inadequacy of the Israeli investigation, and campaigned unsuccessfully to delay Israel's admission to the United Nations.Ilan, p. 238. In 1950, Sweden recognized Israel, but relations remained frosty despite Israeli attempts to mollify Sweden, such as through the planting of a Bernadotte Forest by the Jewish National Fund in Israel.Ilan, p. 241. At a ceremony in Tel Aviv in May 1995, attended by the Swedish deputy prime minister, Israeli Foreign Minister and Labor Party member Shimon Peres issued a \\"condemnation of terror, thanks for the rescue of the Jews and regret that Bernadotte was murdered in a terrorist way\\", adding that \\"We hope this ceremony will help in healing the wound.\\"\\"Israel belatedly condemns U.N. negotiator's murder\\" and \\"Israel tries to ease tensions with Sweden\\" (two articles), Reuters News, 15 May 1995. \\"Peres apologizes for assassination of Bernadotte,\\" Jerusalem Post, 15 May 1995, p. 1. Ralph Bunche, Bernadotte's American deputy, succeeded him as U.N. mediator. Bunche was successful in bringing about the signing of the 1949 Armistice Agreements, for which he received the Nobel Peace Prize. =Awards and memorials= Folke Bernadotte Memorial in Krus√•, Denmark In 1998, Bernadotte was posthumously awarded one of the first three Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Medals, given to UN peacekeepers who are killed in the line of duty.The First Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Medals: Biographical Notes.

Garcia was the singer, songwriter, and lead guitarist of the San Francisco-based group that emerged from the Haight-Ashbury psychedelic-drug-and-music scene in the mid-1960s.\\": \\"Guitarist, singer, and songwriter Jerry Garcia was best known as a founding member of the Grateful Dead, the rock band for which he served as de facto leader for 30 years, from 1965 until his death in 1995. [...] In addition to his musical efforts, Garcia was viewed as an icon and spokesman for the hippie movement of the 1960s, the counterculture fueled by psychedelic drugs and rock & roll that the Grateful Dead embodied for their fervent fans, the Deadheads, as well as to the public at large.\\" Although he disavowed the role, Garcia was viewed by many as the leader or \\"spokesman\\" of the group. As one of its founders, Garcia performed with the Grateful Dead for their entire 30-year career (1965‚Äì1995). Garcia also founded and participated in a variety of side projects, including the Saunders‚ÄìGarcia Band (with longtime friend Merl Saunders), the Jerry Garcia Band, Old & In the Way, the Garcia/Grisman acoustic duo, Legion of Mary, and New Riders of the Purple Sage (which Garcia co-founded with John Dawson and David Nelson). He also released several solo albums, and contributed to a number of albums by other artists over the years as a session musician. He was well known for his distinctive guitar playing, and was ranked 13th in Rolling Stones \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" cover story in 2003. In the 2015 version of the list he was ranked at #46. Garcia was also renowned for his musical and technical ability, particularly his ability to play a variety of instruments, and his ability to sustain long improvisations with the Grateful Dead. Garcia believed that improvisation took stress away from his playing and allowed him to make spur of the moment decisions that he would not have made intentionally. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Garcia noted that \\"my own preferences are for improvisation, for making it up as I go along. The idea of picking, of eliminating possibilities by deciding, that's difficult for me\\". Later in life, Garcia struggled with diabetes and in 1986 went into a diabetic coma that nearly cost him his life. Although his overall health improved somewhat after that, he continued to struggle with obesity, smoking, and longstanding heroin and cocaine addictions. He was staying in a California drug rehabilitation facility when he died of a heart attack on August 9, 1995, at the age of 53.: \\"JERRY Garcia, white-bearded leader of the 1960s cult rock band the Grateful Dead, died yesterday in a drug rehabilitation centre. The 53-year-old erstwhile hippie who founded the band 30 years ago was discovered dead by a counsellor at Serenity Knowles, a residential drug treatment centre near his home in Marin County, California.\\" Early life Garcia's ancestors on his father's side were from Galicia in northwest Spain. His mother's ancestors were Irish and Swedish.: \\"The Romans conquered the territory, which they called Galicia, in the second century B.C. The city now known as La Coru√±a was a small but important trading post for the Romans for several centuries. [...] If you were to scour the streets and alleys of La Coru√±a, you might well encounter a Garcia who can trace the lineage of Jerry's family back many centuries. But in the United States, where two branches of the Garcias settled in the second decade of this century, we must rely on the memories of the lone surviving sibling from the original transatlantic voyage, Leonor Garcia Ross ‚Äî still spry at ninety ‚Äî and on family lore passed along to Jerry's brothers and cousins. [...] Though Leonor considers La Coru√±a the family's ancestral home, the Garcias who emerge from the family's oral history in the mid-nineteenth century actually came from a nearby coastal fishing village called Sada, on an inlet called the R√≠a de Betanzos.\\" He was born in the Excelsior District of San Francisco, California, on August 1, 1942, to Jose Ramon \\"Joe\\" Garcia and Ruth Marie \\"Bobbie\\" (n√©e Clifford) Garcia, who was herself born in San Francisco.: \\"Sometime in 1934 Joe met the woman of his dreams, a twenty-four- year-old nurse at San Francisco General Hospital named Ruth Marie Clifford. Ruth also had deep immigrant roots stretching back even further than the Garcias': Her grandfather Patrick Clifford was born in Ireland in the middle of the nineteenth century and emigrated to California, where he married another Irish expatriate named Ellen Callahan. Ruth's father, William Henry Clifford, was born in San Francisco in 1883. In his twenties he got involved in the laundry business and married nineteen-year-old Tillie May Olsen, whose ancestors had sailed to California from Sweden around the time of the Gold Rush. Shortly after they were married, Bill and Tillie bought a newly built home on the fringes of the Excelsior district. The house at 87 Harrington Street, where Jerry would spend much of his youth, was built in 1907. In June 1910 Jerry's mother, Ruth, was born at that address. She lived there until she married Joe Garcia.\\" His parents named him after composer Jerome Kern.McNally, pg. 7 Jerome John was their second child, preceded by Clifford Ramon \\"Tiff\\", who was born in 1937.McNally, pg. 6 Shortly before Clifford's birth, their father and a partner leased a building in downtown San Francisco and turned it into a bar, partly in response to Jose being blackballed from a musicians' union for moonlighting. Garcia was influenced by music at an early age, taking piano lessons for much of his childhood. His father was a retired professional musician and his mother enjoyed playing the piano. His father's extended family‚Äîwhich had emigrated from Spain in 1919‚Äîwould often sing during reunions. In 1946 two-thirds of four year-old Garcia's right middle finger was cut off by his brother in a wood splitting accident while the family was vacationing in the Santa Cruz Mountains.McNally, pg. 8\\"Garcia, Jerry.\\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed.. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed September 29, 2014. Garcia later confessed that he often used it to his advantage in his youth, showing it off to other children in his neighborhood. Less than a year after this incident his father died in a fly fishing accident when the family was vacationing near Arcata in Northern California. He slipped after entering the Trinity River, part of the Six Rivers National Forest, and drowned before other fishermen could reach him. Although Garcia claimed he saw the incident, Dennis McNally, author of the book A Long Strange Trip: The Inside Story of the Grateful Dead, argues Garcia formed the memory after hearing others repeat the story. Blair Jackson, who wrote Garcia: An American Life, argues a local newspaper article describing Jose's death failed to mention Jerry being present when he died. =Excelsior District= Following his father's death, Garcia's mother Ruth took over her husband's bar, buying out his partner for full ownership. She began working full-time there, sending Jerry and his brother to live nearby with her parents, Tillie and William Clifford. During the five-year period in which he lived with his grandparents, Garcia enjoyed a large amount of autonomy and attended Monroe Elementary School. At the school, Garcia was greatly encouraged in his artistic abilities by his third grade teacher: through her, he discovered that \\"being a creative person was a viable possibility in life\\" According to Garcia, it was around this time that he was opened up to country and bluegrass music by his grandmother, whom he recalled enjoyed listening to the Grand Ole Opry. His elder brother, Clifford, however, staunchly believed the contrary, insisting that Garcia was \\"fantasizing all [that] ... she'd been to Opry, but she didn't listen to it on the radio.\\" It was at this point that Garcia started playing the banjo, his first stringed instrument. =Menlo Park= In 1953, Garcia's mother married Wally Matusiewicz.McNally, pg. 10 Subsequently, Garcia and his brother moved back home with their mother and new stepfather. However, due to the roughneck reputation of their neighborhood at the time, Garcia's mother moved their family to Menlo Park. During their stay in Menlo Park, Garcia became acquainted with racism and antisemitism, things he disliked intensely. The same year, Garcia was also introduced to rock and roll and rhythm and blues by his brother, and enjoyed listening to the likes of Ray Charles, John Lee Hooker, B. B. King, Hank Ballard, and, later, Chuck Berry. Clifford often memorized the vocals for his favorite songs, and would then make Garcia learn the harmony parts, a move to which Garcia later attributed much of his early ear training. In mid-1957, Garcia began smoking cigarettes and was introduced to marijuana. Garcia would later reminisce about the first time he smoked marijuana: \\"Me and a friend of mine went up into the hills with two joints, the San Francisco foothills, and smoked these joints and just got so high and laughed and roared and went skipping down the streets doing funny things and just having a helluva time\\". During this time, Garcia also studied at what is now the San Francisco Art Institute. The teacher there was Wally Hedrick, an artist who came to prominence during the 1960s. During the classes, he often encouraged Garcia in his drawing and painting skills.McNally, pg. 14 Hedrick also introduced Garcia to the fiction of Jack Kerouac, whom Garcia later cited as a major influence. =San Francisco= In June of the same year, Garcia graduated from the local Menlo Oaks school. He then moved with his family back to San Francisco, where they lived in an apartment above the family bar, a newly built replacement for the original, that had been torn down to make way for a freeway entrance.McNally, pg. 12 Two months later, on Garcia's fifteenth birthday, his mother bought an accordion for him, to his great disappointment. Garcia had long been captivated by many rhythm and blues artists, especially Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, leaving him craving an electric guitar. After some pleading, his mother exchanged the accordion for a Danelectro with a small amplifier at a local pawnshop. Garcia's stepfather, who was somewhat proficient with instruments, helped tune his guitar to an unusual open tuning.McNally, pg. 13 =Cazadero= After a short stint at Denman Junior High School, Garcia attended tenth grade at Balboa High School in 1958, where he often got into trouble for skipping classes and fighting.McNally, pg. 15 Consequently, in 1959, Garcia's mother again moved the family to a safer environment, to Cazadero, a small town in Sonoma County, north of San Francisco. This turn of events did not sit well with Garcia, who had to travel by bus to Analy High School in Sebastopol, the nearest school. Garcia did, however, join a band at his school known as the Chords. After performing in and winning a contest, the band's reward was recording a song. They chose \\"Raunchy\\" by Bill Justis.McNally, pg. 16 Recording career =Relocation and band beginnings= Haight and Ashbury, center of the San Francisco neighborhood where the Grateful Dead shared a house at 710 Ashbury from fall 1966 to spring 1968. Garcia stole his mother's car in 1960, and as punishment he was forced to join the United States Army. He received basic training at Fort Ord. After training, he was transferred to Fort Winfield Scott in the Presidio of San Francisco. Garcia spent most of his time in the army at his leisure, missing roll call and accruing many counts of being AWOL.McNally, pg. 17 As a result, Garcia was given a general discharge on December 14, 1960.McNally, pg. 21 In January 1961, Garcia drove down to East Palo Alto to see Laird Grant, an old friend from middle school.McNally, pg. 22 He had bought a 1950 Cadillac sedan from a cook in the army, which barely made it to Grant's residence before it broke down. Garcia spent the next few weeks sleeping where friends would allow, eventually using his car as a home. Through Grant, Garcia met Dave McQueen in February, who, after hearing Garcia perform some blues music, introduced him to local people and to the Chateau, a rooming house located near Stanford University which was then a popular hangout.McNally, pg. 23 On February 20, 1961, Garcia got into a car with Paul Speegle, a sixteen-year-old artist and acquaintance of Garcia; Lee Adams, the house manager of the Chateau and driver of the car; and Alan Trist, a companion of theirs. After speeding past the Palo Alto Veterans Hospital, the car encountered a curve and, traveling around , collided with the guard rail, sending the car rolling turbulently.McNally, pg. 24 Garcia was hurled through the windshield of the car into a nearby field with such force he was literally thrown out of his shoes and would later be unable to recall the ejection. Lee Adams, the driver, and Alan Trist, who was seated in the back, were thrown from the car as well, suffering from abdominal injuries and a spine fracture, respectively. Garcia escaped with a broken collarbone, while Speegle, still in the car, was fatally injured. The accident served as an awakening for Garcia, who later commented: \\"That's where my life began. Before then I was always living at less than capacity. I was idling. That was the slingshot for the rest of my life. It was like a second chance. Then I got serious\\". It was at this time that Garcia began to realize that he needed to begin playing the guitar in earnest‚Äîa move which meant giving up his love of drawing and painting.McNally, pg. 25 In April 1961, Garcia first met Robert Hunter, who would become a long-time friend of and lyricist for the Grateful Dead, collaborating principally with Garcia. The two involved themselves in the South Bay and San Francisco art and music scenes, sometimes playing at Menlo Park's Kepler's Books. Garcia performed his first concert with Hunter, each earning five dollars. Garcia and Hunter also played in bands (the Wildwood Boys and the Hart Valley Drifters) with David Nelson, who would later play with Garcia in the New Riders of the Purple Sage and contribute to several Grateful Dead album songs. In 1962, Garcia met Phil Lesh, the eventual bassist of the Grateful Dead, during a party in Menlo Park's bohemian Perry Lane neighborhood (where author Ken Kesey lived). Lesh would later write in his autobiography that Garcia reminded him of pictures he had seen of the composer Claude Debussy, with his \\"dark, curly hair, goatee, Impressionist eyes\\". While attending another party in Palo Alto, Lesh approached Garcia to suggest they record Garcia on Lesh's tape recorder and produce a radio show for the progressive, community-supported Berkeley radio station KPFA. Using an old Wollensak tape recorder, they recorded \\"Matty Groves\\" and \\"The Long Black Veil\\", among several other tunes. The recordings became a central feature of a 90-minute KPFA special broadcast, \\"The Long Black Veil and Other Ballads: An Evening with Jerry Garcia\\". The link between KPFA and the Grateful Dead continues to this day, having included many fundraisers, interviews, live concert broadcasts, taped band performances and all-day or all-weekend \\"Dead- only\\" marathons. Garcia soon began playing and teaching acoustic guitar and banjo. One of Garcia's students was Bob Matthews, who later engineered many of the Grateful Dead's albums. Matthews attended Menlo-Atherton High School and was friends with Bob Weir, and on New Year's Eve 1963, he introduced Weir and Garcia. Between 1962 and 1964, Garcia sang and performed mainly bluegrass, old-time, and folk music. One of the bands Garcia performed with was the Sleepy Hollow Hog Stompers, a bluegrass act. The group consisted of Garcia on guitar, banjo, vocals, and harmonica, Marshall Leicester on banjo, guitar, and vocals, and Dick Arnold on fiddle and vocals. Soon after this, Garcia, Weir, Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan, and several of their friends formed a jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Around this time, the psychedelic drug LSD was gaining popularity. Garcia first began using LSD in 1964; later, when asked how it changed his life, he remarked: \\"Well, it changed everything [...] the effect was that it freed me because I suddenly realized that my little attempt at having a straight life and doing that was really a fiction and just wasn't going to work out. Luckily I wasn't far enough into it for it to be shattering or anything; it was like a realization that just made me feel immensely relieved.\\" In 1965, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions evolved into the Warlocks, with the addition of Phil Lesh on bass guitar and Bill Kreutzmann on percussion. However, the band discovered that another group (which would later become the Velvet Underground) had recently selected the same name. In response, Garcia came up with \\"Grateful Dead\\" by opening a Funk & Wagnalls dictionary to an entry for \\"Grateful dead\\".:Lesh describes the dictionary as being \\"Britannica World Language Dictionary\\". The definition for \\"Grateful dead\\" was \\"a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial\\".Stories about the \\"Grateful Dead\\" appear in many cultures. The band's first reaction was disapproval. Garcia later explained the group's reaction: \\"I didn't like it really, I just found it to be really powerful. [Bob] Weir didn't like it, [Bill] Kreutzmann didn't like it and nobody really wanted to hear about it.\\" Despite their dislike of the name, it quickly spread by word of mouth, and soon became their official title. =Career with the Grateful Dead= Jerry Garcia in 1969 Garcia served as lead guitarist, as well as one of the principal vocalists and songwriters of the Grateful Dead for its entire career. Garcia composed such songs as \\"Dark Star\\", \\"Franklin's Tower\\", and \\"Scarlet Begonias\\", among many others. Robert Hunter, an ardent collaborator with the band, wrote the lyrics to all but a few of Garcia's songs. Garcia was well-noted for his \\"soulful extended guitar improvisations\\", which would frequently feature interplay between him and his fellow band members. His fame, as well as the band's, arguably rested on their ability to never play a song the same way twice. Often, Garcia would take cues from rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, remarking that \\"there are some [...] kinds of ideas that would really throw me if I had to create a harmonic bridge between all the things going on rhythmically with two drums and Phil [Lesh's] innovative bass playing. Weir's ability to solve that sort of problem is extraordinary. [...] Harmonically, I take a lot of my solo cues from Bob.\\" Garcia in 1978, at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum When asked to describe his approach to soloing, Garcia commented: \\"It keeps on changing. I still basically revolve around the melody and the way it's broken up into phrases as I perceive them. With most solos, I tend to play something that phrases the way the melody does; my phrases may be more dense or have different value, but they'll occur in the same places in the song. [...]\\" Garcia and the band toured almost constantly from their formation in 1965 until Garcia's death in 1995. Periodically, there were breaks due to exhaustion or health problems, often due to Garcia's drug use. During their three-decade span, the Grateful Dead played 2,314 shows. Garcia and Mickey Hart in 1987 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre Garcia's guitar-playing was eclectic. He melded elements from the various kinds of music that influenced him. Echoes of bluegrass playing (such as Arthur Smith and Doc Watson) could be heard. There was also early rock (like Lonnie Mack, James Burton, and Chuck Berry), contemporary blues (Freddie King and Lowell Fulsom), country and western (Roy Nichols and Don Rich), and jazz (Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt) to be heard in Garcia's style. Don Rich was the sparkling country guitar player in Buck Owens's \\"the Buckaroos\\" band of the 1960s, but besides Rich's style, both Garcia's pedal steel guitar playing (on Grateful Dead records and others) and his standard electric guitar work, were influenced by another of Owens's Buckaroos of that time, pedal steel player Tom Brumley. And as an improvisational soloist, John Coltrane was one of his greatest personal and musical influences. Garcia later described his playing style as having \\"descended from barroom rock and roll, country guitar. Just 'cause that's where all my stuff comes from. It's like that blues instrumental stuff that was happening in the late Fifties and early Sixties, like Freddie King.\\" Garcia's style could vary with the song being played and the instrument he was using, but his playing had a number of so-called \\"signatures\\". Among these were lead lines based on rhythmic triplets (examples include the songs \\"Good Morning Little School Girl\\", \\"New Speedway Boogie\\", \\"Brokedown Palace\\", \\"Deal\\", \\"Loser\\", \\"Truckin'\\", \\"That's It for the Other One\\", \\"U.S. Blues\\", \\"Sugaree\\", and \\"Don't Ease Me In\\"). =Side projects= In addition to the Grateful Dead, Garcia had numerous side projects, the most notable being the Jerry Garcia Band. He was also involved with various acoustic projects such as Old & In the Way and other bluegrass bands, including collaborations with noted bluegrass mandolinist David Grisman. The documentary film Grateful Dawg, co-produced by Gillian Grisman and former NBC producer Pamela Hamilton chronicles the deep, long-term friendship between Garcia and Grisman. When Garcia and Grisman released Not For Kids Only, Hamilton produced their interview and concert for NBC. After several years of producing stories on the Grateful Dead and band members' side projects, Hamilton interviewed Bob Weir for a feature on Garcia's death marking the end of an era. Other groups of which Garcia was a member at one time or another include the Black Mountain Boys, photo at eyecandypromo.com. Retrieved April 12, 2013. Legion of Mary, Reconstruction, and the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band. Garcia was also a fan of jazz artists and improvisation: he played with jazz keyboardists Merl Saunders and Howard Wales for many years in various groups and jam sessions, and he appeared on saxophonist Ornette Coleman's 1988 album, Virgin Beauty. His collaboration with Merl Saunders and Muruga Booker on the world music album Blues From the Rainforest launched the Rainforest Band. Garcia also spent a lot of time in the recording studio helping out fellow musician friends in session work, often adding guitar, vocals, pedal steel, sometimes banjo and piano and even producing. He played on over 50 studio albums, the styles of which were eclectic and varied, including bluegrass, rock, folk, blues, country, jazz, electronic music, gospel, funk, and reggae. Artists who sought Garcia's help included the likes of Jefferson Airplane (most notably Surrealistic Pillow, Garcia being listed as their \\"spiritual advisor\\"). Garcia himself recalled in a mid-1967 interview that he'd played the high lead on \\"Today,\\" played on \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\" and \\"Comin' Back to Me\\" on that album. Others include Tom Fogerty, David Bromberg, Robert Hunter (Liberty, on Relix Records), Paul Pena, Peter Rowan, Warren Zevon, Country Joe McDonald, Pete Sears, Ken Nordine, Ornette Coleman, Bruce Hornsby, Bob Dylan, It's a Beautiful Day, and many more. In 1995 Garcia played on three tracks for the CD Blue Incantation by guitarist Sanjay Mishra, making it his last studio collaboration. Throughout the early 1970s, Garcia, Lesh, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, and David Crosby collaborated intermittently with MIT-educated composer and biologist Ned Lagin on several projects in the realm of early ambient music; these include the album Seastones (released by the Ned Lagin on the Round Records subsidiary) and L, an unfinished dance work composed by Ned Lagin. In 1970, Garcia participated in the soundtrack for the film Zabriskie Point. Garcia also played pedal steel guitar for fellow-San Francisco musicians New Riders of the Purple Sage from their initial dates in 1969 to October 1971, when increased commitments with the Dead forced him to opt out of the group. He appears as a band member on their debut album New Riders of the Purple Sage, and produced Home, Home on the Road, a 1974 live album by the band. He also contributed pedal steel guitar to the enduring hit \\"Teach Your Children\\" by Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young. Garcia also played steel guitar licks on Brewer & Shipley's 1970 album Tarkio. Despite considering himself a novice on the pedal steel, Garcia routinely ranked high in player polls. After a long lapse from playing the pedal steel, he played it once more during several of the Dead's concerts with Bob Dylan in the summer of 1987. In 1988, Garcia agreed to perform at several major benefits including the \\"Soviet American Peace Walk\\" concert at the Band Shell, in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, that drew 25,000 people. He was asked to play by longtime friend and fellow musician, Pete Sears, who played piano with all the bands that day, and also procured all the other musicians. Garcia, Mickey Hart and Steve Parish played the show, then were given a police escort to a Grateful Dead show across the bay later that night. Garcia also played with Nick Gravenites and Pete Sears at a benefit given for Vietnam Veteran and peace activist Brian Willson, who lost both legs below the knee when he attempted to block a train carrying weapons to military dictatorships in El Salvador. Having previously studied at the San Francisco Art Institute as a teenager, Garcia embarked on a second career in the visual arts in the late 1980s. He created a number of drawings, etchings, and water colors. Garcia's artistic endeavors were represented by the Weir Gallery in Berkeley, California from 1989 to 1996. During this period, Roberta Weir (unrelated to Garcia's bandmate Bob Weir) provided Garcia with new art techniques to use, sponsored his first solo show in 1990, and prepared blank etching plates for him to draw on.S.F.Chronicle, December 9, 1992 These would then be processed and printed by gallery staff and brought back to Garcia for approval and signature, usually with a passing of stacks of paper backstage at a Dead show. His annual shows at the Weir Gallery garnered much attention, leading to further shows in New York and other cities. Garcia was an early adopter of digital art media; his artistic style was as varied as his musical output, and he carried small notebooks for pen and ink sketches wherever he toured. Roberta Weir continues to maintain an archive of the artwork of Jerry Garcia. Perhaps the most widely seen pieces of Jerry Garcia's art are the many editions of men's neckties produced by Stonehenge Ltd. and Mulberry Neckware. Some began as etchings, other designs came from his drawings, paintings, and digital art. Garcia's artwork has since expanded into everything from hotel rooms, wet suits, men's sport shirts, a women's wear line, boxer shorts, hair accessories, cummerbunds, silk scarves and wool rugs. Personal life Garcia met his first wife, Sara Ruppenthal, in 1963. She was working at the coffee house in the back of Kepler's Books, where Garcia, Hunter, and Nelson regularly performed. They married on April 23, 1963, and on December 8 of that year their daughter Heather was born. Carolyn Adams, a Merry Prankster also known as \\"Mountain Girl\\" or \\"M.G.,\\" had a daughter, Sunshine, with Ken Kesey. Mountain Girl married another Prankster, George Walker, but they soon separated. She and Sunshine then moved into 710 Ashbury with Garcia in late 1966 where they would ultimately live together until 1975. In 1967, Sara and Jerry officially divorced after a long separation. Adams gave birth to Garcia's second and third daughters, Annabelle Walker Garcia (February 2, 1970) and Theresa Adams \\"Trixie\\" Garcia (September 21, 1974). During August 1970, Garcia's mother Ruth was involved in a car crash near Twin Peaks in San Francisco. Garcia, who was recording the album American Beauty at the time, often left the sessions to visit his mother with his brother Clifford. She died on September 28, 1970. In the midst of a March 1973 Grateful Dead engagement at the Nassau Coliseum near New York City, Garcia met Deborah Koons, an aspiring filmmaker from a wealthy Cincinnati, Ohio-based family who would much later marry him and become his widow.: \\"What M.G. didn't know was that Jerry was falling in love with another woman, an aspiring filmmaker named Deborah Koons. She was a few years younger than Jerry, the daughter of wealthy Cincinnati professionals ‚Äî John Fletcher Koons III was a successful businessman and his wife, Patricia Boyle, was a lawyer.\\" After a brief correspondence, he began his relationship with her in mid-1974. This gradually strained his relationship with Adams and culminated in Garcia leaving Adams for Koons in late 1975. The end of his relationship with Koons in 1977 precipitated a brief reconciliation with Adams, including the reestablishment of their household. However, she did not agree with the guitarist's persistent use of narcotics and moved with the children to the Eugene, Oregon area, living near Kesey, in 1978. Following Adams' departure, Garcia had an affair with Amy Moore. She was a Kentucky-born member of the extended \\"Grateful Dead family\\", and the mistress of Texas oil heir Roy Cullen. Their affair lasted circa 1980‚Äì1981, and inspired the Garcia-Hunter song \\"Run for the Roses.\\" Adams and Garcia were married on December 31, 1981, largely as a result of mutual tax exigencies. Despite the legal codification of their union, she remained in Oregon, while Garcia continued to live near the Grateful Dead's offices in San Rafael, California. Garcia lived with a variety of housemates, including longtime Grateful Dead employee and Jerry Garcia Band manager Rock Scully. Scully, who co-managed the Grateful Dead throughout the mid-to-late 1960s before serving as the band's \\"advance man\\" and publicist, was dismissed by the group in 1984 for enabling Garcia's addictions and for allegedly embezzling the Garcia Band's profits. Another housemate was Nora Sage, a Deadhead who became Garcia's housekeeper while studying at the Golden Gate University School of Law. The exact nature of their relationship remains unclear, although it is believed to have been platonic due to Garcia's addictions. She later became his art representative. While they would briefly reunite following his diabetic coma, Garcia and Adams ultimately divorced in 1994. Phil Lesh has subsequently stated that he rarely saw Adams on any of the band tours. In a 1991 Rolling Stone interview, Garcia stated that \\"we haven't really lived together since the Seventies\\". During the autumn of 1978, Garcia developed a friendship with Shimer College student Manasha Matheson, an artist and music enthusiast. They remained friends over the following nine years before initiating a romantic relationship in Hartford, Connecticut on the Grateful Dead's spring 1987 tour. On August 17, 1990, Jerry and Manasha married at their San Anselmo, California home in a spiritual ceremony free of legal convention.\\"Art of Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart and Roberta Weir\\". Weir Gallery. Retrieved July 8, 2015. Jerry and Manasha became parents with the birth of their daughter, Keelin Noel Garcia, on December 20, 1987. In 1991, Garcia expressed his delight in finding the time to \\"actually be a father\\" to Keelin in contrast to his past relationships with his children. A year later, Garcia dedicated his first art book, Paintings, Drawings and Sketches, \\"For Manasha, with love, Jerry.\\"J. Garcia: Paintings, Drawings and Sketches. Pub. Celestial Arts, Berkeley 1992 In January 1993, Barbara \\"Brigid\\" Meier, a former girlfriend from the early 1960s, reentered Garcia's life. According to Meier, he had considered her to be the \\"love of his life\\" and proposed to her during a Hawaiian vacation shortly after their relationship recommenced. The affair with Meier marked the breakup of Jerry's family life with Manasha and Keelin. However, Garcia ended the affair with Meier forty-five days later in Chicago while on tour with the Grateful Dead after she confronted him about his drug use. Shortly thereafter, Garcia renewed his acquaintance with Deborah Koons in the spring of 1993. They married on February 14, 1994, in Sausalito, California. Garcia and Koons were married at the time of his death. Garcia's \\"love of his life\\" sentiment was not reserved for one lover, as he expressed the same feelings to several other women in his life. At Garcia's 1995 funeral, Koons declared that she was \\"the love of his life\\" while paying her final respects, whereupon Meier and Ruppenthal, who were both in attendance, simultaneously exclaimed, \\"He said that to me!\\" =Lifestyle and health= Because of their public profile, Garcia and his collaborators were occasionally singled out in the American war on drugs. On October 2, 1967, 710 Ashbury Street in San Francisco (where the Grateful Dead had taken up residence the year before) was raided after a police tip-off. Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, and Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan were apprehended on marijuana charges which were later dropped, although Garcia himself was not arrested. The following year, Garcia's picture was used in a defamatory context in a campaign commercial for Richard Nixon.\\"Youth\\", Nixon campaign ad (at 0:12) Most of the band were arrested again in January 1970, after they flew to New Orleans from Hawaii. After returning to their hotel from a performance, the band checked into their rooms, only to be quickly raided by police. Approximately fifteen people were arrested on the spot, including many of the road crew, management, and nearly all of the Grateful Dead except for Garcia, who arrived later, outgoing keyboardist Tom Constanten, who abstained from all drugs as a member of the Church of Scientology, and McKernan, who eschewed illegal drugs in favor of alcohol. According to Bill Kreutzmann, the band's use of cocaine accelerated throughout the early 1970s. After experimenting with heroin in a brothel in 1974 (likely on the band's second European tour), Garcia was introduced to a smokeable form of the drug (initially advertised as refined opium) colloquially known as \\"Persian\\" or \\"Persian Base\\" during the group's 1975 hiatus. Influenced by the stresses of creating and releasing The Grateful Dead Movie and the acrimonious collapse of the band's independent record labels over the next two years, Garcia became increasingly dependent upon both substances. These factors, combined with the alcohol and drug abuse of several other members of the Grateful Dead, resulted in a turbulent atmosphere. By 1978, the band's chemistry began \\"cracking and crumbling\\", resulting in poor group cohesion. As a result, Keith and Donna Jean Godchaux left the band in February 1979. With the addition of keyboardist/vocalist Brent Mydland that year amid the ongoing coalescence of the Deadhead subculture, the band reached new commercial heights as a touring group on the American arena circuit in the early 1980s, enabling them to forsake studio recording for several years. Nevertheless, this was offset by such factors as the band's atypically large payroll and Garcia's $700-a-day () drug addiction, resulting in the guitarist taking on a frenetic slate of solo touring outside of the Grateful Dead's rigorous schedule, including abbreviated acoustic duo concerts with Jerry Garcia Band bassist John Kahn that were widely rumored to be a funding conduit for their respective addictions. Though things seemed to be getting better for the band, Garcia's health was declining. By 1983, Garcia's demeanor onstage had appeared to change. Despite still playing the guitar with great passion and intensity, there were times that he would appear disengaged; as such, shows were often inconsistent. Years of heavy tobacco smoking had affected his voice, and he gained considerable weight. By 1984, he would often rest his chin on the microphone during performances. The so-called \\"endless tour\\"‚Äîthe result of years of financial risks, drug use, and poor business decisions‚Äîhad taken its toll. Garcia's decade-long heroin addiction culminated in the rest of the band holding an intervention in January 1985. Given the choice between the band or the drugs, Garcia agreed to check into a rehabilitation center in Oakland, California. A few days later in January, before the start of his program in Oakland, Garcia was arrested for drug possession in Golden Gate Park; he subsequently attended a drug diversion program. Throughout 1985, he tapered his drug use on tour and at home with the assistance of Nora Sage; by the spring of 1986, he was completely abstinent. Precipitated by an unhealthy weight, dehydration, bad eating habits, and a recent relapse on the Grateful Dead's first stadium tour, Garcia collapsed into a diabetic coma in July 1986, waking up five days later. He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: \\"Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle in a sort of futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I came out of my coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of protoplasm that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off.\\" Garcia's coma had a profound effect on him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year. After Garcia's recovery, the band released a comeback album In the Dark in 1987, which became their best-selling studio album. Inspired by Garcia's improved health, a successful album and the continuing emergence of Mydland as a third frontman, the band's energy and chemistry reached a new peak in the late 1980s. Amid a litany of personal problems, Mydland died of a speedball overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, leading him to believe that the band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists Vince Welnick and Bruce Hornsby. The power of Hornsby's performances drove Garcia to new heights on stage. However, as the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a methadone clinic. Garcia said that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music. After returning from the band's 1992 summer tour, Garcia became sick, a throwback to his diabetic coma in 1986. Manasha Garcia nursed Jerry back to health and organized a team of health professionals which included acupuncturist Yen Wei Choong and Randy Baker, a licensed holistic doctor to treat him at home. Garcia recovered over the following days, despite the Grateful Dead having to cancel their fall tour to allow him time to recuperate. Garcia reduced his cigarette smoking and began losing weight. He also became a vegetarian. Despite these improvements, Garcia's physical and mental condition continued to decline throughout 1993 and 1994. Due to his frail condition, he began to use narcotics again to dull the pain. In light of his second drug relapse and current condition, Garcia checked himself into the Betty Ford Center during July 1995. His stay was limited, lasting only two weeks. Motivated by the experience, he then checked into the Serenity Knolls treatment center in Forest Knolls, California, where he died. Death Garcia died in his room at the rehabilitation clinic on August 9, 1995, eight days after his 53rd birthday. The cause of death was a heart attack. Garcia had long struggled with drug addiction, weight problems, sleep apnea, heavy smoking, and diabetes‚Äîall of which contributed to his physical decline. Lesh remarked that, upon hearing of Garcia's death, \\"I was struck numb. I had lost my oldest surviving friend, my brother.\\" Garcia's funeral was held on August 12, at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Belvedere. It was attended by his family, the remaining Grateful Dead members, and their friends, including former pro basketball player Bill Walton and musician Bob Dylan. Deborah Koons barred some of Garcia's former wives from the ceremony. On August 13, approximately 25,000 people attended a municipally sanctioned public memorial at the Polo Fields of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. Crowds produced hundreds of flowers, gifts, images, and a bagpipe rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\" in remembrance. In the Haight, a single white rose was reportedly tied to a tree near the Dead's former Haight-Ashbury house, where a group of followers gathered to mourn. On the morning of April 4, 1996, after a total lunar eclipse earlier that day, Weir and Deborah Koons, accompanied by Sanjay Mishra, spread half of Garcia's ashes into the Ganges at the holy city of Rishikesh, India,: \\"The ashes of Grateful Dead lead guitarist Jerry Garcia were scattered in India's holy Ganges River after last week's lunar eclipse, London's Independent newspaper reported yesterday. [...] Deborah Garcia, the musician's fourth wife, and Bob Weir, his best friend, acted in secret at dawn last Thursday nearly eight months after Garcia's fatal heart attack. [...] They were accompanied by Washingtonian Sanjay Mishra, a classical guitarist who recorded his \\"Blue Incantation\\" CD at the Dead's Club Front studio in San Francisco last year.\\": \\"Grateful Dead lead guitarist Jerry Garcia has made his last trip. His remains were sprinkled in a secret ceremony into India's Ganges River, the Independent newspaper reports. The British newspaper said Garcia's widow, Deborah, and fellow Dead player Bob Weir waded into India's holy river near the town of Rishikesh just after Thursday's lunar eclipse to sprinkle the musician's ashes.\\" a site sacred to Hindus. The remaining ashes were poured into the San Francisco Bay. Koons did not allow former wife Carolyn Garcia to attend the spreading of the ashes.:Then, on a cloudy day, windswept day in late April, we gathered on a boat dock in Sausalito to commit what remained of Jerry's ashes to the deep, as per his last wishes. Deborah refused to allow M.G. to board the boat, even after Bobby begged her to reconsider. Musical equipment Garcia played many guitars during his career, which ranged from student and budget models to custom-made instruments. During his thirty-five year career as a professional musician, Garcia used about 25 guitars. In 1965, when Garcia was playing with the Warlocks, he used a Guild Starfire, which he also used on the d√©but album of the Grateful Dead. Beginning in late 1967 and ending in 1968, Garcia played black or gold mid-1950s Gibson Les Paul guitars with P-90 pickups. In 1969, he picked up the Gibson SG and used it for most of that year and 1970, except for a small period in between where he used a sunburst Fender Stratocaster. During Garcia's \\"pedal steel flirtation period\\" (as Bob Weir referred to it in Anthem to Beauty), from approximately 1969 to 1972, he initially played a Fender instrument before upgrading to the ZB Custom D-10, especially in his earlier public performances. Although this was a double neck guitar, Garcia used the \\"E9 neck and the three pedals to raise the tone and two levers to lower it.\\" Additionally, he was playing an Emmons D-10 at the time of the Grateful Dead's and New Riders of the Purple Sage's final appearances at the Fillmore East. In 1969, Garcia played pedal steel on three notable outside recordings: the track \\"The Farm\\" on the Jefferson Airplane album Volunteers, the track \\"Oh Mommy\\" by Brewer and Shipley and the hit single \\"Teach Your Children\\" by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young from their album D√©j√† Vu, released in 1970. Garcia played on the latter album in exchange for harmony lessons for the Grateful Dead, who were at the time recording Workingman's Dead. In 1971, Garcia began playing a sunburst Les Paul. In March and April 1971 ‚Äì the time period during which the Grateful Dead recorded its second live album, Grateful Dead ‚Äì Garcia played the \\"Peanut,\\" a guitar he had received from Rick Turner, who had custom built the guitar's body and incorporated the neck, pickups, and hardware from an early 60's Les Paul. In May, Garcia began using a 1957 natural finish Stratocaster that had been given to him by Graham Nash. Garcia added an alligator sticker to the pickguard in the fall of that year. ‚ÄúAlligator\\" would remain Garcia's principal electric guitar until August 1973. In the summer of 1971, Garcia also played a double- cutaway Les Paul TV Junior. While Alligator was in the shop in the summer of 1972, he briefly reverted to the sunburst Stratocaster; this can be seen in Sunshine Daydream. In late 1972, Garcia purchased the first guitar (Eagle) made by Alembic luthier Doug Irwin for $850 (). Enamored of Irwin's talents, he immediately commissioned his own custom instrument. This guitar, nicknamed Wolf for a memorable sticker Garcia added below the tailpiece, was delivered in May 1973 and replaced Alligator on stage in September. It cost $1,500 (), an extremely high price for the era. Wolf was made with an ebony fingerboard and featured numerous embellishments like alternating grain designs in the headstock, ivory inlays, and fret marker dots made of sterling silver. The body was composed of western maple wood which had a core of purpleheart. Garcia later had Irwin (who ultimately left Alembic to start his own business) replace the electronics inside the guitar, at which point he added his own logo to the headstock alongside the Alembic logo. The system included two interchangeable plates for configuring pickups: one was made for strictly single coils, while the other accommodated humbuckers. Shortly after receiving the modified instrument, Garcia commissioned another custom guitar from Irwin with one caveat: \\"Don't hold back.\\" During the Grateful Dead's 1974 European tour, Wolf was dropped on several occasions, one of which caused a minor crack in the headstock. Following filming of The Grateful Dead Movie (in which the guitar is prominently visible) a month later, Garcia returned it to Irwin for repairs. Throughout its absence, Garcia predominantly played several Travis Bean guitars, including the TB1000A (1975) and the TB500 (1976-1977). On September 28, 1977, Irwin delivered the refurbished Wolf back to Garcia. The wolf sticker which gave the guitar its name had now been inlaid into the instrument; it also featured an effects loop between the pick-ups and controls (so inline effects would \\"see\\" the same signal at all times) which was bypassable. Irwin also put a new face on the headstock with only his logo (he later claimed to have built the guitar himself, though pictures through time clearly show the progression of logos, from Alembic, to Alembic & Irwin, to only Irwin). Nearly seven years after he commissioned it, Garcia received his second custom guitar (Tiger) from Irwin in the summer of 1979. He first employed the instrument in concert at a Grateful Dead performance at the Oakland Auditorium Arena on August 4, 1979. Its name was derived from the inlay on the preamp cover. The body of Tiger was of rich quality: the top layer was cocobolo, with the preceding layers being maple stripe, vermilion, and flame maple, in that order. The neck was made of western maple with an ebony fingerboard. The pickups consisted of a single coil DiMarzio SDS-1 and two humbucker DiMarzio Super IIs which were easily removable due to Garcia's preference for replacing his pickups every year or two. The electronics were composed of an effects bypass loop, which allowed Garcia to control the sound of his effects through the tone and volume controls on the guitar, and a preamplifier/buffer which rested behind a plate in the back of the guitar. Fully outfitted, Tiger weighed . This was Garcia's principal guitar for the next eleven years, and most played. In the late 1980s Garcia, Weir and CSN (along with many others) endorsed Alvarez Yairi acoustic guitars. There are many photographs circulating (mostly promotional) of Garcia playing a DY99 Virtuoso Custom with a Modulus Graphite neck. He opted to play with the less decorated model but the promotional photo from the Alvarez Yairi catalog has him holding the \\"tree of life\\" model. This hand-built guitar was notable for the collaboration between Japanese luthier Kazuo Yairi and Modulus Graphite of San Rafael. As with most things Garcia, with his passing, the DY99 model is highly valued among collectors. In 1990, Irwin completed Rosebud, Garcia's fourth custom guitar. It was similar to his previous guitar Tiger in many respects, but featured different inlays and electronics, tone and volume controls, and weight. Rosebud, unlike Tiger, was configured with three humbuckers; the neck and bridge pickups shared a tone control, while the middle had its own. Atop the guitar was a Roland GK-2 pickup which fed the controller set inside the guitar. The GK2 was used in junction with the Roland GR-50 rack mount synthesizer. The GR-50 synthesizer in turn drove a Korg M1R synthesizer producing the MIDI effects heard during live performances of this period as heard on the Grateful Dead recording Without a Net. Sections of the guitar were hollowed out to bring the weight down to . The inlay, a dancing skeleton holding a rose, covers a plate just below the bridge. The final cost of the instrument was $11,000 (). In 1993, carpenter-turned-luthier Stephen Cripe tried his hand at making an instrument for Garcia. After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as Lightning Bolt, again named for its inlay. The guitar used Brazilian rosewood for the fingerboard and East Indian rosewood for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, had been taken from a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers. Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar. Cripe, who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to \\"wing it.\\" Cripe later delivered the backup, which was known by the name Top Hat. Garcia bought it from him for $6,500, making it the first guitar that Cripe had ever sold. However, infatuated with Lightning Bolt, Garcia rarely used the backup. After Garcia's death, the ownership of his Wolf and Tiger came into question. According to Garcia's will, his guitars were bequeathed to Doug Irwin, who had constructed them. The remaining Grateful Dead members disagreed‚Äîthey considered his guitars to be property of the band, leading to a lawsuit between the two parties. In 2001, Irwin won the case. However, nearly having been left destitute from a traffic accident in 1998, he decided to place the guitars up for auction in hopes of being able to start another guitar workshop. On May 8, 2002, Wolf and Tiger, among other memorabilia, were placed for auction at Studio 54 in New York City. Tiger was purchased for $957,500, while Wolf was bought for $789,500. Together, the pair sold for $1.74 million, setting a new world record. Wolf went into in the private collection of Daniel Pritzker who kept it in a secure climate controlled room in a private residence at Utica, N.Y. Tiger went to the private collection of Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay. In May 2017, Wolf was again auctioned, but this time for charity. Pritzker decided to sell the guitar and donate all proceeds to the Montgomery, Alabama based Southern Poverty Law Center. Brian Halligan placed the winning bid totaling $1.9M. For the majority of 2019 Wolf and Tiger were included in the Play it Loud exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. On June 23, 2019 John Mayer played Wolf with Dead & Co. at Citi Field. Legacy Garcia was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Grateful Dead in 1994. He declined to attend the ceremony; the band jokingly brought a cardboard cutout of Garcia out on stage in his absence. In 1987, Vermont ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's introduced their Cherry Garcia flavor dedicated to him. It was the first ice cream flavor dedicated to a musician. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Jerry Garcia 13th in their list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\". According to fellow Bay Area guitar player Henry Kaiser, Garcia is \\"the most recorded guitarist in history. With more than 2,200 Grateful Dead concerts, and 1,000 Jerry Garcia Band concerts captured on tape ‚Äì as well as numerous studio sessions ‚Äì there are about 15,000 hours of his guitar work preserved for the ages.\\"Kaiser, Henry. \\"Jerry Garcia Live!\\", Guitar Player, October 2007 On July 30, 2004, Melvin Seals was the first Jerry Garcia Band (JGB) member to headline an outdoor music and camping festival called \\"The Grateful Garcia Gathering\\". Jerry Garcia Band drummer David Kemper joined Melvin Seals and JGB in 2007. Other musicians and friends of Garcia include Donna Jean Godchaux, Mookie Siegel, Pete Sears, G.E. Smith, Chuck Hammer, Barry Sless, Jackie Greene, Brian Lesh, Sanjay Mishra, and Mark Karan. On July 21, 2005, the San Francisco Recreation and Park Commission passed a resolution to name the amphitheater in McLaren Park \\"The Jerry Garcia Amphitheater.\\" The amphitheater is located in the Excelsior District, where Garcia grew up. The first show to happen at the Jerry Garcia Amphitheater was Jerry Day 2005 on August 7, 2005. Jerry's brother, Tiff Garcia, was the first person to welcome everybody to the \\"Jerry Garcia Amphitheater.\\" Jerry Day is an annual celebration of Garcia in his childhood neighborhood. The dedication ceremony (Jerry Day 2) on October 29, 2005 was officiated by mayor Gavin Newsom. On September 24, 2005, the Comes a Time: A Celebration of the Music & Spirit of Jerry Garcia tribute concert was held at the Hearst Greek Theatre in Berkeley, California. The concert featured Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann, Mickey Hart, Bruce Hornsby, Trey Anastasio, Warren Haynes, Jimmy Herring, Michael Kang, Jay Lane, Jeff Chimenti, Mark Karan, Robin Sylvester, Kenny Brooks, Melvin Seals, Merl Saunders, Marty Holland, Stu Allen, Gloria Jones, and Jackie LaBranch. Georgia-based composer Lee Johnson released an orchestral tribute to the music of the Grateful Dead, recorded with the Russian National Orchestra, entitled \\"Dead Symphony: Lee Johnson Symphony No. 6.\\" Johnson was interviewed on NPR on the July 26, 2008 broadcast of Weekend Edition, and gave much credit to the genius and craft of Garcia's songwriting. A live performance with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Johnson himself, was held Friday, August 1. In 2010 the Santa Barbara Bowl in California opened Jerry Garcia Glen along the walk up to the venue. There is a statue of Garcia's right hand along the way. Seattle rock band Soundgarden wrote and recorded the instrumental song \\"Jerry Garcia's Finger\\", dedicated to the singer, which was released as a b-side with their single \\"Pretty Noose\\". Numerous music festivals across the United States and Uxbridge, Middlesex, UK hold annual events in memory of Jerry Garcia. On May 14, 2015 an all-star lineup held a tribute concert for Garcia at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. The event was called \\"Dear Jerry\\". In 2015, Hunter and Garcia were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Hunter accepted the award along with Garcia's daughter, Trixie Garcia, accepting on behalf of her father. In 2015, Jerry Garcia's wife, Manasha Garcia and their daughter, Keelin Garcia launched The Jerry Garcia Foundation, a nonprofit charity that supports projects for artistic, environmental, and humanitarian causes. The Foundation's Board members are Bob Weir, Peter Shapiro, Glenn Fischer, Irwin Sternberg, Daniel Shiner, TRI Studios CEO, Christopher McCutcheon and Fender Music Foundation Executive Director, Lynn Robison. Keelin Garcia said, \\"It is a tremendous honor to participate in nonprofit work that is in accordance with my father's values.\\" In 2018, Jerry Garcia family members, Keelin Garcia and Manasha Garcia launched the Jerry Garcia Music Arts independent music label Discography * New Riders of the Purple Sage ‚Äì New Riders of the Purple Sage ‚Äì 1971 * Hooteroll? ‚Äì Howard Wales and Jerry Garcia ‚Äì 1971 * Garcia ‚Äì Jerry Garcia ‚Äì 1972 * Live at Keystone ‚Äì Merl Saunders, Jerry Garcia, John Kahn, Bill Vitt ‚Äì 1973 * Compliments ‚Äì Jerry Garcia ‚Äì 1974 * Old & In the Way ‚Äì Old & In the Way ‚Äì 1975 * Reflections ‚Äì Jerry Garcia ‚Äì 1976 * Cats Under the Stars ‚Äì Jerry Garcia Band ‚Äì 1978 * Run for the Roses ‚Äì Jerry Garcia ‚Äì 1982 * Vintage NRPS ‚Äì New Riders of the Purple Sage ‚Äì 1986 * Keystone Encores ‚Äì Merl Saunders, Jerry Garcia, John Kahn, Bill Vitt ‚Äì 1988 * Almost Acoustic ‚Äì Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band ‚Äì 1988 * Jerry Garcia / David Grisman ‚Äì Jerry Garcia and David Grisman ‚Äì 1991 * Jerry Garcia Band ‚Äì Jerry Garcia Band ‚Äì 1991 * Not for Kids Only ‚Äì Jerry Garcia and David Grisman ‚Äì 1993 Notes References Sources      * External links * The official homepage of Jerry Garcia * Annotated Grateful Dead Lyrics * Jerry Garcia on Fretbase * The Jerry Site * Official Grateful Dead website * Jerry Garcia discography at deaddisc.com * Jerry Garcia autopsy * Jerry Day: A Civic and Cultural Celebration of Jerry Garcia held in San Francisco * FBI Records: The Vault - Jerry Garcia at vault.fbi.gov * Jerry Garcia's Army personnel file at the National Archives * TEAM Category:Culture of San Francisco Category:American banjoists Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American bluegrass musicians Category:American people of Galician descent Category:American people of Swedish descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American people of Spanish descent Category:American amputees Category:American bluegrass guitarists Category:American country guitarists Category:American male singers Category:American folk guitarists Category:American rock singers Category:American blues guitarists Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Songwriters from California Category:Deaths from diabetes Category:Disease-related deaths in California Category:Grateful Dead members Category:20th century in San Francisco Category:Lead guitarists Category:Pedal steel guitarists Category:Guitarists from San Francisco Category:San Francisco Art Institute alumni Category:United States Army soldiers Category:American Episcopalians Category:1942 births Category:1995 deaths Category:People from Sebastopol, California Category:Singers from San Francisco Category:20th-century American singers Category:Psychedelic drug advocates Category:New Riders of the Purple Sage members Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Old & In the Way members Category:Reconstruction (band) members Category:Jerry Garcia Band members Category:Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band members Category:Rainforest Band members Category:Legion of Mary (band) members ","title":"Jerry Garcia"},{"id":"75762","text":"Calgary is a city in Alberta, Canada.

The Palenque ruins date from ca. 226 BC to ca. 799 AD. After its decline, it was overgrown by the jungle of cedar, mahogany, and sapodilla trees, but has since been excavated and restored. It is located near the Usumacinta River in the Mexican state of Chiapas, about 130 km (81 mi) south of Ciudad del Carmen, above sea level. It averages a humid 26 ¬∞C (79 ¬∞F) with roughly of rain a year. Palenque is a medium-sized site, smaller than Tikal, Chichen Itza, or Cop√°n, but it contains some of the finest architecture, sculpture, roof comb and bas-relief carvings that the Mayas produced. Much of the history of Palenque has been reconstructed from reading the hieroglyphic inscriptions on the many monuments; historians now have a long sequence of the ruling dynasty of Palenque in the 5th century and extensive knowledge of the city-state's rivalry with other states such as Calakmul and Tonin√°. The most famous ruler of Palenque was K'inich Janaab Pakal, or Pacal the Great, whose tomb has been found and excavated in the Temple of the Inscriptions. By 2005, the discovered area covered up to 2.5 km2 (1 sq mi), but it is estimated that less than 10% of the total area of the city is explored, leaving more than a thousand structures still covered by jungle. Palenque received 920,470 visitors in 2017. History Mythological beings using a variety of emblem glyphs in their titles suggests a complex early history. For instance, K ºuk º Bahlam I, the supposed founder of the Palenque dynasty, is called a Toktan Ajaw in the text of the Temple of the Foliated Cross. The famous structures that we know today probably represent a rebuilding effort in response to the attacks by the city of Calakmul and its client states in 599 and 611.Martin and Grube 2000: One of the main figures responsible for rebuilding Palenque and for a renaissance in the city's art and architecture is also one of the best-known Maya Ajaw, K ºinich Janaab º Pakal (Pacal the Great), who ruled from 615 to 683. He is known through his funerary monument dubbed the Temple of Inscriptions, after the lengthy text preserved in the temple's superstructure. At the time Alberto Ruz Lhuillier excavated Pakal's tomb, it was the richest and best preserved of any scientifically excavated burial then known from the ancient Americas. It held this position until the discovery of the rich Moche burials at Sipan, Peru and the recent discoveries at Copan and Calakmul. A bas-relief in the Palenque museum that depicts Upakal K'inich, the son of K'inich Ahkal Mo' Naab III. Beside the attention that K'inich Janaab' Pakal's tomb brought to Palenque, the city is historically significant for its extensive hieroglyphic corpus composed during the reigns of Janaab' Pakal, his son K ºinich Kan Bahlam II, and his grandson K'inich Akal Mo' Naab', and for being the location where Heinrich BerlinBerlin 1959, 1965, 1968 and later Linda Schele and Peter Mathews outlined the first dynastic list for any Maya city.Mathews and Schele 1974 The work of Tatiana Proskouriakoff as well as that of Berlin, Schele, Mathews, and others, initiated the intense historical investigations that characterized much of the scholarship on the ancient Maya from the 1960s to the present.Schele and Freidel 1990; Martin and Grube 2000 The extensive iconography and textual corpus has also allowed for study of Classic period Maya mythologyBerlin 1963; Wald [Schele] 1999; Freidel et al. 1993; Freidel and Macleod 2000; Stuart 2005: Chapter 6 and ritual practice.Stuart 1998 =Rulers= A list of possible and known Maya rulersMartin & Grube 2008, pp. 155‚Äì176.Skidmore 2010, pp. 2‚Äì91. of the city, with dates of their reigns: K'inich Kan B'alam II, one of the many rulers of Palenque. Detail from the Temple XVII Tablet. =Early Classic period= The first ajaw, or king, of B'aakal that we know of was K'uk Balam (Quetzal Jaguar), who governed for four years starting in the year 431. After him, a king came to power, nicknamed \\"Casper\\" by archaeologists. The next two kings were probably Casper's sons. Little was known about the first of these, B'utz Aj Sak Chiik, until 1994, when a tablet was found describing a ritual for the king. The first tablet mentioned his successor Ahkal Mo' Naab I as a teenage prince, and therefore it is believed that there was a family relation between them. For unknown reasons, Akhal Mo' Naab I had great prestige, so the kings who succeeded him were proud to be his descendants. When Ahkal Mo' Naab I died in 524, there was an interregnum of four years, before the following king was crowned at Tokt√°n in 529. K'an Joy Chitam I governed for 36 years. His sons Ahkal Mo' Naab II and K'an B'alam I were the first kings who used the title Kinich, which means \\"the great sun\\". This word was used also by later kings. B'alam was succeeded in 583 by Yohl Ik'nal, who was supposedly his daughter. The inscriptions found in Palenque document a battle that occurred under her government in which troops from Calakmul invaded and sacked Palenque, a military feat without known precedents. These events took place in 599. A second victory by Calakmul occurred some twelve years later, in 611, under the government of Aj Ne' Yohl Mat, son of Yohl Iknal. In this occasion, the king of Calakmul entered Palenque in person, consolidating a significant military disaster, which was followed by an epoch of political disorder. Aj Ne' Yohl Mat was to die in 612. =Late Classic period= The two inner columns from the Temple of the Inscriptions B'aakal began the Late Classic period in the throes of the disorder created by the defeats before Calakmul. The glyphic panels at the Temple of Inscriptions, which records the events at this time, relates that some fundamental annual religious ceremonies were not performed in 613, and at this point states: \\"Lost is the divine lady, lost is the king.\\"Mesoweb Mentions of the government at the time have not been found. It is believed that after the death of Aj Ne' Yohl Mat, Janaab Pakal, also called Pakal I, took power thanks to a political agreement. Janaab Pakal assumed the functions of the ajaw (king) but never was crowned. He was succeeded in 612 by his daughter, the queen Sak K'uk', who governed for only three years until her son was old enough to rule. It is considered that the dynasty was reestablished from then on, so B'aakal retook the path of glory and splendor. The Palace Observation Tower The grandson of Janaab Pakal is the most famous of the Mayan kings, K'inich Janaab' Pakal, also known as Pakal the Great. He began rule at the age of 12 years after his mother Sak Kuk resigned as queen after three years, thus passing power on to him. Pakal the Great reigned in Palenque from 615 to 683, and his mother remained an important force for the first 25 years of his rule. She may have ruled jointly with him. Known as the favorite of the gods, he carried Palenque to new levels of splendor, in spite of having come to power when the city was at a low point. Pakal married the princess of Okt√°n, Lady Tzakbu Ajaw (also known as Ahpo-Hel) in 624 and had at least three children. The Palace as seen from the courtyard. Most of the palaces and temples of Palenque were constructed during his government; the city flourished as never before, eclipsing Tikal. The central complex, known as The Palace, was enlarged and remodeled on various occasions, notably in the years 654, 661, and 668. In this structure, is a text describing how in that epoch Palenque was newly allied with Tikal, and also with Yaxchilan, and that they were able to capture the six enemy kings of the alliance. Not much more had been translated from the text. In the Palace After the death of Pakal in 683, his older son K'inich Kan B'alam assumed the kingship of B'aakal, who in turn was succeeded in 702 by his brother K'inich K'an Joy Chitam II. The first continued the architectural and sculptural works that were begun by his father, as well as finishing the construction of the famous tomb of Pakal. Pakal's sarcophagus, built for a very tall man, held the richest collection of jade seen in a Mayan tomb. A jade mosaic mask was placed over his face, and a suit made of jade adorned his body, with each piece hand-carved and held together by gold wire. Furthermore, K'inich Kan B'alam I began ambitious projects, including the Group of the Crosses. Thanks to numerous works begun during his government, now we have portraits of this king, found in various sculptures. His brother succeeded him continuing with the same enthusiasm of construction and art, reconstructing and enlarging the north side of the Palace. Thanks to the reign of these three kings, B'aakal had a century of growing and splendor. Mask of the Red Queen from the tomb found in Temple XIII. In 711, Palenque was sacked by the realm of Tonin√°, and the old king K'inich K'an Joy Chitam II was taken prisoner. It is not known what the final fate of the king was, and it is presumed that he was executed in Tonin√°. For 10 years there was no king. Finally, K'inich Ahkal Mo' Nab' III was crowned in 722. Although the new king belonged to the royalty, there is no evidence that he was the direct inheritor direct of K'inich K'an Joy Chitam II. It is believed, therefore, that this coronation was a break in the dynastic line, and probably K'inich Ahkal Nab' arrived to power after years of maneuvering and forging political alliances. This king, his son, and grandson governed until the end of the 8th century. Little is known about this period, except that, among other events, the war with Tonin√° continued, where there are hieroglyphics that record a new defeat of Palenque. Occasionally city-state lords were women. Lady Sak Kuk ruled at Palenque for at least three years starting in 612 CE, before she passed her title to her son. However, these female rulers were accorded male attributes. Thus, these women became more masculine as they assumed roles that were typically male roles. =Abandonment= During the 8th century, B'aakal came under increasing stress, in concert with most other Classic Mayan city-states, and there was no new elite construction in the ceremonial center sometime after 800. An agricultural population continued to live here for a few generations, then the site was abandoned and was slowly grown over by the forest. The district was very sparsely populated when the Spanish first arrived in the 1520s. Art and architecture Important structures at Palenque include: =Temple of the Inscriptions= Temple of the Inscriptions The Temple of Inscriptions had begun perhaps as early as 675Schele and Mathews 1998:97‚Äì99 as the funerary monument of Hanab-Pakal. The temple superstructure houses the second longest glyphic text known from the Maya world (the longest is the Hieroglyphic Stairway at Copan). The Temple of the Inscriptions records approximately 180 years of the city's history from the 4th through 12th K'atun. The focal point of the narrative records K'inich Janaab' Pakal's K'atun period-ending rituals focused on the icons of the city's patron deities prosaically known collectively as the Palenque Triad or individually as GI, GII, and GIII.Berlin 1963; Schele and Mathews 1998: 106; Carrasco 2005: 433. The Pyramid measures 60 meters wide, 42.5 meters deep and 27.2 meters high. The Summit temple measures 25.5 meters wide, 10.5 meters deep and 11.4 meters high. The largest stones weigh 12 to 15 tons. These were on top of the Pyramid. The Total volume of pyramid and temple is 32,500 cu. meters.Scarre 1999 In 1952 Alberto Ruz Lhuillier removed a stone slab in the floor of the back room of the temple superstructure to reveal a passageway (filled in shortly before the city's abandonment and reopened by archeologists) leading through a long stairway to Pakal's tomb. The tomb itself is remarkable for its large carved sarcophagus, the rich ornaments accompanying Pakal, and for the stucco sculpture decorating the walls of the tomb. Unique to Pakal's tomb is the psychoduct, which leads from the tomb itself, up the stairway and through a hole in the stone covering the entrance to the burial. This psychoduct is perhaps a physical reference to concepts about the departure of the soul at the time of death in Maya eschatology where in the inscriptions the phrase ochb'ihaj sak ik'il (the white breath road-entered) is used to refer to the leaving of the soul. A find such as this is greatly important because it demonstrated for the first time the temple usage as being multifaceted. These pyramids were, for the first time, identified as temples and also funerary structures. The much-discussed iconography of the sarcophagus lid depicts Pakal in the guise of one of the manifestations of the Maya maize god emerging from the maws of the underworld.The direction of the K'inich Janaab' Pakal's movement between realms has been the subject of debate in recent years. Initially, Linda Schele, David Freidel, and others saw Pakal as descending into the underworld (Schele and Mathews 1998: 115). More recently, David Stuart and Freidel have suggested the opposite based on glyphic texts accompanying similar scenes. In these images the birth glyph (often spelled SIH-ya-ja) describes the depicted event. The temple also has a duct structure that still is not completely understood by archaeologists. It has been suggested that the duct aligns with the winter solstice and that the sun shines down on Pakal's tomb. =Temples of the Cross group= Temple of the Cross The Temple of the Cross, Temple of the Sun, and Temple of the Foliated Cross are a set of graceful temples atop step pyramids, each with an elaborately carved relief in the inner chamber depicting two figures presenting ritual objects and effigies to a central icon. Earlier interpretations had argued that the smaller figure was that of K'inich Janaab' Pakal while the larger figure was K'inich Kan B'ahlam. However, it is now known based on a better understanding of the iconography and epigraphy that the central tablet depicts two images of Kan B'ahlam. The smaller figure shows K'inich Kan B'ahlam during a rite of passage ritual at the age of six (9.10.8.9.3 9 Akbal 6 Xul) while the larger is of his accession to kingship at the age of 48.Bassie 1991 These temples were named by early explorers; the cross-like images in two of the reliefs actually depict the tree of creation at the center of the world in Maya mythology. =Palace= The Palace and aqueduct The Palace, a complex of several connected and adjacent buildings and courtyards, was built by several generations on a wide artificial terrace during four century period. The Palace was used by the Mayan aristocracy for bureaucratic functions, entertainment, and ritualistic ceremonies. The Palace is located in the center of the ancient city. The Corbel arch seen in a hallway at the Palace Within the Palace there are numerous sculptures and bas-relief carvings that have been conserved. The Palace most unusual and recognizable feature is the four-story tower known as The Observation Tower. The Observation Tower like many other buildings at the site exhibit a mansard-like roof. The A-shaped Corbel arch is an architectural motif observed throughout the complex. The Corbel arches require a large amount of masonry mass and are limited to a small dimensional ratio of width to height providing the characteristic high ceilings and narrow passageways. The Palace was equipped with numerous large baths and saunas which were supplied with fresh water by an intricate water system. An aqueduct, constructed of great stone blocks with a three-meter-high vault, diverts the Otulum River to flow underneath the main plaza. The Palace is the largest building complex in Palenque measuring 97 meters by 73 meters at its base. =Other notable buildings= Temple of the Count * The Temple of the Skull has a skull on one of the pillars. * Temple XIII contained the Tomb of the Red Queen, an unknown noble woman, possibly the wife of Pakal, discovered in 1994. The remains in the sarcophagus were completely covered with a bright red powder made of cinnabar. * The Temple of The Jaguar (a.k.a. The Temple of the Beautiful Relief) at a distance of some 200 meters south of the main group of temples; its name came from the elaborate bas-relief carving of a king seated on a throne in the form of a jaguar. * Structure XII with a bas-relief carving of the God of Death. * Temple of the Count another elegant Classic Palenque temple, which got its name from the fact that early explorer Jean Frederic Waldeck lived in the building for some time, and Waldeck claimed to be a count. The site also has a number of other temples, tombs, and elite residences, some a good distance from the center of the site, a court for playing the Mesoamerican Ballgame, and an interesting stone bridge over the Otulum River some distance below the Aqueduct. Modern investigations Detail of a relief at the Palace drawn by Ricardo Almend√°riz during the Del Rio expedition in 1787 After de la Nada's brief account of the ruins, no attention was paid to them until 1773 when one Don Ramon de Ordo√±ez y Aguilar examined Palenque and sent a report to the Capitan General in Antigua Guatemala, a further examination was made in 1784 saying that the ruins were of particular interest, so two years later surveyor and architect Antonio Bernasconi was sent with a small military force under Colonel Antonio del R√≠o to examine the site in more detail. Del Rio's forces smashed through several walls to see what could be found, doing a fair amount of damage to the Palace, while Bernasconi made the first map of the site as well as drawing copies of a few of the bas-relief figures and sculptures. Draughtsman Luciano Casta√±eda made more drawings in 1807, and a book on Palenque, Descriptions of the Ruins of an Ancient City, discovered near Palenque, was published in London in 1822 based on the reports of those last two expeditions together with engravings based on Bernasconi and Casta√±edas drawings; two more publications in 1834 contained descriptions and drawings based on the same sources. Juan Galindo visited Palenque in 1831, and filed a report with the Central American government. He was the first to note that the figures depicted in Palenque's ancient art looked like the local Native Americans; some other early explorers, even years later, attributed the site to such distant peoples as Egyptians, Polynesians, or the Lost Tribes of Israel. Starting in 1832 Jean Frederic Waldeck spent two years at Palenque making numerous drawings, but most of his work was not published until 1866. Meanwhile, the site was visited in 1840 first by Patrick Walker and Herbert Caddy on a mission from the governor of British Honduras, and then by John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood who published an illustrated account the following year which was greatly superior to the previous accounts of the ruins. D√©sir√© Charnay took the first photographs of Palenque in 1858, and returned in 1881-1882\\\\. Alfred Maudslay encamped at the ruins in 1890-1891 and took extensive photographs of all the art and inscriptions he could find, and made paper and plaster molds of many of the inscriptions, and detailed maps and drawings, setting a high standard for all future investigators to follow. Maudslay learned the technique of making the papier mache molds of the sculptures from Frenchman Desire Charnay. Jade mask of King K'inich Janaab Pakal. National Museum of Anthropology and History, Mexico City. K'inich K'an B'alam II (\\"Chan Bahlam II\\"). Several other expeditions visited the ruins before Frans Blom of Tulane University in 1923, who made superior maps of both the main site and various previously neglected outlying ruins and filed a report for the Mexican government on recommendations on work that could be done to preserve the ruins. From 1949 through 1952 Alberto Ruz Lhuillier supervised excavations and consolidations of the site for Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH); it was Ruz Lhuillier who was the first person to gaze upon Pacal the Great's tomb in over a thousand years. Ruz worked for four years at the Temple of Inscriptions before unearthing the tomb. Further INAH work was done in lead by Jorge Acosta into the 1970s. In 1973, the first of the very productive Palenque Mesa Redonda (Round table) conferences was held here on the inspiration of Merle Greene Robertson; thereafter every few years leading Mayanists would meet at Palenque to discuss and examine new findings in the field. Meanwhile, Robertson was conducting a detailed examination of all art at Palenque, including recording all the traces of color on the sculptures. The 1970s also saw a small museum built at the site. In the last 15 or 20 years, a great deal more of the site has been excavated, but currently, archaeologists estimate that only 5% of the total city has been uncovered. In 2010, Pennsylvania State University researchers, Christopher Duffy and Kirk French, identified the Piedras Bolas Aqueduct as a pressurised aqueduct, the earliest known in the New World. It is a spring-fed conduit located on steep terrain that has a restricted opening that would cause the water to exit forcefully, under pressure, to a height of . They were unable to identify the use for this man-made feature.Maya plumbing, first pressurized water feature found in New World , Penn State university, 4 May 2010, accessed 5 May 2010 See also *List of Mesoamerican pyramids *List of megalithic sites *Maya script *Temple 20 Notes References : (1963).

Site members could vote for or against publishing an article and once the article had reached a certain number of votes, it was published to the site or deleted from the queue. The site has been described as \\"a free-for-all of news and opinion written by readers\\". Around 2005, its membership numbered in the tens of thousands. On May 1, 2016, the site was closed down permanently with all content taken offline. Foster stated at the time that it might return in the form of a static archive at a later date. Overview All content was generated and selected by the users themselves, with the exception of site news written by the administrators. Registered users would submit stories to the submissions queue where other users would vote +1 FP (front page), +1, 0, or ‚Äì1. If the story reached a predetermined threshold score, it was posted to the front page or to the relevant section, depending on the proportion of \\"FP votes\\". If it failed to make the threshold, other factors (such as number of comments, type of comments, and their ratings) could still cause the story to be posted to a section or to the front page. Otherwise, it was dropped. One feature of the story queue was edit mode, in which a story was protected from voting for a period of time during which the author could make changes. Comments could still be made on the story to suggest changes before voting began. These comments were distinguished as being editorial or topical. A further section was known as the diaries. Having no editing or moderation vetting, diaries were essentially weblogs. and formed the source of most of Kuro5hin's content by volume. However, unlike the edited article sections, they were not widely syndicated. Other users would also comment on these diaries in the same way as stories but with without the editorial or topical stipulation. History Foster named Kuro5hin‚Äîpronounced corrosion‚Äîas a pun on his nickname. The site was powered by the Scoop collaborative system, originally written by Foster himself, with the motto \\"Technology and Culture, from the Trenches\\". In July 2000, the site was temporarily closed due to comment spam and denial of service attacks. In January 2002, OSDN ended the advertising affiliate agreement with Kuro5hin.

Categories include (explicit) icebreaker, parlour (indoor), picnic (outdoor), and large group games.Frankel, Lillian; Frankel, Godfrey; and Anderson, Doug (2007). Party Games for Adults, p.7. Sterling. .Sheila Anne Barry (1987). The World's Best Party Games, p.3. Sterling. . Other types include pairing off (partnered) games, and parlour races. Different games will generate different atmospheres so the party game may merely be intended as an icebreakers, or the sole purpose for or structure of the party. As such, party games aim to include players of various skill levels and player-elimination is rare.Meyer, Ben (2009). \\"Fort Ancient: Ohio\\", Proceedings of the 3rd European Conference on Game Based Learning, p.259. Academic Conferences. . Party games are intended to be played socially, and are designed to be easy for new players to learn.McGonigal, Jane (2011). Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World, unpaginated. Penguin. . Characteristics The characteristics of party games tend to include: * A game can support a relatively large or undefined number of players, compared to more traditional board games or card games that require a small, set number of players. Some games, especially commercial games, have a set limit based on available equipment; others are limited by other mechanics of the game like time for each turn, while still others have no practical limit. * Team-based play in party games is common, but not required. Games that divide players into two, three, or four roughly equal teams, such as Cranium, Charades or Pictionary tend to allow for larger total numbers of players. By contrast, other games such as Werewolf and How to Host a Murder are role-based, with each player being given a character or other role to play in the course of the game. The number of players is limited to the number of roles, but in many such games there are \\"generic\\" roles allowing for a high degree of flexibility. * Cooperation and interaction between players is encouraged. Both team and role-based play generally encourage this social aspect to the game; games that do not encourage this interaction generally make poor party games. * Multiple ways to play and contribute. For example, in Fictionary not everyone needs to create plausible dictionary definitions; humorous submissions are welcome. In Charades, players can actively participate in guessing without taking a turn at acting. Sports often make poor party games as limitations in a player's physical abilities may preclude participation though some party games, such as: relay racing and Red light/Green light, involve a significant physical aspect and are especially suitable for groups similar in age and ability. * Players participate in gameplay frequently, sometimes on an impromptu basis. Games in which each player has their own independent turn generally make poor party games, especially if a turn takes a long time. * A game should also have entertainment value for spectators. Many party games involve at least some level of humor, whether inherent in the game or introduced by players. In this way, players not taking a turn can still enjoy the gameplay, whilst party favors can embellish the party atmosphere. * Player elimination is rare. Monopoly makes a poor party game, because bankrupt players must sit out while the remaining players continue to the game's conclusion, which can take several hours. In contrast, no matter how far behind a team is in Pictionary, all players can participate until the end. * The amount of specialized equipment needed is not dependent on the number of players. Games such as Liar's Dice make poor party games because each player needs a cup and five dice to start the game. By contrast, Yahtzee needs only one cup and set of dice regardless of the number of players (the basic Yahtzee game does have other practical limitations). * The game usually does not involve spending real money as a prerequisite or consequence of playing. Games that require each player to purchase consumable items or specialized equipment are usually poor party games. Casino games are a notable exception. Examples include \\"casino nights\\" with a token door charge or buy-in for charity or to defray costs and poker tournaments with a similar small buy-in.

Another early example is Starpath's Party Mix. Party video games are commonly designed as a collection of simple minigames, designed to be intuitive and easy to control, and allow for competition between many players. Some like the Mario Party series and Sonic Shuffle, are played on simulated game boards. Large group games Large group games are played by many participants and are often used as planned activities in structured environments, especially as educational activities. They are similar to party games, except that large group games are typically planned for larger numbers (perhaps even hundreds) as part of an event. Large group games can take a variety of forms and formats. Some are physical games such as Buck buck. Some are modeled on the TV game show format, offering points for teams who can answer questions the fastest. Trivia-type games might have questions posed from the stage and each tabletop writing their answers to be collected and scored. Others may take on some of the qualities of Open Space environments and allow participants to wander in a less structured way. Some are modeled on TV reality shows such as The Amazing Race or Survivor. Participants compete as individuals or in teams to complete challenges that move them towards victory in a competition spanning the entire party. The TV shows on which such parties are based are normally competitions involving elimination, so such events require significant planning to avoid exclusion or boredom. Group board games can take on the design of small groups of players, seated at tables of 4 to 6 people, who work together on a problem. There can be large numbers of people (and thus many tables). If properly designed, these scalable exercises can be used for small groups (12 to 20 people) as well as very large events (600 people or 100 tables). Generally, for these larger exercises, multimedia projectors, large screens and microphones are required for instructions and communications. A search for team building events can turn up millions of links to exercises, companies, and all kinds of offerings ranging from paintball competitions to fire walks to outdoor climbing or whitewater adventures. The impact on actual team building can vary widely - a golf outing for corporate executives does not generally accomplish much in the way of organizational improvement while a business simulation might be directly focused on linking the play of the game to issues for corporate improvement. Holiday groups use a gift exchange party game such as white elephant gift exchange for socializing and sharing gifts. New online party games, based on these holiday games, allow larger groups to gather on the internet to save travel expenses.

Born in Sumida, Tokyo, Nakatar≈ç Takamizawa grew up an orphan: his mother died upon his birth, his father and his uncle (who served as one of his stepparents) both died several years afterwards. He graduated from Fukagawa's municipal Rinkai Jinj≈ç elementary school in 1911. In 1919, he was conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army, and left in 1922. In 1925, he graduated from Nihon Bijutsu Gakk≈ç (\\"Japan School of Art\\"). In 1926, he became a rakugo author. He began producing manga in 1927. He gained a regular assignment selling manga stories and adopted the pen name , which was later corrupted into : literally means \\"water bubble\\". In 1928 he married (younger sister of Hideo Kobayashi) in a church ceremony. In 1931, he began the long- running series Norakuro in Kodansha's anthology magazine Sh≈çnen Kurabu, about an anthropomorphic black and white dog in an army of dogs. Although at first intended to have only a brief lifespan, its immense popularity urged Tagawa to continue producing the strip. He has won numerous awards and is recognized as one of the pioneers of the Japanese manga industry. After World War II he became a bona fide Christian; he credited the faith in helping him overcome alcoholism after several failed attempts. In 1988, he produced the autobiographical Watashi no Rirekisho (\\"My R√©sum√©\\") for the Japanese Sankei Shimbun newspaper. He died in 1989 at the age of 90.

Early life Wrightson was born October 27, 1948, in Dundalk, Maryland. He received training in art from watching Jon Gnagy on television, reading comics, particularly those of EC, as well as through a correspondence course from the Famous Artists School. His artistic influences were Frank Frazetta, Al Williamson, Al Dorne, Graham Ingels, Jack Davis and Howard Pyle. He published a piece of fan art, containing a headstone bearing the inscription \\"Berni Wrightson, Dec. 15, 1965\\", on page 33 of Warren Publishing's Creepy #9 (cover-dated June 1966). Career In 1966, Wrightson began working for The Baltimore Sun newspaper as an illustrator. The following year, after meeting artist Frank Frazetta at a comic-book convention in New York City, he was inspired to produce his own stories. In 1968, he showed copies of his sequential art to DC Comics editor Dick Giordano and was given a freelance assignment. Wrightson began spelling his name \\"Berni\\" in his professional work to distinguish himself from an Olympic diver named Bernie Wrightson, but later restored the final \\"e\\" to his name. In 1968, he drew his first professional comic book story, \\"The Man Who Murdered Himself\\", which appeared in House of Mystery No. 179 (March‚ÄìApril 1969). He continued to work on a variety of mystery and anthology titles for both DC and, a few years later, its principal rival, Marvel Comics. It was for Marvel's Chamber of Darkness and Tower of Shadows titles where he was first encouraged to slightly simplify his intricate pen-and-ink drawing, and where his lush brushwork, a hallmark of his comics inking in the 1970s, was first evidenced. Like many artists in the 1970s and 1980s, Wrightson moved to New York in hopes of finding work with comics publishers such as DC Comics or Marvel Comics. At one point Wrightson lived in the same Queens apartment building as artists Allen Milgrom, Howard Chaykin and Walter Simonson. Simonson recalls, \\"We'd get together at 3 a.m. They'd come up and we'd have popcorn and sit around and talk about whatever a 26, 27 and 20-year-old guys talk about. Our art, TV, you name it. I pretty much knew at the time, 'These are the good ole days.'\\" =Swamp Thing= Swamp Thing #1 panel, original ink art by Wrightson With writer Len Wein, Wrightson co-created the muck creature Swamp Thing in House of Secrets No. 92 (July 1971) in a standalone horror story set in the Victorian era.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 146: \\"'Swamp Thing' was the name of Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson's turn-of-the-century tale, and its popularity with readers led a modernized version of the character into his own series a year later.\\" Wein later recounted how Wrightson became involved with the story: \\"Bernie Wrightson had just broken up with a girlfriend, and we were sitting in my car just talking about life ‚Äì all the important things to do when you're 19 and 20 years old. [Laughs] And I said, 'You know, I just wrote a story that actually kind of feels like the way you feel now.' I told him about Swamp Thing, and he said, 'I gotta draw that.'\\" In summer 1972 he published Badtime Stories, a horror/science fiction comics anthology featuring his own scripts and artwork (from the period 1970‚Äì1971), each story being drawn in a different medium (ink wash, tonal pencil drawings, duoshade paper, screen tones, e.g., along with traditional pen-and-ink and brushwork). He and writer Marv Wolfman co-created Destiny in Weird Mystery Tales No. 1 (July‚ÄìAug. 1972), a character which would later be used in the work of Neil Gaiman.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p.152 \\"The host that was first presented in a framing sequence by scribe Marv Wolfman and artist Bernie Wrightson received further, imaginative development in Neil Gaiman's The Sandman series decades later.\\" In the fall of 1972 the Swamp Thing returned in his own series, set in the contemporary world and in the general DC continuity.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 153: \\"Following his debut in House of Secrets No. 92 in 1971, the Swamp Thing grew into his own series, albeit with a reimagining of his origins by writer Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson.\\" Wrightson drew the first ten issues of the series. Abigail Arcane, a major supporting character in the Swamp Thing mythos was introduced in issue No. 3 (Feb.-March 1973).McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 154: \\"Scribe Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson left Swamp Thing some company...the woman who would become Swamp Thing's soul mate, Abigail Arcane.\\" Wrightson had originally been asked by DC to handle the art for its revival of The Shadow, but he left the project early on when he realized he could not produce the necessary minimum number of pages on time, along with his work on Swamp Thing. Michael Kaluta illustrated the series, but Wrightson did contribute much to the third issue in both pencils and inks, as well as inking the splash page of issue #4. =Warren and The Studio= In January 1974, he left DC to work at Warren Publishing, and for whose black- and-white horror-comics magazines he produced a series of original work as well as short story adaptations. As with BadTime Stories, Wrightson experimented with different media in these black-and-white tales: Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Black Cat\\" featured intricate pen-and-ink work which stood in direct contrast with his brush-dominated Swamp Thing panels. \\"Jenifer\\", scripted by Bruce Jones, was atmospherically rendered with gray markers. \\"The Pepper Lake Monster\\" was a synthesis of brush and pen-and-ink, whereas H.P. Lovecraft's \\"Cool Air\\" was a foray into duotone paper. \\"Nightfall\\" was an exercise in ink wash. \\"Clarice\\" was also drawn in pen, brush, and ink, and with ink wash. In 1975, Wrightson joined with fellow artists Jeffrey Catherine Jones, Michael Kaluta, and Barry Windsor-Smith to form The Studio, a shared loft in Manhattan where the group would pursue creative products outside the constraints of comic book commercialism. Though he continued to produce sequential art, Wrightson at this time began producing artwork for numerous posters, prints, calendars, and even a highly detailed coloring book. He also drew sporadic comics stories and single illustrations for National Lampoon magazine from 1973 to 1983. Wrightson spent seven years drawing approximately 50 detailed pen-and-ink illustrations to accompany an edition of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. =Later career= The \\"Captain Sternn\\" segment of the animated film Heavy Metal is based on a character created by Wrightson (first appearing in the June 1980 issue of Heavy Metal magazine). The Freakshow graphic novel, written by Bruce Jones and illustrated (via pen, brush, and ink with watercolors) by Wrightson, was published in Spain in 1982 and serialized in Heavy Metal magazine in the early 1980s. In 1983 Bernie Wrightson illustrated the comic book adaptation of the Stephen King-penned horror film Creepshow. This led to several other collaborations with King, including illustrations for the novella \\"Cycle of the Werewolf\\", the restored edition of King's apocalyptic horror epic, The Stand, and Wolves of the Calla, the fifth installment of King's Dark Tower series. He would later illustrate the cover for TV Guide magazine's April 26 ‚Äì May 2, 1997 issue, illustrating the TV miniseries of King's The Shining. During production on the 1984 film Ghostbusters, Wrightson was among the artists hired by associate producer Michael C. Gross to provide concept art envisioning the ghosts and other psychic phenomena encountered by that film's characters. The artwork he contributed included images of the \\"escapees\\" from the Ghostbusters' electrically-powered ghost storage facility, which run amok after the facility's electricity is turned off.Wallace, Daniel (October 27, 2015). Ghostbusters: The Ultimate Visual History, Insight Editions. San Rafael, California. pp. 21 and 86. Wrightson in 2012 Jim Starlin and Wrightson produced Heroes for Hope, a 1985 one-shot designed to raise money for African famine relief and recovery. Published in the form of a \\"comic jam\\", the book featured an all-star lineup of comics creators as well as a few notable authors from outside the comic book industry, such as Stephen King, George R. R. Martin, Harlan Ellison, and Edward Bryant.Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men at the Grand Comics Database In 1986, Wrightson and writer Susan K. Putney collaborated on the Spider-Man: Hooky graphic novel. That same year saw Wrightson and Starlin produce a second benefit comic, Heroes Against Hunger featuring Superman and Batman which was published by DC and like the earlier Marvel project featured many top comics creators.Heroes Against Hunger at the Grand Comics DatabaseManning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 219: \\"Plotted by Jim Starlin, with dramatic designs by Bernie Wrightson...Heroes Against Hunger featured nearly every popular DC creator of the time.\\" Starlin and Wrightson collaborated on two miniseries in 1988, The Weird and Batman: The Cult,Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 234: \\"Writer Jim Starlin took the Dark Knight into the depths of Gotham for the four-issue prestige format Batman: The Cult...with horror artist Bernie Wrightson.\\" as well as Marvel Graphic Novel No. 29 featuring the Hulk and the Thing for Marvel. He has illustrated cards for Last Unicorn Games' collectible card game Heresy: Kingdom Come, and has contributed album covers for a number of bands, including Meat Loaf. Wrightson did concept art for film and television, working on productions including The Faculty, Galaxy Quest, Spiderman, The Mist, Land of the Dead, and Serenity. In 2012, Wrightson collaborated with Steve Niles on Frankenstein Alive, Alive! published by IDW Publishing, for which he won a National Cartoonists Society's award. Personal life Wrightson's first wife Michele Wrightson was involved in underground comix, contributing stories to such publications as It Ain't Me, Babe, Wimmen's Comix, and Arcade. She died in 2015. Wrightson and Michelle had two sons together, John and Jeffrey. Wrightson lived with his second wife Liz Wrightson and his stepson Thomas Adamson in Austin, Texas. Wrightson announced in January 2017 that he was retiring because of his battle with cancer. He died on March 18, 2017, at the age of 68. The next day, Liz Wrightson confirmed that his death followed a long battle with brain cancer. \\"The First Day of the Rest of Your Life\\", the April 2, 2017 season 7 finale of the TV series The Walking Dead, was dedicated to Wrightson's memory. Creative legacy Wrightson's death met with a series of testimonials and tributes by colleagues and professional admirers that included Joss Whedon, Neil Gaiman, Guillermo Del Toro, Walter Simonson and Mike Mignola. Whedon called Wrightson \\"a star by which other pencillers chart their course\\", while Gaiman stated that Wrightson was the first comics artist whose work I loved. Horror connoisseur del Toro took a 24-hour pledge of silence in honor of Wrightson, writing, \\"As it comes to all of us, the end came for the greatest that ever lived: Bernie Wrightson. My North dark star of youth. A master.\\" Hellboy creator Mike Mignola said of Wrightson, \\"He was a genius, and not just a monster guy. Everything Bernie did had soul.\\" Wrightson's former neighbor Walter Simonson, who lived in the same building as Wrightson in the 1980s, recalled, \\"Even at an early age, we were all really in awe of his work, it was so good.\\" Analyzing Wrightson's skill in depth, Simonson explained that in addition to his ability to draw anything, Wrightson was a master of value, able to effect a precise command over the depth and tones of the colors and shades of grey in his work, stating, \\"In drawing or in painting, one of the things that you control is the value, which is the light and dark. If you were to take your color TV set and somehow turn off the color and just have a black and white and gray picture, you're looking at the values of those color pictures. 'Frankenstein' is a complete masterpiece of value, using incredibly complex pictures, and yet you always see exactly what you are supposed to see. He drives the eye right where it needs.\\" Regarding the famously reproduced two-page spread from that work depicting Frankenstein's laboratory, Simonson said of that image, \\"It's so complicated and yet he's able to show you what he wants you to see. In some ways [the lab scene is] the core of the story. It's where Frankenstein breaks the laws of God. I think people were just drawn to it cause it's so completely over the top and yet it's so completely controlled at the same time.\\" Comics analyst and historian Scott McCloud called that image a \\"riot of detail\\", saying, \\"It might take a moment before you even notice the corpse laying at the bottom of the composition on the left. That makes it a bit more of a treasure map. Bit more of a 'Where Is Waldo?'\\" During a 2016 tour of his extensive library of art and pop culture memorabilia, Del Toro named Wrightson's Frankenstein as the work whose original artwork was the hardest to find, saying, \\"They are very rare. The people that have them don't let them go. It's taken me years to get that. I have nine out of the 13 favorite plates of the Frankenstein book that Bernie Wrightson ever did. The other four: one of them, no one knows where it is, and the other three are, I would say, very hard to pry away from the people that have them.\\" Awards Wrightson won the Shazam Award for Best Penciller (Dramatic Division) in 1972 and 1973 for Swamp Thing, the Shazam Award for Best Individual Story (Dramatic) in 1972 for Swamp Thing No. 1 (with Len Wein). He received additional nominations, including for the Shazam Award for Best Inker in 1973 for Swamp Thing, as well as that year's Shazam for Best Individual Story, for \\"A Clockwork Horror\\" in Swamp Thing No. 6 (with Len Wein). Wrightson was a recipient of the 1974 Comic Fan Art Award for Favorite Pro Artist. He was a nominee for the same award, then known as the \\"Goethe Award,\\" in 1973. Wrightson was co-recipient of the Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award for 1986, along with Jim Starlin, for his work on Heroes for Hope. The following year, Wrightson received an Inkpot Award. Wrightson received the H.P. Lovecraft Award (also known as the \\"Howie\\") at the 2007 H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival in Portland, Oregon. He received the National Cartoonists Society's award in the category Comic Books for 2012 for Frankenstein Alive, Alive!. He was awarded the Inkwell Award Special Recognition Award in 2015 for his 45-plus years of work, including co-creating DC Comic's Swamp Thing and Frankenstein.

The word synod comes from the meaning \\"assembly\\" or \\"meeting\\" and is analogous with the Latin word meaning \\"council\\". Originally, synods were meetings of bishops, and the word is still used in that sense in Catholicism, Oriental Orthodoxy and Eastern Orthodoxy. In modern usage, the word often refers to the governing body of a particular church, whether its members are meeting or not. It is also sometimes used to refer to a church that is governed by a synod. Sometimes the phrase \\"general synod\\" or \\"general council\\" refers to an ecumenical council. The word synod also refers to the standing council of high-ranking bishops governing some of the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox churches. Similarly, the day-to-day governance of patriarchal and major archiepiscopal Eastern Catholic Churches is entrusted to a permanent synod. Usages in different Communions =Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox= Saint Tikhon as Patriarch of Moscow In Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches, synods of bishops are meetings of bishops within each autonomous Church and are the primary vehicle for the election of bishops and the establishment of inter-diocesan ecclesiastical laws. A sobor (Church Slavonic: —Å—ä–±–æ—Ä—ä, \\"assembly\\") is a formal gathering or council of bishops together with other clerical and lay delegates representing the church to deal with matters of faith, morality, rite, and canonical and cultural life.Sobor in the Encyclopedia of Ukraine online The synod in the Western churches is similar, but it is distinguished by being usually limited to an assembly of bishops. The term is found among those Eastern Orthodox Churches that use Slavic language (the Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Serbian and Macedonian Orthodox Churches), along with the Romanian Orthodox Church.  Assembly  The presence of clerical and lay delegates is for the purpose of discerning the consensus of the church on important matters; however, the bishops form an upper house of the sobor, and the laity cannot overrule their decisions. Kievan Rus' chronicles record the first known East Slavic church sobor as having taken place in Kiev in 1051. Sobors were convened periodically from then on; one notable assembly held in 1415 formed a separate metropoly for the church in the Grand Duchy of Lithuanian lands. Important sobors in the History of the Russian Orthodox Church are: *Vladimir's Sobor in 1276 * The Stoglavy Sobor (Sobor of a Hundred Chapters) in 1551 * The Moscow Sobor of 1666‚Äì1667, to deal with disputes surrounding the ecclesiastical reforms of Patriarch Nikon * The All-Russian Sobor of 1917, which restored the Moscow Patriarchate and elected Saint Tikhon as the first modern Patriarch of Moscow * The All-Russian Sobor of 1988, called on the 1000th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus' to guide the church in the wake of glasnost and the loosening of the Soviet grip over the church A bishop may also call a sobor for his diocese, which again would have delegates from the clergy, monasteries and parishes of his diocese, to discuss important matters. Such diocesan sobors may be held annually or only occasionally. =Catholic= In Roman Catholic usage, synod and council are theoretically synonymous as they are of Greek and Latin origins, respectively, both meaning an authoritative meeting of bishops for the purpose of church administration in the areas of teaching (faith and morals) or governance (church discipline or law). However, in modern use, synod and council are applied to specific categories of such meetings and so do not really overlap. A synod generally meets every three years and is thus designated an \\"Ordinary General Assembly.\\" However, \\"Extraordinary\\" synods can be called to deal with specific situations. There are also \\"Special\\" synods for the Church in a specific geographic area such as the one held November 16-December 12, 1997, for the Church in America.  Synod of Bishops  While the words \\"synod\\" and \\"council\\" usually refer to a transitory meeting, the term \\"Synod of Bishops\\" or \\"Synod of the Bishops\\", is also applied to a permanentMotu proprio Apostolica sollicitudo, ISynodal Information body established in 1965 as an advisory body of the pope. It holds assemblies at which bishops and religious superiors, elected by bishops conferences or the Union of Superiors General or appointed by the Pope vote on proposals (\\"propositiones\\") to present for the pope's consideration, and which in practice the pope uses as the basis of \\"post-synodal apostolic exhortations\\" on the themes discussed. While an assembly of the Synod of Bishops thus expresses its collective wishes, it does not issue decrees, unless in certain cases the pope authorizes it to do so, and even then an assembly's decision requires ratification by the pope.Code of Canon Law, canon 343 The pope serves as president of an assembly or appoints the president, determines the agenda, and summons, suspends, and dissolves the assembly. Modern Catholic synod themes: * X \\"The Bishop: Servant of the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST for the hope of the world\\" 1998 * XI \\"The Eucharist: Source and Summit of the Life and Mission of the Church 2005 * XII \\"The Word of God in the Life and Mission of the Church\\" 2008 * XIII \\"New Evangelisation for the Transmission of the Christian Faith\\" 2012 * Extraordinary General \\"The Pastoral Challenges of the Family in the Context of Evangelization\\" 2014 Councils Meetings of bishops in the Roman empire are known from the mid-third century and already numbered twenty by the time of the First Council of Nicaea (325). Thereafter they continued by the hundreds into the sixth century. Those authorized by an emperor and often attended by him came to be called ecumenical, meaning throughout the world (as the world was thought of in Western terms).MacMullen, Ramsay. Voting About God in Early Church Councils, Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut, 2006. Today, Council in Roman Catholic canon law typically refers to an irregular meeting of the entire episcopate of a nation, region, or the world for the purpose of legislation with binding force. Those contemplated in canon law are the following: *An ecumenical council is an irregular meeting of the entire episcopate in communion with the pope and is, along with the pope, the highest legislative authority of the universal Church (can. 336). The pope alone has the right to convoke, suspend, and dissolve an ecumenical council; he also presides over it or chooses someone else to do so and determines the agenda (can. 338). The vacancy of the Holy See automatically suspends an ecumenical council. Laws or teachings issued by an ecumenical council require the confirmation of the pope, who alone has the right to promulgate them (can. 341). The role of the pope in an ecumenical council is a distinct feature of the Catholic Church. *Plenary councils, which are meetings of the entire episcopate of a nation (including a nation that is only one ecclesiastical province), are convoked by the national episcopal conference. *Provincial councils, which consist of the bishops of an ecclesiastical province smaller than a nation, are convoked by the metropolitan with consent of a majority of the suffragan bishops. Plenary and provincial councils are categorized as particular councils. A particular council is composed of all the bishops of the territory (including coadjutors and auxiliaries) as well as other ecclesiastical ordinaries who head particular churches in the territory (such as territorial abbots and vicars apostolic). Each of these members has a vote on council legislation. Additionally, the following persons by law are part of particular councils but only participate in an advisory capacity: vicars general and episcopal, presidents of Catholic universities, deans of Catholic departments of theology and canon law, some major superiors elected by all the major superiors in the territory, some rectors of seminaries elected by the rectors of seminaries in the territory, and two members from each cathedral chapter, presbyterial council, or pastoral council in the territory (can. 443). The convoking authority can also select other members of the faithful (including the laity) to participate in the council in an advisory capacity. Meetings of the entire episcopate of a supra-national region have historically been called councils as well, such as the various Councils of Carthage in which all the bishops of North Africa were to attend. During the Middle Ages, some councils were legatine, called by a papal legate rather than the pope or bishop. Synods Synods in Eastern Catholic Churches are similar to synods in Orthodox churches in that they are the primary vehicle for election of bishops and establishment of inter-diocesan ecclesiastical laws. The term synod in Latin Church canon law, however, refers to meetings of a representative, thematic, non-legislative (advisory) or mixed nature or in some other way do not meet the qualifications of a \\"council.\\" Examples include: *Diocesan synods are irregular meetings of the clergy and laity of a particular church summoned by the diocesan bishop (or other prelate if the particular church is not a diocese) to deliberate on legislative matters. Only the diocesan bishop holds legislative authority; the other members of the diocesan synod act only in an advisory capacity. Those who must be invited to a diocesan synod by law are any coadjutor or auxiliary bishops, the vicars general and episcopal, the officialis, the vicars forane plus an additional priest from each vicariate forane, the presbyterial council, canons of the cathedral chapter (if there is one), the rector of the seminary, some of the superiors of religious houses in the diocese, and members of the laity chosen by the diocesan pastoral council, though the diocesan bishop can invite others to attend at his own initiative. (can. 463) Episcopal conferences National Episcopal Conferences are another development of the Second Vatican Council. They are permanent bodies consisting of all the Latin rite bishops of a nation and those equivalent to diocesan bishops in law (i.e. territorial abbots). Bishops of other sui juris churches and papal nuncios are not members of episcopal conferences by law, though the conference itself may invite them in an advisory or voting capacity (can. 450). While councils (can. 445) and diocesan synods (can. 391 & 466) have full legislative powers in their areas of competence, national episcopal conferences may only issue supplementary legislation when authorized to do so in canon law or by decree of the Holy See. Additionally, any such supplemental legislation requires a two-thirds vote of the conference and review by the Holy See (can. 455) to have the force of law. Without such authorization and review, episcopal conferences are deliberative only and exercise no authority over their member bishops or dioceses. = Anglican = In the Anglican Communion, synods are elected by clergy and laity. In most Anglican churches, there is a geographical hierarchy of synods, with General Synod at the top; bishops, clergy and laity meet as \\"houses\\" within the synod. Diocesan synods are convened by a bishop in his or her diocese, and consist of elected clergy and lay members. Deanery synods are convened by the Rural Dean (or Area Dean) and consist of all clergy licensed to a benefice within the deanery, plus elected lay members. =Lutheran= In Lutheran traditions a synod can be a legislative body at various levels of the church administration. It can also refer to an administrative region or an entire church body. Lutheran synods of the 1500s were only clergy gatherings such as those in the pre-Reformation church. Synods were held annually and dealt with only spiritual matters. The inclusion of the laity in gatherings termed \\"synod\\" began with the Reformed churches and spread to the Lutherans. In the 1600s, Reformed-style synodical governance was adopted by the Lutheran congregations in the United Duchies of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg when the sovereigns ceased to play a hand in church matters. A combination of consistorial and presbyterial-synodal style governance was instituted in the Prussian Union of Churches under Frederick William III of Prussia. Lutherans who immigrated from Germany and Scandinavia also adopted this form of synod, because the lands they immigrated to had no state church. The specific design of the synods took guidance from philosophies of organizational governance used at the time such as those modeled after the influence of Kant and Hegel. When the German monarchy and the sovereign governance of the church was ended in 1918, the synods took over the governance of the state churches. * In North America, a synod can be a local administrative region similar to a diocese in other denominations. An example of this is the Minneapolis Area Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. However, for some denominations such as the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, it denotes an entire church body. The usage of synod as an administrative ecclesiastical region is also reflected by the German term (i.e. synodal federation), such as the Regional Synodal Federation of the Free City of Danzig. EKHN's 10th Church Synod (general assembly), 2009 * In Europe, a synod can be a legislature comprising deputies elected by all enfranchised members of a church and competent for the entire church. It is similar to a general assembly in Presbyterianism, and found, in regional Protestant church bodies (Landeskirche) in Germany; examples include (i.e. regional or land synod) or (general synod). A synod can also be used by an administrative subunit of a church body, such as a city synod (; comprising synodal deputies of congregations of one denomination within one city) or provincial synod (; comprising synodal deputies of congregations within an ecclesiastical province). The use of the term synod to describe a small gathering is now obsolete, the term used instead is Kirchenkreis. A few Lutheran churches, such as the Church of Sweden or the Evangelical Regional Church in W√ºrttemberg, allow for the formation of political parties (also known as nominating groups, church party or colloquy circle) to nominate candidates for the Synod as a legislation; it is an extension of the idea of multi-ideological democracy within the church. The Missouri Synod also has nominating groups, but they are not officially recognized by the Synod and are not closely linked to any secular political parties as in Sweden. Larger nominating groups include Jesus First/Congregations Matter and the United List. Also the former Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union, comprising mostly Lutheran but also some Reformed and United Protestant congregations, had church parties in its presbyterial and synodal elections. =Presbyterian= Members of a Reformed Synod in Amsterdam by Bernard Picart (1741) In the Presbyterian system of church governance the synod is a level of administration between the local presbytery and the national general assembly. Some denominations use the synod, such as the Presbyterian Church in Canada, Uniting Church in Australia, and the Presbyterian Church USA. However some other churches do not use the synod at all, and the Church of Scotland dissolved its synods in 1993, see List of Church of Scotland synods and presbyteries. =Reformed= In Swiss and southern German Reformed churches, where the Reformed churches are organized as regionally defined independent churches (such as Evangelical Reformed Church of Zurich or Reformed Church of Berne), the synod corresponds to the general assembly of Presbyterian churches. In Reformed churches, the synod can denote a regional meeting of representatives of various classes (regional synod), or the general denominational meeting of representatives from the regional synods (general or national synod). Some churches, especially the smaller denominations, do not have the regional synod tier (for example, the Reformed Church in the United States (RCUS)). Historically, these were meetings such as the Synod of Homberg. =Church of Christ in Congo= In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the vast majority of Protestant denominations have regrouped under a religious institution named the Church of Christ in Congo or CCC, often referred to ‚Äì within the Congo ‚Äì simply as The Protestant Church. In the CCC structure, the national synod is the general assembly of the various churches that constitutes the CCC. From the Synod is drawn an Executive Committee, and a secretariat. There are also synods of the CCC in every province of the Congo, known appropriately as provincial synods. The CCC regroups 62 Protestant denominations.

In Spain, since his abdication, Juan Carlos has usually been referred to as the Rey Em√©rito ('Emeritus King').

Juan Carlos was born in Rome during his family's exile. Francisco Franco took over the government of Spain after his victory in the Spanish Civil War in 1939, yet in 1947 Spain's status as a monarchy was affirmed and a law was passed allowing Franco to choose his successor. Juan Carlos's father, Juan, was the third son of King Alfonso, who had renounced his claims to the throne in January 1941. Juan was seen by Franco to be too liberal and in 1969 was bypassed in favour of Juan Carlos as Franco's successor as head of state.\\"Those Apprentice Kings and Queens Who May ‚Äì One Day ‚Äì Ascend a Throne,\\" The New York Times. 14 November 1971. Juan Carlos spent his early years in Italy and came to Spain in 1947 to continue his studies. After completing his secondary education in 1955, he began his military training and entered the General Military Academy at Zaragoza. Later, he attended the Naval Military School and the General Academy of the Air, and finished his tertiary education at the University of Madrid. In 1962, Juan Carlos married Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark in Athens. The couple had two daughters and a son together: Elena, Cristina, and Felipe. Due to Franco's declining health, Juan Carlos first began periodically acting as Spain's head of state in the summer of 1974. Franco died in November the following year and Juan Carlos became king on 22 November 1975, two days after Franco's death, the first reigning monarch since 1931; although his exiled father did not formally renounce his claims to the throne in favor of his son until 1977. Expected to continue Franco's legacy, Juan Carlos, however, soon after his accession introduced reforms to dismantle the Francoist regime and begin the Spanish transition to democracy. This led to the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 in a referendum which re-established a constitutional monarchy. In 1981, Juan Carlos played a major role in preventing a coup that attempted to revert Spain to Francoist government in the King's name. In 2008, he was considered the most popular leader in all Ibero-America. Hailed for his role in Spain's transition to democracy, the King and the monarchy's reputation began to suffer after controversies surrounding his family arose, exacerbated by the public controversy centering on an elephant-hunting trip he undertook during a time of financial crisis in Spain. In June 2014, Juan Carlos, citing personal reasons, abdicated in favour of his son, who acceded to the throne as Felipe VI. Since August 2020, Juan Carlos has lived in self- exile from Spain over allegedly improper ties to business deals in Saudi Arabia.  Early life (1938‚Äì1969)  Juan Carlos was born to Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, and Princess Mar√≠a de las Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies in their family home in Rome, where his grandfather King Alfonso XIII of Spain and other members of the Spanish royal family lived in exile following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. He was baptized as Juan Carlos Alfonso V√≠ctor Mar√≠a de Borb√≥n y Borb√≥n-Dos Sicilias. His early life was dictated largely by the political concerns of his father and General Franco. He moved to Spain in 1948 to be educated there after his father persuaded Franco to allow it. He began his studies in San Sebasti√°n and finished them in 1954 at the Instituto San Isidro in Madrid. He then joined the army, doing his officer training from 1955 to 1957 at the Military Academy of Zaragoza. Juan Carlos and Alfonso with their father Juan in between (1950) Juan Carlos has two sisters: Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz (1936‚Äì2020); and Infanta Margarita, Duchess of Soria (born 1939). He also had a younger brother, Alfonso. =Brother's death= On the evening of Holy Thursday, 29 March 1956, Juan Carlos's younger brother Alfonso died in a gun accident at the family's home Villa Giralda in Estoril, on the Portuguese Riviera. The Spanish Embassy in Portugal then issued the following official communiqu√©:Quoted in Paul Preston, Juan Carlos: Steering Spain from Dictatorship to Democracy (New York: W. W. Norton, 2004), 101. Alfonso had won a local junior golf tournament earlier in the day, then went to evening Mass and rushed up to the room to see Juan Carlos who had come home for the Easter holidays from military school. Both Juan Carlos, age 18, and Alfonso, age 14, had been apparently playing with a .22 caliber Long Automatic Star revolver owned by Alfonso. As they were alone in the room, it is unclear how Alfonso was shot, but according to Josefina Carolo, dressmaker to Juan Carlos's mother, Juan Carlos pointed the pistol at Alfonso and pulled the trigger, unaware that it was loaded. Bernardo Arnoso, a Portuguese friend of Juan Carlos, also said that Juan Carlos had told him he had fired the pistol not knowing that it was loaded, and adding that the bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Alfonso in the face. Helena Matheopoulos, a Greek author who spoke with Juan Carlos's sister Pilar, said that Alfonso had been out of the room and when he returned and pushed the door open, the door knocked Juan Carlos in the arm, causing him to fire the pistol.Preston, 102.A Royal Mystery at Snopes.com.Juan Carlos and Sof√≠a in August 1962 at the White House's Oval Office, along the Spanish Ambassador and US President John F. Kennedy After learning this news, his father Juan of Bourbon reportedly grabbed Juan Carlos by the neck and shouted at him angrily, \\"Swear to me that you didn't do it on purpose!\\", sending him back to the military academy two days later. Following a later declaration of Mar√≠a de las Mercedes, Paul Preston argues that the content of the former testimony implies that Juan Carlos had pointed the gun at Alfonso and, apparently not knowing that the gun was loaded, he had pulled the trigger. = Education = In 1957, Juan Carlos spent a year in the naval school at Mar√≠n, Pontevedra, and another in the Air Force school in San Javier in Murcia. In 1960‚Äì61, he studied law, international political economy and public finance at the University of Madrid.Su Majestad el Rey Don Juan Carlos , P√°gina oficial de la Casa de Su Majestad el Re. Retrieved 16 September 2011 He then went to live in the Palace of Zarzuela and began carrying out official engagements. = Marriage = Juan Carlos was married in Athens on 14 May 1962, to Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark, daughter of King Paul of Greece, firstly in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Church of St. Denis, followed by a Greek Orthodox ceremony at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. She converted from Greek Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism. They had three children: Elena (b. 1963), Cristina (b. 1965) and Felipe (b. 1968).  Prince of Spain (1969‚Äì1975)  Juan Carlos and Francisco Franco in 1969 The dictatorial regime of Francisco Franco came to power during the Spanish Civil War, which pitted a government of democrats, anarchists, socialists, and communists, supported by the Soviet Union and international volunteers, against a rebellion of conservatives, monarchists, nationalists, and fascists, supported by both Hitler and Mussolini, with the rebels ultimately winning. Franco's authoritarian government remained dominant in Spain until the 1960s. With Franco's increasing age, left-wing protests increased, while at the same time, the far right factions demanded the return of a hardline absolute monarchy. At the time, the heir to the throne of Spain was Juan de Borb√≥n (Count of Barcelona), the son of the late Alfonso XIII. However, General Franco viewed him with extreme suspicion, believing him to be a liberal who was opposed to his regime. Juan Carlos's first cousin Alfonso, Duke of Anjou and C√°diz was also briefly considered as a candidate. Alfonso was known to be an ardent Francoist and would marry Franco's granddaughter, Do√±a Mar√≠a del Carmen Mart√≠nez-Bordi√∫ y Franco in 1972. Ultimately, Franco decided to skip a generation and name Juan de Borb√≥n's son, Prince Juan Carlos, as his personal successor. Franco hoped the young prince could be groomed to take over the nation while still maintaining the ultraconservative and authoritarian nature of his regime. In 1969, Juan Carlos was officially designated heir-apparent and was given the new title of Prince of Spain (not the traditional Prince of Asturias). As a condition of being named heir-apparent, he was required to swear loyalty to Franco's Movimiento Nacional, which he did with little outward hesitation. His choice was ratified by the Spanish parliament on 22 July 1969. Juan Carlos met and consulted Franco many times while heir apparent and often took part in official and ceremonial state functions, standing alongside the dictator, much to the anger of hardline republicans and more moderate liberals, who hoped that Franco's death would bring in an era of reform. During 1969‚Äì1975, Juan Carlos publicly supported Franco's regime. Although Franco's health worsened during those years, whenever he did appear in public, from state dinners to military parades, it was in Juan Carlos's company. Juan Carlos continued to praise Franco and his government for the economic growth and positive changes in Spain. However, as the years progressed, Juan Carlos began meeting secretly with political opposition leaders and exiles, who were fighting to bring liberal reform to the country. He also had secret conversations with his father over the telephone. Franco, for his part, remained largely oblivious to the prince's actions and denied allegations from his ministers and advisors that Juan Carlos was in any way disloyal to his vision of the regime. Proclamation as king at the Palacio de las Cortes on 22 November 1975 During periods of Franco's temporary incapacity in 1974 and 1975, Juan Carlos was acting head of state. On 30 October 1975, Franco gave full control to Juan Carlos; he died three weeks later, on 20 November. On 22 November, two days after Franco's death, the Cortes Espa√±olas proclaimed Juan Carlos King of Spain. In his address to the Cortes, Juan Carlos spoke of three factors: historical tradition, national laws, and the will of the people, and in so doing referred to a process dating back to the Civil War of 1936‚Äì39. He swore using the following formula: \\"I swear to God and the Gospels to comply and enforce compliance to the Fundamental Laws of the Realm and to remain loyal to the Principles of the National Movement\\". On 27 November, a Mass of the Holy Spirit was celebrated in the church of San Jer√≥nimo el Real in Madrid to inaugurate his reign. He opted not to call himself Juan III or Carlos V, but Juan Carlos I. Juan Carlos is reported to have been pressured by Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing to personally tell Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who had traveled to Spain for Franco's funeral, not to attend his inauguration.  Reign (1975‚Äì2014)  = Transition = Royal trips of King Juan Carlos I from 1975 until 2010 Juan Carlos's accession met with relatively little parliamentary opposition. Some members of the Movimiento Nacional voted against recognising him, and more against the 1976 Law for Political Reform. But even most Movimiento members supported both measures.Payne, Stanley G; Fascism in Spain 1923‚Äì1977; University of Wisconsin Press, 1999 Juan Carlos quickly instituted reforms, to the great displeasure of Falangist and conservative (monarchist) elements, especially in the military, who had expected him to maintain the authoritarian state. In July 1976, Juan Carlos dismissed prime minister Carlos Arias Navarro, who had been attempting to continue Francoist policies in the face of the King's attempts at democratisation. He instead appointed Adolfo Su√°rez, a former leader of the Movimiento Nacional, as prime minister, who would go on to win the following year's election and become the first democratically elected leader of the new regime. Juan Carlos in 1977 Further legitimacy was restored to Juan Carlos's position on 14 May 1977, when his father (whom many monarchists had recognized as the legitimate, exiled King of Spain during the Franco era) formally renounced his claim to the throne and recognized his son as the sole head of the Spanish Royal House, transferring to him the historical heritage of the Spanish monarchy, thus making Juan Carlos both de facto and de jure king in the eyes of the traditional monarchists. On 20 May 1977, the leader of the only recently legalized Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), Felipe Gonz√°lez, accompanied by Javier Solana, visited Juan Carlos in the Zarzuela Palace. The event represented a key endorsement of the monarchy from Spain's political left, who had been historically republican. Left-wing support for the monarchy grew when the Communist Party of Spain was legalized shortly thereafter, a move Juan Carlos had pressed for, despite enormous right-wing military opposition at that time, during the Cold War. On 15 June 1977, Spain held its first post-Franco democratic elections. Juan Carlos had played a role as middleman in order to channel $10 million from the Shah of Persia to Adolfo Su√°rez's election campaign, reportedly asking the Shah the money to \\"save Spain from Marxism\\". In 1978, the government promulgated a new constitution that acknowledged Juan Carlos as rightful heir of the Spanish dynasty and king; specifically, Title II, Section 57 asserted Juan Carlos's right to the throne of Spain by dynastic succession in the Bourbon tradition, as \\"the legitimate heir of the historic dynasty\\" rather than as the designated successor of Franco.Title II, Section 57, Subsection 1: \\"The Crown shall be inherited by the successors of H.M. Juan Carlos I de Borb√≥n, the legitimate heir of the historic dynasty.\\" \\"La Corona de Espa√±a es hereditaria en los sucesores de S. M. Don Juan Carlos I de Borb√≥n, leg√≠timo heredero de la dinast√≠a hist√≥rica.\\" The Constitution was passed by the democratically elected Constituent Cortes, ratified by the people in a referendum (6 December) and then signed into law by the King before a solemn meeting of the Cortes. = 1981 coup d'√©tat attempt = There was an attempted military coup, known as 23-F, on 23 February 1981, when the Cortes were seized by members of the Guardia Civil in the parliamentary chamber. During the coup, the King, wearing his uniform as Captain-General of the Armed Forces, gave a public television broadcast calling for unambiguous support for the legitimate democratic government. The broadcast is believed to have been a major factor in foiling the coup. The coup leaders had promised many of their potential supporters that they were acting in the King's name and with his approval, but were unable to demonstrate either, and the broadcast ‚Äì coming just after midnight on the night of the coup ‚Äì definitively showed the King's opposition to the coup makers. When Juan Carlos became king, Communist leader Santiago Carrillo nicknamed him Juan Carlos the Brief, predicting that the monarchy would soon be swept away with the other remnants of the Franco era. After the collapse of the attempted coup, however, in an emotional statement, Carrillo remarked: \\"Today, we are all monarchists.\\" Public support for the monarchy among democrats and leftists before 1981 had been limited; following the king's handling of the coup it increased significantly. = Later role in Spanish politics = 5000 Spanish peseta note with the image of King Juan Carlos The victory of the PSOE in 1982 under Gonz√°lez marked the effective end of the King's active involvement in Spanish politics. Gonz√°lez would govern for 14 years, longer than any democratically elected Prime Minister. His administration helped consolidate Spanish democracy and thus maintained the stability of the nation. On paper, Juan Carlos retained fairly extensive reserve powers. He was the guardian of the Constitution and was responsible for ensuring that it was obeyed. In practice, since the passage of the Constitution (and especially since 1982), he took a mostly non-partisan and representative role, acting almost entirely on the advice of the government. However, he commanded great moral authority as an essential symbol of the country's unity. Under the Constitution, the King has immunity from prosecution in matters relating to his official duties. Consequently, he exercised most of his powers through the ministers; his acts as King (and not as a citizen) were not valid unless countersigned by a minister, who became politically responsible for the act in question. The honour of the royal family is specifically protected from insult by the Spanish Penal Code. Under this protection, Basque independentist Arnaldo OtegiBasque convicted for king insult, BBC News, 4 November 2005. Retrieved 29 December 2007. and cartoonists from El Jueves were tried and punished. The King gives an annual speech to the nation on Christmas Eve. He is the commander-in-chief of the Spanish armed forces. Meeting of Juan Carlos and Sof√≠a with Vladimir Putin and Lyudmila Putina in 2000 during an official state visit of the latter to Spain In July 2000, Juan Carlos was the target of an enraged protester when former priest Juan Mar√≠a Fern√°ndez y Krohn, who had once attacked Pope John Paul II, breached security and attempted to approach the king. When the media asked Juan Carlos in 2005 whether he would endorse the bill legalising same-sex marriage that was then being debated in the Cortes Generales, he answered \\"Soy el Rey de Espa√±a y no el de B√©lgica\\" (\\"I am the King of Spain, not of Belgium\\")a reference to King Baudouin of Belgium, who had refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. The King gave his Royal Assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005; the law legalising same-sex marriage was gazetted in the Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July. According to a poll in the newspaper El Mundo in November 2005, 77.5% of Spaniards thought Juan Carlos was \\"good or very good\\", 15.4% \\"not so good\\", and only 7.1% \\"bad or very bad\\". Even so, the issue of the monarchy re-emerged on 28 September 2007 as photos of the king were burnt in public in Catalonia by small groups of protesters wanting the restoration of the Republic.  2007 Ibero-American Summit  2007 Ibero-American Summit in Santiago de Chile In November 2007, at the Ibero-American Summit in Santiago de Chile, during a heated exchange, Juan Carlos interrupted Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez, saying, \\"¬øPor qu√© no te callas?\\" (\\"Why don't you shut up?\\"). Ch√°vez had been interrupting the Spanish Prime Minister, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, while the latter was defending his predecessor and political opponent, Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, after Ch√°vez had referred to Aznar as a fascist and \\"less human than snakes\\". The King shortly afterwards left the hall when President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua accused Spain of intervention in his country's elections and complained about some Spanish energy companies working in Nicaragua. (\\"King Juan Carlos to Hugo Ch√°vez: 'Why don't you shut up?'\\") This was an unprecedented diplomatic incident and a rare display of public anger by the King. (\\"Never has the King been seen so angry in public\\")  Budget of the royal house  In 2011, after the King's son-in-law I√±aki Urdangar√≠n (married to Cristina in 1997) became embroiled in a financial scandal and was accused of corruption (the \\"Urdangar√≠n affair\\"), Juan Carlos detailed for the first time the yearly royal budget of ‚Ç¨8.3 million, excluding expenses such as the electricity bill, paid by the State.  Botswana hunting trip  In April 2012, Juan Carlos faced criticism for an elephant- hunting trip in Botswana. The public found out about the trip only after the King injured himself and a special aircraft was sent to bring him home.Winds of change: The rights, wrongs, abdication and legacy of King Juan Carlos, The Economist. Spanish officials stated that the expenses of the trip were not paid by taxpayers or by the palace, but by Mohamed Eyad Kayali, a businessman of Syrian origin. Cayo Lara Moya of the United Left party said the King's trip \\"demonstrated a lack of ethics and respect toward many people in this country who are suffering a lot\\" while Tom√°s G√≥mez of the Socialist party said Juan Carlos should choose between \\"public responsibilities or an abdication\\". In April 2012, Spain's unemployment was at 23% and nearly 50% for young workers. El Pa√≠s estimated the total cost of a hunting trip at ‚Ç¨44,000, about twice the average annual salary in Spain. A petition called for the king to resign from his position as honorary president of the Spanish branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature. The WWF itself responded by asking for an interview with the King to resolve the situation. In July 2012, WWF-Spain held a meeting in Madrid and decided with 226 votes to 13 to remove the King from its honorary presidency. He later apologised for the hunting trip. Up until the Botswana elephant trip, Juan Carlos had enjoyed a high level of shielding from media scrutiny, described as \\"rare among Western leaders\\". = Abdication = Juan Carlos I next to prime minister Mariano Rajoy, who is seen countersigning the organic law for abdication (18 June 2014). Spanish news media speculated about the King's future in early 2014, following public criticism over his taking an elephant hunting safari in Botswana and an embezzlement scandal involving his daughter Cristina, and her husband I√±aki Urdangarin. The King's chief of staff denied in a briefing that the 'abdication option' was being considered. On the morning of 2 June 2014, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy made a televised announcement that the King had told him of his intention to abdicate. Later, the King delivered a televised address and announced that he would abdicate the throne in favour of the Prince of Asturias. Royal officials described the King's choice as a personal decision which he had been contemplating since his 76th birthday at the start of the year. The King reportedly said, \\"No queremos que mi hijo se marchite esperando como el pr√≠ncipe Carlos.\\" (English: \\"We do not want my son to wither waiting like Prince Charles.\\") As required by the Spanish constitution, any abdication would be settled by means of an organic law. A draft law was passed with 299 in favour, 19 against and 23 abstaining. On 18 June, he signed the organic law passed by parliament several hours before his abdication took effect. Felipe was enthroned on 19 June 2014, and Juan Carlos's granddaughter Leonor became the new Princess of Asturias. Juan Carlos was the fourth European monarch to abdicate in just over a year, following Pope Benedict XVI (28 February 2013), Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands (30 April 2013), and King Albert II of Belgium (21 July 2013). The Spanish constitution at the time of the abdication did not grant an abdicated monarch the legal immunity of a head of state, but the government changed the law to allow this. However, unlike his previous immunity, the new legislation left him accountable to the supreme court, in a similar type of protection afforded to many high-ranking civil servants and politicians in Spain. The legislation stipulates that all outstanding legal matters relating to the former king be suspended and passed \\"immediately\\" to the supreme court.  Reactions  Republican demonstration in the Puerta del Sol on the day that Juan Carlos announced his decision to abdicate The Spanish press gave the announcement a broadly positive reception, but described the moment as an \\"institutional crisis\\" and \\"a very important moment in the history of democratic Spain\\". Around Spain and in major cities (including London) the news was met by republican celebration and protests, calling for the end of the monarchy. Catalan leader Artur Mas said that the news of the King's abdication would not slow down the process of independence for Catalonia. I√±igo Urkullu, the President of the Basque government, concluded that the King's reign was \\"full of light yet also darkness\\" and said that his successor Felipe should remember that \\"the Basque Question has not been resolved\\". Other regional leaders had more positive evaluations of Juan Carlos following his decision to abdicate: Alberto N√∫√±ez Feij√≥o of Galicia called him \\"the King of Democracy\\" who \\"guaranteed the continuation of constitutional monarchy\\" and Alberto Fabra of the Valencian Community said that Spaniards are proud of their king who had been \\"at the forefront of protecting our interests inside and outside of our borders\\". British Prime Minister David Cameron stated: \\"I would like to use this opportunity to make a tribute to King Juan Carlos, who has done so much during his reign to aid the successful Spanish transition to democracy, and has been a great friend of the United Kingdom.\\" The President of the European Commission, Jos√© Manuel Barroso, said that Juan Carlos was a \\"believer in Europeanism and modernity...without whom one could not understand modern Spain\\". The Spanish public also gave a broadly positive opinion not only of the abdication but of his reign as a whole. According to a poll taken by El Mundo, 65% saw the King's reign as either good or very good, up from 41.3%. Overall, 55.7% of those polled in the 3‚Äì5 June survey by Sigma Dos supported the institution of the monarchy in Spain, up from 49.9% when the same question was posed six months prior. 57.5% believed the Prince could restore the royal family's lost prestige. An overwhelming majority of Spaniards believed the new King, Felipe VI, would make a good monarch and more than three-quarters believed King Juan Carlos had been right to hand over the throne to his son.  Retirement  Juan Carlos continued to have a role as institutional representative. In December 2015, Juan Carlos attended the inauguration of Mauricio Macri as President of Argentina as top Spanish representative. He announced by a letter to his son Felipe that his intention to retire from public life on 2 June 2019. In June 2019, the former King announced his retirement from official duties. = 2020 Saudi rail deal = a high-speed railway in Saudi Arabia was allegedly coordinated with kick-backs to Juan Carlos during the late-2000s. 260x260px Recordings of the former King's alleged mistress Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn speaking with a former police chief were leaked to the press in mid-2018. Sayn-Wittgenstein claimed that Juan Carlos received kick-backs from commercial contracts in the Gulf States ‚Äì particularly in the late-2000s construction of the ‚Ç¨6.7 billion (US$6 billion) Haramain high-speed railway in Saudi Arabia ‚Äì and maintained these proceeds in a bank account in Switzerland. She alleged that he purchased properties in Monaco under her name to circumvent the tax treatment of lawful residents, stating \\"[not] because he [loved] me a lot, but because I reside in Monaco.\\" She further claimed the head of the Spanish intelligence service warned her that her life, and those of her children, would be at risk if she spoke of their association. The allegations drew demands for Juan Carlos to be investigated for corruption in early June 2019.Matthew Campbell, Juan Carlos: with a final ol√©, Spain's King of Shame limps out of spotlight, The Sunday Times, 2 June 2019 Swiss authorities began investigating Juan Carlos in March 2020 in relation to a $100 million donation given to Sayn-Wittgenstein in 2012. This donation was linked to alleged kick-back fees from Saudi Arabia. Sayn-Wittgenstein reportedly told the head Swiss prosecutor on 19 December 2018 that Juan Carlos had gifted her ‚Ç¨65 million out of \\"gratitude and love\\", to guarantee her future and her children's, because \\"he still had hopes to win her back\\". On 14 March 2020, The Telegraph reported that his son Felipe, King of Spain since 2014, appeared as second beneficiary (after Juan Carlos) of the Lucum Foundation, the entity on the receiving end of a ‚Ç¨65 million donation by Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, King of Saudi Arabia. On 15 March 2020, the Royal Household issued a statement declaring that Felipe VI would renounce any inheritance from his father. Additionally, the statement announced that the former king would lose his public stipend from the State's General Budget. In June 2020, the public prosecutor's office of the Spanish Supreme Court accepted to pursue investigation against Juan Carlos pertaining his role as facilitator in the Phase II of the high speed rail connecting Mecca and Medina, intending to delimitate the criminal relevance of the facts that took place after his abdication in June 2014. As King of Spain, Juan Carlos was immune from prosecution from 1975 to 2014 via crown immunity. =Exile= On 3 August 2020, the Palace of Zarzuela announced Juan Carlos wished to relocate from Spain because of increased media press about his business dealings in Saudi Arabia and left a letter to his son saying so. By the time the letter had been made public, he had already left the country. Journalists speculated that he might have fled to the Dominican Republic, Portugal, France, and Italy, and, later, as of 7 August, the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi. The Royal Household initially declined requests to publicly disclose Juan Carlos's location; on 17 August, the Royal House confirmed that, since 3 August, Juan Carlos was in the United Arab Emirates, where he arrived by taking a private plane from Vigo Airport. Family and private life Juan Carlos, Sof√≠a and their three children in 1975 Juan Carlos and Sof√≠a have had two daughters and one son: * Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo (born 20 December 1963 at Our Lady of Loreto Nursing Home in Madrid) * Infanta Cristina (born 13 June 1965 at Our Lady of Loreto Nursing Home in Madrid) * King Felipe VI of Spain (born 30 January 1968 at Our Lady of Loreto Nursing Home in Madrid) Juan Carlos is also the alleged father of Alberto Sola, born in Barcelona in 1956, also of a woman born in Catalonia in 1964, and of Ingrid Sartiau, a Belgian woman born in 1966 who has filed a paternity suit,Article by Jennifer Navarro in El Nacional 8 January 2018 but complete sovereign immunity prevented that suit prior to his abdication. Juan Carlos had several extramarital affairs adversely affecting his marriage.Stanley G. Payne & Jes√∫s Palacios in Franco: A Personal and Political Biography 2014 p. 578 In 1972, Juan Carlos, a keen sailor, competed in the Dragon class event at the Olympic Games, finishing 15th. In their summer holidays, the whole family meets in Marivent Palace (Palma de Mallorca) and the Fortuna yacht, where they take part in sailing competitions. The king has manned the Brib√≥n series of yachts. In winter, the family often go skiing in Baqueira-Beret and Candanch√∫ (Pyrenees). At present, his hobbies include classic sailing boats. Juan Carlos also hunts bears; in October 2004, he angered environmental activists by killing nine bears in central Romania, one of which was pregnant.Romania: Elite Hunting Spree Sparks Calls For Better Animal Protection, RFE/RL, 27 January 2005 It was alleged by the Russian regional authorities that in August 2006 Juan Carlos shot a drunken tame bear (Mitrofan the Bear) during a private hunting trip to Russia; the Office of the Spanish Monarchy denied this claim.\\"Royal row over Russian bear fate\\", BBC, 20 October 2006 Juan Carlos is a member of the World Scout Foundation and of the Sons of the American Revolution. Health Royal monogram A benign 17‚Äì19 mm tumour was removed under general anaesthetic from King Juan Carlos's right lung in an operation carried out in the Hospital Cl√≠nic de Barcelona in May 2010. The operation followed an annual check-up, and Juan Carlos was not expected to need any further treatment. In April 2012, the King underwent surgery for a triple fracture of the hip at the San Jose Hospital, Madrid, following a fall on a private elephant-hunting trip to Botswana. He also underwent a hip operation in September 2013 at Madrid's Quir√≥n hospital. In April 2018, Juan Carlos was admitted to hospital for a surgery on his right knee. On 24 August 2019 he had heart surgery.  Titles, styles, honours and arms  In 1969, Juan Carlos was named as General Franco's successor and was given the title of 'Prince of Spain'. Upon the death of Franco in 1975, Juan Carlos acceded to the throne of Spain. The current Spanish constitution refers to the monarch by the simple title \\"King of Spain\\". Aside from this title, the constitution allows for the use of other historic titles pertaining to the Spanish monarchy, without specifying them.Article 56 This was also reiterated by a decree promulgated on 6 November 1987 concerning titles of members of the royal family. Since his abdication in 2014, King Juan Carlos has retained, by courtesy, the title and style of king that he enjoyed during his reign. = Arms =  Ancestry   See also  * List of honours of the Spanish Royal Family by country * Line of succession to the Spanish throne * List of titles and honours of Juan Carlos I of Spain  Notes   References  =Informational notes= =Citations= =Bibliography= *  Further reading  * Paul Preston, Juan Carlos: Steering Spain from Dictatorship to Democracy, W W Norton & Co Inc, June 2004. . * Ronald Hilton, SPAIN: King Juan Carlos. * Wilsford, David, ed.

The Laboratory has been operated by Ohio-based Battelle since 1965.PNNL: About - Business Facts History This November 1964 Tri-City Herald newspaper clip announces Battelle has been selected to manage the new Pacific Northwest Laboratory in Richland beginning in January 1965. PNNL was established in 1965 but traces its origins to World War II, in the establishment of the Hanford Site in 1943. Plutonium production for the Manhattan Project required extensive research and development activities at the Hanford Site. The General Electric Company began operating the site in 1946 and consolidated R&D; into the new Hanford Laboratory in 1953. After GE ended its contract in 1963 to avoid conflicts with its growing commercial nuclear business, the Atomic Energy Commission split the Hanford contract among several organizations, awarding the laboratory contract to Ohio-based Battelle Memorial Institute. Battelle took over operations on January 4, 1965, and named it the Pacific Northwest Laboratory. Initially, PNL‚Äôs research emphasized nuclear energy and non-destructive uses for nuclear materials, including the design for the Fast Flux Test Facility to test fuels and materials for the AEC‚Äôs commercial nuclear power program. However, PNL scientists and engineers also worked on nongovernment projects. Jim Russell patented a method for optical digital recording and playback, eventually used in compact discs and digital video discs, while a Senior Scientist at PNL in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1969, NASA chose PNL to measure the concentration of both solar and galactic cosmic-ray-produced radionuclides in lunar material collected from the entire Apollo program. In the 1970s, PNL expanded into energy, environment, health and national security research. The shift occurred as the AEC was replaced by the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1974 and the Department of Energy in 1977. During this period, researchers at PNL developed vitrification, a process to lock hazardous waste inside glass, and an acoustic holography technique allowing medical personnel to view internal organs, detect fetal abnormalities, and locate blood clots without an operation. In the 1980s, PNL researchers introduced the first portable blood irradiator for leukemia treatments,Hungate, FP. 1995. \\"Portable Blood Irradiator.\\" Radiation Protection Dosimetry 60(4): 359-362. and worked with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle under a cooperative research and development agreement to develop safe and effective protocols for its use. In the mid-1980s, PNL became one of the U.S. Department of Energy's multiprogram laboratories. In 1995, the laboratory was renamed the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The Laboratory's global environmental and nuclear nonproliferation work moved to the forefront during the 1990s. The Pacific Northwest Center for Global Security was established to coordinate nuclear nonproliferation programs, research and policy work within the Laboratory and throughout the region.

Turbyfill Front Quadrangle with (left to right) Miller Hall, The Administration Building, and Trout Hall, all listed on the National Register of Historic Places =Early years= Roanoke College was founded in 1842, as a boys' preparatory school by Lutheran pastors David F. Bittle and Christopher C. Baughmann.Guide to Historical Salem  Vol. 9 No. 1 Originally located in Augusta County near Staunton, the school was named Virginia Institute until chartered on January 30, 1845, as Virginia Collegiate Institute. In 1847, the institute moved to Salem which was developing into a center of commerce and transportation in the region; the school moved all of its possessions in a single covered wagon. The Virginia General Assembly granted a college charter on March 14, 1853 and approved the name Roanoke College, chosen in honor of the Roanoke Valley.\\"Legislature of Virginia\\". Richmond Enquirer (Richmond, Virginia). March 15, 1853. p. 4. Bittle then served as the college's first president. Roanoke was one of the few Southern colleges that remained open throughout the American Civil War. The student body was organized into a corps of cadets and fought with Confederate forces near Salem in December 1863. The students were outmatched and quickly forced to surrender, but the Union commander paroled them and allowed them to return to their studies. The college company was formally mustered into the Confederate Army, Virginia Reserves, on September 1, 1864, but the students did not see combat before the war ended. =International students= Roanoke enrolled its first international students in the late 19th century; the first Mexican student in 1876 and the first Japanese student in 1888. The first Korean to graduate from an American college or university, Surh Beung Kiu, graduated in 1898. =Coeducation= Roanoke became coeducational in 1930. A small number of non-degree-seeking women, mostly from Elizabeth College in Salem, were previously enrolled. Originally named Roanoke Women's College, Elizabeth was a sister Lutheran women's college destroyed by fire in 1921 and closed; the female students finished the 1921‚Äì22 academic year at Roanoke.A Guide to Historical Salem  Vol. 4 No. 3 Roanoke opened its first women's residence hall, Smith Hall, in 1941. Smith Hall has a prominent position on the John R. Turbyfill Front Quad. Roanoke retains the Roanoke Women's College campus as its Elizabeth Campus, named for Elizabeth College. The campus, located approximately two miles from the Roanoke main campus, houses residence halls, athletic fields, and the college tennis complex. Roanoke adopted the alumnae of Marion College, a sister Lutheran women's college in Marion, Virginia, when it closed in 1967. Marion Hall, a residence hall constructed in 1968, honors the college and its alumnae. =National championships= Roanoke athletic teams have won two national championships: the 1972 NCAA Men's College Division Basketball Championship and the 1978 Division II men's lacrosse championship. Roanoke's third national championship occurred in 2001 when student Casey Smith won an individual championship in the Division III women's 10,000m track and field event. In 2009, student Robin Yerkes secured Roanoke's fourth national championship when she won an individual championship in the Division III women's 400m track and field event. =Sesquicentennial= Roanoke experienced exceptional growth in the 1980s and 1990s.Prologue to Prominence ‚Äì George Keller ‚Äì Two campaign plans, the 1992 Sesquicentennial Campaign and the 2002 Plan, also known as \\"The Difference\\", were successfully completed with over $150 million raised. The campaigns financed the renovation and construction of numerous facilities including the library, the student center, and the arts and performance center. Roanoke's tenth president, and first female president, Sabine O'Hara, took office in 2004. O'Hara, an expert in sustainable economic development, was recruited to lead formulation of a new strategic plan, one that would advance the college into the next decade. In 2006, Roanoke unveiled \\"The 2015 Plan\\", which calls for expanded academic offerings, an increase in enrollment from 1,900 to 2,100 students, renovation and construction of facilities to support increased enrollment, and growth in endowment resources to support financial aid for more students. O'Hara resigned in 2007 after unveiling the plan; her tenure was short, but productive with four new residence halls constructed, two academic buildings renovated, a new sports stadium completed, and records set for applications and enrollment. =Leaders= David F.

Lutheran heritage Established in 1842, Roanoke is the second oldest (Gettysburg College is the oldest) Lutheran-affiliated college in the United States and is associated with three synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America: the Virginia Synod, the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Synod, and the West Virginia‚ÄìWestern Maryland Synod. The Virginia Synod is headquartered in Bittle Hall, the college's first library now occupied by the Bishop of the Virginia Synod. Historically, the college has had a small Lutheran population. Roanoke's student body represents numerous religious denominations; Roman Catholic is the most prevalent, Lutherans total less than ten percent. Roanoke has an active religious life program for students seeking that experience, but religion is not prominent; students are not required to attend religious services or to take classes in religion. Roanoke honors its Lutheran heritage with an independent board of trustees; the church does not control administration. The dominant aspect of Roanoke's Lutheran heritage is the college's commitment to academic freedom. Martin Luther encouraged freedom from oppression along with freedom for learning and freedom for service in the community. Academics = Reputation = Roanoke is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award bachelor's degrees in arts, science, and business administration. In addition, the business administration program is accredited by the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs; the chemistry program is accredited by the American Chemical Society; the teacher licensure program is accredited by the Teacher Education Accreditation Council; and the athletic training program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs.

Each year, Roanoke accepts approximately 35 incoming freshmen and first-term sophomores to become members of the Honors Program. These students complete the Honors Curriculum in lieu of the Roanoke College Core Curriculum. Honors students are offered numerous special learning experiences including plays, lectures, concerts, and service projects. Roanoke has 16 academic departments: * Biology * Business Administration and Economics * Chemistry * Education * English * Environmental Studies * Fine Arts * Health and Human Performance * History * Math, Computer Science, and Physics * Modern Languages * Psychology * Public Affairs * Religion and Philosophy * Sociology Roanoke also has eight pre- professional programs: * Dentistry * Engineering * Law * Medicine * Ministry * Nursing * Pharmacy * Veterinary Medicine In 2010, Roanoke was recognized as one of the top 16 colleges or universities where it is hardest to receive an \\"A\\" grade, ranking third in the south. Roanoke students receive an \\"A\\" approximately 30 percent of the time. Other schools included in the top 16 were Princeton University, Boston University, and MIT. =Roanoke College Seal= The Roanoke College Seal was designed in 1964 by Professor Guy A. Ritter. The Board of Trustees subsequently approved the seal and it is now used to represent the college in all academic settings. The blue shield on the seal emblazoned with a gold cross represents the College's strong history and relationship with the Christian church. The white dogwood flower represents the Commonwealth of Virginia The Lamp above symbolizes the lamp of knowledge. The motto, \\"Palmam Qui Meruit Ferat\\", means in English, \\"Let he who earns the palm bear it\\". The palm is symbolic of the honor-laden palm leaf given during antiquity in Greece. =Special programs= Roanoke has several special programs that bring distinguished visitors to the college. The Henry H. Fowler Public Affairs Lecture Series brings respected world leaders to campus. Guest lecturers have included former presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Lawrence Eagleburger, former Polish president Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and numerous other diplomats and public officials. In addition, the Copenhaver Artist-in-Residence Program brings visiting artists to campus, including theatrical productions, while the Charles H. Fisher Lecture Series brings distinguished scientists to campus. =Upward Bound= The Roanoke College Upward Bound Program (a TRIO program) was established in 1965 and has helped more than 1,200 socio-economically challenged high school students prepare for college. The program serves students attending high school in Salem, Roanoke, Roanoke County and Bedford County; the schools are Glenvar, Liberty, Northside, Patrick Henry, Salem, Staunton River and William Fleming. The program offers classes in math, science, English, foreign languages, computer science, and physical education during the summer and during the academic year. Roanoke cancelled the 2012 summer session; due to fiscal constraints, the Congress did not renew the five-year grant that funds the program. Student body Roanoke has approximately 2,000 students who represent approximately 40 states and 30 countries. Approximately 50% of the student body is from Virginia; the majority of out-of-state students are from Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. It is also known for its famous radio show John Dodd‚Äôs Chalk Talk. Faculty Roanoke has a tenure-track faculty of 131 (95% hold the highest degrees in their fields) plus a variety of adjunct professors selected from the business, political, and other communities for their subject matter expertise. Library Roanoke's Fintel Library, named after Dr. Norman Fintel, eighth president of the college, has a collection of over half a million items.Library Information ‚Äì Roanoke College ‚Äì Salem, Virginia Roanoke and nearby Hollins University have a reciprocal borrowing agreement, expanding the size of the library collection by another 300,000 items. Student life =Student organizations= Roanoke has over 100 student organizations that provide learning experiences outside the classroom. Students may choose from academic, cultural, religious, service, and social organizations including nine Greek organizations. The Student Government Association at Roanoke exists to give students a voice in the administration. It is the highest level student organization. It is made up of an executive board (President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, and Attorney General) and the Senate (41 members). Student publications and media opportunities include the Brackety- Ack campus newspaper, a literary magazine titled On Concept's Edge, the Roanoke Review literary journal, and the student-operated radio station named WRKE-LP. Intramural sports are also offered. =Greek life= Organizations Roanoke has recognized chapters of nine social and two service Greek organizations. Fraternities: * Kappa Alpha Order (Beta Rho Chapter, established 1924, revived 1988) * Pi Kappa Alpha (Phi Chapter, established 1896, revived 2001) * Pi Kappa Phi (Xi Chapter, established 1916, revived 2005) * Pi Lambda Phi (Virginia Lambda Kappa Chapter, established 1959, revived 2012) * Sigma Chi (Tau Chapter, established 1872, revived 1923) Pi Lambda Phi's Lambda Kappa Chapter (founded 1959) Sororities: * Alpha Sigma Alpha (Theta Beta Chapter, established 2002) * Chi Omega (Pi Epsilon Chapter, established 1955) * Delta Gamma (Gamma Pi Chapter, established 1955) *Sigma Alpha Omega (Beta Alpha Chapter, established 2016) Service fraternities and sororities: *Alpha Phi Omega (Alpha Beta Psi Chapter, established 1988) *Mu Beta Psi (Omicron Chapter, established 2001) Greek history Roanoke has a long history of Greek organizations. The Black Badge Society, organized at Roanoke in 1859, was one of the earliest Greek organizations established in the South. The fraternity became inactive at Roanoke in 1879, but had expanded to include chapters at eight other colleges and universities, the last of which became inactive in 1882. In addition to the Black Badge Society, Roanoke's inactive fraternities include: * Alpha Tau Omega (Epsilon Chapter, established 1869) * Phi Delta Theta (Virginia Alpha Chapter, established 1869) * Phi Gamma Delta (Beta Deuteron Chapter, established 1866) * Sigma Phi Epsilon (Virginia Gamma Chapter, established 1903) Roanoke added sororities for the first time in 1955; the three organizations, Chi Omega, Delta Gamma and Phi Mu, were housed in Bowman Hall for many years until they moved to Chesapeake Hall in 2006. Alpha Sigma Alpha, the fourth sorority, was established in 2002. Roanoke's newest sorority is Delta Sigma Theta, the college's first historically African-American sorority, established in 2005. Phi Mu (Gamma Eta Chapter) became inactive in 2014. Housing Roanoke's Greek organizations reside in college-owned housing. Roanoke's original fraternity row, constructed in the 1960s, no longer houses the college's fraternities; the buildings have been converted into residence halls. The Greek organizations are now housed in two locations on the Roanoke campus. Kappa Alpha Order, Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi Lambda Phi and Sigma Chi have houses on the Elizabeth Campus. Alpha Sigma Alpha, Chi Omega, Delta Gamma and Pi Kappa Phi occupy Chesapeake Hall, a residence hall on the main campus; each organization has a floor in the four-story building. Student participation Roanoke's Greek organizations have a prominent role on campus, but are not dominant; approximately 25% of the Roanoke student body participates in Greek life. Roanoke has over 100 student organizations that provide many extracurricular opportunities other than Greek life. Campus =Quadrangles= Roanoke's main campus is relatively self-contained with most academic buildings and residence halls built around three quadrangles: the John R. Turbyfill Front Quad, the Back Quad (central campus), and the Athletic Quad, which surrounds the college's newest athletic facilities and residence halls. The campus is lined with brick sidewalks and has been recognized for its landscaping and views of the surrounding mountains. The largest Rock Elm in the United States is located near the library. The only Alice Aycock sculpture in Virginia is on the Back Quad. =Architecture= The campus architecture is a blend of traditional collegiate and modern styles. The Administration Building, constructed in 1848 with bricks made on-site, and six other buildings, Miller Hall, Trout Hall, Bittle Hall, Monterey House, West Hall, and the Old Salem Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Two of these buildings, the Administration Building and Monterey House, were built by the Deyerle brothers, Joseph and Benjamin Deyerle. The designers of some of the other historic buildings are unknown, but may have also included members of the Deyerle family. Fintel Library, Colket Student Center, and most residence halls have the traditional style of the older structures. Other newer buildings are more modern; these include Antrim Chapel, the science complex comprising Trexler Hall, Massengill Auditorium, and the Life Science Building, the fine arts building named F. W. Olin Hall, and C. Homer Bast Physical Education and Recreational Center. =National Register of Historic Places= Old Roanoke County Courthouse (now Francis T.

The colonial revival mansion, one of the largest private homes in the area, was constructed in the late 1930s. It was purchased in the mid-1950s by John P. Fishwick, president of the Norfolk and Western Railway and a Roanoke & Harvard Law School alumnus, and was acquired by the college in 1968. Presidents Kendig, Fintel, Gring, O'Hara, and Maxey have lived in the house. In April 2011, the President's House and its garden were opened to the public during Virginia's Historic Garden Week. Selection of sites to participate is very competitive; only five Roanoke Valley residences were featured in 2011.President‚Äôs House featured on the Roanoke Valley Home and Garden Tour - Roanoke College - Salem, Virginia =Elizabeth Campus= Additional college facilities, mostly residence halls and athletic fields, are located on the site of Elizabeth College, a Lutheran women's college that closed in 1922. The area, approximately two miles east of the main campus, is referred to as Elizabeth Campus. Houses for Kappa Alpha Order, Pi Kappa Alpha, Pi Lambda Phi and Sigma Chi are on Elizabeth Campus along with Elizabeth Hall, a large residence hall with apartments for non-freshman students. =College Avenue ‚Äì Main Street= The Old Salem Post Office Building, one of seven college buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places Roanoke acquired three office buildings on College Avenue across from West Hall in 2005‚Äì06. The buildings have been renovated to provide classroom and office space for various college departments.Construction Highlights the Changing Face of Campus ‚Äì Roanoke College ‚Äì Salem, Virginia With the acquisitions, the Roanoke campus occupies both sides of College Avenue from Main Street north to the traditional campus entrance. In 2013, Roanoke purchased two Main Street buildings: the Bank Building, located on the corner of College Avenue and Main Street across from West Hall, and the Old Salem Post Office, located on the corner of Main and Market Streets. Roanoke had leased the bank building for several years preceding the purchase and will continue to use it for academic purposes. The post office building, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is the seventh building on the Roanoke campus listed on the national register; it will be renovated for academic use. =Recent construction= Roanoke opened a new 200-bed residence hall in 2012; the building, the college's second LEED certified building, completes the third quadrangle along with Kerr Stadium and Caldwell, Beamer, and Ritter Halls. The college previously completed an eight-court competition tennis complex on the Elizabeth Campus and a large parking lot on the main campus; the projects replaced existing facilities and made land available for the new residence hall.Roanoke College airs plan for land ‚Äì Roanoke.com Roanoke College's proposed parking lot ‚Äì Roanoke.com In addition, McClanahan Hall on the Elizabeth Campus reopened in 2012 as the Sigma Chi house; the Sigma Chi house on the main campus was razed and is now green space. Roanoke's most recent major project opened in 2016; the Morris M. Cregger Center is a multi-purpose athletic and recreation center with a 2,500 seat performance arena (basketball and volleyball), a 200-meter indoor track and field facility, athletic department and faculty offices, classrooms, fitness and workout facilities, and a sports medicine clinic. The center is on the north side of campus; Bowman Hall, a large residence hall that opened in 1965, was razed to make land available. Kerr Stadium was incorporated as a part of the western facade so the two facilities form a unified complex; the center overlooks the stadium. Roanoke, in anticipation of future growth, has purchased a significant number of private homes on Market Street adjacent to campus, which will provide land for expansion.Roanoke College adds homes to its holdings ‚Äì Roanoke.com Athletics Roanoke is an NCAA Division III school competing in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference.

Roanoke graduates who have advanced to leadership positions include Stuart T. Saunders and John Fishwick, former presidents of the NWR; John R. Turbyfill, retired vice-chairman, NSC; John S. Shannon, retired executive vice president, NSC; and William T. Ross, Sr., retired assistant vice president, NWR. Roanoke has strong historic ties to the railway due in part to its alumni connections. The NWR named a Pullman car \\"Roanoke College\\" in honor of the college and Fishwick's Salem residence is now the college President's House. Saunders and Turbyfill served as chairman of Roanoke's board of trustees. In 2007, David R.

Such regions are neither legally incorporated as a city or town would be, nor are they legal administrative divisions like counties or separate entities such as states; because of this, the precise definition of any given metropolitan area can vary with the source. The statistical criteria for a standard metropolitan area were defined in 1949 and redefined as metropolitan statistical area in 1983. A typical metropolitan area is centered on a single large city that wields substantial influence over the region (e.g., New York City or Philadelphia). However, some metropolitan areas contain more than one large city with no single municipality holding a substantially dominant position (e.g., Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex, Norfolk-Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads), Riverside‚ÄìSan Bernardino (Inland Empire) or Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul (Twin Cities)). MSAs are defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and used by the Census Bureau and other federal government agencies for statistical purposes. Map An enlargeable map of the 955 core based statistical areas (CBSAs) of the United States and Puerto Rico, Feb 2013. The 374 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) are shown in medium green. Definitions U.S. Census statistics for metropolitan areas are reported according to the following definitions. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines a set of core based statistical areas (CBSAs) throughout the country. CBSAs are delineated on the basis of a central urban area or urban clusterin other words: a contiguous area of relatively high population density. CBSAs are composed of counties and county equivalents.Census Geographic Glossary, U.S. Census Bureau The counties containing the core urban area are known as the central counties of the CBSA. A central county is a county in which 50% of its population lives in urban areas of at least 10,000 in population, or where a population of 5,000 are located in a single urban area of at least 10,000 in population where that urban area is split between more than one county. Additional surrounding counties, known as outlying counties, can be included in the CBSA if these counties have strong social and economic ties to the central counties as measured by commuting and employment. Outlying counties are included in the CBSA if 25% of the workers living in the county work in the central county or counties or, conversely, 25% of the employment in the county is held by workers who live in the central county or counties. All counties in a CBSA must be contiguous, and a county can only be included within one CBSA. In New England, towns have precedence over counties, so statistically similar areas are defined in terms of town-based units known as New England city and town areas (NECTAs). Adjacent CBSAs are merged into a single CBSA when the central county or counties of one CBSA qualify as an outlying county or counties to the other CBSAs. One or more CBSAs may be grouped together or combined to form a larger statistical entity known as a combined statistical area (CSA) when the employment interchange measure (EIM) reaches 15% or more. As well as MSAs, CBSAs are also subdivided into micropolitan statistical areas (ŒºSAs) for CBSAs built around an urban cluster of at least 10,000 in population but less than 50,000 in population. Previous terms that are no longer used include standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) and primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA).

This definition requires a notion of \\"proof\\". defines the notion this way: \\"The class of provable formulas is defined to be the smallest class of formulas that contains the axioms and is closed under the relation \\"immediate consequence\\", i.e., formula c of a and b is defined as an immediate consequence in terms of modus ponens or substitution; cf , . Tarski defines \\"proof\\" informally as \\"statements follow one another in a definite order according to certain principles ‚Ä¶ and accompanied by considerations intended to establish their validity [true conclusion for all true premises ‚Äì ]\\" cf . defines the notion with respect to either an induction or as to paraphrase) a finite sequence of formulas such that each formula in the sequence is either an axiom or an \\"immediate consequence\\" of the preceding formulas; \\"A proof is said to be a proof of its last formula, and this formula is said to be (formally) provable or be a (formal) theorem\\" cf . The lack of contradiction can be defined in either semantic or syntactic terms. The semantic definition states that a theory is consistent if it has a model, i.e., there exists an interpretation under which all formulas in the theory are true. This is the sense used in traditional Aristotelian logic, although in contemporary mathematical logic the term satisfiable is used instead. The syntactic definition states a theory T is consistent if there is no formula \\\\varphi such that both \\\\varphi and its negation \\\\lnot\\\\varphi are elements of the set of consequences of T. Let A be a set of closed sentences (informally \\"axioms\\") and \\\\langle A\\\\rangle the set of closed sentences provable from A under some (specified, possibly implicitly) formal deductive system. The set of axioms A is consistent when \\\\varphi, \\\\lnot \\\\varphi \\\\in \\\\langle A \\\\rangle for no formula \\\\varphi. (Please note definition of Mod(T) on p. 30 ...) If there exists a deductive system for which these semantic and syntactic definitions are equivalent for any theory formulated in a particular deductive logic, the logic is called complete. The completeness of the sentential calculus was proved by Paul Bernays in 1918 states that Bernays determined the independence of the axioms of Principia Mathematica, a result not published until 1926, but he says nothing about Bernays proving their consistency. and Emil Post in 1921,Post proves both consistency and completeness of the propositional calculus of PM, cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Post's 1931 Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions in . Also . while the completeness of predicate calculus was proved by Kurt G√∂del in 1930,cf van Heijenoort's commentary and G√∂del's 1930 The completeness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic in . and consistency proofs for arithmetics restricted with respect to the induction axiom schema were proved by Ackermann (1924), von Neumann (1927) and Herbrand (1931).cf van Heijenoort's commentary and Herbrand's 1930 On the consistency of arithmetic in . Stronger logics, such as second-order logic, are not complete. A consistency proof is a mathematical proof that a particular theory is consistent.Informally, Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory is ordinarily assumed; some dialects of informal mathematics customarily assume the axiom of choice in addition. The early development of mathematical proof theory was driven by the desire to provide finitary consistency proofs for all of mathematics as part of Hilbert's program. Hilbert's program was strongly impacted by the incompleteness theorems, which showed that sufficiently strong proof theories cannot prove their own consistency (provided that they are in fact consistent). Although consistency can be proved by means of model theory, it is often done in a purely syntactical way, without any need to reference some model of the logic. The cut-elimination (or equivalently the normalization of the underlying calculus if there is one) implies the consistency of the calculus: since there is no cut-free proof of falsity, there is no contradiction in general. Consistency and completeness in arithmetic and set theory In theories of arithmetic, such as Peano arithmetic, there is an intricate relationship between the consistency of the theory and its completeness. A theory is complete if, for every formula œÜ in its language, at least one of œÜ or ¬¨œÜ is a logical consequence of the theory. Presburger arithmetic is an axiom system for the natural numbers under addition. It is both consistent and complete. G√∂del's incompleteness theorems show that any sufficiently strong recursively enumerable theory of arithmetic cannot be both complete and consistent. G√∂del's theorem applies to the theories of Peano arithmetic (PA) and primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA), but not to Presburger arithmetic. Moreover, G√∂del's second incompleteness theorem shows that the consistency of sufficiently strong recursively enumerable theories of arithmetic can be tested in a particular way. Such a theory is consistent if and only if it does not prove a particular sentence, called the G√∂del sentence of the theory, which is a formalized statement of the claim that the theory is indeed consistent. Thus the consistency of a sufficiently strong, recursively enumerable, consistent theory of arithmetic can never be proven in that system itself. The same result is true for recursively enumerable theories that can describe a strong enough fragment of arithmeticincluding set theories such as Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory (ZF). These set theories cannot prove their own G√∂del sentence‚Äîprovided that they are consistent, which is generally believed. Because consistency of ZF is not provable in ZF, the weaker notion ' is interesting in set theory (and in other sufficiently expressive axiomatic systems). If T is a theory and A is an additional axiom, T + A is said to be consistent relative to T (or simply that A is consistent with T) if it can be proved that if T is consistent then T + A is consistent. If both A and ¬¨A are consistent with T, then A is said to be independent of T.  First-order logic  =Notation= \\\\vdash (Turnstile symbol) in the following context of mathematical logic, means \\"provable from\\". That is, a\\\\vdash b reads: b is provable from a (in some specified formal system). See List of logic symbols. In other cases, the turnstile symbol may mean implies; permits the derivation of.

First, that \\\\sim is in fact an equivalence relation. Then, it needs to be verified that (1), (2), and (3) are well defined. This falls out of the fact that \\\\sim is an equivalence relation and also requires a proof that (1) and (2) are independent of the choice of t_0, \\\\ldots ,t_{n-1} class representatives.

It was located on the northeast bank of the James (Powhatan) River about southwest of the center of modern Williamsburg. It was established by the Virginia Company of London as \\"James Fort\\" on May 4, 1607 O.S. (May 14, 1607 N.S.), and was considered permanent after a brief abandonment in 1610. It followed several failed attempts, including the Lost Colony of Roanoke, established in 1585 on Roanoke Island. Jamestown served as the colonial capital from 1616 until 1699. Colonial Jamestown About 1614 The settlement was located within the country of Tsenacommacah, which belonged to the Powhatan Confederacy, and specifically in that of the Paspahegh tribe. The natives initially welcomed and provided crucial provisions and support for the colonists, who were not agriculturally inclined. Relations quickly soured, and the colonists would annihilate the Paspahegh in warfare within four years.

In August 1619, the first recorded slaves from Africa to British North America arrived in what is now Old Point Comfort near the Jamestown colony, on a British privateer ship flying a Dutch flag. The approximately 20 Africans from the present-day Angola had been removed by the British crew from a Portuguese slave ship, the \\"S√£o Jo√£o Bautista\\".https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and- history/magazine/2019/07-08/virginia-first-africans-transatlantic-slave-trade/ , 400 years ago, enslaved Africans first arrived in Virginiahttps://time.com/5653369/august-1619-jamestown-history/ , The First Africans in Virginia Landed in 1619. It Was a Turning Point for Slavery in American History ‚Äì But Not the Beginning They most likely worked in the tobacco fields as slaves under a system of race-based indentured servitude. The modern conception of slavery in the colonial United States was formalized in 1640 (the John Punch hearing) and was fully entrenched in Virginia by 1660. The London Company's second settlement in Bermuda claims to be the site of the oldest town in the English New World, as St. George's, Bermuda was officially established in 1612 as New London, whereas James Fort in Virginia was not converted into James Towne until 1619, and further did not survive to the present day.The Royal Gazette, World Heritage (Town of St. George's and related fortifications) Supplement, February 22, 2001. In 1676, Jamestown was deliberately burned during Bacon's Rebellion, though it was quickly rebuilt. In 1699, the colonial capital was moved to what is today Williamsburg, Virginia; Jamestown ceased to exist as a settlement, and remains today only as an archaeological site. Today, Jamestown is one of three locations composing the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia, along with Williamsburg and Yorktown, with two primary heritage sites. is the archaeological site on Jamestown Island and is a cooperative effort by Jamestown National Historic Site (part of Colonial National Historical Park) and Preservation Virginia. Jamestown Settlement, a living history interpretive site, is operated by the Jamestown Yorktown Foundation, a state agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Settlement Spain, Portugal, and France moved quickly to establish a presence in the New World, while other European countries moved more slowly. The English did not attempt to found colonies until many decades after the explorations of John Cabot, and early efforts were failures‚Äîmost notably the Roanoke Colony which vanished about 1590. =1607‚Äì1609: Arrival and beginning= Map of Jamestown Island, showing the terrain and location of the original 1607 fort. (Modern roads, causeway, and buildings not shown) Late in 1606, English colonists set sail with a charter from the London Company to establish a colony in the New World. The fleet consisted of the ships Susan Constant, Discovery, and Godspeed, all under the leadership of Captain Christopher Newport. They made a particularly long voyage of four months, including a stop in the Canary Islands, in Spain, and subsequently Puerto Rico, and finally departed for the American mainland on April 10, 1607. The expedition made landfall on April 26, 1607 at a place which they named Cape Henry. Under orders to select a more secure location, they set about exploring what is now Hampton Roads and an outlet to the Chesapeake Bay which they named the James River in honor of King James I of England. Captain Edward Maria Wingfield was elected president of the governing council on April 25, 1607. On May 14, he selected a piece of land on a large peninsula some inland from the Atlantic Ocean as a prime location for a fortified settlement. The river channel was a defensible strategic point due to a curve in the river, and it was close to the land, making it navigable and offering enough land for piers or wharves to be built in the future. Perhaps the most favorable fact about the location was that it was uninhabited because the leaders of the nearby indigenous nations considered the site too poor and remote for agriculture. The island was swampy and isolated, and it offered limited space, was plagued by mosquitoes, and afforded only brackish tidal river water unsuitable for drinking. The Jamestown settlers arrived in Virginia during a severe drought, according to a research study conducted by the Jamestown Archaeological Assessment (JAA) team in the 1990s. The JAA analyzed information from a study conducted in 1985 by David Stahle and others, who obtained drawings of 800 year-old bald cypress trees along the Nottoway and Blackwater rivers. The lifespan of these trees is up to 1,000 years and their rings offer a good indication of an area's annual amount of rainfall. The borings revealed that the worst drought in 700 years occurred between 1606 and 1612. This severe drought affected the Jamestown colonists and Powhatan tribe's ability to produce food and obtain a safe supply of water.Blanton, Dennis B. \\"Drought as a Factor in the Jamestown Colony, 1607‚Äì1612.\\" Historical Archaeology 34, no. 4 (2000): 74‚Äì81. https://www.jstor.org/stable/25616853 . Salt marshes along Jamestown Island. The ample wetlands on the island proved to be a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The settlers also arrived too late in the year to get crops planted.Don't Know Much About History, Kenneth C. Davis Many in the group were either gentlemen unused to work or their manservants, both equally unaccustomed to the hard labor demanded by the harsh task of carving out a viable colony. One of these was Robert Hunt, a former vicar of Reculver, England who celebrated the first known Anglican Eucharist in the territory of the future United States on June 21, 1607. In a few months, 80% of the party were dead; some of the survivors were deserting to the Indians whose land they had colonized. Virginia Native Americans had established settlements long before the English settlers arrived, and there were an estimated 14,000 in the region who were politically known as Tsenacommacah and who spoke an Algonquian language. They were the Powhatan Confederacy, ruled by their paramount chief known as Wahunsenacawh or \\"Chief Powhatan\\". Wahunsenacawh initially sought to resettle the English colonists from Jamestown, considered part of Paspahegh territory, to another location known as Capahosick where they would make metal tools for him as members of his Confederacy, but this never happened. Jamestown settler dead in the swamp The first explorers had been welcomed by the Indians with dancing, feasting, and tobacco ceremonies.George Percy, 1608, \\"Observations by George Percy\\" Despite the hospitality of Wahunsenacawh, the presence of the English settlers and perhaps a further expedition up the James River by Captain Christopher Newport provoked the Paspahegh, Weyanock, and other groups to mount a series of attacks on the fort during a period of violence lasting from May 27 to July 14, 1607. Pedro de Z√∫√±iga, depicting the fort in about 1608 Two-thirds of the settlers died before ships arrived in 1608 with supplies and German and Polish craftsmen, who helped to establish the first manufactories in the colony. As a result, glassware became the foremost American products to be exported to Europe at the time. Clapboard had already been sent back to England beginning with the first returning ship. Names of those on the Second Supply ‚Äì Page 445 (or Page 72)\\"The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles\\", by Capt. John Smith ‚Äì The delivery of supplies in 1608 on the First and Second Supply missions of Captain Newport had also added to the number of hungry settlers. It seemed certain at that time that the colony at Jamestown would meet the same fate as earlier English attempts to settle in North America, specifically the Roanoke Colony (Lost Colony) and the Popham Colony, unless there was a major relief effort. The Germans who arrived with the Second Supply and a few others defected to the Powhatans, with weapons and equipment. The Germans even planned to join a rumored Spanish attack on the colony and urged the Powhatans to join it.Horn, 2006, pp. 129‚Äì130. The Spanish were driven off by the timely arrival in July 1609 of Captain Samuel Argall in Mary and John, a larger ship than the Spanish reconnaissance ship La Asunci√≥n de Cristo.Horn, 2006, p.154‚Äì156. Argall's voyage also prevented the Spanish from gaining knowledge of the weakness of the colony. Don Pedro de Z√∫√±iga, the Spanish ambassador to England, was desperately seeking this (in addition to spies) in order to get Philip III of Spain to authorise an attack on the colony. The investors of the Virginia Company of London expected to reap rewards from their speculative investments. With the Second Supply, they expressed their frustrations and made demands upon the leaders of Jamestown in written form. They specifically demanded that the colonists send commodities sufficient to pay the cost of the voyage, a lump of gold, assurance that they had found the South Sea, and one member of the lost Roanoke Colony. It fell to the third president of the Council Captain John Smith to deliver a bold and much-needed wake-up call in response to the investors in London, demanding practical laborers and craftsmen who could help make the colony more self-sufficient.Horn, 2006, pp. 128‚Äì129. =1609‚Äì1610: Starving Time and Third Supply= After Smith was forced to return to England due to an explosion which gave him deep burn wounds during a trading expedition,John Marshall p. 44 the colony was led by George Percy, who proved incompetent in negotiating with the native tribes. There are indications that those in London comprehended and embraced Smith's message. The Third Supply mission of 1609 was to be by far the largest and best equipped. They also had a new purpose-built flagship, Sea Venture, constructed, and placed in the most experienced of hands, Christopher Newport. Mass grave at Jamestown discovered by archaeologists, beneath the foundations of one of the later capitol buildings On June 2, 1609, Sea Venture set sail from Plymouth as the flagship of a seven-ship fleet (towing two additional pinnaces) destined for Jamestown, Virginia as part of the Third Supply, carrying 214 settlers. On July 24, the fleet ran into a strong storm, likely a hurricane, and the ships were separated. Although some of the ships did make it to Jamestown, the leaders, and most of the supplies had been aboard Sea Venture, which fought the storm for three days before Admiral of the Company, Sir George Somers, deliberately drove it onto the reefs of Bermuda to prevent its foundering. This allowed all aboard to be landed safely.Horn, James (2006). A Land as God Made It: Jamestown and the Birth of America, pp. 158‚Äì60. New York: Basic Books. . The survivors (including Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Gates, Captain Christopher Newport, Sylvester Jordain, Stephen Hopkins, later of Mayflower, and secretary William Strachey) were stranded on Bermuda for approximately nine months. During that time, they built two new ships, the pinnaces Deliverance and Patience. The original plan was to build only one vessel, Deliverance, but it soon became evident that it would not be large enough to carry the settlers and all of the food (salted pork) that was being sourced on the islands.Evans, Cerinda W. (1957). Some Notes On Shipbuilding and Shipping in Colonial Virginia. Williamsburg, Virginia 350th Anniversary Celebration Corp. p. 7. While the Third Supply was stranded in Bermuda, the colony at Jamestown was in even worse shape. In the \\"Starving Time\\" of 1609‚Äì1610, the Jamestown settlers faced rampant starvation for want of additional provisions. During this time, lack of food drove people to eat snakes and even boil the leather from shoes for sustenance. Only 60 of the original 214 settlers at Jamestown survived. There is scientific evidence that the settlers at Jamestown had turned to cannibalism during the starving time. The ships from Bermuda arrived in Jamestown on May 23, 1610.Vaughan (1991), p. 41.Evans, Cerinda W. (1957). Some Notes On Shipbuilding and Shipping in COlonial Virginia. Williamsburg, Virginia 350th Anniversary Celebration Corp. p. 5.Vaughan, Alden T., and Vaughan, Virginia Mason (1991). Shakespeare's Caliban: A Cultural History, pp. 38‚Äì40. Cambridge University Press. . Many of the surviving colonists were near death, and Jamestown was judged to be unviable. Everyone was boarded onto Deliverance and Patience, which set sail for England. However, on June 10, 1610, the timely arrival of another relief fleet, bearing Governor Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (who would eventually give his name to the colony of Delaware), which met the two ships as they descended the James River, granted Jamestown a reprieve. The Colonists called this The Day of Providence. The fleet brought not only supplies, but also additional settlers.Woodward, Hobson. A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest. Viking (2009). All the settlers returned to the colony, though there was still a critical shortage of food. Relations between the colonists and the Powhatans quickly deteriorated after De La Warr's arrival, eventually leading to conflict. The Anglo-Powhatan War lasted until Samuel Argall captured Wahunsenacawh's daughter Matoaka, better known by her nickname Pocahontas, after which the chief accepted a treaty of peace. =1610‚Äì1624: Rising fortunes= Due to the aristocratic backgrounds of many of the new colonists, a historic drought and the communal nature of their work load, progress through the first few years was inconsistent at best. By 1613, six years after Jamestown's founding, the organizers and shareholders of the Virginia Company were desperate to increase the efficiency and profitability of the struggling colony. Without stockholder consent the Governor, Sir Thomas Dale, assigned plots to its \\"ancient planters\\" and smaller plots to the settlement's later arrivals. Measurable economic progress was made, and the settlers began expanding their planting to land belonging to local native tribes. That this turnaround coincided with the end of a drought that had begun the year before the English settlers' arrival probably indicates multiple factors were involved besides the colonists' ineptitude.\\"The lost colony and Jamestown droughts.\\" , Stahle, D. W., M. K. Cleaveland, D. B. Blanton, M. D. Therrell, and D. A. Gay. 1998. Science 280:564‚Äì567. Among the colonists who survived the Third Supply was John Rolfe, who carried with him a cache of untested new tobacco seeds from Bermuda, which had grown wild there after being planted by shipwrecked Spaniards years before. In 1614, Rolfe began to successfully harvest tobacco.John Marshall p.52 Prosperous and wealthy, he married Pocahontas, daughter of Chief Powhatan, bringing several years of peace between the English and natives. However, at the end of a public relations trip to England, Pocahontas became sick and died on March 21, 1617. The following year, her father also died. Powhatan's brother, a fierce warrior named Opchanacanough, became head of the Powhatan Confederacy. As the English continued to appropriate more land for tobacco farming, relations with the natives worsened. Due to the high cost of the trans-Atlantic voyage at this time, many English settlers came to Jamestown as indentured servants: in exchange for the passage, room, board, and the promise of land or money, these immigrants would agree to work for three to seven years. Immigrants from continental Europe, mainly Germans, were usually redemptioners‚Äîthey purchased some portion of their voyage on credit and, upon arrival, borrowed or entered into a work contract to pay the remainder of their voyage costs.Gary Walton; History of the American Economy; p. 32 Of the first documented African slaves to arrive in English North America, on the frigate White Lion in 1619, were an African man and woman, later named Antoney and Isabella. Their baby, named William Tucker, would become the first documented African child baptized in British North America. Listed in the 1624 census in Virginia, they became the first African family recorded in Jamestown.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/08/24/slaverys- bitter-roots-in-1619-20-and-odd-negroes-arrived-in-virginia/ , \\"Slavery‚Äôs bitter roots: In 1619, '20 And odd Negroes' arrived in Virginia\\" In 1619, the first representative assembly in America, the General Assembly, convened in the Jamestown Church, \\"to establish one equal and uniform government over all Virginia\\" which would provide \\"just laws for the happy guiding and governing of the people there inhabiting,\\" Initially, only men of English origin were permitted to vote. On June 30, 1619, in what was the first recorded strike in Colonial America, the Polish artisans protested and refused to work if not allowed to vote (\\"No Vote, No Work\\"). On July 21, 1619, the court granted the Poles equal voting rights. Afterwards, the labor strike (the first \\"in [North] American history\\") was ended and the artisans resumed their work. Individual land ownership was also instituted, and the colony was divided into four large \\"boroughs\\" or \\"incorporations\\" called \\"citties\\" by the colonists. Jamestown was located in James Cittie. After several years of strained coexistence, Chief Opchanacanough and his Powhatan Confederacy attempted to eliminate the English colony once and for all. On the morning of March 22, 1622, they attacked outlying plantations and communities up and down the James River in what became known as the Indian Massacre of 1622. More than 300 settlers were killed in the attack, about a third of the colony's English-speaking population. Sir Thomas Dale's development at Henricus, which was to feature a college to educate the natives, and Wolstenholme Towne at Martin's Hundred, were both essentially wiped out. Jamestown was spared only through a timely warning by a Virginia Indian employee. There was not enough time to spread the word to the outposts. Of the 6,000 people who came to the settlement between 1608 and 1624, only 3,400 survived. =1624‚Äì1699: Later years= In 1624, King James revoked the Virginia Company's charter, and Virginia became a royal colony. Despite the setbacks, the colony continued to grow. Ten years later, in 1634, by order of King Charles I, the colony was divided into the original eight shires of Virginia (or counties), in a fashion similar to that practiced in England. Jamestown was now located in James City Shire, soon renamed the \\"County of James City\\", better known in modern times as James City County, Virginia, the nation's oldest county. Another large-scale \\"Indian attack\\" occurred in 1644. In 1646, Opchanacanough was captured and while in custody an English guard shot him in the back‚Äîagainst orders‚Äîand killed him. Subsequently, the Powhatan Confederacy began to decline. Opechancanough's successor signed the first peace treaties between the Powhatan Indians and the English. The treaties required the Powhatan to pay yearly tribute payment to the English and confined them to reservations. A generation later, during Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, Jamestown was burned, eventually to be rebuilt. During its recovery, the Virginia legislature met first at Governor William Berkeley's nearby Green Spring Plantation, and later at Middle Plantation, which had been started in 1632 as a fortified community inland on the Virginia Peninsula, about distant. When the statehouse burned again in 1698, this time accidentally, the legislature again temporarily relocated to Middle Plantation, and was able to meet in the new facilities of the College of William and Mary, which had been established after receiving a royal charter in 1693. Rather than rebuilding at Jamestown again, the capital of the colony was moved permanently to Middle Plantation in 1699. The town was soon renamed Williamsburg, to honor the reigning monarch, King William III. A new Capitol building and \\"Governor's Palace\\" were erected there in the following years. This was a dramatic change that spelled the decline and doomed the town. Aftermath and preservation 1854 image of the ruins of Jamestown showing the tower of the old Jamestown Church built in the 17th century Due to the movement of the capital to Williamsburg, the old town of Jamestown began to slowly disappear from view. Those who lived in the general area attended services at Jamestown's church until the 1750s, when it was abandoned. By the mid-18th century, the land was heavily cultivated, primarily by the Travis and Ambler families. During the American Revolutionary War, although the Battle of Green Spring was fought nearby at the site of former Governor Berkeley's plantation, Jamestown was apparently inconsequential. In 1831, David Bullock purchased Jamestown from the Travis and Ambler families. =American Civil War= During the American Civil War, in 1861, Confederate William Allen, who owned the Jamestown Island, occupied Jamestown with troops he raised at his own expense with the intention of blockading the James River and Richmond from the Union Navy. He was soon joined by Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones, who directed the building of batteries and conducted ordnance and armor tests for the first Confederate ironclad warship, CSS Virginia, which was under construction at the Gosport Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth in late 1861 and early 1862. Jamestown had a peak force of 1,200 men. During the Peninsula Campaign, which began later that spring, Union forces under General George B. McClellan moved up the Peninsula from Fort Monroe in an attempt to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. The Union forces captured Yorktown in April 1862, and the Battle of Williamsburg was fought the following month. With these developments, Jamestown and the lower James River were abandoned by the Confederates. Some of the forces from Jamestown, and the crew of Virginia, relocated to Drewry's Bluff, a fortified and strategic position high above the river about below Richmond. There, they successfully blocked the Union Navy from reaching the Confederate capital. Once in Federal hands, Jamestown became a meeting place for runaway slaves, who burned the Ambler house, an eighteenth-century plantation house, which along with the old church was one of the few remaining signs of old Jamestown. When Allen sent men to assess the damage in late 1862, they were killed by the former slaves. Following the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, the oath of allegiance was administered to former Confederate soldiers at Jamestown. =Preservation and early archaeology= Ruins of Jamestown Church at the turn of the 20th century, prior to the Tercentennial in 1907 In the years after the Civil War, Jamestown became quiet and peaceful once again. In 1892, Jamestown was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. Edward Barney. The following year, the Barneys donated 22¬Ω acres of land, including the ruined church tower, to the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (now known as Preservation Virginia). By this time, erosion from the river had eaten away the island's western shore. Visitors began to conclude that the site of James Fort lay completely underwater. With federal assistance, a sea wall was constructed in 1900 to protect the area from further erosion. The archaeological remains of the original 1607 fort, which had been protected by the sea wall, were not discovered until 1996. In 1932, George Craghead Gregory of Richmond was credited with discovering the foundation of the first brick statehouse (capitol) building, circa 1646, at Jamestown on the land owned by Preservation Virginia. Around 1936, Gregory, who was active with the Virginia Historical Society, founded the Jamestowne Society for descendants of stockholders in the Virginia Company of London and the descendants of those who owned land or who had domiciles in Jamestown or on Jamestown Island prior to 1700. Colonial National Monument was authorized by the U.S. Congress on July 3, 1930 and established on December 30, 1930. In 1934, the National Park Service obtained the remaining portion of Jamestown Island which had been under private ownership by the Vermillion family. The National Park Service partnered with Preservation Virginia to preserve the area and present it to visitors in an educational manner. On June 5, 1936, the national monument was re-designated a national historical park, and became known as Colonial National Historical Park. From 1936 J.C. \\"Pinky\\" Harrington worked on the NPS's excavations at Jamestown. In 1954 John L. Cotter took charge of field projects at Jamestown, conducted with the site's 350th anniversary (1957) in mind. Cotter worked with Edward B. Jelks and Harrington to survey the area's colonial sites. In 1957 Cotter and J. Paul Hudson co-authored New Discoveries at Jamestown. Cotter contributed, along with Jelks, Georg Neumann, and Johnny Hack, to the 1958 report Archaeological Excavations at Jamestown. Present day In the present time, as part of the Colonial National Historical Park, the Jamestown Island area is home to two heritage tourism sites related to the original fort and town. Nearby, the Jamestown-Scotland Ferry service provides a link across the navigable portion of the James River for vehicles and affords passengers a view of Jamestown Island from the river.  , located at the original site of Jamestown, is administered by Preservation Virginia and the National Park Service. The central 22¬Ω acres of land, where the archaeological remains of the original James Fort were found, are owned by Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities); the remaining are held by the National Park Service and is part of the Colonial National Historical Park. The site gained renewed importance when in 1996 the Jamestown Rediscovery project began excavations in search of the original James Fort site, originally in preparation for the quadricentennial of Jamestown's founding. The primary goal of the archaeological campaign was to locate archaeological remains of \\"the first years of settlement at Jamestown, especially of the earliest fortified town; [and the] subsequent growth and development of the town\\". Today, visitors to can view the site of the original 1607 James Fort, the 17th-century church tower and the site of the 17th-century town, as well as tour an archaeological museum called the Archaearium and view many of the close to two million artifacts found by Jamestown Rediscovery. They also may participate in living history ranger tours and Archaeological tours given by the Jamestown Rediscovery staff. Visitors can also often observe archaeologists from the Jamestown Rediscovery Project at work, as archaeological work at the site continues. , the archaeological work and studies are ongoing. In addition to their newsletter and website, new discoveries are frequently reported in the local newspaper, the Virginia Gazette based in nearby Williamsburg, and by other news media, often worldwide. =Jamestown Settlement= Jamestown Settlement is a living-history park and museum located from the original location of the colony and adjacent to Jamestown Island. Initially created for the celebration of the 350th anniversary in 1957, Jamestown Settlement is operated by the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, and largely sponsored by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The museum complex features a reconstruction of a Powhatan village, the James Fort as it was ‚Äì1614, and seagoing replicas of the three ships that brought the first settlers, Susan Constant, Godspeed, Discovery. Commemorations With the national independence of the United States established by the end of the 18th century, Jamestown came to be looked at as a starting point. Its founding in 1607 has been regularly commemorated, with the most notable events being held every fifty years. =200th anniversary (1807)= The bicentennial of Jamestown on May 13‚Äì14, 1807, was called the Grand National Jubilee. Over 3,000 people attended the event, many arriving on vessels which anchored in the river off the island. May 13 was the opening day of the festival, which began with a procession which marched to the graveyard of the old church, where the attending bishop delivered the prayer. The procession then moved to the Travis mansion, where the celebrants dined and danced in the mansion that evening. Also during the festivities, students of the College of William and Mary gave orations. An old barn on the island was used as a temporary theater, where a company of players from Norfolk performed. Attending were many dignitaries, politicians, and historians. The celebration concluded on May 14 with a dinner and toast at the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg. =250th anniversary (1857)= In 1857, the Jamestown society organized a celebration marking the 250th anniversary of Jamestown's founding. According to the Richmond Enquirer, the site for the celebration was on on the spot where some of the colonists' houses were originally built. However, it is also speculated that the celebration was moved further east on the island closer to the Travis grave site, in order to avoid damaging Major William Allen's corn fields. The attendance was estimated at between 6,000 and 8,000 people. Sixteen large steam ships anchored offshore in the James River and were gaily decorated with streamers. Former US President John Tyler of nearby Sherwood Forest Plantation gave a 2¬Ω hour speech, and there were military displays, a grand ball and fireworks. =300th anniversary (1907): Jamestown Exposition= The Jamestown Tercentenary Monument, erected on Jamestown Island in 1907. It stands tall. The 100th anniversary of the Surrender at Yorktown in 1781 had generated a new interest in the historical significance of the colonial sites of the Peninsula. Williamsburg, a sleepy but populated town of shops and homes, was still celebrating Civil War events. However, as the new century dawned, thoughts turned to the upcoming 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (now known as Preservation Virginia) started the movement in 1900 by calling for a celebration honoring the establishment of the first permanent English colony in the New World at Jamestown to be held on the 300th anniversary in 1907. As a celebration was planned, virtually no one thought that the actual isolated and long-abandoned original site of Jamestown would be suitable for a major event because Jamestown Island had no facilities for large crowds. The original fort housing the Jamestown settlers was believed to have been long ago swallowed by the James River. The general area in James City County near Jamestown was also considered unsuitable, as it was not very accessible in the day of rail travel before automobiles were common. As the tricentennial of the 1607 Founding of the Jamestown neared, around 1904, despite an assumption in some quarters that Richmond would be a logical location, leaders in Norfolk began a campaign to have a celebration held there. The decision was made to locate the international exposition on a mile-long frontage at Sewell's Point near the mouth of Hampton Roads. This was about downstream from Jamestown in a rural section of Norfolk County. It was a site which could become accessible by both long-distance passenger railroads and local streetcar service, with considerable frontage on the harbor of Hampton Roads. This latter feature proved ideal for the naval delegations which came from points all around the world. The Jamestown Exposition of 1907 was one of the many world's fairs and expositions that were popular in the early part of the 20th century. Held from April 26, 1907 to December 1, 1907, attendees included US President Theodore Roosevelt, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, the Prince of Sweden, Mark Twain, Henry H. Rogers, and dozens of other dignitaries and famous persons. A major naval review featuring the United States' Great White Fleet was a key feature. U.S. Military officials and leaders were impressed by the location, and the Exposition site later formed the first portion of the large U.S. Naval Station Norfolk in 1918 during World War I. Jamestown commemorative stamps, issue of 1907 The U.S. Post Office issued a set of stamps, on the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown colony. =350th Anniversary (1957): Jamestown Festival= Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and her consort Prince Philip inspect the replica of Susan Constant at Jamestown Festival Park in Virginia on October 16, 1957 With America's increased access to automobiles, and with improved roads and transportation, it was feasible for the 350th anniversary celebration to be held at Jamestown itself in 1957. Although erosion had cut off the land bridge between Jamestown Island and the mainland, the isthmus was restored and new access provided by the completion of the National Park Service's Colonial Parkway which led to Williamsburg and Yorktown, the other two portions of Colonial Virginia's Historic Triangle. There were also improvements of state highways. The north landing for the popular Jamestown Ferry and a portion of State Route 31 were relocated. Major projects such were developed by non-profit, state and federal agencies. Jamestown Festival Park was established by the Commonwealth of Virginia adjacent to the entrance to Jamestown Island. Full-sized replicas of the three ships that brought the colonists, Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery were constructed at a shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia and placed on display at a new dock at Jamestown, where the largest, Susan Constant, could be boarded by visitors. On Jamestown Island, the reconstructed Jamestown Glasshouse, the Memorial Cross and the visitors center were completed and dedicated. A loop road was built around the island. Special events included army and navy reviews, air force fly-overs, ship and aircraft christenings and even an outdoor drama at Cape Henry, site of the first landing of the settlers. This celebration continued from April 1 to November 30 with over a million participants, including dignitaries and politicians such as the British Ambassador and U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon. The highlight for many of the nearly 25,000 at the Festival Park on October 16, 1957 was the visit and speech of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and her consort, Prince Philip. Queen Elizabeth II loaned a copy of the Magna Carta for the exhibition. It was her first visit to the United States since assuming the throne. The 1957 Jamestown Festival was so successful that tourists still kept coming long after the official event was completed. Jamestown became a permanent attraction of the Historic Triangle, and has been visited by families, school groups, tours, and thousands of other people continuously ever since. =400th anniversary: Jamestown 2007= Early in the 21st century, new accommodations, transportation facilities and attractions were planned in preparation for the quadricentennial of the founding of Jamestown. Numerous events were promoted under the banner of America's 400th Anniversary and promoted by the Jamestown 2007 Commission. The commemoration included 18 months of statewide, national and international festivities and events, which began in April 2006 with a tour of the new replica Godspeed. In January 2007, the Virginia General Assembly held a session at Jamestown. On May 4, 2007, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Prince Philip attended a ceremony commemorating the 400th anniversary of the settlement's arrivals, reprising the honor they paid in 1957. In addition to the Virginia State Quarter, Jamestown was also the subject of two United States commemorative coins celebrating the 400th anniversary of its settlement. A silver dollar and a gold five dollar coin were issued in 2007. = 2019 Commemoration = In 2019 Jamestown, in cooperation with Williamsburg, will hold a commemoration that marks the 400th anniversary of three landmark events in American history: the first meeting of the General Assembly, the arrival of the first Africans to English North America, and the first Thanksgiving. In popular culture * A fictional romantic adventure set at Jamestown, To Have and to Hold, was the bestselling novel in the United States in 1900. The novel was later adapted into two feature films, in 1916 and 1922. * A highly fictionalized version of the Jamestown settlement is depicted in the animated Disney film Pocahontas (1995) as well as its direct-to-video sequel Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World (1998). Among other inaccuracies it is shown as being near mountains, when it was actually located on the Tidewater region. * A feature-length film, The New World (2005), directed by Terrence Malick, covers the story of Jamestown's colonization. Although the historical details are accurate in most ways, the plot focuses on a dramatized relationship between John Smith, played by Colin Farrell, and Pocahontas, played by Q'orianka Kilcher. It also features John Rolfe, played by Christian Bale. Many scenes were filmed on-location along the James and Chickahominy Rivers and at Henricus Historical Park in Chesterfield County, Virginia. * Another feature-length film, First Landing: The Voyage from England to Jamestown (2007), documents the 1607 landing of English colonists. * In 2017, Sky 1 launched a new series based in Jamestown. The series, named after its eponymous setting, revolves around the societal change triggered by the arrival of women to the settlement to marry the male citizens of the area, and is made by the producers of Downton Abbey. * The story of Bartholomew Gosnold and the establishment of Jamestown is told in the 2018 musical To Look For America written by Richard Digance and Eric Sedge. * In alternate history TV show For All Mankind, United States has its first moon base named Jamestown.

In traditional logic, a contradiction consists of a logical incompatibility or incongruity between two or more propositions. It occurs when the propositions, taken together, yield two conclusions which form the logical, usually opposite inversions of each other. Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, Aristotle's law of noncontradiction states that \\"It is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect.\\" In modern formal logic, the term is mainly used instead for a single proposition, often denoted by the falsum symbol \\\\bot; a proposition is a contradiction if false can be derived from it, using the rules of the logic. It is a proposition that is unconditionally false (i.e., a self-contradictory proposition). This can be generalized to a collection of propositions, which is then said to \\"contain\\" a contradiction. History By creation of a paradox, Plato's Euthydemus dialogue demonstrates the need for the notion of contradiction. In the ensuing dialogue, Dionysodorus denies the existence of \\"contradiction\\", all the while that Socrates is contradicting him: Indeed, Dionysodorus agrees that \\"there is no such thing as false opinion ... there is no such thing as ignorance\\", and demands of Socrates to \\"Refute me.\\" Socrates responds \\"But how can I refute you, if, as you say, to tell a falsehood is impossible?\\".Dialog Euthydemus from The Dialogs of Plato translated by Benjamin Jowett appearing in: BK 7 Plato: Robert Maynard Hutchins, editor in chief, 1952, Great Books of the Western World, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., Chicago.  In formal logic  In classical logic, particularly in propositional and first-order logic, a proposition \\\\varphi is a contradiction if and only if \\\\varphi\\\\vdash\\\\bot. Since for contradictory \\\\varphi it is true that \\\\vdash\\\\varphi\\\\rightarrow\\\\psi for all \\\\psi (because \\\\bot\\\\rightarrow\\\\psi), one may prove any proposition from a set of axioms which contains contradictions. This is called the \\"principle of explosion\\", or \\"ex falso quodlibet\\" (\\"from falsity, anything follows\\"). In a complete logic, a formula is contradictory if and only if it is unsatisfiable. =Proof by contradiction= For a set of premises \\\\Sigma and a proposition \\\\varphi, it is true that \\\\Sigma \\\\vdash\\\\varphi (i.e., \\\\Sigma proves \\\\varphi) if and only if \\\\Sigma \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ eg\\\\varphi\\\\\\\\} \\\\vdash \\\\bot (i.e., \\\\Sigma and eg\\\\varphi leads to a contradiction). Therefore, a proof that \\\\Sigma \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ eg\\\\varphi\\\\\\\\} \\\\vdash \\\\bot also proves that \\\\varphi is true under the premises \\\\Sigma. The use of this fact forms the basis of a proof technique called proof by contradiction, which mathematicians use extensively to establish the validity of a wide range of theorems. This applies only in a logic where the law of excluded middle A\\\\vee eg A is accepted as an axiom. =Symbolic representation= In mathematics, the symbol used to represent a contradiction within a proof varies. Some symbols that may be used to represent a contradiction include ‚ÜØ, Opq, \\\\Rightarrow \\\\Leftarrow, ‚ä•, \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\ \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!/ , and ‚Äª; in any symbolism, a contradiction may be substituted for the truth value \\"false\\", as symbolized, for instance, by \\"0\\" (as is common in boolean algebra). It is not uncommon to see Q.E.D., or some of its variants, immediately after a contradiction symbol. In fact, this often occurs in a proof by contradiction to indicate that the original assumption was proved false‚Äîand hence that its negation must be true. = The notion of contradiction in an axiomatic system and a proof of its consistency = In general, a consistency proof requires the following two things: # An axiomatic system # A demonstration that it is not the case that both the formula p and its negation ~p can be derived in the system. But by whatever method one goes about it, all consistency proofs would seem to necessitate the primitive notion of contradiction. Moreover, it seems as if this notion would simultaneously have to be \\"outside\\" the formal system in the definition of tautology. When Emil Post, in his 1921 \\"Introduction to a General Theory of Elementary Propositions\\", extended his proof of the consistency of the propositional calculus (i.e. the logic) beyond that of Principia Mathematica (PM), he observed that with respect to a generalized set of postulates (i.e. axioms), he would no longer be able to automatically invoke the notion of \\"contradiction\\"such a notion might not be contained in the postulates: Post's solution to the problem is described in the demonstration \\"An Example of a Successful Absolute Proof of Consistency\\", offered by Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman in their 1958 G√∂del's Proof. They too observed a problem with respect to the notion of \\"contradiction\\" with its usual \\"truth values\\" of \\"truth\\" and \\"falsity\\". They observed that: Given some \\"primitive formulas\\" such as PM's primitives S1 V S2 [inclusive OR] and ~S (negation), one is forced to define the axioms in terms of these primitive notions. In a thorough manner, Post demonstrates in PM, and defines (as do Nagel and Newman, see below) that the property of tautologous ‚Äì as yet to be defined ‚Äì is \\"inherited\\": if one begins with a set of tautologous axioms (postulates) and a deduction system that contains substitution and modus ponens, then a consistent system will yield only tautologous formulas. On the topic of the definition of tautologous, Nagel and Newman create two mutually exclusive and exhaustive classes K1 and K2, into which fall (the outcome of) the axioms when their variables (e.g. S1 and S2 are assigned from these classes). This also applies to the primitive formulas. For example: \\"A formula having the form S1 V S2 is placed into class K2, if both S1 and S2 are in K2; otherwise it is placed in K1\\", and \\"A formula having the form ~S is placed in K2, if S is in K1; otherwise it is placed in K1\\".Nagel and Newman:110-111 Hence Nagel and Newman can now define the notion of tautologous: \\"a formula is a tautology if and only if it falls in the class K1, no matter in which of the two classes its elements are placed\\".Nagel and Newman:111 This way, the property of \\"being tautologous\\" is described‚Äîwithout reference to a model or an interpretation. Post observed that, if the system were inconsistent, a deduction in it (that is, the last formula in a sequence of formulas derived from the tautologies) could ultimately yield S itself. As an assignment to variable S can come from either class K1 or K2, the deduction violates the inheritance characteristic of tautology (i.e., the derivation must yield an evaluation of a formula that will fall into class K1). From this, Post was able to derive the following definition of inconsistency‚Äîwithout the use of the notion of contradiction: In other words, the notion of \\"contradiction\\" can be dispensed when constructing a proof of consistency; what replaces it is the notion of \\"mutually exclusive and exhaustive\\" classes. An axiomatic system need not include the notion of \\"contradiction\\".  Philosophy  Adherents of the epistemological theory of coherentism typically claim that as a necessary condition of the justification of a belief, that belief must form a part of a logically non-contradictory system of beliefs. Some dialetheists, including Graham Priest, have argued that coherence may not require consistency.In Contradiction: A Study of the Transconsistent By Graham Priest =Pragmatic contradictions= A pragmatic contradiction occurs when the very statement of the argument contradicts the claims it purports. An inconsistency arises, in this case, because the act of utterance, rather than the content of what is said, undermines its conclusion. =Dialectical materialism= In dialectical materialism: Contradiction‚Äîas derived from Hegelianism‚Äîusually refers to an opposition inherently existing within one realm, one unified force or object. This contradiction, as opposed to metaphysical thinking, is not an objectively impossible thing, because these contradicting forces exist in objective reality, not cancelling each other out, but actually defining each other's existence. According to Marxist theory, such a contradiction can be found, for example, in the fact that: * (a) enormous wealth and productive powers coexist alongside: * (b) extreme poverty and misery; * (c) the existence of (a) being contrary to the existence of (b). Hegelian and Marxist theory stipulates that the dialectic nature of history will lead to the sublation, or synthesis, of its contradictions. Marx therefore postulated that history would logically make capitalism evolve into a socialist society where the means of production would equally serve the exploited and suffering class of society, thus resolving the prior contradiction between (a) and (b). Mao Zedong's philosophical essay On Contradiction (1937) furthered Marx and Lenin's thesis and suggested that all existence is the result of contradiction. Outside formal logic Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement Colloquial usage can label actions or statements as contradicting each other when due (or perceived as due) to presuppositions which are contradictory in the logical sense. Proof by contradiction is used in mathematics to construct proofs. The scientific method uses contradiction to falsify bad theory.

The planet is the native world of Superman and is named after the element Krypton. The planet was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and was first referred to in Action Comics #1 (June 1938). The planet made its first full appearance in Superman #1 (summer 1939). Krypton is also the native world of Supergirl, Krypto the Superdog, and Power Girl (in her case, an alternate-universe version designated \\"Krypton-Two\\"). It has been consistently described as having been destroyed shortly after Superman's escape from the planet, although the exact details of its destruction vary by time period and writers. Kryptonians were the dominant species on Krypton. Overview Krypton is usually portrayed in comics as the home of a fantastically advanced civilization, which tragically is destroyed when the planet explodes. As originally depicted, all the civilizations and races of Krypton perished in the explosion, with one exception: the baby Kal-El who was placed in an escape rocket by his father, Jor-El, and sent to the planet Earth, where he grew up to become Superman. Kandor in Action Comics #866; art by Gary Frank and Jon Sibal In some versions of the story, additional survivors were later discovered, such as Krypto the Superdog, Supergirl, her parents (kept alive in the \\"Survival Zone\\", a similar parallel \\"dimension\\" to the Phantom Zone), the criminal inhabitants of the Phantom Zone, Dev-Em, Beppo the Super-Monkey, the residents of the bottled city of Kandor, and the real parents of both Superman and Supergirl. Kandor, the first capital of Krypton, is miniaturized by Brainiac, but it is eventually recovered by Superman and subsequently housed in the Fortress of Solitude for safekeeping. Soon afterward, Kryptonopolis becomes the second capital of Krypton. From the late 1980s through the early 2000s, the number of survivors was reduced to Superman himself in the comic book stories (the Eradicator was added in 1989 as a non-sentient device, and shown to be self-aware in 1991Superman: The Man of Steel #1), but more recent accounts have restored Supergirl, Krypto, and Kandor and introduced another newly discovered survivor, Karsta Wor-Ul. Kryptonian civilization's reported level of technological advancement has also varied. Some works, such as Kevin J. Anderson's novel The Last Days of Krypton, describe it as a few centuries ahead of Earth, while others, such as the Superman film series and Man of Steel, describe it as thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years more advanced. Versions of Krypton =Krypton in the Golden Age of Comic Books= History Krypton's apocalyptic ends on Action Comics #1 (June 1938). Art by Joe Shuster. In its first appearance, Krypton was only depicted at the moment of its destruction. Soon, beginning in the Superman comic strip, Krypton was shown to have been a planet similar to Earth, only older by eons and possessed of all the beneficial progress that implied (though the downside was the hint that Krypton exploded due mainly to old age). The debut of the Superman newspaper comic strip in 1939 delved into further details about Krypton, introducing the idea that all Kryptonians possessed a level of heightened physical abilities, including super-strength and super-speed. In the early comics' version of Krypton, Superman's parents were named \\"Jor-L\\" and \\"Lora\\" (changed to the more familiar \\"Jor-El\\" and \\"Lara\\" by the end of the 1940s). The Golden Age Krypton would be revised into another form almost as soon as it was defined (see Krypton in transition below), and very few stories were initially written about it. However, after the introduction of DC's multiverse in the 1960s, this version of Krypton was declared to be the Krypton of the Earth-Two universe (the native dimension of DC's Golden Age characters) and its Superman. After the emergence of Earth-Two as a differentiated alternate universe within the DC Multiverse, Power Girl (Kara Zor-L) was introduced as Krypton-Two's alternate Supergirl in 1976. Kal-L and Kara Zor-L were the only known survivors of Krypton-Two, unlike the Silver Age analogue. Earth Two's universe lacked its own Brainiac, so its Kandor was never abducted from Krypton Two before its destruction, nor did Kal-L have his own version of Krypto as an infant and toddler on this world. In the Golden Age, Superman was unaware initially of his true origins; in Superman #61, Superman discovered the existence of Krypton for the first time and learned of his Kryptonian heritage. He later encountered other survivors prior to Kara's arrival in the form of three criminals, U-Ban, Kizo, and Mala, who were exiled by Superman's father before Krypton's destruction. Krypton in transition Over the course of the 1940s and 1950s, various alterations and additions to the makeup of Krypton were made in the comics. Among them was an explanation of why the natives of Krypton perished if they had possessed superpowers on their native world (as was the case in the earliest versions of Krypton outlined above, although this only became a problem once Superman  and by extension anyone from Krypton  was portrayed as increasingly powerful, able to withstand nuclear explosions, contrasted with his original power level in which a bursting mortar shell could penetrate his skin). Thus, it was explained by the early 1950s that Kryptonians were powerless on their own planet and would gain superpowers only within a lower gravity environment. This matched the correct theories being published that when man reaches the Moon (a lighter gravity environment) he will be able to lift great masses and leap great distances. In the early 1960s, added to this was the need to be exposed to the rays of a yellow sun (versus Krypton's red sun, Rao, which was older and cooler, or put out less energy) to gain superpowers, with the yellow sun aspect soon gaining the much greater emphasis. Other changes to the concept of Krypton and its culture were introduced, many of which were stylistic. =Krypton in the Silver Age of Comic Books= By the late 1950s, Krypton played an increasing role in various Superman stories, with greater detail provided about Krypton's makeup. Superman's Kryptonian heritage was a frequent factor in Silver Age Superman comic storylines, as he was fully aware of his origins from an early age. Superman would use this knowledge for such tasks as constructing advanced Kryptonian technology or observing some of Krypton's traditions. History Map of Krypton Kryptonians made use of their advanced science to create a world where scientific inventions and research influenced much of daily life. Robots and computers were used for many tasks on Krypton, even for determining what career paths young Kryptonians would take as they grew up. Scientific and technological research were highly valued on Krypton, with the ruling body of Krypton named the \\"Science Council\\". Several stories featured characters traveling back in time to visit Krypton before its destruction; one example is the 1960 story \\"Superman's Return to Krypton\\", in which Superman is swept back in time to Krypton some years before its destruction. Powerless, he spends some time on the planet, where he meets his future parents-to-be and falls in love with a Kryptonian actress named Lyla Lerrol. A Superman \\"imaginary story\\" entitled \\"What If Krypton Had Not Exploded?\\" (reprinted in the trade paperback The Greatest Superman Stories Ever Told) gave more insight into Krypton's society. This era also established that the Guardians of the Universe, the administrators of the interstellar police force, the Green Lantern Corps, were themselves aware of Krypton's pending destruction and assigned Green Lantern Tomar-Re to avert it, but he was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempt. In 1979, a three-issue miniseries titled World of Krypton was published, providing a great amount of detail into Krypton's history just before its destruction, along with the life story of Jor-El himself. A three-issue miniseries entitled The Krypton Chronicles, published in 1981, tells of Superman researching his rootsManning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 195: \\"The Man of Steel took a look at his family tree in this three-issue miniseries by writer E. Nelson Bridwell and longtime Superman mainstay artist Curt Swan.\\" when, as Clark Kent, he was assigned to write an article about Superman's family by an assignment editor impressed with the television miniseries Roots. To do so, he and Supergirl travel to Kandor, where they learn the history of the El family. In 1985, writer Alan Moore gave a somewhat darker glimpse into the world of Krypton in his story \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\" (in Superman Annual #11), the premise being an elaborate dream of Superman's in which Krypton had not exploded and he had grown to adulthood there. Background details are culled from other Krypton stories. This same story was retold in the animated series Justice League Unlimited in an episode by the same name and several elements were used in the Supergirl series episode \\"For the Girl Who Has Everything\\". Moons One of Krypton's moons, Wegthor, was accidentally destroyed by the Kryptonian scientist Jax-Ur, who was experimenting with a nuclear missile that was diverted from its intended destination. The disaster killed 500 inhabitants of the moon and Jax- Ur became the first and only criminal to be banished eternally to the Phantom Zone. This disaster also prompted the Science Council of Krypton to ban space flight completely. Survivors A Silver Age Superman was not alone in the survival of Krypton's destruction, being joined by his cousin Supergirl, the Phantom Zone criminals, Beppo the Super-Monkey, Krypto the Superdog, a juvenile delinquent named Dev-Em, the entire population of the city of Kandor, Supergirl's biological parents, and even Superman's biological parents (in hibernation on a space ship - Superboy #158 (July 1969)), although it was discovered that they actually died from lethal radiation. When the planet exploded, one entire city of Krypton, Argo City, survived the cataclysm. Argo City drifted through space on an asteroid-sized fragment of Krypton, which had been transformed into kryptonite by the explosion. The super-advanced technology of its Kryptonian inhabitants allowed them to construct a life- sustaining dome and a lead shield that protected their city from the kryptonite radiation of the asteroid. The protective shield was destroyed in a meteor storm, exposing the inhabitants to the deadly radiation. The sole survivor of Argo City, Kara Zor-El, was sent to Earth by her scientist father to live with her cousin Kal-El, who had become known as Superman. Kara adjusted to her new life on Earth and became known as Supergirl. It was later discovered that Supergirl's parents had survived in the Survival Zone, a parallel dimension similar to the Phantom Zone, from which she released them. When the bottle city of Kandor was finally enlarged on a new planet that was similar to Krypton, Supergirl's parents joined its inhabitants to live there. Daxamites The people now known as the Daxamites were originally Kryptonians who left their homeworld to explore the universe (in post-Crisis on Infinite Earths continuity, the Eradicator, an artificial lifeform programmed to preserve all Kryptonian culture, altered the birthing matrices (\\"artificial wombs\\") that the explorers took with them so that all newborns would be fatally vulnerable to lead and other materials such as greenhouse gases and certain rocks). Thus, if they persisted in their anti-Kryptonian wanderlust, they would all die from it. One Daxamite, Mon-El, was poisoned by lead and preserved in the Phantom Zone until a cure was found by Brainiac 5 in the 30th century, whereafter Mon-El became a member of the Legion of Super- Heroes. Crisis on Infinite Earths After the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Silver Age version of Krypton was replaced by a newer version. The Silver Age Krypton made a rare Post-Crisis appearance in The Sandman #48, during a flashback sequence. =Krypton in the Modern Age of Comic Books= The exploding planet Krypton from History of the DC Universe #1 (1986) The Man of Steel Following Crisis on Infinite Earths, which rebooted the history of the DC Universe and retroactively eliminated the existence of the Golden and Silver Age versions of Krypton, writer/artist John Byrne was given the task of recreating the entire Superman mythos. This rewrite was started in the 1986 Man of Steel miniseries, which addressed Krypton in both its opening and closing chapters. Krypton itself was the main subject of the late 1980s The World of Krypton miniseries (not to be confused with the 1979 miniseries of the same name). This miniseries was written by Byrne and illustrated by Mike Mignola, and filled in much of Krypton's new history. =History= The new Krypton was approximately one-and-a-half times larger than the Earth and orbited a red sun called Rao fifty light-years from our solar system. Krypton's primordial era produced some of the most dangerous organisms in the universe. It was for this reason that 250,000 years ago, Krypton was chosen as the place to create Doomsday through forced evolution. Until its destruction, many dangerous animals, including ferrophage moles, still existed on Krypton. Kryptonians had to use their advanced technology to survive. Over 200,000 years ago, Krypton had developed scientific advancements far beyond those of present-day Earth, and had discovered a way to conquer disease and aging by perfecting cloning; vast banks of clones, kept in stasis, held multiple copies of each living Kryptonian so that replacement parts were always available in the event of injury. All Kryptonians were now effectively immortal, \\"with all the strength and vigor of youth maintained\\", and for millennia they enjoyed an idyllic, sensual existence in an Arcadian paradise. 100,000 years later Kryptonian society was tipping toward decadence and eventually political strife resulted from the debate as to whether clones were sentient beings and should have rights (sparked by the presence of an alien missionary known as the Cleric, who carried \\"the Eradicator\\"). Eventually this disagreement led to open violent conflict. A woman named Nyra, seeking what she considered a suitable mate for her son, Kan-Z, had one of her younger clones removed from stasis. The clone gained full sentience and was presented to society as a normal woman. When Kan-Z discovered that his fianc√©e was in fact his mother's clone, he killed the clone, then publicly killed his mother and also attempted his own suicide before being stopped. This key incident ignited the Clone Wars which lasted for 1,000 years, during which Kryptonian science was turned to warfare and several superweapons were developed and used. Among them was the device known as the Destroyer. Although the Eradicator's effects (altering the DNA of all Kryptonian lifeforms so that they would instantly die upon leaving the planet) were felt immediately, the Destroyer's effects were possibly more significant: by the time the Kryptonian government admitted defeat and abolished the clone banks, a pro-clone rights terrorist faction known as Black Zero had started the Destroyer, a device which functioned as a giant nuclear gun, projecting massive streams of nuclear energy into the core of Krypton, intended to trigger an explosive chain reaction within Krypton's core almost immediately. The use of the Destroyer eliminated the Post-Crisis city of Kandor, but it was believed at the time that the device had been stopped before it could achieve planetary destruction (by Van-L, an ancestor of Jor- El). Centuries later, Jor-El himself would discover that the reaction had only been slowed to a nearly imperceptible rate and it would eventually destroy the planet as intended. =Destruction= Though it survived the war, Krypton was scarred deeply by it. The formerly lush garden world was burned and blasted to a desert, and a sterile society‚Äîemotionally unlike its predecessor‚Äîemerged. The population lived isolated from one another in widely separated technological citadels, shunning all physical and personal contact, to the point that even family members would only interact with each other via communication devices. Procreation became a matter of selecting compatible genetic material to be placed within an artificial womb called a \\"birthing matrix,\\" the parents almost never met in person and never touched one another. The planetary government was deeply isolationist and forbade space exploration and communication with other worlds. The young scientist Jor-El was born into this world. By his adult years, a mysterious \\"Green Plague\\" was killing Kryptonians by the thousands, and upon researching the matter, Jor-El discovered that its cause was growing radiation produced by Krypton's increasingly unstable core. This process was going to cause the planet to explode. Unable to convince his associates to abandon tradition and consider escape, and reasoning that modern Kryptonian society had grown cold, unfeeling and sterile, Jor-El removed the Eradicator's planetary binding genes from his unborn son Kal-El's genetic pattern, took Kal-El's birthing matrix and attached a prototype interstellar propulsion system to the vessel. Just as the planet began to shake apart, he launched the matrix towards Earth, where it would open and give birth to the infant upon landing (the Post-Crisis Superman therefore was considered to be technically \\"born\\" on Earth). Jor-El was not only determined that his son would survive the death of his birthworld, but that he would grow up on a world that vibrantly embraced living, as his forebears once did. =The Last Son of Krypton= A central theme of this version of the Superman mythos was that the character was to remain the last surviving remnant of Krypton. Thus, Silver Age elements such as Supergirl, Krypto, and Kandor had never existed in this version (though Post-Crisis versions of these elements were eventually reintroduced). The supervillain Doomsday was revealed in the 1990s as a being genetically engineered by Bertron, an alien scientist, on an ancient Krypton. Doomsday left the planet after killing Bertron and Krypton's natives found the remains of Bertron's lab, thus obtaining the knowledge of cloning. In the newer continuity, Superman also became aware of his alien heritage only sometime after his debut as a superhero - initially assuming himself to be a human mutated in some manner and launched as part of an Earth space program - when a holographic program encoded into the craft which brought him to Earth uploaded the information into his brain (although Lex Luthor had earlier discovered his alien heritage when his attempts to create a clone of Superman were complicated by the unexpected x-factor of Superman's alien DNA). =Revisiting Krypton= In Action Comics #600 (May 1988), Krypton was close enough to Earth that the radiation from its explosion (traveling only at light speed) was able to reach Earth. In a 1988 storyline, Superman traveled to the former site of Krypton to discover that the planet was slowly reforming from the vast sphere of debris remaining. It would take millions of years before the planet would be solid again. This sphere of debris had been turned to kryptonite by the planet's destruction, and the radiation caused Superman to have a hallucination in which the entire population of Krypton came to Earth and colonized the already inhabited planet, prompting Jor-El to initiate a Terran-based resistance movement, pitting him against his estranged wife Lara and now-grown son Kal-El, at which point the hallucination ended.John Byrne: \\"Return to Krypton\\" Superman: (vol. 2) #18 (June 1988) In Superman: The Man of Steel Annual #3, \\"Unforgiven\\" - an Elseworlds tale - Jor-El convinces the Science Council to relocate selected Kryptonians to Earth. In a 1999 Starman storyline, Jack Knight became lost in time and space, and landed on Krypton several years before its destruction, meeting Jor-El as a young man. The story implies that it was this early meeting with a Terran that led Jor-El to study other worlds and eventually choose Earth as the target for his son's spacecraft; at the story's end, Jack gives Jor-El a device with the coordinates and images of Earth. In a 2001‚Äì2002 storyline, an artificial version of the Pre-Crisis Krypton was created in the Phantom Zone by Brainiac 13, a descendant of the original Brainiac who had traveled back in time to the present. This version of Krypton was based on Jor-El's favorite Kryptonian historical period. Superman: Birthright In the 2004 miniseries Superman: Birthright, a new retelling of Superman's origin and early years, Mark Waid located Krypton in the Andromeda Galaxy 2.5 million light-years away, and adopted elements from several previous versions of the planet. Although usually depicted as a red giant or red supergiant, in this story Rao is mentioned by Jor-El to be a red dwarf. In previous comic versions, it was assumed the \\"S\\" shield on Superman's costume simply stood for \\"Superman\\"; in Birthright, Waid presented it as a Kryptonian symbol of hope; he borrowed and modified a concept from Superman: The Movie, wherein the \\"S\\" was the symbol of the House of El, Superman's ancestral family. Post-Birthright revisions Beginning with Infinite Crisis, writer Geoff Johns began laying subtle hints to a new origin for Superman. Last Son, a storyline co-written by Geoff Johns and Superman film director Richard Donner, further delves into this version of Krypton which reintroduces General Zod and the Phantom Zone criminals into mainstream continuity. With art by Adam Kubert, the design of Kryptonian society is distinct yet again from Birthright, incorporating elements of both Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths continuity and Donner's work on the first two Christopher Reeve films, in particular the notion of Krypton's Council threatening Jor-El with harsh punishment were he to make public his predictions of their planet's imminent doom. This variation of Krypton's past was again seen in flashbacks during Johns' Brainiac and New Krypton story arcs. The very different depictions of Kryptonian clothing in the Golden and Silver Age comics, in the Christopher Reeve films, and in John Byrne's The Man of Steel all appeared in Johns' Superman: Secret Origin (which superseded The Man of Steel and Superman: Birthright). Multi-ethnic versions of Kryptonians that resemble Africans and Asians have also made appearances in the stories. Previously, \\"black\\" Kryptonians were mainly confined within the Kryptonian continent of Vathlo Island, but a 2011 storyline depicted Kryptonians resembling black and Asian humans who were more integrated into Kryptonian society than they were in the Silver and pre-Modern Age DC Universe.Brady, Matt (January 7, 2009). \\"Superman's planet is racially diverse - finally\\". NBC News. The New 52 Following Grant Morrison's run on Action Comics, Krypton is again a scientific and cultural utopia, and Kryptonians themselves are highly intelligent, even from infancy; Morrison describes Krypton as ‚Äúthe planet of your dreams. A scientific utopia. I wanted to explore Krypton as the world of super people. What would happen if they worked it all out, if they lived for 500 years with amazing technology?‚Äù Cody Walker elaborates on this, saying, \\"Kal-El is the next step in evolution physically, but he comes from a planet that is the next stage in evolution as well.

He explained that many artists may only use bits and pieces of science, allowing for greater latitude in their creativity, but, he said, he wanted to show that using real science, particularly astrophysics, allows for just as much creativity.American Museum of Natural History (2012, November 14).

In other media =Radio= The first non-comics version of Krypton was presented in the debut storyline of the 1940s Superman radio series. In the radio show, Krypton was part of our Solar System, a Counter-Earth sharing Earth's orbit but on the opposite side of the Sun, hidden from view of the Earth (\\"Krypton\\" derives from the Greek word for \\"hidden\\"). Some comics of the early 1950s suggested a similar theory, but in general the comics have depicted Krypton as being in a far-away star system. =Television=  Live-action  * In the pilot episode of the 1950s television program Adventures of Superman, Jor-El, portrayed by Robert Rockwell, was Krypton's leading scientist, who tried to warn the ruling council of Krypton's demise. In this take on the story, Jor-El proposed transporting the entire Kryptonian population to Earth via a fleet of rockets. He was laughed at by the council, and the planet began to break apart sooner than he expected anyway, leaving him only with a small test rocket, in which he and Lara placed Kal-El and his red-and-blue blankets. The explosion of Krypton was visualized through low- budget special effects and stock footage of simulated earthquakes. Of note is that the flight to Earth was depicted as occurring in a matter of seconds. The narrator had characterized Krypton as being \\"millions of miles\\" from Earth. * The version of Krypton portrayed in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman was similar to the 1978 version in Superman: The Movie. At the end of the third season, it was revealed that a sizable colony had survived the planet's destruction. From what was shown of the colony (called New Krypton), the society, despite the advanced technology, had numerous archaic elements, like hereditary rule, arranged marriage for nobles, often as early as birth, and trial by combat being legal for nobility (although seldom practiced). Unlike many incarnations, New Krypton was not as isolated from other races; it had starships, including a large vessel which served as its palace, and the main antagonist of the story arc (Nor) dealing with the colony was able to hire an assassin from another race to attempt to kill Kal-El. * The television series Smallville presents a version of Krypton that mirrors the Superman: The Movie aesthetic but has more ties to Earth. Numerous Kryptonian artifacts come into play during the show. For example, the \\"Stones of Power\\" in season 4 (used to contain all information in the known 28 galaxies and become the Crystal of Knowledge to make the Fortress of Solitude), \\"The Orb\\" in season 8 (containing DNA of fallen Kryptonian citizens), and its bible, The Book of Rao (used to transport Kryptonians to \\"Heaven\\") during season 9. In season 2, as elements of Krypton came to light, more Kryptonian glyphs appear on Earth via the Kawatche Caves as there were prophesies discovered by various characters about a \\"Traveler\\" planted by a young Jor-El visiting Smallville. It was considered by the universe as a peaceful and advanced planet until civil war broke out, leading to its destruction in 1986 by General Zod and the renegade Zor-El after they used Brainiac to ignite Krypton's unstable core. * The destruction of Krypton was featured in the 2015 pilot episode of Supergirl. Kara was sent to Earth to protect her then-infant cousin, Kal-El. Krypton exploded just seconds after her pod took off, sending it into the Phantom Zone. The episode \\"Hostile Takeover\\" revealed that the planet was destroyed due to over-mining its core. The third season episode \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" revealed that Argo City was preserved along with many of the inhabitants, on an asteroid formed from Kryptonian debris. * David S. Goyer developed a prequel TV series titled Krypton. In December 2014, it was confirmed that the series was in development and would air on the SyFy network. The series was produced by Goyer and written and executive produced by Ian Goldberg. Goyer has also confirmed that the series takes place approximately 200 years before the time period of the Man of Steel film. TV Line reports that SyFY has placed a pilot order for the show, Damian Kindler is the showrunner and co-executive producer with Goyer and Colm McCarthy directed the pilot. In June 2016, TV Line reports that the series would feature Seg-El, Lyta-Zod, Val-El, Alura Zod, Dev-Em and Ter-El and the pilot started filming in Montreal. This version of Krypton became unstable after Brainiac steals the city of Kandor. In May 2018, Syfy renewed Krypton for a second season, which premiered in June 2019. Animation * Krypton was very briefly depicted in the first Fleischer Studios-produced Superman cartoon in the early 1940s as \\"a planet that burned like a green star in the distant heavens [and where] civilization was far advanced and it brought forth a race of Supermen whose mental and physical powers were developed to the absolute peak of human perfection,\\" implying that all Kryptonians had Superman's abilities even on their own planet. The planet is seen only from a distance, just before its explosion. * Depictions of Krypton on both The New Adventures of Superman and Super Friends; in one of the \\"lost episodes\\" of Super Friends season of 1983‚Äì1984), \\"The Krypton Syndrome\\" Jor-El says that Krypton will be enveloped by their sun and explode a short time later. * In Superman: The Animated Series, \\"The Last Son of Krypton\\", Krypton's climate is shown to have both temperate and Arctic conditions. According to commentary on the DVD collection of the show's first season, part of Krypton's appearance was influenced by the artistic style of American comic book artist Jack Kirby.  This version depicted the villain Brainiac as responsible via inaction for the destruction of Krypton's people (though not the planet itself). Brainiac was the planet's essential A.I. system; it, like Jor-El, discovered that the planet would explode after several weeks of intense seismic activity. Brainiac knew that if the Kryptonian elders learned of it, Brainiac would be tasked with formulating an evacuation plan. Brainiac believed, given the time Krypton had left, that any personal evacuation was pointless, and it would leave Brainiac itself with no time to escape, so it told the elders that Jor-El was mistaken and that the quakes were the result of a polar shift. It secretly uploaded itself and all of Krypton's culture and knowledge onto a satellite, jettisoning it out of Krypton's orbit before the planet's destruction, while Kryptonian civilization (save for Jor-El and his family) remained unaware of the planet's peril until it was too late to evacuate.  Krypton had a \\"sister planet\\" named Argo, colonized by Kryptonians many centuries before the destruction of Krypton. Its people had a greater resistance to kryptonite under a yellow sun. On a journey into space, Superman found that the explosion of Krypton pushed the planet from its orbit away from its sun, causing the planet to gradually cool. Its people went into cryostasis to survive, but an accident left Supergirl the only survivor. The remains of Krypton settled into an asteroid belt of kryptonite. * In the Legion of Super Heroes animated series, Krypton is shown in a flashback during the episode \\"Message in a Bottle\\". In this version, Jor- El actually found a way to save the planet with his creation, \\"the Messenger\\". The Messenger was kept in the city of Kandor; when the city was shrunken and stolen by Brainiac, the planet's destruction was assured. At the end of the episode, the Messenger is used to restore Krypton from its remains, and Kandor is restored to its full size so its people can begin life anew. * Krypton appears as a final cameo in the 2019 animated series DC Super Hero Girls, episode \\"#DCSuperHeroBoys\\" (Part 1). In a flashback, Alura Zor-El tells Zod that Krypton is collapsing on itself. She uses a device to send Zod and his minions Ursa and Non to the Phantom Zone, then tells Kara that she is sending her to join her cousin Kal. =Film= Superman In the first feature- length Superman film in 1978, a vastly less idyllic image of Krypton was presented. Whereas in the comics Krypton was colorful and bright, the film depicted the planet with stark bluish-white terrain of jagged frozen plateaus under heavy, dark skies. The planet was threatened by their sun turning into a supernova. Jor-El unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the council of elders to immediately evacuate the planet. Kryptonians themselves were portrayed as coolly cerebral and morally enlightened, clad in stark white bodysuits emblazoned with each family's house symbol. The architecture featured halls of white crystal under crystalline arches. The crystalline motif was employed not only in the architecture, but in the landscape and technology as well, suggesting that the entire planet had been adapted and altered by Kryptonian influence. In 1948, Krypton was ultimately destroyed when its red sun began to collapse; the planet was pulled into the sun and steadily crushed, then exploded in the ensuing supernova. When Krypton was destroyed, fragments from the planet were launched into space, resulting in the creation of a harmful radioactive substance known as kryptonite. Both Jor-El and Lara preserved some part of their \\"essence\\" (in the form of virtual copies of themselves) in the starship that took three years to bring their child to Earth. On Clark Kent's eighteenth birthday, a glowing crystal revealed itself in the ship and compelled Clark to take it north. He eventually reached the Arctic, where the crystal constructed the massive crystalline Fortress of Solitude. Inside, an artificially intelligent hologram of Jor-El appeared to him and initiated twelve years of Kryptonian education. These virtual versions of Jor-El and Lara remained as constructs within the Fortress throughout the series. Superman's symbol was given a Kryptonian origin in the film. Male Kryptonians were shown wearing unique symbols on the chests of their robes, similar to a family crest; Jor-El and Kal-El wore the familiar S-shield, which Lois Lane later assumed to be the letter S from the familiar Latin alphabet, and thus dubs him \\"Superman\\". Superman Returns The 2006 movie Superman Returns presents a version of Krypton almost identical to Superman. In the beginning of the film, scientists discover remains of Krypton, and Superman leaves Earth for five years to look for it. His ship is seen leaving the dead planet. The planet is destroyed when the red supergiant Rao becomes a supernova. Superman Returns extends the crystalline Kryptonian technology from Superman which allowed young Clark Kent to \\"grow\\" the Fortress of Solitude. Kryptonian crystals are able to grow huge land masses and incorporate the properties of the surrounding environment; a sliver taken from one of the crystals used to test the theory causes Lex Luthor's basement to be filled with a huge crystal structure. Growing land in this manner causes widespread power failure. Lex Luthor later combines one of the crystals with kryptonite and shoots it into the ocean, creating a new land mass he calls \\"New Krypton\\". Superman uses his heat vision to get under the crust of the island and throws it into space, including the other crystals that Luthor wanted to use to set up a real estate scam, despite the warning that many people would die from the massive tsunamis and earthquakes that the crystals would create. The novelization by Marv Wolfman states that one of Superman's ancestors helped civilize Krypton long ago. Man of Steel The 2013 film Man of Steel adds strong dystopian elements to Krypton and its fate. The planet is portrayed as having an Earth- like terrain composed of mountains, canyons and oceans. The planet is 8.7 billion years old and approximately 27.1 light years from Earth. Its parent star Rao is depicted as a 13 billion year old red dwarf sun. Its gravity is much higher than that of Earth, and its atmospheric composition is unsuitable for humans. It is also shown to have a natural satellite. Kryptonian society is divided into houses, such as the House of El. Citizens wear the crests of their house over their chests, which hold meanings, such as the crest of House of El meaning \\"hope\\". Kryptonian civilization is at least 100,000 years old and many millennia more advanced than human civilization on Earth, and had begun exploring the Milky Way Galaxy. Kryptonians later abandon these projects in favor of isolationism and artificial population control, engineering newborns for pre-determined roles in society. The planet's resources were strained, and the stability of the planet was threatened by careless mining of the planet's core. As Jor-El attempts to warn the Science Council of their folly, General Zod stages a coup. In hopes of preserving the Kryptonian race, Jor-El steals the genetic Codex of the planet (a list holding the DNA pattern of everyone yet to be born on Krypton) and infuses it into the cells of Kal- El, the first natural-born child on Krypton in centuries, and sends his son to Earth. Zod kills Jor-El and is arrested by the authorities. He and his followers are banished to the Phantom Zone shortly before Krypton is destroyed. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice In the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Luthor learns the Council of Krypton banished the creations of \\"Kryptonian Deformities\\". =Novelizations= Last Son of Krypton The 1978 novel Last Son of Krypton by Elliot S! Maggin contains descriptions of Krypton, mainly referencing the Silver Age version; it describes the planet as a \\"failed star\\" with massive surface gravity and extremely hostile, glaciated conditions, which forced extreme adaptation and rapid evolution in the descendants of humanoid space travelers (and their dogs) who became stranded on its surface in prehistory. This led to an extremely strong, dense, and durable Kryptonian species with unusual physical properties. Maggin describes the rise of a civilization which uses geothermal heat as its primary power source, developing science and technology, but finding it difficult to escape the massive world's gravity. Eventually its internal nuclear reactions led to Krypton's explosion. The Last Days of Krypton Novelist Kevin J. Anderson presents approximately the last Earth year before Krypton's destruction in the 2007 novel The Last Days of Krypton.

A double entendre (plural double entendres) is a figure of speech or a particular way of wording that is devised to have a double meaning, of which one is typically obvious, whereas the other often conveys a message that would be too socially awkward, sexually suggestive, or offensive to state directly. A double entendre may exploit puns or word play to convey the second meaning. Double entendres generally rely on multiple meanings of words, or different interpretations of the same primary meaning. They often exploit ambiguity and may be used to introduce it deliberately in a text. Sometimes a homophone can be used as a pun. When three or more meanings have been constructed, this is known as a \\"triple entendre\\", etc.  Etymology  According to the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, the expression comes from the rare and obsolete identical French expression, which literally meant \\"double meaning\\" and was used in the senses of \\"double understanding\\" or \\"ambiguity\\" but acquired its current suggestive twist in English after being first used in English in 1673 by John Dryden.Merriam-Webster Unabridged DictionaryThe Grammarphobia Blog: Double entendre The phrase has not been used in French for centuries and would be ungrammatical in modern French. No exact equivalent exists in French, whose similar expressions (mot/expression √†) double entente and (mot/expression √†) double sens don't have the suggestiveness of the English expression.  Structure  A person who is unfamiliar with the hidden or alternative meaning of a sentence may fail to detect its innuendos, aside from observing that others find it humorous for no apparent reason. Innuendo is often used in sitcoms and other comedy where some in the audience may enjoy the humour while being oblivious to its secondary meaning. A triple entendre is a phrase that can be understood in any of three ways, such as in the back cover of the 1981 Rush album Moving Pictures which shows a moving company carrying paintings out of a building while people are shown being emotionally moved and a film crew makes a \\"moving picture\\" of the whole scene.  Usage  = Literature = In Homer's The Odyssey, when Odysseus is captured by the Cyclops Polyphemus, he tells the Cyclops that his name is Oudeis (ŒøœÖŒ¥ŒµŒπœÇ = No- one). When Odysseus attacks the Cyclops later that night and stabs him in the eye, the Cyclops runs out of his cave, yelling to the other Cyclopes that \\"No- one has hurt me!\\", which leads the other Cyclopes to take no action under the assumption that Polyphemus blinded himself by accident, allowing Odysseus and his men to escape. The first page of the poem \\"The Wanderer\\" found in the Exeter Book. Some of the earliest double entendres are found in the Exeter Book, or Codex exoniensis, at Exeter Cathedral in England. The book was copied around AD 975. In addition to the various poems and stories found in the book, there are also numerous riddles. The Anglo-Saxons did not reveal the answers to the riddles, but they have been answered by scholars over the years. Some riddles were double-entendres, such as Riddle 25 (\\"I am a wondrous creature: to women a thing of joyful expectation, to close-lying companions serviceable. I harm no city-dweller excepting my slayer alone. My stem is erect and tall‚Äì‚ÄìI stand up in bed‚Äì‚Äìand whiskery somewhere down below. Sometimes a countryman's quite comely daughter will venture, bumptious girl, to get a grip on me. She assaults my red self and seizes my head and clenches me in a cramped place. She will soon feel the effect of her encounter with me, this curl-locked woman who squeezes me. Her eye will be wet.\\") which suggests the answer \\"a penis\\" but has the correct answer \\"an onion\\". Examples of sexual innuendo and double- entendre occur in Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales (14th century), in which the Wife of Bath's Tale is laden with double entendres. These include her use of the word \\"queynte\\" to describe both domestic duties (from the homonym \\"quaint\\") and genitalia (\\"queynte\\" being the root of \\"cunt\\", a vulgar English word for vulva). The title of Sir Thomas More's 1516 fictional work Utopia is a double entendre because of the pun between two Greek-derived words that would have identical pronunciation: with his spelling, it means \\"no place\\" (as echoed later in Samuel Butler's later Erewhon); spelled as the rare word Eutopia, it is pronounced the sameA. D. Cousins, Macquarie University. \\"Utopia\\". The Literary Encyclopedia. 25 October 2004. The Literary Dictionary Company. 2008. by English-speaking readers, but has the meaning \\"good place\\". Sometimes, it is unclear whether a double entendre was intended. For example, the character Charley Bates from Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist is frequently referred to as Master Bates. The word \\"masturbate\\" was in use when the book was written, and Dickens often used colourful names related to the natures of the characters. The title of Damon Knight's story To Serve Man is a double entendre which could mean \\"to perform a service to humanity\\" or \\"to serve a human as food\\". An alien cookbook with the title To Serve Man is featured in the story which could imply that the aliens eat humans. The story was the basis for an episode of The Twilight Zone. At the end of the episode the line \\"It's a cookbook!\\" reveals the truth. Double entendres are used in the Fourth Gospel (Gospel of John) as a narrative device to further the dialogue between Jesus and a character. A case in point is Nicodemus‚Äô conversation with Jesus in John 3:3: \\"Very truly, I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above/again (Greek: ·ºÑŒΩœâŒ∏ŒµŒΩ, an≈çthen).‚Äù Nicodemus selects the literal meaning of the word (born \\"again\\") and wonders how one can enter the mother's womb a second time (John 3:4). But Jesus intends the figurative meaning (born \\"from above\\", John 3:5‚Äì7).R. Alan Culpepper, Anatomy of the Fourth Gospel: A Study in Literary Design (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1983), 135. See also James L. Resseguie, \\"A Glossary of New Testament Narrative Criticism with Illustrations,\\" in Religions, 10 (3: 217), 10‚Äì11. Double entendres also accentuate the gospel's theological singularities. For example, the narrator uses the verb ‚Äúto be lifted up‚Äù (Greek: ·ΩëœàœâŒ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ, hyps≈çthƒìnai) to describe Jesus‚Äô crucifixion in John 3:14, 8:28, and 12:32. In each instance, it has a second, theological meaning: He is exalted or glorified in this act.Resseguie, The Strange Gospel: Narrative Design and Point of View in John (Leiden: Brill, 2001), 55-6. = Stage performances = Flax on a distaff Shakespeare frequently used double entendres in his plays. Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night says of Sir Andrew's hair, that \\"it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off\\"; the Nurse in Romeo and Juliet says that her husband had told Juliet when she was learning to walk that \\"Yea, dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit\\"; or is told the time by Mercutio: \\"for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon\\"; and in Hamlet, Hamlet publicly torments Ophelia with a series of sexual puns, including \\"country matters\\" (similar to \\"cunt\\"). The title of Shakespeare's play Much Ado About Nothing is a pun on the Elizabethan use of \\"no-thing\\" as slang for vagina. In the UK, starting in the 19th century, Victorian morality disallowed sexual innuendo in the theatre as being unpleasant, particularly for the ladies in the audience. In music hall songs, on the other hand, this kind of innuendo remained very popular. Marie Lloyd's song \\"She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas\\" is an example of this. (Music hall in this context is to be compared with Variety, the one common, low-class and vulgar; the other demi- monde, worldly and sometimes chic.) In the 20th century there began to a crackdown on lewdness, including some prosecutions. It was the job of the Lord Chamberlain to examine the scripts of all plays for indecency. Nevertheless, some comedians still continued to get away with it. Max Miller had two books of jokes, a white book and a blue book, and would ask his audience which book they wanted to hear stories from. If they chose the blue book, he could blame the audience for the lewdness to follow (in the UK, \\"blue\\" colloquially refers to sexual content, as in \\"blue jokes\\", \\"blue movies\\" etc.). = Radio and television = In the United States, innuendo and double entendre were only lightly used in radio media until the 1980s when the Howard Stern Show began to push the envelope of what was acceptable on the radio through use of double entendre and ironies. This garnered so much attention it spawned an entire genre of Radio called \\"Shock Jock Radio\\" where DJs will push the limits of what is an \\"acceptable\\" double entendre to use on over the air as the FCC has been known to hand out large fines for the use of double entendre on radio if they deem it to be in violation of their standards. In Britain, innuendo humour began to transfer to radio and cinema from the late 1950s on. Particularly significant in this respect were the Carry On series of films and the BBC radio series Round the Horne; although some of Round the Horne appeared to be nonsense language, the protagonists were sometimes having \\"rude\\" conversations in Polari (gay slang). Round the Horne depended heavily on innuendo and double entendre, the show's name itself being a triple entendre, a play on the name of its central actor Kenneth Horne and those around him, the sailor's expression \\"going round the horn\\" (i.e. Cape Horn), and the fact that \\"horn\\" is slang for an erection. Spike Milligan, writer of The Goon Show, remarked that a lot of \\"blue\\" (i.e. sexual) innuendo came from servicemen's jokes, which most of the cast understood (they all had been soldiers) and many of the audience understood, but which passed over the heads of most of the Senior BBC producers and directors, most of whom were \\"Officer class\\". In 1968, the office of the Lord Chamberlain ceased to have responsibility for censoring live entertainment, after the Theatres Act 1968. By the 1970s, innuendo had become widely used across much of the British broadcast media, including sitcoms and radio comedy, such as I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. For example, in the 1970s TV comedy series Are You Being Served?, Mrs. Slocombe frequently referred to her pet cat as her \\"pussy\\", apparently unaware of how easily her statement could be misinterpreted, such as \\"It's a wonder I'm here at all, you know. My pussy got soakin' wet. I had to dry it out in front of the fire before I left\\". Someone unfamiliar with sexual slang might find this statement funny simply because of the references to her sodden cat, whereas others would find further humour in the innuendo (\\"pussy\\" being sexual slang for vulva). Modern comedies, such as the US version of The Office, often do not hide the addition of sexual innuendos into the script; for example, main character Michael Scott often deploys the phrase \\"that's what she said\\" after another character's innocent statement, to turn it retroactively into a sexual pun. On The Scott Mills Show on BBC Radio 1, listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with double meanings in a humorous context, a feature known as \\"Innuendo Bingo\\". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game. = Movies = Double entendres are popular in modern movies, as a way to conceal adult humour in a work aimed at general audiences. The James Bond films are rife with such humour. For example, in Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), when Bond is disturbed by the telephone while in bed with a Danish girl, he explains to Moneypenny that he is busy \\"brushing up on a little Danish\\". Moneypenny responds by pointing out that Bond was known as \\"a cunning linguist\\", a play on the word \\"cunnilingus\\". In the final scene of Moonraker, while Bond is taking Dr Holly Goodhead \\"round the world one more time\\", Q says to Sir Frederick Gray, \\"I think he‚Äôs attempting re-entry, sir\\". In The World Is Not Enough (1999), while in bed with Dr Christmas Jones, Bond tells her \\"I thought Christmas only comes once a year\\". Other obvious examples include Pussy Galore in Goldfinger and Holly Goodhead in Moonraker. The double entendres of the Bond films were parodied in the Austin Powers series. Bawdy double entendres, such as \\"I'm the kinda girl who works for Paramount by day, and Fox all night\\", and (from the movie Myra Breckinridge) \\"I feel like a million tonight ‚Äì but only one at a time\\", are typical of the comedy writing of Mae West, for her early-career vaudeville performances as well as for her later plays and movies. = Music = Double entendres are very common in the titles and lyrics of pop songs, such as \\"If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me\\" by The Bellamy Brothers. By one interpretation, the person being talked to is asked if they would be offended; by the other interpretation, they are asked if they would press their body against the person doing the talking. Singer and songwriter Bob Dylan, in his somewhat controversial song \\"Rainy Day Women No. 12 & 35\\", repeats the line \\"Everybody must get stoned\\". In context, the phrase refers to the punishment of execution by stoning, but on another level it means to \\"get stoned\\", a common slang term for being high on cannabis. In their song \\"Big Balls\\" on the album Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, AC/DC the chorus \\"we've got big balls\\" can be read as referring to either formal dances or testicles. During the 1940s, Benny Bell recorded several \\"party records\\" that contained double entendre including \\"Everybody Wants My Fanny\\". = Social interaction = Double entendres can arise in the replies to inquiries. The clich√©d phrase \\"Said the actress to the bishop\\", as well as \\"that's what she said\\" can be used to remark on a sentence said by another which was not intended as a double entendre but nevertheless could be interpreted with a double meaning, one of them sexual.

The series, written by Marv Wolfman and pencilled by George P√©rez, was first serialized as a 12-issue limited series from April 1985 to March 1986. As the main piece of a crossover event, some plot elements were featured in tie-in issues of other publications. Since its initial publication, the series has been reprinted in various formats and editions. The idea for the series stemmed from Wolfman's desire to abandon the DC Multiverse depicted in the company's comics‚Äîwhich he thought was unfriendly to readers‚Äîand create a single, unified DC Universe (DCU). The foundation of Crisis on Infinite Earths developed through a character (the Monitor) introduced in Wolfman's The New Teen Titans in July 1982 before the series itself started. P√©rez was not the intended artist for the series, but was excited when he learned of it and called illustrating it some of the most fun he ever had. At the start of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Anti-Monitor (the Monitor's evil counterpart) is unleashed on the DC Multiverse and begins to destroy the various Earths that it comprises. The Monitor tries to recruit heroes from around the Multiverse but is murdered, while Brainiac collaborates with the villains to conquer the remaining Earths. However, both the heroes and villains are eventually united by the Spectre; the series concludes with Kal-L, Superboy- Prime and Alexander Luthor Jr. defeating the Anti-Monitor and the creation of a single Earth in place of the Multiverse. Crisis on Infinite Earths is noted for its high death count; hundreds of characters died, including DC icons Kara Zor-El (the original Supergirl) and Barry Allen (the Flash of the Silver Age). The story's events resulted in the entire DCU being rebooted. The series was a bestseller for DC and has been reviewed positively by comic book critics, who praised its ambition and dramatic events. The story is credited with popularizing the idea of a large-scale crossover in comics. \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" is the first installment in what became known as the Crisis trilogy; it was followed by Infinite Crisis (2005‚Äì2006) and Final Crisis (2008‚Äì2009). The story also serves as inspiration for \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", an Arrowverse crossover event consisting of an episode each of Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow and Batwoman. Publication history =Background= DC Comics is an American comic book publisher best known for its superhero stories featuring characters including Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The company debuted in February 1935 with New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine. Most of DC's comic books (as well as some published under its imprints Vertigo and Young Animal) take place within a shared universe called the DC Universe (DCU) allowing plot elements, characters, and settings to cross over with each other. The concept of the DCU has provided DC's writers some challenges in maintaining continuity, due to conflicting events within different comics that need to reflect the shared nature of the universe. \\"The Flash of Two Worlds\\" from The Flash #123 (September 1961), which featured Barry Allen (the Silver Age Flash) teaming up with Jay Garrick (the Golden Age Flash) was the first DC comic to suggest that the DCU was a part of a multiverse. The DC Multiverse concept was expanded in later years with the DCU having infinite Earths; for example, the Golden Age versions of DC heroes resided on Earth-Two, while DC's Silver Age heroes were from Earth- One. Since \\"Crisis on Earth-One!\\" (1963), DC has used the word \\"Crisis\\" to describe important crossovers within the DC Multiverse. Over the years, various writers took liberties creating additional parallel Earths as plot devices and to house characters DC had acquired from other companies, making the DC Multiverse a \\"convoluted mess\\". DC's comic book sales were also far below those of their competitor Marvel Comics. According to ComicsAlliance journalist Chris Sims, \\"the [DC] multiverse . . . felt old-fashioned. . . . Marvel, on the other hand, felt contemporary and when you stack them up against each other, there's one difference that sticks out above anything else: Marvel feels unified.\\" During the Bronze Age of Comic Books, writer Marv Wolfman became popular among DC's readers for his work on Weird War Tales and The New Teen Titans. George P√©rez, who illustrated The New Teen Titans, also began to rise to prominence in this era. In 1984, P√©rez entered into an exclusive contract with DC, which was later extended one year. Although The New Teen Titans was a major success for DC, the company's comic book sales were still below Marvel's. Wolfman began to attribute this to the DC Multiverse, feeling \\"The Flash of Two Worlds\\" had created a \\"nightmare\\": it was not reader-friendly for new readers to be able to keep track of and writers struggled with the continuity errors it caused. In The New Teen Titans #21 (July 1982), Wolfman introduced a new character: the shadowy, potentially villainous Monitor; this laid the foundation for Crisis on Infinite Earths. =Development= Marv Wolfman, the author of Crisis on Infinite Earths, in 2007 In 1981, Wolfman was editing Green Lantern. He got a letter from a fan asking why a character did not recognize Green Lantern in a recent issue despite the two having had worked together in an issue three years earlier. Soon afterward, Wolfman pitched Crisis on Infinite Earths as The History of the DC Universe, seeing it as a way to simplify the DCU and attract new readers. The History of the DC Universes title was changed to Crisis of Infinite Earths because its premise, involving the destruction of entire worlds, sounded more like a crisis. Wolfman said when he pitched the series to DC, he realized it was going to be a completely new beginning for the DCU. \\"I knew up front, and they did too, how big this was going to be,\\" he said. \\"But, no-one knew how well it would sell, or whether it would sell at all. It was a risk DC was willing to take, because my thoughts were that DC needed a lot of help at that time, and they did too.\\" Wolfman also said he saw it as an attempt to improve DC's reputation for storytelling. Many readers at the time saw them as old-fashioned. The crossover was fleshed out and coordinated at a meeting attended by president Jenette Kahn, Paul Levitz, vice president and executive editor Dick Giordano and DC's editors. In 1982, DC hired a researcher to go through their library and read every comic the company had published, a task that took two years. The series was delayed to 1983 due to the time for research, and again to 1985 when it was still not ready for 1983 and to coincide with DC's fiftieth anniversary. As an event like Crisis on Infinite Earths had never happened before, those working on it met for around two hours a week; at the time, this was uncommon. The groundwork for the series was laid the year before it was published.Crisis on Infinite Earths: Absolute Edition One of the greatest challenges for Wolfman and Giordano was coming up with a story. Wolfman cited making use of every DC character and creating a plot that was fun to read and filled with surprises as difficulties, as the series needed to sell well; if it did not, it could have caused a disaster for DC. Plotting became easier once a beginning and an ending had been determined and when P√©rez became involved. Crisis on Infinite Earths was DC's first mainstream maxiseries, which was still a relatively new concept. Early in planning for Crisis on Infinite Earths, a list was made of characters that were part of the DCU; characters from other universes, such as those that formerly belonged to Charlton Comics, also were used. According to Wolfman, one of the purposes of Crisis on Infinite Earths was to showcase all the characters DC had. The series is infamous for its high death count. Hundreds of characters died; among the most noted was Barry Allen's. Wolfman has said he did not want to kill Allen, but DC ordered him to because it perceived the character as dull. Therefore, he conceived Allen's death‚Äîin which he runs through time before vanishing‚Äîas a way to make the character seem more interesting and hopefully spare him. Wolfman wanted to make the series unforgettable; he said that many writers had expressed interest in simplifying DC's continuity and he wanted to be the one to do so. P√©rez says he was not the intended artist for Crisis on Infinite Earths, but was excited when he learned about it, seeing it as an opportunity for \\"revenge\\" against Marvel, which he blamed for blocking the JLA/Avengers crossover he had been working on. He enjoyed working with Wolfman again, and took a leave of absence from The New Teen Titans to draw the series.\\"George P√©rez signs contract with DC, Takes leave of absence from Titans, The Comics Journal #92 (August 1984), p. 16. DC initially did not know P√©rez would want to work on it. According to P√©rez, he was motivated by the fact that DC did not know if the series was going to be a success. He also wanted \\"to draw everybody I could get my hands on\\" and called illustrating the series some of the most fun he ever had. P√©rez was excited because not only did he get to draw the Teen Titans again, but also obscure characters he was not familiar with, saying he could possibly have never gotten another chance. One panel in Crisis on Infinite Earths shows the Marvel Universe being destroyed with other earths. When Giordano (the series' initial inker) had difficulty meeting deadlines while continuing as DC vice president and executive editor, editorial coordinator Pat Bastienne reassigned the inking to Jerry Ordway despite Giordano's objections. =Publication= The idea for Crisis on Infinite Earths was first noted in the December 1981 issue of The Comics Journal, which mentioned a twelve-part maxiseries scheduled for 1982. The series was announced in Giordano's \\"Meanwhile...\\" column DC ran in its titles in June 1984. Giordano warned readers that \\"odd occurrences\\" would begin to happen throughout DC's comics. He also clarified it would commemorate DC's fiftieth anniversary and would provide the company \\"wonderful stepping-stones\\" for new characters and comics. The series was marketed with the tagline \\"Worlds will live, worlds will die and nothing will ever be the same\\". The series began in January 1985 and lasted for twelve issues, ending in December 1985 (issues cover dated April 1985 through March 1986). The close spacing of Crisis on Infinite Earths and Marvel's similar crossover Secret Wars caused some fans to create conspiracy theories about idea theft. According to writer Steve Gerber, the series \\"got virtually no promotion ... How many handouts did you see? How many posters did you see in people's windows? How much information was really distributed to the press and how much was gotten just by individual reporters going to Marv Wolfman and [Crisis artist] George P√©rez?\\" =Tie-ins= Superman #415 was a tie-in issue to Crisis on Infinite Earths, indicated by the banner at the top of the cover. The cover art is by Eduardo Barreto. Elements to set up Crisis on Infinite Earths were put in DC's comics years before the crossover took place; an example of this was the Monitor's appearance in The New Teen Titans. In a January 3, 1983 memo, Giordano, Wolfman, and Len Wein instructed editors and writers to use the Monitor twice in the coming year but not to show him: \\"Because this series involves the entire DC Universe we do ask that each Editor and writer cooperate with the project by using a character called The Monitor in their books twice during the next year\\". This served to set up the series. When Wolfman and Giordano reiterated this in a 1984 meeting, some editors were not pleased; one was so miffed he did not speak for the rest of the meeting. Tie-ins for Crisis on Infinite Earths were published in DC's ongoing series. Unlike the 1991 Marvel crossover storyline The Infinity Gauntlet, where Marvel only published tie-ins in titles that needed a boost in sales, the vast majority of DC's comics featured events that directly tied to the crossover. The following comic book issues were labeled as part of the crossover; their covers contained a banner that read \\"Special Crisis Cross- Over\\", along with the logo for DC's fiftieth anniversary. * All-Star Squadron #50‚Äì56 * Amethyst (vol. 2) #13 * Blue Devil (DC Comics) #17-18 * DC Comics Presents #86‚Äì88 * The Fury of Firestorm #41‚Äì42 * Green Lantern (vol. 2) #194‚Äì195; #198 * Infinity, Inc. #18‚Äì24; Annual #1 * Justice League of America #244‚Äì245; Annual #3 * JLA: Incarnations #5 (released in 2001) * Legion of Super-Heroes #18 * The Losers Special #1 * The New Teen Titans (vol. 2) #13‚Äì14 * The Omega Men #31 * Superman #414‚Äì415 * Swamp Thing #46 * Wonder Woman #327‚Äì329 * Legends of the DC Universe : Crisis on Infinite Earths #1 =Collected editions= * Crisis on Infinite Earths #1‚Äì12 (April 1985 ‚Äì March 1986) was published in a slipcased hardcover edition (which included a bonus gatefold 21\\" x 32\\" poster version of Crisis issue #7's \\"Death of Supergirl\\" cover) (December 1998; ) and trade paperback (January 2001; ) editions, with cover art by George P√©rez and Alex Ross.

Synopsis The conflicting stories of the DCU are explained as a Multiverse, containing many parallel universes and alternate versions of the characters, with the primary DC continuity referred to as Earth-One. A cosmic being from the beginning of time known as the Monitor catalogues these realities, but he has an evil counterpart, the Anti-Monitor, who comes from an antimatter universe. After an accident with antimatter on one universe, the Anti-Monitor begins destroying many of the realities with a wave of antimatter, planning on becoming sole ruler of all realities. To combat this, the Monitor recruits heroes and villains from across time and space to set up five towers, to help merge the multiverse back into one to make it stronger. However, he is murdered by his prot√©g√©e, Harbinger, who is possessed by one of the Anti-Monitor's demons. His death releases enough energy to project two of the last five parallel Earths into a protective limbo. The Anti-Monitor recruits Psycho-Pirate to his cause, infusing him with part of his power to manipulate the heroes of Earth-4, Earth-S and Earth-X against the rest; this fails when all five Earths enter the limbo universe. Harbinger then recruits heroes from the remaining Earths to lead an assault on the Anti-Monitor in the antimatter universe, using Alexander Luthor Jr.'s powers to open a portal between the limbo and antimatter universes. Pariah tracks down the Anti- Monitor at his fortress, and the heroes destroy a converter, powered by stellar energy, used to destroy the last five Earths; the injured Anti-Monitor retreats and Supergirl dies. During a lull in the war, the villains unite under Brainiac, who kills Earth-Two's Alexei Luthor while recruiting the Earth-One Lex Luthor to conquer the remaining Earths. The Anti-Monitor meanwhile creates a new body for himself, and tries to use an antimatter cannon to penetrate the limbo universe and destroy the five partially merged Earths. The Flash (Barry Allen) dies stopping this attempt. A furious Anti- Monitor absorbs the energy of millions of worlds and vows to travel back through time to prevent the creation of the multiverse. The Spectre unites the heroes and villains by warning them about the Anti-Monitor's plan; the heroes travel back in time to stop the Anti-Monitor, while the villains travel back in time to the ancient planet Oa to prevent renegade scientist Krona from creating the technology necessary for the Anti-Monitor's plan to succeed. The villains fail, and Krona continues his experiment. The Anti-Monitor waits for Alex Luthor to reopen the portal between the positive and antimatter universes, capturing the heroes, but a magically empowered Spectre creates an energy overload which shatters space and time. The five Earths merge into a single shared universe, and the superheroes return to the present; only those present at the dawn of time remember the original realities. A cosmically empowered Anti-Monitor attacks again, transporting the new Earth to the antimatter universe and summoning a horde of shadow demons. He falls in a carefully planned counterattack, culminating in a battle with Kal-L (the Earth-Two Superman) Alexander Luthor of Earth-Three and Superboy of Earth- Prime, with help from New Gods adversary Darkseid. In this final battle the Anti-Monitor, reduced to a flaming head, crashes into a star and is killed by the Earth-Two Superman. As they are the only four who remember the original past, Alex sends Earth-Two Superman, Earth-Two Lois Lane, Earth-Prime Superboy and himself to a pocket \\"paradise\\" dimension, leaving the heroes of the remaining Earth to sort out the aftermath of this crisis. Reception Despite relatively limited marketing and DC being unsure if the series would be successful, Crisis on Infinite Earths was a bestseller. IGNs Hilary Goldstein summarized the series as \\"a crucial turning point for DC Comics\\" and credited it with saving the company. Goldstein called Wolfman's idea to simplify the DCU bold and unprecedented, noting the story's exceptional size and saying the story was \\"unbelievable\\", if somewhat aged. He also praised P√©rez's detailed artwork, saying no other artist could have possibly illustrated it as well as he did and gave the book a \\"must have\\" rating. Fellow IGN writer Jesse Schedeen named Crisis on Infinite Earths one of the best DC crossovers, agreeing it was unprecedented and dramatic. Marc Buxton of Comic Book Resources named \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" the greatest comic book crossover ever, saying that no crossover has been bigger or as ambitious: \\"where some events seem hesitant to actually leave a mark on their respective universes, Crisis did it with aplomb\\". He praised the series for exploring the entire DCU and felt it was a fitting event for DC's fiftieth anniversary. Nerdist News noted that many of the series' central events‚Äîsuch as the deaths of Supergirl and Barry Allen‚Äîhave become iconic moments in DC's history. Not all reviewers have been as positive. Chris Sims wrote the series was messy and built awkwardly, describing it as \\"a textbook definition of style over substance\\". Sims said it was far from the best work of Wolfman and P√©rez; however, he still thought it was groundbreaking, saying, \\"It's the first time in comics history that EVERYTHING was in danger\\". Merchandise A novelization of Crisis on Infinite Earths was written by Wolfman and published by iBooks in 2005, with cover art by P√©rez and Alex Ross. The book follows the events of the original series; most of the story is presented from Barry Allen's point of view, while parts where he is not present are told from a third-person perspective. It also added some details, including internal monologue and updates to make the story more modern, such as characters having cell phones. In 2008, WizKids issued a toy pack centered around the Anti- Monitor as a part of its DC HeroClix toy line. The pack came with a large Anti-Monitor figure with LED-lit eyes, several smaller figures, and a map. An exclusive variant, based on the Sinestro Corps, was available at the San Diego Comic-Con and Gen Con Indy conventions that year. DC Collectibles (then called DC Direct) released three series of action figures between 2005 and 2006. Based on the George Perez artwork, the figures had a base with the logo of the series and certain figures included an accessory. The first series included Earth 2 Robin, Harbinger, Monitor, Psycho-Pirate, and Supergirl. Later series included Anti Monitor, Earth 2 Superman, Flash, Battle Armor Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Earth 1 Batman, Doctor Light, Earth Prime Superboy, Earth 2 Huntress, and Weaponer of Qward. Legacy Though it was not the first large- scale comic book crossover, Crisis on Infinite Earths is generally credited with popularizing the idea. Comics historian Matthew K. Manning wrote that Crisis on Infinite Earths paved way for all future crossovers of similar scale, and Andrew J. Friedenthal said \\"Crisis showed the two major superhero comic book publishers (DC Comics and Marvel Comics) how they could utilize the continuity established by decades' worth of stories to weave together a cohesive, metatextual tapestry that both appealed to long-time readers and brought in massive amounts of money\\". The series' success inspired DC to begin a tradition of \\"summer crossovers\\"; some of these include Invasion! (1988‚Äì1989), Armageddon 2001 (1991), Zero Hour: Crisis in Time! (1994), and Identity Crisis (2004), and some mention the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths. The second part of one of DC's later crossovers, Convergence (2015), heavily references the series and sees DC's superheroes travel back to its era. The writers of Convergence all had fun writing stories set during Crisis on Infinite Earths, calling the series an exciting time for DC. The series had an immediate effect on DC, dividing the company's history into two eras: \\"Pre- Crisis\\" and \\"Post-Crisis\\". Wolfman and P√©rez teamed again to produce the History of the DC Universe limited series to summarize the DCU's new history. Many of DC's characters had their histories rebooted. Wonder Woman's comic was relaunched entirely by P√©rez, Wein, and Greg Potter. Superman was first re- envisioned in the limited series The Man of Steel by John Byrne; his comic was retitled The Adventures of Superman to make way for a new Superman series. Batman was minimally affected by the reboot, and his comic was not relaunched. However, he was still given an updated origin, courtesy of Frank Miller. In addition, Wally West replaced Barry Allen as the Flash, the Justice League's roster was changed, and characters DC acquired from other companies, such as Fawcett Publications and Charlton Comics, were integrated into the DCU. The practice of re-envisioning characters in the new DCU lasted well into 1989, with properties such as Green Lantern, Hawkman, Black Orchid, and the Suicide Squad all being rebooted. The revamp raised sales 22% in the first year, and DC beat Marvel in direct market sales for the first time in August and September 1987. The Man of Steel #1 was the bestselling comic book issue of 1986. Crisis on Infinite Earths has been referenced several times in the various television series that comprise the Arrowverse, starting with the first episode of The Flash which aired in October 2014. It features a newspaper from 2024 that reads \\"Flash Missing, Vanishes in Crisis\\". Grant Gustin, who plays the Flash on the show, has said he thinks the goal of the series is to reach \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\": \\"Obviously we'd have to go, I think 10 years to reach that, so there's a possibility for sure. It'll be fun to get there.\\" The concept of a multiverse has been explored several times throughout the history of the franchise. Talking in 2014, Geoff Johns, when discussing the difference between the DC Extended Universe and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, said \\"We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\\" The storyline inspired the 2019 Arrowverse crossover, also titled \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", with the original date seen in the pilot episode of The Flash having been moved up by five years as a side effect of time travel. Sequels Crisis on Infinite Earths is the first installment in what became known as the Crisis trilogy. The second part of the trilogy, the seven-part Infinite Crisis, was written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Phil Jimenez, P√©rez, Ivan Reis, and Jerry Ordway. It was published from October 2005 to June 2006, with a number of tie-in issues. In the series, Kal-L, Alexander Luthor, and Superboy-Prime escape from the pocket dimension they were left in at the end of the original series; Luthor, having gone insane, attempts to recreate the multiverse using the Anti-Monitor's corpse. Whereas Crisis on Infinite Earths discarded the DC Multiverse, Infinite Crisis restored it. The conclusion to the trilogy, Final Crisis, began in May 2008 and ended in January 2009. The series was written by Grant Morrison, with art by J. G. Jones, Carlos Pacheco, Marco Rudy, and Doug Mahnke. In Final Crisis, Darkseid arrives on Earth and begins a conquest to overthrow reality, as part of a plan by Libra to conquer the Multiverse. The Justice League and Green Lantern Corps join forces in a desperate attempt to stop the upcoming onslaught.

Today it includes a recreation of the original James Fort (c. 1607 to 1614), a Powhatan Native American Town, indoor and outdoor displays, and replicas of the original settlers' ships the Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery. It is located adjacent to Historic Jamestowne, on Jamestown Island, which is run in partnership by the National Park Service and the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation, a private nonprofit branch of Preservation Virginia dedicated to the archaeological mission. Historic Jamestowne is established in the original James Fort and Jamestown Colony, the first successful English settlement on the mainland of North America, founded on May 14, 1607. Colonial Williamsburg and The American Revolution Museum in Yorktown, additional living history sites, follow the next centennial of Virginian and American history up to the American Civil War. The Colonial Parkway connects all of these sites. The Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation is a Virginia state agency that administers the education aspects the Jamestown Settlement as well as the American Revolution Museum at Yorktown. Background Late in the 19th century, Jamestown became the focus of renewed historical interest and efforts at preservation. In 1893, a portion of the island was donated to Preservation VirginiaPreservation Virginia was formerly known as The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities. for that purpose, including the ruined church tower. In the early 1900s, a seawall was constructed with the intention of preserving the site around the original \\"James Fort\\", even though the actual location of the original 1607 fort was thought to be underwater and lost to erosion. In 1907, the Jamestown Exposition was held to mark the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, but the celebration was held at Sewell's Point in Norfolk, Virginia on the harbor of Hampton Roads, due to transportation and other considerations. The area came back into national prominence with the creation of the Colonial National Historical Park in 1940 and the uncovering of the old fort in 1996 by archaeologists of the Jamestown Rediscovery project. Jamestown Festival Park Exposition Hall built for the 350th anniversary in 1957 (since replaced for the 400th anniversary) A return to Jamestown itself was considered feasible by 1957, in time for the 350th anniversary of the founding of the London Company settlement at Jamestown. Attractions were developed by the US National Park Service and the Commonwealth of Virginia which included the reconstructed Glasshouse, the Memorial Cross, and the visitors center. The National Park Service's Colonial Parkway was also completed in April, 1957 linking the Historic Triangle of Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown, including the construction of a land bridge to Jamestown Island. The 1957 celebrations continued from April 1 to November 30 with more than one million participants, including dignitaries and politicians such as the British Ambassador and U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon. Full- sized replicas were constructed of the three ships that brought the colonists: the Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery. They were built at a shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia and relocated to nearby Glass House Point for the festival. There nearly 25,000 visitors at the Festival Park on October 16, 1957, and the highlight for many was the visit and speech of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. Queen Elizabeth lent a copy of Magna Carta for the exhibition. Other events in 1957 included army and navy reviews, air force fly-overs, ship and aircraft christenings, and an outdoor drama at Cape Henry, site of the first landing of the settlers in April 1607. 400th Anniversary Jamestown Settlement facilities and programs were greatly expanded early in the 21st century as part of the Jamestown 2007 quadricentennial celebration. A special exhibition named \\"The World of 1607\\" was created to showcase 17th century Virginia and featured rare artificats that were on loan from international collections and major museums. Additionally, new permanent exhibits were added while existing materials were refreshed and a new introductory film was added. Her majesty, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh were invited and attended the Jamestown Settlement on May 4, 2007 as part of a two day royal visit to Virginia. Their itinerary included visits to the state capital in Richmond, Virginia, Colonial Williamsburg, and Historic Jamestown. Approximately 1,200 invited guests, educational groups, and members of the community were in attendance. The celebration of Jamestown was held in Jamestown, Virginia.

It is the capital of the Loiret department and of the Centre-Val de Loire region. Orl√©ans is located on the Loire River where the river curves south towards the Massif Central. In 2017, the city had 116,685 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries. Orl√©ans is the center of Orl√©ans M√©tropole that has a population of 286,257, the 20th largest in France. The largest metropolitan area has a population of 444,681. √éle d'Orl√©ans in Quebec, Canada is named after Orleans in France as well as Orl√©ans, Ontario and the former French colony New Orleans, Louisiana. (French: La Nouvelle-Orl√©ans) Geography 270px Orl√©ans is located in the northern bend of the Loire, which crosses from east to west. Orl√©ans belongs to the vall√©e de la Loire sector between Sully-sur-Loire and Chalonnes-sur-Loire, which was in 2000 inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The capital of Orl√©anais, 120 kilometres southwest of Paris, is bordered to the north by the Beauce region, more specifically the Orl√©ans Forest (French: for√™t d'Orl√©ans) and Orl√©ans-la-Source neighbourhood, and the Sologne region to the south. Five bridges in the city cross the Loire River: Pont de l'Europe, Pont du Mar√©chal Joffre (also called Pont Neuf), Pont George-V (also called Pont Royal, carrying the commune tramway), Pont Ren√©-Thinat and Pont de Vierzon (rail bridge). 270px To the north of the Loire (rive droite) is to be found a small hill ( at the pont Georges-V, at the Place du Martroi) which gently rises to at la Croix Fleury, at the limits of Fleury-les-Aubrais. Conversely, the south (on the rive gauche) has a gentle depression to about above sea level (at Saint-Marceau) between the Loire and the Loiret, designated a \\"zone inondable\\" (flood-risk zone). At the end of the 1960s, the Orl√©ans-la-Source neighbourhood was created, to the south of the original commune and separated from it by the Val d'Orl√©ans and the Loiret River (whose source is in the Parc Floral de la Source). This quarter's altitude varies from about . =The Loire and navigation= In Orl√©ans, the Loire is separated by a submerged dike known as the dhuis into the Grande Loire to the north, no longer navigable, and the Petite Loire to the south. This dike is just one part of a vast system of construction that previously allowed the Loire to remain navigable to this point. The Loire was formerly an important navigation and trading route. With the increase in size of ocean-going ships, large ships can now navigate the estuary only up to about Nantes. Boats on the river were traditionally flat-bottomed boats, with large but foldable masts so the sails could gather wind from above the river banks, but the masts could be lowered in order to allow the boats to pass under bridges. these vessels are known as gabarre, futreau, and so on, and may be viewed by tourists near pont Royal. The river's irregular flow strongly limits traffic on it, in particular at its ascent, though this can be overcome by boats being given a tow. 400px An Inexplosible-type paddle steamer owned by the mairie was put in place in August 2007, facing Place de la Loire and containing a bar. Every two years, the Festival de Loire recalls the role played by the river in the commune's history. On the river's north bank, near the town centre, is the Canal d'Orl√©ans, which connects to the Canal du Loing and the Canal de Briare at Buges near Montargis. The canal is no longer used along its whole length. Its route within Orl√©ans runs parallel to the river, separated from it by a wall or muret, with a promenade along the top. Its last pound was transformed into an outdoor swimming pool in the 1960s, then filled in. It was reopened in 2007 for the \\"f√™tes de Loire.\\" There are plans to revive use of the canal for recreation and install a pleasure-boat port there. =Climate= Orl√©ans experiences an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfb), similar to much of central France. History =Prehistory and Roman Empire= :See also Cenabum, Aureliana Civitas. Cenabum was a Gallic stronghold, one of the principal towns of the tribe of the Carnutes where the Druids held their annual assembly. The Carnutes were massacred and the city was destroyed by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, then a new city was built on its ruins by settlers from the gens Aurelia who named the city, civitas Aurelianorum (\\"city of the Aurelii\\"), after themselves. The name later evolved into Orl√©ans.For an exact etymology, see Cenabum, Aurelianis, Orl√©ans de Jacques Debal (Coll. Galliae civitates, Lyon, PUL, 1996) In 442 Flavius Aetius, the Roman commander in Gaul, requested Goar, head of the Iranian tribe of Alans in the region to come to Orleans and control the rebellious natives and the Visigoths. Accompanying the Vandals, the Alans crossed the Loire in 408. One of their groups, under Goar, joined the Roman forces of Flavius Aetius to fight Attila when he invaded Gaul in 451, taking part in the Battle of Ch√¢lons under their king Sangiban. Goar established his capital in Orl√©ans. His successors later took possession of the estates in the region between Orl√©ans and Paris. Installed in Orl√©ans and along the Loire, they were unruly (killing the town's senators when they felt they had been paid too slowly or too little) and resented by the local inhabitants. Many inhabitants around the present city have names bearing witness to the Alan presence ‚Äì Allaines. Also many places in the region bear names of Alan origin.marres.education. Accessed January 2016. =Early Middle Ages= In the Merovingian era, the city was capital of the Kingdom of Orl√©ans following Clovis I's division of the kingdom, then under the Capetians it became the capital of a county then duchy held in appanage by the house of Valois-Orl√©ans. The Valois-Orl√©ans family later acceded to the throne of France via Louis XII then Francis I. In 1108, one of the few consecrations of a French monarch to occur outside of Reims occurred at Orl√©ans, when Louis VI of France was consecrated in Orl√©ans cathedral by Daimbert, archbishop of Sens. =High Middle Ages= Orl√©ans in September 1428, the time of the Siege of Orl√©ans. The city was always a strategic point on the Loire, for it was sited at the river's most northerly point, and thus its closest point to Paris. There were few bridges over the dangerous river Loire, but Orl√©ans had one of them, and so became ‚Äì with Rouen and Paris ‚Äì one of medieval France's three richest cities. 15th-century depiction of the French troops attacking an English fort at the siege of Orl√©ans On the south bank the \\"ch√¢telet des Tourelles\\" protected access to the bridge. This was the site of the battle on 8 May 1429 which allowed Joan of Arc to enter and lift the siege of the Plantagenets during the Hundred Years' War, with the help of the royal generals Dunois and Florent d'Illiers. The city's inhabitants have continued to remain faithful and grateful to her to this day, calling her \\"la pucelle d'Orl√©ans\\" (the maid of Orl√©ans), offering her a middle-class house in the city, and contributing to her ransom when she was taken prisoner. Statue of Joan of Arc, Place du Martroi =1453 to 1699= Aurelia Franciae civitas ad Ligeri flu. sita (1581) The Renaissance H√¥tel Groslot Once the Hundred Years' War was over, the city recovered its former prosperity. The bridge brought in tolls and taxes, as did the merchants passing through the city. King Louis XI also greatly contributed to its prosperity, revitalising agriculture in the surrounding area (particularly the exceptionally fertile land around Beauce) and relaunching saffron farming at Pithiviers. Later, during the Renaissance, the city benefited from its becoming fashionable for rich ch√¢telains to travel along the Loire valley (a fashion begun by the king himself, whose royal domains included the nearby ch√¢teaus at Chambord, Amboise, Blois, and Chenonceau). The University of Orl√©ans also contributed to the city's prestige. Specializing in law, it was highly regarded throughout Europe. John Calvin was received and accommodated there (and wrote part of his reforming theses during his stay), and in return Henry VIII of England (who had drawn on Calvin's work in his separation from Rome) offered to fund a scholarship at the university. Many other Protestants were sheltered by the city. Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known by his pseudonym Moli√®re, also studied law at the University, but was expelled for attending a carnival contrary to university rules. From 13 December 1560 to 31 January 1561, the French States-General after the death of Francis II of France, the eldest son of Catherine de M√©dicis and Henry II. He died in the H√¥tel Groslot in Orl√©ans, with his queen Mary at his side. The cathedral was rebuilt several times. The present structure had its first stone laid by Henry IV, and work on it took a century. It thus is a mix of late Renaissance and early Louis XIV styles, and one of the last cathedrals to be built in France. =1700‚Äì1900= When France colonised America, the territory it conquered was immense, including the whole Mississippi River (whose first European name was the River Colbert), from its mouth to its source at the borders of Canada. Its capital was named la Nouvelle-Orl√©ans in honour of Louis XV's regent, the duke of Orl√©ans, and was settled with French inhabitants against the threat from British troops to the north-east. The Dukes of Orl√©ans hardly ever visited their city since, as brothers or cousins of the king, they took such a major role in court life that they could hardly ever leave. The duchy of Orl√©ans was the largest of the French duchies, starting at Arpajon, continuing to Chartres, Vend√¥me, Blois, Vierzon, and Montargis. The duke's son bore the title duke of Chartres. Inheritances from great families and marriage alliances allowed them to accumulate huge wealth, and one of them, Philippe √âgalit√©, is sometimes said to have been the richest man in the world at the time. His son, King Louis- Philippe I, inherited the Penthi√®vre and Cond√© family fortunes. 1852 saw the creation of the Compagnies ferroviaires Paris-Orl√©ans and its famous gare d'Orsay in Paris. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the city again became strategically important thanks to its geographical position, and was occupied by the Prussians on 13 October that year. The arm√©e de la Loire was formed under the orders of General d'Aurelle de Paladines and based itself not far from Orl√©ans at Beauce. =1900 to present= US Army medics in Orl√©ans, 1944 During the Second World War, the German army made the Orl√©ans Fleury-les- Aubrais railway station one of their central logistical rail hubs. The Pont Georges V was renamed \\"pont des Tourelles\\".World-wide current events of 16 May 1941, available on the site of the INA (direct link). A transit camp for deportees was built at Beaune-la-Rolande. During the Liberation, the American Air Force heavily bombed the city and the train station, causing much damage. The city was one of the first to be rebuilt after the war: the reconstruction plan and city improvement initiated by Jean K√©risel and Jean Royer was adopted as early as 1943, and work began as early as the start of 1945. This reconstruction in part identically reproduced what had been lost, such as Royale and its arcades, but also used innovative prefabrication techniques, such as √Ælot 4 under the direction of the architect Pol Abraham.Joseph Abram, L'architecture moderne en France, du chaos √† la croissance, tome 2, √©d. Picard, 1999, pp. 28 et 37‚Äì38 The big city of former times is today an average-sized city of 250,000 inhabitants. It is still using its strategically central position less than an hour from the French capital to attract businesses interested in reducing transport costs. =Heraldry= According to Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun in La France Illustr√©e, 1882, Orl√©ans's arms are \\"gules, three caillous in c≈ìurs de lys argent, and on a chief azure, three fleurs de lys Or.\\" Charle Grandmaison, in the Dictionnaire H√©raldique of 1861, states that it is \\"Or, with three hearts in gules\\", without the chief of France. Sometimes, in faulty designs, we find it described \\"gules, three fleurs de lys argent, and on a chief azure three fleurs de lys Or.\\"Grand Larousse encyclop√©dique in 10 volumes, 163 The design shown left shows 3 \\"c≈ìurs de lys\\" (heart of a lily), seen from above. This \\"c≈ìurs de lys\\" is therefore not a true lily, which would have 6 tepals, but a hypothetical aerial view of a symbolic lily. It has probably also been stylised more and more in heraldry, as in the heart in a pack of cards. Certain authors solve the problem by calling this symbol a \\"tiercefeuille\\", defined as a stemless clover leaf, with one leaf at the top and two below, thus making this coat of arms \\"gules, with three reversed tiercefeuilles in argent, etc\\". =Motto= \\"Hoc vernant lilia corde\\" (granted by Louis XII, then duke of Orl√©ans), meaning \\"It is by this heart that lilies flourish\\" or \\"This heart makes lilies flourish\\", referring to the fleur de lys, symbol of the French royal family.

It was built in the 14th century. It can be seen through a window in the subterranean car-park under the square, or visited under certain conditions. * The rue de Bourgogne and surrounding streets, Orl√©ans' main street since the Antiquity, it's the former Roman decumanus, crossing the city from east to west. Joan of Arc entered the city in 1429 by the \\"Bourgogne\\" gatehouse situated at its Easter end. Until today it is still giving access to the \\"Prefecture\\", where the \\"Prefet\\" (officer who represents the French State in the Region) lives, many pubs, night clubs, restaurants and shops such as the \\"Galeries Lafayette\\". It is more than a mile long. One can admire many medieval houses on its sides. * The Tour Blanche / White Tower, it is one of the only medieval defensive towers remaining in the city (still in use at the time of the Siege of Orl√©ans). It nowadays houses city's archaeological department. * The Docks, (Port of Orl√©ans) once the most important inland port of France (18th century). While boats could not sail on the river Seine because of the windings, they could sail to Orl√©ans on the Loire river with the wind in their back. Then the merchandise was brought to Paris by roadways. Wine, and sugar from the colonies, were shipped to Orl√©ans where they were stored and refined. Vinegar is still a city' speciality due to the lapsing of wine stocks during the shipment. One can admire the old pavement of the docks (18th and 19th centuries) on the north bank of the river in the city and on the island in the middle, that was used to channel the water * The H√¥pital Madeleine (former hospital), built by King Louis XIV (18th century) and his successors (notably an important part of the 18th century). * Saint-Charles chapel, located within the grounds of the Madeleine Hospital, it was built in 1713 by Jacques V Gabriel, one of Louis XIV architects. * The H√¥tel Cabu, otherwise named house of Diane de Poitiers, built at the behest of Philippe Cabu, barrister, in 1547, famous architect Jacques Ier Androuet du Cerceau providing the plans. * The H√¥tel Hatte, 16th century. Today's Charles- P√©guy Center. * The H√¥tel Toutin, 16th century * The H√¥tel Pommeret d'Orl√©ans, 16th century * The H√¥tel Ducerceau, 16th century *The maison de la coquille, 16th century * The H√¥tel des Cr√©neaux, former city hall, flanked by its bell tower (15th century). It nowadays houses the city's school of music. This is a magnificent piece of late gothic secular architecture (15th century) that reminds the famous and much more recent Parisian city hall. * The House of Jean Dalibert, 16th century * The Study of Jacques Bouchet (16th century), which can be admired from the public square \\"Jacques Bouchet\\" * The mansions, rue d'Escure (17th and 18th centuries) * The \\"Pr√©fecture\\" : former Benedictine monastery, built in 1670 and housing the \\"Pr√©fecture du Loiret\\" since 1800. * The Pont de l'Europe, designed by Santiago Calatrava, is an inclined bow- string ark bridge particularly original. * The Pont Royal / George V Royal bridge, the oldest bridge of the city. Built between 1751 and 1760, at the request of Daniel-Charles Trudaine, administrator and civil engineer. It was renamed in honour of King George V after the World War II out of respect of Britain's role in the war. * The Pont des Tourelles, built in 1140 and demolished in 1760, was the first stone-made bridge of Orl√©ans. When the river Loire is low, one can see remains of it in the water * The Palais √©piscopal d'Orl√©ans, former Bishop's Palace. It was built between 1635 and 1641. Napol√©on stayed there. It is nowadays housing the international center for research, part of University of Orl√©ans. * The courthouse (18th to 20th centuries) * The \\"salle de l'Institut\\", located on the \\"place Sainte Croix\\", is a small concert hall which can be converted into a ballroom. Its acoustics are remarkable. * Mansions, rue de la Bretonnerie. This street concentrates many particular mansions, of all styles and ages (15th to 20th centuries).

The historical center dating back to the 15th century extends far beyond the limits of the pedestrian sector that has been extensively restored in the past few years. In fact it corresponds to the portion of the modern city which is enclosed by the Boulevards. Many historical monuments remain in the non- pedestrian sectors of the city (for example, at rue Notre-Dame-de-Recouvrance, at rue des Carmes, at rue de la Bretonnerie, at Square Saint-Aignan).
