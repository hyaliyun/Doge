Nagar Panchayat Pipri Chairman-Digvijay Pratap Singh Rihand Dam Rihand Dam (Hindi: रिहन्द बांध) is a concrete gravity dam located at Pipri in Sonbhadra District in Uttar Pradesh, India. Its reservoir area is on the border of Madhya pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. This reservoir is known as Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar. It is on the Rihand River, which is the tributary of the Son River. The catchment area of this dam is spread in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh, where it supplies irrigation water in Bihar located in the downstream of the river. Specifications Rihand dam is a concrete gravity dam with a length of 934.21 m. The maximum height of the dam is 91.44 m and was constructed during period 1954-62. The dam comprises 61 independent blocks and ground joints. The powerhouse is situated at the toe of the dam, with installed capacity of 300 MW (6 units of 50 MW each). The Intake Structure is situated between blocks no. 28 to 33. The Dam is in distress condition. It is proposed to carry out the rehabilitation works in the dam and the powerhouse.[3] The F.R.L. of the dam is 268.22 m and it impounds 8.6 Million Acre ft of water. It is one of the biggest reservoir by its gross storage capacity in India but sufficient water is not flowing in to the reservoir. The construction of the dam resulted in forced relocation of nearly 100,000 people [4] Many super thermal power stations are located in the catchment area of the dam. These are Singrauli, Vindyachal, Rihand, Anpara & Sasan super thermal power stations and Renukoot thermal station. The high alkalinity run off water from the ash dumps (some are located in the reservoir area) of these coal-fired power stations ultimately collects in this reservoir enhancing its water alkalinity and pH. Using high alkalinity water for irrigation converts the agriculture fields in to fallow Alkali soils.

He served as the president of Arkansas Holiness and Peniel College, editor of the Herald of Holiness, and general superintendent in the Church of the Nazarene.  Early life and education  Chapman was born 1884 in Yale, Illinois, the second son and fifth child of Marinda and Thomas Smith Chapman.https://sail.cnu.edu/omeka/files/original/71f1570afa7fda763c2aad74573e058c.pdf The family moved to Oklahoma when he was fourteen years old, where he was converted to Christianity in 1899. Chapman's first academic instructor was his wife, a schoolteacher. When he took a pastorate at Vilonia, Arkansas, in 1908, he enrolled at the Arkansas Holiness College there at age 24. After graduating in 1910, he left to pursue further study at Texas Holiness University in Peniel, Texas, under president Roy T. Williams, where he received his Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1913. Peniel College later awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree in 1918, and Pasadena College did the same in 1927.Spirit-Filled: The Life of James Blaine Chapman by David Shelby Corlett, Kansas City: Beacon Hill Press  Career  He began to preach at the age of sixteen, uniting with the World's Faith Missionary Association of Shenandoah, Iowa, and then the Texas Holiness Association before forming his own Independent Holiness Church. He married Maud Frederick in 1903, at the church's first annual convention. His first pastorate was a church in Durant, in Indian Territory, which he organized in 1905 and would become part of the Holiness Church of Christ, but he also became pastor of a church in Pilot Point, Texas, in 1907, for which he left Durant in 1908. That same year the Holiness Church of Christ joined the Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene, and Chapman moved again, this time to a pastorate at Vilonia, Arkansas. He left in 1911 after graduating from Arkansas Holiness College to pursue further education at Texas Holiness University. His only other pastorate would later be at Bethany, Oklahoma, from 1918 to 1919. After enrolling at Peniel in 1910, Chapman instead became president of the Arkansas Holiness College, but returned to Peniel University in 1912 to teach there and became dean of the college upon his arrival. After he graduated with his Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1913, President Williams resigned and the college named Chapman president until 1918. At the time Chapman took the presidency, Peniel was ranked behind Asbury College and Taylor University as the third-best holiness college in the nation, but it eventually closed in 1920 to lend support to Oklahoma Nazarene College instead. As an educator, Chapman aided the General Board of Education of the Church of the Nazarene to establish educational policy. Chapman is quoted as having said: > It was originally the plan to call every school we started a “university”... > It was our ultimate aim to have universities and our schools were named > according to our vision of future developments. But I am, personally, > convinced that we should definitely abandon the idea of building any > universities, that we should drop these names from our schools... > [Moreover,] it is my conclusion that we... cannot permanently maintain > academies and they do not meet our need, that a special Bible school does > not meet our needs and that we should express ourselves on this > conviction....

In an o-ring boss (abbreviated ORB) system, a male-threaded part is inserted into a female-threaded part, providing a mechanical seal. This system differs from others in that an additional nut is tightened over an o-ring into a chamfered area, creating a fluid-tight seal. This system is used most frequently in hydraulics, although it has been applied to other systems including compressed air systems and vacuum pumps, such as many Robinair pumps, in which the intake tee has an o-ring boss seal on the bottom. The ORB system can be confused with other connection systems, such as NPT. While threads of different connectors sometimes fit (although often very inexactly), o-ring boss seal system connectors should never be used with any other type of connectors and vice versa, as leaks are likely. Under the high fluid pressures commonly seen in hydraulic systems, a leak or failure of the connection is quite dangerous and could lead to loss of life. This system has the advantage of being able to be tightened mechanically before being sealed. Most threaded systems, such as NPT, have a seal provided by a taper in the thread, so it is difficult to orient both ends of the hose, pipe or tube so that it is not twisted. In the o-ring boss system, this problem is eliminated because the threads do not seal the connection and therefore can be rotated at least a full revolution before they are sealed while maintaining a proper mechanical connection. The orientation problem could also be solved with a suitable union.

This bureau shall be made up of those administrative law judges, supervisors and clerical personnel assigned by the commissioner to carry out the provisions of article 2-A of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and this Subchapter.\\" Proceedings The TVB conducts its proceedings according to the Administrative Adjudication of Traffic Violations regulations in the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations. The National Motorists Association assists motorists and offers attorney referrals to motorists appearing before the TVB. The DMV TVB is an administrative court that is not part of the judiciary, but an executive agency with different procedures regarding elements ranging from rules of evidence to threshold for conviction. The function of the judge is carried out by an administrative law judge, or ALJ. The sole options are to plead guilty or not guilty: plea bargains are not conducted, nor can the judge reduce a charge, only rule guilty or not guilty on the stated charge. After a guilty finding, the DMV ALJ may impose any penalty authorized by the Vehicle and Traffic Law, including suspension or revocation of a driver's license and/or motor vehicle registration, but not including imprisonment.15 NYCRR § 124.7 There is no absolute right to a supporting deposition, and rules on admissibility of hearsay evidence are far more lax than in court. Typically, the hearing consists simply of each side presenting its story, the allowance of hearsay negating the necessity of formalities such as sworn witnesses and the like. Administrative appeals are made to the DMV Motor Vehicle Appeals Board.15 NYCRR § 126.1 There is a fee of $10 for the appeal and $50 for the transcript that must be ordered.15 NYCRR § 126.2 Judicial review of the appeal is made under article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules,Vehicle and Traffic Law § 22815 NYCRR § 126.5 which is equivalent to a writ or order of certiorari, mandamus and/or prohibition.Civil Practice Law and Rules § 7801 Criticisms Because the rules of evidence, specifically the right of discovery and the admissibility of hearsay, are more lax than in normal court, the TVB system has often been characterized as a difficult or biased one. The absence of an option to plead to reduced charges, traditionally a staple of traffic court, has been especially criticized. The threshold of conviction is \\"clear and convincing evidence\\", in contrast to the general definition of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a lower standard, making conviction easier. Conversely, the argument has been made that the more streamlined process, coupled with the judge being an expert on traffic law, makes for a fairer trial. The concept of administration adjudication was upheld by New York State's highest court, the Court of Appeals, in Rosenthal v. Hartnett, (1975). The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles has in the past noted that a 65% conviction rate is required to maintain the financial viability of the Traffic Violations Bureau System (Source: New York State Bar Association Committee on Administrative Adjudication). History The TVB is authorized by Vehicle and Traffic Law article 2-A, which was created by chapter 1074 of the laws of 1969 (enacted May 26, 1969, effective July 1, 1970) under Governor Rockefeller. The rationale behind the establishment of this office was to offload the large volume of such cases from the New York City Criminal Court, and also authorized local parking violations bureaus. Effective April 1, 2013, the Suffolk County Traffic and Parking Violations Agency began adjudicating parking summonses, red light camera citations and moving violations in the five western towns of Suffolk County. Effective July 1, 2015, the Buffalo TVB closed. Effective April 21, 2018 the Rochester TVB closed.

It is loosely based on the 1981 science fiction novel of the same name by Craig Harrison.DVD Talk Other sources of inspiration have been suggested: the 1954 novel I Am Legend, Dawn of the Dead, and especially the 1959 film The World, the Flesh and the Devil, of which it has been called an unofficial remake. Plot July 5 begins as a normal winter morning near Hamilton, New Zealand. At 6:12 a.m., the sun darkens for a moment, and a red light surrounded by darkness is briefly seen. Zac Hobson (Bruno Lawrence) is a scientist employed by Delenco, part of an international consortium working on \\"Project Flashlight\\", an experiment to create a global energy grid. He awakens abruptly; when he turns on his radio, he is unable to receive any transmissions. He gets dressed and drives into the deserted city. Investigating a fire, he discovers the wreckage of a passenger jet, but there are no bodies, only empty seats. Zac enters his laboratory but fails to contact any of the other labs around the world. Descending to an underground lab, he discovers the dead body of a colleague at a control panel; a monitor displays the message \\"Project Flashlight Complete\\". The mass disappearance seems to coincide with the moment Flashlight was activated. The lab is suddenly and automatically sealed because of radiation, so he improvises a bomb to free himself. He listens to his own voice on a tape recorder describing the project as having \\"phenomenal destructive potential\\", then notes: \\"Zac Hobson, July 5th. One: there has been a malfunction in Project Flashlight with devastating results. Two: it seems I am the only person left on Earth.\\" From this point onward, he refers to the crucial moment and its result as \\"The Effect\\". After a week of vain attempts to contact another human being, Zac moves into a mansion and acquires numerous goods from a mall, but his mental state begins to deteriorate. He puts on a woman's night gown and alternates between exhilaration and despair. He assembles cardboard cutouts of famous people (including Adolf Hitler, Elizabeth II, and Pope John Paul II), plays a loud fanfare and cheers from large speakers, and addresses the cutouts from a balcony. He declares himself \\"President of this Quiet Earth\\", then goes on a destructive rampage after the power blacks out. He bursts into a church, shoots a statue of Jesus off a crucifix, and announces that he is God. After accidentally crushing an empty pram with an enormous earthmover, he puts the barrel of a shotgun into his mouth but finally comes to his senses. Zac settles into a more normal routine. One morning, a young woman named Joanne (Alison Routledge) appears. Zac is attracted to her, and after a few days together they have sex. They scour the city and find a third survivor, a large Māori man named Api (Pete Smith). The three determine why they survived: at the instant of The Effect, they were all at the moment of death: Api was being drowned in a fight, Joanne was electrocuted by a faulty hairdryer, and Zac had overdosed on pills in a suicide attempt. He had realized the experiment posed serious dangers and was guilt-ridden for not speaking out. A love triangle develops, but Zac is more concerned about his observations: universal physical constants are changing, causing the Sun's output to fluctuate. Zac fears The Effect will occur again and decides to destroy the Delenco facility in an attempt to stop it. The three put aside their personal conflicts and drive a truckload of explosives to the installation, only to be stopped at the perimeter when Zac detects dangerous levels of ionising radiation emanating from the plant. He says that he will go to town to retrieve a remote control device that will allow them to send the truck into the facility. While Zac is gone, Joanne and Api have sex. Afterward, Api tells Joanne that he will sacrifice himself by driving the truck; he doubts that Zac's device will be capable of controlling the vehicle. They then hear the truck and realise that Zac did not go to town after all. He drives the truck onto the weakened roof of the underground portion of the laboratory, which collapses. Just as the effect reaches a maximum, he triggers the explosives. Once again a red light is seen surrounded by the dark tunnel. Zac finds himself lying face down on a beach. There are strange cloud formations, resembling waterspouts, rising out of the ocean. As he walks to the water's edge, an enormous ringed planet slowly appears over the horizon. Analysis The precise meaning of the final scene is left to the audience. In his commentary on the Umbrella Entertainment DVD release, writer/producer Sam Pillsbury states, \\"...we all thought it was quite simple; I mean, our intention was just that, what happened was, he died at the moment of the effect for a second time and he's now found himself in another world, what the hell's he gonna do...\\", he then says, more or less jokingly, that director Geoff Murphy being \\"a Catholic or lapsed Catholic, [it] may well have been something to do with purgatory, and y'know, you being trapped in cyclical and going back into having to relive your thing until you work out your karma, [something; possibly 'if I'm not'] mixing my metaphors; anyway, enigmatic is good, I think, to a certain extent...\\" Cast * Bruno Lawrence as Zac Hobson * Alison Routledge as Joanne * Pete Smith as Api Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that five of eight surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.2/10. Walter Goodman of The New York Times wrote, \\"...it's easy to watch most of the time and never positively painful.\\"New York Times Variety wrote, \\"One of New Zealand's top directors, Geoff Murphy has taken a man-alone theme and turned it imaginatively to strong and refreshing effect in The Quiet Earth.\\" Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times called Lawrence's screen presence \\"electrifying\\". It has since become a cult film. In 2014, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson named it one of his favorite science fiction films. The film placed tenth in a 2014 public poll by Stuff.co.nz of the best New Zealand films of all time.

Rugby union is considered one of the most popular sport in Georgia.  Governing body  The governing body for rugby union in Georgia is the Georgia Rugby Union. It was founded in 1961 (as a domestic body) and became an official affiliate to the International Rugby Board (IRB) in 1992.Bath p67 History Prehistory Like some other rugby playing nations, the popularity of the game in Georgia can be traced back to a pre-existing Georgian folk sport, called lelo or Lelo Burti (meaning literally in Georgian \\"Field Ball\\"), which is a full contact ball game, and very similar to rugby.Richards Chapter 1 Fons et Origo, p27; Chapter 15 Going Forward, p291 In fact, even within Georgian rugby terminology, the word lelo is used to mean a try. Lelo was played in Georgia from ancient times and is still played on occasions in rural areas. A field (\\"Lelo\\") was selected between two river creeks which represented a playing ground. Two teams, usually consisting of the male population of neighboring villages, would face each other, with the local priest acting as the referee. The number of players from each side was not set, but included any able men each village could summon. A large, heavy ball was placed in the middle of the field and the goal of the game was to carry it over the river creek of the opposing side. Soviet period During the Soviet period, the Georgians regularly had six or seven players in the USSR side, before the break-up, as well as supplying the Soviet club champion, Dinamo Tbilisi. Rugby has been played in Georgia since the 1930s, possibly earlier, but its first official test was against a touring Zimbabwe side. There were several unsuccessful attempts to introduce rugby into Georgia, the earliest known being in 1928, with subsequent attempts also in 1940 and in 1948. Rugby was introduced to Georgia by Jacques Haspekian, an Armenian man from Marseille in France who taught the game to students in the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, although he then subsequently returned in France. He is still alive and living in Marseille, he was interviewed on French radio on the occasion of Georgia playing France in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The very first rugby session was held on October 15, 1959 in Tbilisi, at the racecourse, where 20 people attended the meeting. The first Georgian club formed was the GPI (Georgian Polytechnical Institute), now known as \\"Qochebi\\". In 1961, a three team domestic competition was formed, called the Tbilisi Championship. The following year the first match between a Georgian team and a Russian team took place, with Trud Moscow defeating the Georgian club. That year Georgian clubs also went on their first tours, going to Russia and Latvia. In 1962, the first Soviet Trade-Union tournament was held. In the same year, ten new rugby teams were established in Georgia.Louis, p39 In 1964 the Tbilisi Rugby Section became known as the Georgia Rugby Federation. From the mid-1960s, the Soviet Championship and the Soviet Cup were introduced for competitive club competition between Soviet rugby clubs, with the first competition being held in 1966. The Georgian clubs were formed as regional selections fed by student teams. The best players would go on to make the USSR team. A Moscow team won the first Soviet Championship, though Dynamo from Tbilisi came in second place. In 1967 a French trade-union selection visited Georgia. It would not be until 1978, in the Soviet Cup (which was introduced in 1976) that a Georgian team would finish first, which was Locomotivi from Tbilisi. Georgian teams dominated the Soviet Championship and the Soviet Cup in the late 1980s with Kutaisi winning the championship in 1987 and 1988 and RC AIA Kutaisi winning in 1989 and 1990. In 1988 Georgia produced their first national sevens side. Post-independence The break- up of the Soviet Union led to a civil war, which helped set back the game greatly, and the recent Russian conflict with Georgia has also set it on a back foot. Half of all Soviet clubs were in Georgia.Richards, Chapter 14 Journeys without Maps, p260 The Georgians applied for associate membership of the IRB in 1990, but were turned down. It took two years for the IRB to admit them in 1990, after consultation with the Soviet Federation. The following year, Georgia played their first international match, against Zimbabwe, and won 16 to 3. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia formed their own national team (though a CIS team played in the early 1990s) and applied for International Rugby Football Board (now, International Rugby Board) membership. In 1993 the IFRB accepted Georgia as a federation member, making them the 52nd member. In 1997, New Zealand coach Ross Meurant found the national team had only two practice balls, when he went to advise the Georgia Under-19 squad. This was typical of the lack of resources that the Georgians faced. Meurant said that the tackle bags that they were using were improvised: :\\"They were of denim material, obviously stitched together on a domestic sewing machine and stuffed with rubber.\\" The wife of another coach had stayed up half the night making them. This was not atypical. In the early 1990s, the Georgians had converted old Soviet era tractors into scrum machines. In 1994 the Gumari were formed, being the Georgian Barbarians, and they went on to tour France. The following year saw the inauguration of the Sini competition. Their 1998 loss to Romania saw Georgia face Tonga in a repechage match to enter the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales. Georgia lost and thus did not make it to the World Cup. Though in 2001 they won the European Nations Cup, and became the 7th highest ranked team in Europe. They subsequently got through the qualifying stages for the next World Cup, and made it to Australia for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. They also qualified for the 2007 World Cup and went on to win their first World Cup match. Crowds as large as 10-15,000 regularly attend local derbies in Tbilisi. As Georgia is a member of the Council of Europe, this gives Georgians employment rights within France, and many Georgian players are now based there.Richards, Chapter 14 Journeys without Maps, p270 For example, in the qualifiers for the 2007 Rugby World Cup against Ireland, 18 of 25 players on the squad were based in France. Notable players include Georgi Shkinin, and captain Ilia Zedginidze who was considered something of a Renaissance Man in World Cup rugby as a talented international lawyer with the ability to speak several languages fluently.Richards, Chapter 14 Journeys without Maps, p271  Competitions  The Didi 10, and Georgia Cup(till 2011) are the domestic rugby union club competitions in Georgia. Since most of the Georgian internationals play in France, its quality level does not match the popularity of rugby union across the country. This explains why Georgian clubs are still absent from the major team competitions in Europe, both the Heineken Cup and the European Challenge Cup.  Popularity  Rugby union is one of the most popular sports in Georgia. Rugby is especially popular in the south of the country where the game is more popular than association football. The popularity of rugby union largely took off after the Georgia Rugby Union's inception into the IRB. This has seen rugby union become a major spectator sport. There are currently 2866 registered male players in Georgia according to the International Rugby Board. When Georgia played Russia in the European Nations Cup, 65,000 people crammed into the national stadium in Tbilisi and another 44,000 watched Georgia beat Russia 17–13.  National team  The Lelos (as they are nicknamed) are the national rugby union team of Georgia. The team's name comes from lelo, an indigenous Georgian sport with strong similarities to rugby. Lelo has been adopted as the Georgian word for \\"try\\". One standard cheer of Georgian rugby union fans is Lelo, Lelo, Sakartvelo (Try, Try, Georgia). The Lelos participate in the European Nations Cup, which is a second-level competition for European national teams. The majority of the national side are based in France, in the lower divisions, having been sent there to improve their rugby skills and facilitate their development by coach Claude Saurel.  World Cup  Ireland playing Georgia in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Prior to the 2003 Rugby World Cup, Georgia had failed to qualify for any previous tournaments, despite coming close in 1999 after losing a two legged repechage play-off against Tonga. On that occasion Georgia lost the first leg 37-6 in Nukualofa before recording a 28-27 win in Tbilisi. Georgia then bounced back to defeat Russia 17-13 to qualify for the subsequent 2003 Rugby World Cup. They lost all four of their matches but impressed against South Africa. Despite the poor financial state of the Georgia Rugby Union, qualification has seen the sport's profile enjoy a huge rise in popularity throughout Georgia.Their best performance was in 2015 tournament, when they were drawn against eventual world champions New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and Namibia. Georgia won games against Tonga and Namibia, finished third in the group and automatically qualified for 2019 Rugby World Cup.  European Nations Cup  The European Nations Cup is a second-level competition for tier-two European nations. Initially started as a one-year competition, the championship is now decided over two years with each team playing each other on a home and away basis. Georgia have won the competition on eight occasions, in 2001, 2008-9 and 2011-15.  The Antim Cup  The Antim Cup is contested between Georgia and Romania. The cup is contested each time Georgia and Romania meet in a senior international match other than World Cup matches or qualifiers. The holder retains the cup unless the challenger wins the match in normal time. It is named after the Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan Antim Iverianul, who came from Georgia.

The system used a photoelectric recording method and a non-standard film size (42mm) which incorporated the sound track with stock 35mm film. With a Swiss backer, the inventors formed Tri-Ergon AG in Zurich, and tried to interest the market with their invention. Ufa acquired the German sound film rights for the Tri-Ergon process in 1925, but dropped the system when the public showing of their first sound film suffered technical failures. The Tri-Ergon system appeared at a time when a number of other sound film processes were arriving on the market, and the company soon merged with a number of competitors to form the Tobis syndicate in 1928, joined by the Klangfilm AG syndicate in 1929 and renamed as Tobis-Klangfilm by 1930. While Tri-Ergon became the dominant sound film process in Germany and much of Europe through its use by Tobis-Klangfilm, American film companies were still squabbling over their respective patents. For a time Tri-Ergon successfully blocked all American attempts to show their sound films in Germany and other European countries, until a loose cartel was formed under an agreement in Paris in 1930. However, William Fox of the Fox Film Corporation acquired the US rights for the Tri-Ergon system and, backed by Tri-Ergon AG, began a patent infringement battle in the courts in 1929 against much of the American film industry. The dispute wasn't settled until 1935, when Fox lost his final appeal in the US Supreme Court. A new Paris accord was signed in March 1936, which held until the start of the Second World War. The Tri-Ergon system continued in use in Germany and the continent during the war. There were a number of companies which used the Tri-Ergon name: * Tri-Ergon AG (Zurich, Switzerland), acquired the rights to the original 1919 patents from the inventors in 1923 * Tri-Ergon-Musik AG (St. Gallen, Switzerland), founded c1926, held the patents for the rest of the world outside Germany * Tri-Ergon- Musik AG (Berlin), which made phonograph records and owned the patents for Germany, formed in 1927: a subsidiary or branch of the St. Gallen company * Tri-Ergon-Photo-Electro-Records (Berlin), a record label subsidiary of Tri- Ergon-Musik AG (Berlin) Etymology The name Tri-Ergon means \\"the work of three\\", and is derived from , meaning three, and , , meaning 'deed, action, work, labour, or task'; cognate with (English work).\\"ἔργον\\". Wiktionary. Retrieved 3 September 2017.\\"Tri-Ergon\\" (in Swedish). FilmSoundSweden. Accessed 3 September 2017. With many photos. NB Swedish translates relatively well into English with a machine translator. The erg also derives from the same word . Design Movietone sound track with variable density recording, similar to Tri-Ergon. Right: Variable area track as used by RCA Photophone The Tri- Ergon process involved recording sound onto film using the \\"variable density\\" method, used by Movietone and Lee De Forest's Phonofilm, rather than the \\"variable area\\" method later used by RCA Photophone.There are analogies to be found with 'variable density' and the 'variable area' recording by considering sound broadcasting using FM and AM: or the difference between editing a bar code and a sound file. Tri-Ergon used a special form of microphone without mechanical moving parts (Cathodophone) for sound pickup and a special electric discharge tube for variable density film recording. For reproduction of sound, the system used an electrostatic loudspeaker. Two specific patents in the Tri- Ergon system would later cause controversy. The Tri-Ergon film used an extra 7mm sound strip attached to the edge of a standard 35mm film, resulting in a new film 42mm wide. This was achieved by a \\"double-printing\\" method by which the film and sound tracks were recorded and developed separately, then printed together onto a common positive. This required special adjustments on the standard projectors, which was not well received by the industry. The other patent was a \\"flywheel\\" which allowed the film to flow smoothly through sound reproducing equipment. An original Tri-Ergon sound movie projector (dated to 1923) is in the collection of the Deutsches Museum in München, Germany. History Beginnings Plaque at the site of the former Alhambra theatre on Kurfürstendamm, Charlottenburg, Berlin, commemorating the first public showing of sound films in 1922 by Engl, Massolle, and Vogt (in German). Massolle, Engl and Vogt secured patents from 1919 in Germany, and applied for a US patent on 20 March 1922.American Tri-Ergon Corp v. Altoona Publix Theaters (1933) Casetext. Retrieved 3 September 2017. The first public showing of Tri-Ergon sound films took place in the at 68 Kurfürstendamm, Berlin on 17 September 1922. The inventors sold their patent to Swiss financial backers (St. Gallen) who formed Tri-Ergon AG in Zürich, Switzerland to continue developing their process. In 1924 Universum-Film AG (Ufa) produced three hours' worth of vaudeville shorts with sound, similar to those produced by Warner Brothers, who used a sound-on-disc system. Tri-Ergon AG licensed the recording film rights to Ufa in January 1925 and Masolle briefly became technical director of Ufa's first sound-film division. However, the non- standard film format was not popular: even a well-publicized tour of Germany in 1925 failed to generate much interest. Ufa's first sound film, the 20-minute short ' ('The Match Girl') was directed by Guido Bagier. Bagier (who worked at Ufa between 1922 and 1927 as producer and musical advisor) also wrote the music for the film; the screenplay was by Hans Kyser. It premièred at the MozartsaalThe Mozartsaal was a cinema converted from a former concert hall, located upstairs in the Neues Schauspielhaus, 5 Nollendorfplatz, Berlin. in December 1925, but was a total flop in terms of technical sound quality. According to Bagier, the fiasco was due to technical problems with the playback equipment. The Parufmet agreement In the meantime, Ufa, having ducked the whole issue of sound films, had still fallen into severe financial difficulties with productions of vastly expensive silent films accompanied by a live symphony orchestra playing a specially-composed score, such as F. W. Murnau's Der Letzte Mann (1924), with Emil Jannings and Faust (1926 film); and both parts of Fritz Lang's Die Nibelungen, with a score by Gottfried Huppertz. Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer stepped into the financial breach with the highly restrictive Parufamet agreement of December 1925, whereby the American firms took control (and revenue) of all Ufa's first-run theatres to show American films. Only one significant German film was shown in Ufa first- run cinemas in Berlin during this whole time the agreement was in effect: Joe May's silent The Farmer from Texas. The film received no publicity build-up and was dropped after only one week at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo. Almost no German films were shown in US cinemas: and Ufa made no new films in Germany at all while the Parufamet contract was in force. Although this injection of foreign capital allowed the construction in 1926 of Ufa's enormous new Große Halle studios at Neubabelsberg (designed by Carl Stach-Urach, who had re-built the Ufa-Palast am Zoo the previous year), the Ufa management with Erich Pommer in charge of production continued to over-spend by enormous amounts. Lang's Metropolis cost over an (estimated) 5,100,000 Reichsmarks. Yet the only venue where Metropolis could be seen in the whole of Germany was at a single, small—yet equisitely decorated—cinema showing second-rate films, the Ufa- Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz.. The box office receipts amounted to approximately 75,000 Reichsmarks, slightly over 0.01% of the budget. Expansion William Fox in 1921 From 1926, needing more revenue, Tri-Ergon AG sought backers in the US. On 5 July 1927 the Hungarian-American William Fox of the Fox Film Corporation personally purchased the US rights to the Tri- Ergon patents for $50,000, forming the American Tri-Ergon Corporation. Fox Film had also purchased sound-on-film patents from Freeman Harrison Owens and Theodore Case, although it seems that only the Case patents were actually used in creating the new sound-on-film system he dubbed Fox Movietone. One of the first feature films to be released in Fox Movietone was Sunrise (1927) directed by F. W. Murnau. Fox also used the system for the long-running newsreel series Fox Movietone News. On 5 March 1927 Alfred Hugenberg's industrial Hugenberg-Gruppe took over Ufa and, as part of their initial cost- cutting measures, closed down the Tri-Ergon department. Ludwig Klitzsch, the managing director, dismissed Bagier and his team, sidestepping the problem of \\"the talkies\\" with their vast technical, financial, and legal problems. On 12 May 1927, Tri-Ergon-Musik-AG (Berlin), a subsidiary of Tri-Ergon-Musik-AG (St. Gallen) was formed by Joseph Masolle. By 1931 it was a subsidiary of IG Farben, which was founded in 1925. In December 1927 the Dutch firm of H. J. Küchenmeister founded a new company, International Maatschappij voor Sprekende Films NV (Sprekende Films NV) to profit from its patented 'Meisterton' system. Within a year the Dutch company would have almost total control of the Tobis and the Tri-Ergon patents. Walther Ruttmann's Lichtspiel Opus I (1921) Hanns Eisler in uniform in 1917 At the 1927 Baden-Baden festival of contemporary chamber-music, pioneering sound films with original scores by leading avant- garde composers were shown at special 'Film and Music' sessions. Walther Ruttmann's abstract experimental film Opus III (1924), with an original score for chamber orchestra by Hans Eisler, was shown twice: firstly as a silent film with the music performed live and synchronized using Blum's Musikchronometer, and then as a sound film (no longer extant) using the Tri- Ergon process.Ruttman would go on to direct Berlin: Symphony of a Great City with Meisel's avant-garde music. The sound-film recording was supervised by Bagier, now working for Tri-Ergon-Musik A.G. Other films shown at the festivals in 1928-9 included American cartoons with music by Paul Hindemith and Ernst Toch, newsreels (Darius Milhaud), and abstract films by Hans Richter (Hindemith). By mid-1928 a number of short films had been made using the Tri- Ergon process, produced by Tobis-Industrie GmbH (TIGes) (Berlin).\\"Tobis- Industrie GmbH (Tiges) (Berlin)\\" (in German). Filmportal.

In the autumn of a touring exhibition of sound films was shown throughout Austria. The German première of Ein Tag auf dem Bauernhof took place on 12 September 1928 at the Mozartsaal. In July 1928 German State Radio commissioned Tri-Ergon-Musik A.G. to produce a sound film for the opening of the fifth German Radio Exhibition in Berlin. Their film Deutscher Rundfunk, with music by Edmund Meisel, showed at the exhibition in August. Reviewers of the Radio Exhibition screenings were impressed by the reproduction of natural sounds, such as street noises, marching soldiers, hammering machines, steam ships and zoo animals. It was later released in a shorter version, Tönende Welle. Tobis and cartel wars Competing American sound film companies such as RKO (formed by RCA) were becoming more organised in Germany. To protect the market from American domination the German government lobbied for a cartelization of all important German sound film patents, and on 30 August 1928 the Tobis Tonbild-Syndicate A.G. was formed to consolidate the Tri-Ergon patents and several hundred more. The four original main companies who made up the Tobis syndicate were: * Messter-Ton Film, founded in Berlin by Oskar Messter, the founder of the German film industry who had been making and showing sound-on-disc films since 1903. He merged his companies with Ufa at its founding in 1917, and owned a number of significant sound film patents. * Tri-Ergon-Musik AG (St. Gallen) formed c1926 by Tri- Ergon AG (Zurich), which since 1923 had owned the patents registered by the original inventors in 1919. This was the parent company of Tri-Ergon-Musik AG (Berlin), formed by Masolle on 12 May 1927, which made both sound films, and also phonograph records with the same photo-electric method used in the film soundtracks. The records were sold under the name Tri-Ergon-Photo-Records. * Deutsche Tonfilm AG (Hannover), which in 1925 acquired the Petersen-Poulsen patents for German-speaking countries, signed a monopoly contract with Phoebus-Film (Berlin) to produce sound films. Deutsche Tonfilm, Phoebus-Film and Lignose Hörfilm (see Jules Greenbaum) were all affiliated with the chemical-industrial giant IG Farben, also formed in 1925. * The Dutch firm of H. J. Küchenmeister, who had started making 'Meisterton' sound films in 1925 with his own Ultraphone sound-on-disc system, which used two gramophone pick- up needles to give a stereo-like sound. He formed a holding company - Küchenmeisters Internationale Ultraphoon Maatschappij NV (Ultraphone) - which launched on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in October 1928 It swiftly combined with German interests to form H. J. Küchenmeister-Kommanditgesellschaft (Berlin). In this deal, Tobis acquired the option to purchase outright Tri- Ergon-Musik AG (Berlin), and made an agreement with Tri-Ergon-Musik-AG (St. Gallen) to use the Tri-Ergon sound film patents. Tobis was almost completely controlled by Küchenmeister by 1929. Richard Tauber at a concert in the Berlin Zoological Garden in August 1932 I Kiss Your Hand, Madame ('Ich küsse ihre Hand, Madame') was the first Tobis film with sound. Starring Harry Liedtke and Marlene Dietrich it premièred on January 16, 1929. Free of dialogue, the film's only sound segment occurs when the tenor Richard Tauber sings the title song on the soundtrack (00:32). Although Tauber appears with Liedtke and Dietrich in publicity shots for the film, he didn't appear on screen himself. The film was distributed by Deutsche Lichtspiel-Syndikat (DLS),\\"Deutsche Lichtspiel-Syndikat (DLS) (de)\\". IMDb. Retrieved 22 October 2017. a chain of 800 cinemas which had installed Küchenmeister's 'Meisterton' sound system in 1928. The main competitor of Tobis was the Klangfilm syndicate, a partnership formed in early 1929 between the electrical manufacacturers Siemens & Halske, AEG, and Polyphon-Werke A.G. (who sold Polydor records). By March 1929 Tobis merged with Klangfilm, and the resulting syndicate was renamed Tobis-Klangfilm in 1930. Tobis-Klangfilm made a deal with the British and French Phototone companies, and British Talking Pictures, Ltd. This made the patents of Lee de Forest available to Tobis-Klangfilm. Tobis-Klangfilm now had branches for production, distribution and equipment throughout Europe (including Tobis Portuguesa) and the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, also in 1929, Ufa and Klangfilm planned a separate contract to develop their own sound film production. Tobis (possibly because its earlier failure with Ufa in 1925) stood in direct competition with the giant Ufa as a producer of film.The Emergence of German Sound Film. Filmportal.de. Retrieved 3 September 2017. The premiere in March 1929 at the Baden-Baden Festival of Walther Ruttmann's Tobis film Melodie der Welt (Melody of the World), introduced the longest German sound film at the time with some 40 minutes running time. The Dutch firm of H. J. Küchenmeister planned a massive expansion of Tobis across Europe, and on 19 May 1929 issued 5,000 shares of its new company, 'Internationale Maatschappij voor Accoustiek NV' (Accoustiek NV) on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. This was the largest Dutch flotation to date, netting 5 million Dutch guilders (approx. 8.3 million reichsmarks, $2 million, £500,000). It was over-subscribed by 3 billion guilders (about 5 billion RM), in keeping with the general stock exchange euphoria of the times. Although Tobis-Klangfilm's preparations were complete by the spring of 1929, Warner Bros. was still technically far ahead and in May 1929 tried to present The Singing Fool in Germany, a Part-Talkie with Al Jolson in a follow-up to The Jazz Singer.From the start of 1930, beginning with The Jazz Singer, Warner Bros. only produced optical soundtracks, having had ditched their Vitaphone sound-on-disc system. Tobis-Klangfilm sued both Warner Bros. and Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI)—Western Electric's subsidiary for distributing its sound motion picture equipment—for patent infringement.Warner Bros. was itself in dispute with ERPI over royalty payments. After a number of court cases, on 22 July 1929 the German appeals court upheld Tobis-Klangfilm's exclusive rights to sound-on-film recording in Germany: the company was victorious in all subsequent appeals. Tobis-Klangfilm won further injunctions in Switzerland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Holland, and Austria. Even William Fox, owner of Tri-Ergon's American rights, was prevented from presenting films in Berlin. No American films were shown at all in Berlin, and Tobis-Klang refused an offer from ERPI, Will H. Hays organised an American boycott through his company Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA). The première of Carmine Gallone's Tobis production, Das Land ohne Frauen ('The Land Without Women') - almost two hours long - on September 30, 1929, was hailed by reviews in the press as \\"the first feature- length German sound film\\". On 29 October 1929 the Wall Street Crash occurred, triggering a worldwide financial crisis. Ufa's first major sound film, Melody of the Heart, was released in December 1929, followed in April 1930 by The Blue Angel with Dietrich and Emil Jannings, and music by Friedrich Hollaender; and in September that year The Three from the Filling Station with Lilian Harvey, Willy Fritsch and songs by the Comedian Harmonists. The success of these early sound films led the Berlin Chamber of Commerce to comment: \\"By now, sound film has become firmly established.\\" 1930 Paris accord General Electric logo AEG Turbine factory (c1909), designed by Peter Behrens The stalemate in the ongoing patent wars between the US and European interests was broken by RCA. In the summer of 1929 General Electric (GE) acquired a part interest in AEG, one of the companies making up the original Klangfilm AG syndicate. With GE's influence, RCA and Tobis-Klangfilm signed a cooperative agreement. On 22 July 1930, at a conference in Paris, France, RCA, ERPI, and Tobis-Klangfilm formed a loose cartel to divide the world into three regions for selling sound recording and reproducing apparatus. All pending litigation was dropped. ERPI and RCA acquired exclusive rights to sell their own recording and reproduction equipment, and distribute films in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and the Soviet Union. Royalties collected in the United Kingdom were split, 25 percent going to Tobis- Klangfilm, who also acquired similar exclusive rights in Central Europe and Scandinavia. Patent battles in the US In 1930 Tri-Ergon AG's 1922 patent application was still pending in the United States. William Fox (who had bought the US Tri-Ergon rights in 1926) had lost control of his own company, Fox Studios, to ERPI. Backed by Tri-Ergon AG in Switzerland, he intensified the attempt to get the patent granted. In September 1931 the efforts of American Tri-Ergon Corporation's patent lawyers paid off, and he was finally assigned the US patent for the Tri-Ergon rights in the United States. The assignor was Tri-Ergon AG, who had originally applied for the US patent back in 1922. The Tri-Ergon patents named particular technical features that claimed to precede all other sound-on-film patents, such as the flywheel on the sound drum. Fox then separately sued (as test cases) Altoona Publix Theatres Inc., which leased and operated the projection equipment from RCA; and Paramount for infringement of the \\"double printing\\" method. He then sued RCA and ERPI - and all the US film companies which used the Tri-Ergon design - for infringement, specifically the flywheel on the sound drum. During a series of legal tussles Fox at first won his lawsuit on appeal and then lost it after an unusual reversal of decision by the US Supreme Court in October 1934 not to review the case. The Supreme Court surprisingly relented, heard the appeal and finally ruled in March 1935 that neither system was 'new', and that there were prior inventions. An appeal by Alttona Publix was rejected on 1 April 1935.\\"Altoona Publix Theatres, Inc. v. American Tri-Ergon Corp.\\" 294 U.S. 734, (U.S. 1935) Decided 1 April 1935. Ravel. Retrieved 3 September 2017. Although this brought a swift end to the sound film wars between various competing US and European (Dutch, German, and Swiss) interests, it also meant that the original Tri-Ergon system was never formally adopted in the United States. As a result, William Fox's own American Tri-Ergon Corporation failed to collect an estimated $100 million in licensing fees. Financial woes In 1931 the effects of the Wall Street Crash eventually hit Küchenmeister's Sprekende Film NV, which owned Tobis. The Dutch firm had over-extended itself with bank loans which were not renewed, and its Ultraphone business went bankrupt. The hugely complex chain of inter-linked Tobis companies fell to pieces, necessitating a complete reorganisation of the whole business. Dutch bankers and creditors began re-financing the profitable parts of the company, which emerged in 1932 as 'International Tobis NV' or Intertobis 1932 Paris conference Reichstag on fire in 1933 The cartel rules began to irk foreign film companies, who had to pay ERPI a license fee (royalties) to shoot the film, and then had to pay Tobis-Klang to show the film in the areas allotted to them under the 1930 accord. Another conference was held in Paris during February 1932, but Tobis-Klangfilm demanded extra royalty fees, and American companies began withholding payments. Following the Reichstag fire, the NSDAP (Nazi Party) began to suspend civil liberties and eliminate political opposition. The Communists were excluded from the Reichstag. Adolf Hitler called on Reichstag members to vote for the Enabling Act on 24 March 1933, completing his rise to power from 1919 through the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 to Chancellor ('Reichkanzler') of the German Reich. During the nationalisation of the German film industry in 1935, the interests of Intertobis and Ufa were clandestinely transferred to Cautio GmbH. Cautio was personally set up in 1929 by Max Winkler, its sole owner and shareholder, as a front company for the secret transfer of funds from the NSDAP regime. In 1935 Winkler was named by Hitler as \\"Reich Plenipotentiary for the German Film Industry\\". He had links to Max Amann, Hitler's sergeant from 1915 to 1918, president of Eher Verlag since 1922, and president of the Reich Media Council and Reich Press Leader from c1933. The new head of Tobis-Klang-film, Dr. Hans Henkel, journeyed to New York for personal negotiations in March 1936 to effect a new agreement. After two weeks' discussion all parties signed the new 1932 Paris accord on 18 March 1936 which included payment of royalties in the local currency where the film was being shown. Most American companies had withdrawn anyway from the German market by 1936, since much of their revenues were frozen under strict currency laws under the NSDAP. Ufa continued to use the Tri-Ergon system during WW2 until the collapse of Germany in 1945. Tri-Ergon records Bernard Etté in 1938 A subsidiary, Tri-Ergon Musik AG of Berlin, made commercial phonograph records for the German, French, Swedish and Danish markets from about 1928 to 1932.

Louis was a younger son of Duke Robert II of Burgundy and Agnes of France. In 1313, he took part in a complex marriage pact designed to secure control by the Angevins and the Burgundians over Frankish Greece. On July 31, 1313, he married Matilda of Hainaut, heir-general of William II Villehardouin, to whom Philip I of Taranto gave the Principality of Achaea in fief. Louis ceded his claims on the family lands in Burgundy to his elder brother, Duke Hugh V of Burgundy, who in turn ceded to Louis the claim to the Kingdom of Thessalonica, which had been sold to their family in 1266. He subsequently did homage to Philip of Taranto, who was suzerain of Achaea and nominally also Thessalonica as titular Latin emperor, and agreed to assist in a campaign to recapture the Latin Empire. Matilda and Louis arrived separately in Achaea, she sailing directly from Marseille to Navarino with 1,000 troops, while Louis came by way of Venice, where he was soliciting aid from the Republic. Ferdinand of Majorca, who also claimed the principality jure uxoris (his wife Isabelle de Sabran was descended from the younger daughter of William II Villehardouin), had landed there in 1315 and taken to Glarentza. Matilda arrived late in 1315, and several barons, including the count of Cephalonia returned to her allegiance. However, her army was beaten by Ferdinand and his Catalans on February 22, 1316 at Picotin. About this time, Louis arrived, making an unsuccessful attempt to capture the castle of Chalandritsa. Ferdinand sent for aid from the Kingdom of Majorca and the Catalan Company, but neither arrived in time to prevent his death and defeat by Louis at the Battle of Manolada on July 5, 1316. Four weeks later, Louis died. The Chronicle of the Morea attributes his death to a fever, while the Catalan Declaratio summa states that he was poisoned by Count John I Orsini of Cephalonia. His death left Achaea in an unsettled state, with his brother Odo, his widow, and the Angevins all attempting to gain it.

At its completion, it was the longest (615 feet) and tallest (70 feet) railroad viaduct in the world; today, it is the last surviving viaduct of its kind. It has been in continuous service for years; it now carries high-speed passenger and freight rail service. The Canton Viaduct's walls are similar to the ancient curtain wall of Rhodes (built about 400 BCE) with rusticated stone. It supports a train deck about American Society of Civil Engineers article - Rebuilding History above the Canton River, the east branch (tributary) of the Neponset River. The stream pool passes through six semi-circular portals in the viaduct, flowing to a waterfall about 50 feet downstream. The viaduct was the final link built for the B&P;'s then 41-mile mainline between Boston, Massachusetts; and Providence, Rhode Island.Not the current distance, due to later route changes. Today, the viaduct serves Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, as well as Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Providence/Stoughton Line commuter trains. It sits 0.3 miles (0.5 km) south of Canton Junction, at milepost 213.74,Milepost at northern end of the viaduct reckoned from Pennsylvania Station in New York City, and at the MBTA's milepost 15.35, reckoned from South Station in Boston. Inception cavities in the viaduct Lego model of wall section with deck removed Lego model of wall section with deck removed and foundation exposed The Canton Viaduct was erected in 1835 by the B&P;, one of the first New England railroads, shortly after its 1831 founding. Thomas B. Wales, one of the original families of Boston, and owner of the T.B. Wales & Co. Shipping Company, was the first president of the B&P;, The Taunton Branch Railroad, as well as the Western Railroad Corporation. Due to his friendship with prominent New England families, including the Revere family, they were able to bring the Canton Viaduct to fruition. The T.B. Wales & Co. clipper ships brought raw materials for manufacturing companies from its dock (Wales Wharf) and Counting House (Long Wharf) to various areas in New England. Without the influence of individuals such as Thomas B. Wales, Joseph Warren Revere, owner of the Revere Copper Company and major stockholders (most of whom were Board members), the Canton Viaduct would not have been built. There were better routes through other towns for the location of the railroad line from Boston to Providence. However, building the railroad through Canton placed the line close to Paul Revere's Copper Rolling Mill, where a half mile spur (using strap rails and horse power) connected the mill to Canton Junction and undoubtedly gave a boost to Revere's copper business. The other influencing factor that caused the Canton Viaduct to be built was a fatal accident in 1832 on the Granite Railroad, which used inclined planes to cross a valley.Plan of the Granite Railroad inclined planes The original plans called for the use of inclined planes to cross the Canton River Valley (Canton Dale), but they were changed after the inclined plane accident, and a viaduct was built instead. This unique viaduct was designed by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Officer and West Point graduate - Captain William Gibbs McNeill. He was assisted by engineers, Major George Washington Whistler (McNeill's brother-in-law), Major General Isaac Ridgeway Trimble and General William Raymond Lee. McNeill and Whistler were the uncle and father of the artist James McNeill Whistler. The viaduct was built by the Dodd & Baldwin company from Pennsylvania; the firm was established by cousins Ira Dodd and Caleb Dodd Baldwin. Around this time, Russia was interested in building railroads. Tsar Nicholas I sent workmen to draw extensive diagrams of the Canton Viaduct. He later summoned Whistler to Russia as a consulting engineer to design the Moscow–Saint Petersburg Railway, on which two viaducts were modeled after the Canton Viaduct. A scale model viaduct of similar design is on display at the Oktyabrsky Railroad Museum in St. Petersburg. Design and construction  Classification  This Canton Viaduct is the first and possibly only viaduct to use both a blind arcade and cavity wall structure. The structure is often referred to as a \\"multiple arch bridge\\", but it does not fit the classic definition of spanning a distance between two points. Although the deck arches appear to extend through to other side, they do not; each deck arch is only four feet deep. The deck arches support the spandrels, deck (beyond the walls), coping and parapets; they are not tied to the longitudinal walls. The only arches that extend through to the other side are six river portals and two roadway portals. The 'buttresses' are also unique in that they extend through to the other side, so they are actually transverse walls. Due to its use of double walls and lack of open arches, the Canton Viaduct is more accurately described as a blind arcade cavity wall. The Thomas Viaduct (Maryland, 1835) and Starrucca Viaduct (Pennsylvania, 1847) are classic examples of multiple arch viaducts, as their primary support system consists of open semi-circular arches spanning the distance between piers, without any walls. Materials Video of the west side of Canton Viaduct sweeping from north to south - no sound The Canton Viaduct contained 14,483 cubic feet (15,800 perches) of granite, which weighs approximately prior to its concrete redecking in 1993. Each stone has a Mason's mark to identify who cut the stone. Each course is 22\\" - 24\\" high and laid in a pattern closely resembling a Flemish bond. Exterior stone for the walls, wing wall abutments, portals, deck arches, coping, parapets and the foundation stone are riebeckite granite mined from Moyles quarry (a.k.a. Canton Viaduct Quarry) located on the westerly slope of Rattlesnake Hill in Sharon, Massachusetts; now part of Borderland State Park. This type of granite was chosen because it does not stain as it weathers, but retains its original color. Interior stone for the foundation, walls, wing wall abutments, binders, stiles, deck, Dedication Stone and capstone are of a different type of granite mined from Dunbar's quarry in Canton, Massachusetts. ;Walls *Granite (two types from two local quarries) *Mortar (except interior of the wing wall abutments which were laid dry) *Reinforced concrete (roadway portal and deck arches) ;Deck *Reinforced concrete (new deck and cross ties) *Waterproof cement (on coping) *Iron (fence/railing and rails) *Galvanized steel (walkway grating and catenary system) *Rubber (ballast mats under tracks for noise reduction) *Lean concrete (longitudinal troughs fill) *Crushed granite (track ballast) *Wood (original longitudinal sleepers, cross ties, fence/railing and curb) Location Canton Viaduct foundation plan and west elevation The majority of the viaduct is over land (71%), while 29% is over water. In addition to the six river portals, one roadway portal was originally provided. The distance between the transverse walls at this section is wider than all the other sections of the viaduct. The overall length is with a one degree horizontal curve that creates two concentric arcs. This makes the west wall slightly shorter than the east wall producing a slight keystone shape in the cavities. Originally unnamed, it was referred to as \\"the stone bridge\\" and \\"the viaduct at Canton\\" before it was eventually named after the town. In 1840 the road under the viaduct was known as \\"the street leading from Neponset Bank by Elisha White's to near Joseph Downes.\\" Sometime after, it was known as \\"Rail Road St.\\", and in 1881, it was finally named \\"Neponset St.\\" after the river. It serves as a major artery in Canton connecting its main street (Washington St.) to Interstate 95. Freemasons The stone cutters and masons who worked on the viaduct were Scottish FreemasonsA History of Canton Junction by Edward D. Galvin from local area lodges.Canton Viaduct Masonic Memorial and Milestone Public Flyer In addition to the workmen, the majority of the B&P;'s Board of Directors were Freemasons, including Thomas B. Wales and Joseph W. Revere. The foundation stone was laid on Sunday, April 20, 1834 with a Masonic Builders' rites ceremony. Following to Masonic tradition, the foundation stone was located in the northeast corner of the structure. Construction A random sample of Canton Viaduct Mason's marks; there are thousands of stones in the structure and each has a symbol to identify who cut the stone. The Canton Viaduct cost $93,000 to build ($ today). Construction took 15 months, 8 days from laying of the foundation stone on April 20, 1834, to completion on July 28, 1835. The first and last transverse walls (next to the wing wall abutments) are only 3 feet wide, all the other transverse walls are 5 feet, 6 inches wide. The wing wall abutments are 25 feet wide where they meet the viaduct; they are curved and stepped and were excavated by William Otis using his first steam shovel. From the top of the wing walls to midway down, the stones are of 2' wide; from midway down to the bottom of the wing walls the stones are 4' wide. The coping is supported by 42 segmental deck arches (21 on each side) that span the tops of 22 transverse walls beyond the longitudinal walls. The longitudinal walls are five feet thick with a four-foot gap between them joined with occasional tie stones. More construction details are available in the original specifications. When the viaduct had a single set of tracks, the rails were placed directly over the longitudinal walls as the cavity's width is less than standard gauge. When the viaduct was double tracked in 1860, the inside rails were placed directly over the longitudinal walls and the outside rails were supported by the deck arches. The viaduct was \\"substantially complete\\" in June 1835 from various accounts of horse-drawn cars passing over it during that time. The viaduct was built before the advent of construction safety equipment such as hard hats and fall arrest devices. Surprisingly, no deaths were recorded during the construction, but deaths have occurred at the viaduct since completion; mainly from people crossing it while trains passed in opposite directions. Charlie, the old white horse who had hauled the empty railcars back to Sharon, Massachusetts (4 miles), was placed upon the flat car and hauled across the viaduct by the workers, thus becoming the first \\"passenger\\" to cross the structure. A June 6, 1835, article in the Providence Journal describes it. As reported by the Boston Advertiser and the Providence Journal, \\"Whistler\\" was the first engine to pass over the entire length of the road. The engine was built by Robert Stephenson in 1833 in England and named by William Gibbs McNeill in honor of his brother-in-law George Washington Whistler. The trip from Boston to Providence cost $2 one way. There are examples of Fibonacci numbers and golden ratios in the Canton Viaduct: *The inscription on the back of the Dedication Stone is recessed into an elongated octagon. *The original roadway portal was built through the eighth cavity from the south end and the concrete roadway portal was built through the thirteenth cavity from the north end. *The rise of the original roadway portal is 8 rows and the rise of each deck arch is 3 rows. *There are 5 voussoirs in each arch row (depth) of the original roadway portal and river portals. *There are 21 deck arches on each side of the viaduct and 21 voussoirs in each deck arch. *There are 21 cavities in the viaduct. *There are 13 voussoirs in each river portal. *There are 3 rows of stones in the Canton Viaduct monument, the bottom and middle rows have 8 stones each. Aside from seasonal vegetation control and occasional graffiti removal, the viaduct requires no regular maintenance other than periodic bridge inspections from Amtrak. Dedication Stone keystone removed during the 1993 deck replacement. Canton Viaduct Dedication Stone The Canton Viaduct Dedication Stone was originally laid in the west parapet, south end. The capstone was laid in the south end of the west parapet. This stone sat atop the Dedication Stone and it was the last stone to be laid in the viaduct. The Dedication Stone is actually two stones now held together with two iron straps on each end. The overall dimensions are approximately 60\\" long × 36\\" high × 18\\" wide (golden ratio), and it weighs approximately 3,780 lbs. The Dedication Stone was originally topped with a 63\\" long × 8\\" high × 24\\" wide capstone with double beveled edges, creating an irregular hexagonal profile. Due to its breaking in 1860, the Dedication Stone is about 1\\" shorter today than its original height. The damage obscured two directors' names, W. W. Woolsey and P. T. Jackson. Woolsey was also a Director of the Boston & Providence Railroad & Transportation Co. (B&P; RR&T; Co.) in Rhode Island (incorporated May 10, 1834) which owned the Rhode Island portion of the Boston and Providence rail line. The B&P; RR&T; Co. merged with the B&P; on June 1, 1853. Railroad track During the 1993 deck renovation, two 18-inch-deep troughs were discovered recessed into the granite deck stones running the entire length of the viaduct and spaced at standard gauge width ( inches). The troughs contained longitudinal baulks and were part of the original construction. The baulks supported the rails without the need for transoms as the gauge was maintained by the longitudinal troughs. This is the only known instance of transomless baulks recessed in granite slabs; the original tracks before and after the viaduct used baulks making the B&P; originally a baulk railroad. A 1910 photo taken atop the viaduct shows dirt between the cross ties and tracks, so this material may have been used before traditional gravel ballast. Baulks were used to support strap rails or bridge rail. These early rails would have been replaced with flanged T-rails by 1840. These photosCanton Historical Society: Canton Junction show baulks at Canton Junction in 1871. An 1829 report from the Massachusetts Board of Directors of Internal Improvements describes how the railroad from Boston to Providence was to be built. The report states, \\"It consists of one pair of tracks composed of long blocks of granite, about one foot square, resting upon a foundation wall extending to the depth of ' below the surface of the ground, and 2' wide at the bottom\\". The report also calls for using horse-drawn wagons and carriages at 3 MPH on the rail line, not steam locomotives. Construction sequence The Canton Viaduct was constructed in the following sequence: ;Planning *Design and specifications ;Preconstruction *Site preparation, mobilization, surveying, excavation (using timber piling), river diversion (using cofferdams) ;Construction *Wing wall abutments - foundations and walls (using scaffolding) *Temporary train platforms and embankment staircases at abutments *Walls: Foundations - the Foundation Stone was the first stone to be laid on April 20, 1834 (northeast corner) with Masonic Builders' rites ceremony Walls and portals (using falsework) Deck arches (using falsework) Spandrels Cavity slabs Deck slabs (with longitudinal troughs) and coping Parapets - the capstone was the final stone to be laid at the southwest end with Masonic ceremony ;Post Construction *Track installation - baulks, rail and ballast - the first \\"passenger\\" was Charlie, the workhorse *Site cleanup and demobilization *Opening ceremony - July 28, 1835. The first train, \\"Whistler\\" passed over the Canton Viaduct at approximately 5:00 PM local solar time. Waterway A west side view of the Canton Viaduct with its waterfall in the foreground. Spillway Dam at Neponset St. - a.k.a. Canton Viaduct Falls impounds Mill Pond. It is a weir or low head dam that is owned by the MBTA. The 16' high by 90' long granite dam was built in 1900 and currently (2009) averages 78 cubic feet/second annual discharge. Water power was supplied to nearby businesses via water wheel from the canal starting at the waterfall's enclosed plunge pool and continuing about 200' under the Neponset St. bridge. There were also two channels located between the viaduct and the waterfall (one on each side) referred to as sluices, headraces and flumes in various maps. They were filled in sometime after 1937 (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers National Inventory of Dams No. MA03106). Renovations and repairs An east side view of the Canton Viaduct looking north shows some repairs in a 1906 postcard. USNGS survey marker (Permanent ID: MY0489) is located on the west side of the concrete roadway portal, south end. A west side view looking south shows the viaduct's new cantilevered concrete deck and original iron fence from 1878 (restored). A south view from midway atop the Canton Viaduct. The new concrete deck can be seen with refurbished iron fence/rail, 4' walkways, catenary system, concrete ties, continuously welded rail and safety rails. A non-railroad electrical substation is shown in the background off to the right. *1860 - 25 years after its construction, the increased traffic between Boston and Providence made the need for double tracking necessary. The roadbed was built wide enough to accommodate two sets of tracks, but only one set was originally installed. To accommodate the second track the granite parapets were removed. The parapets were 36\\" high × 12\\" wide topped with 8\\" high × 18\\" wide coping for a total height of 3'-8\\". The Dedication Stone was tossed off the viaduct and lay broken in a field for 18 years. The Dedication Stone is the only known remnant of the parapets. It is not known if any stones fell into the river during this renovation. These stones may have been used in railroad projects or as mile markers or building foundations and walls in Canton. The granite parapets were replaced with a heavy cantilevered wooden fence fastened to transverse wooden floor beams. A hard pine curb was bolted at the edges of the deck to retain the new ballast. The deck troughs and baulks were abandoned at this time, and the troughs were filled in with stone. The timber approach structures would have been removed at this time to accommodate the double tracking. Although the viaduct was able to accommodate two sets of tracks it was not the original design intent due to a single set of longitudinal troughs, the weak deck arches, and the narrow width of the deck - the outer rails of each set of tracks are above the deck's edge. *1878 - The wooden fence was removed and replaced with a heavy cantilevered iron fence (of similar design) from the Edgemoor Iron Company for $12,000. The new fence also used transverse floor beams (but made from iron) and was built to carry an 18\\" cantilevered footwalk that was never installed. The ends of the fence were flared (over the abutments) to guide trains onto the viaduct if they derailed before reaching it. The Dedication Stone was repaired by squaring off the broken stones and connecting them with two iron straps on each side. It was then raised to the top of the viaduct at the opposite (north) end facing East. *1887 - Safety tracks were placed on the viaduct on April 15Canton Journal index (1876–1890) to prevent a derailed train from hitting a passing train and/or falling off the viaduct. The addition of the safety tracks was in response to the recent disasters at White River Bridge and Bussey Bridge. Many guard rail configurations have been used on the viaduct over the years. *1897 - This photo shows the Mill Pond water level lowered to expose the viaduct foundations for workers to make repairs. Another photo shows missing foundation stones that were replaced. All joints were filled with waterproof cement. *1906 - Heavy timbers support a work platform in this post card dated October 15. Deck arch 13E is being repaired and suggests the deck arches were not strong enough to handle the ever-increasing loads or were deteriorating. This is the same arch that would later be opened to allow a second roadway passage in 1953. *1909 - A stone in deck arch 10E dropped out of place and the arch was badly cracked; stonemasons began repairing it on Sunday, December 19. An article titled, \\"More Trouble with the Viaduct at Canton Junction\\" in the December 24 edition of the Canton Journal describes this as the second arch to have given way within a month. *1910 - Reinforced concrete arches (42 total, 21 on each side) were added under each deck arch. The repairs took almost 2 years to complete. A report from this year describes the first known interior inspection. *1912 - An interior inspection at arch 7 occurred in late October. A large stone was removed to allow access and three platforms with ladders were erected inside to facilitate inspection of the walls and underside of the deck. There were no broken or cracked stones and all joints were still full of good hard mortar. A photo from the inspection shows the formation of stalactites under the deck indicating water penetration which may have caused the deck arch problems from freeze/thaw cycles resulting in frost disintegration. *1914 - Four wooden \\"jump-out\\" platforms (approximately 6' long × 4' deep) were attached to the iron fence supports for people to seek refuge upon when trains passed. The platforms were staggered every 154' and cantilevered over the deck arches (mid-span) 5W, 9E, 13W and 17E. The jump-outs were installed after the death of Canton Junction section foreman, Wilbert H. Jerauld who was on the viaduct when two trains converged and was unable to escape. *1939 - During World War II guard houses were built at each end of the Canton Viaduct to protect the viaduct from sabotage. *1953 - 118 years after the Canton Viaduct's construction, a concrete roadway portal was cut adjacent to the original roadway portal in arch 13 to accommodate northbound traffic on Neponset Street. The $40,000 renovation took place in March and the cost was split by the town of Canton and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Co. This roadway portal is much smaller due to its segmental arch design and shorter width between transverse walls. The cavity at arch 13 and foundations would have been inspected at this time. *1963 - After years of Canton River flooding, the Army Corps of Engineers built the Canton Local Protection Project. The project's main purpose was to protect businesses along the river and prevent scouring of the viaduct's foundations during flood season and hurricanes as seen here during the Long Island Express hurricane of 1938. *1965 - A USCGS benchmark (F31) was placed on the west side of the concrete roadway portal. *1973 - Mason's marks on the viaduct were cataloged and painted white by the Canton Historical Society in April. Painting of the Canton Viaduct's Mason's marks is known to have occurred one other time in the late 1800s. *1995 - The MBTA and Amtrak rehabilitated the viaduct for high- speed Acela Express train service. The main objectives of this $10 Million dollar project were to widen (13' track centers), strengthen and lengthen the viaduct with a new cantilevered, precast, prestressed concrete deck, replace the concrete deck arches and institute electrification via catenary lines. Voltage for the 25 kV AC lines is provided by the electrical substation at the south end of the viaduct. The original iron fence was also removed, refurbished and attached to the new deck. The new deck was 8' wider, with 4' walkways on each side that eliminated the need for the jump-out platforms. The concrete roadway portal was refinished and the USCGS benchmark was replaced. Project challenges It was necessary to maintain the historic fabric of the structure so all work was consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Treatment of Historic Structures. The viaduct is located within Massachusetts DCR's Fowl Meadow and Ponkapoag Bog ACEC(Map Tile #7g) so protecting endangered species in the nearby wildlife refuge presented a challenge. Working in and over the Canton River required extensive permitting and close monitoring by environmental groups. The project was also located in a designated National Environmental Study Area. An excerpt from the September 1998 Railway Track & Structures article reads, > It was initially believed that the top of the viaduct was composed of solid > granite blocks (originally carrying a single track). After the track and > ballast were removed from the structure, troughs were discovered recessed > into the granite capstones. The 18\\" deep troughs ran the entire length of > the viaduct and were spaced approximately 56\\" apart (standard railroad > gauge). In some locations, the trough contained a solid piece of oak, > including some abandoned spikes. It is believed the troughs held wooden > sleepers for the original single track railroad. These loose materials were > removed from the deck, and lean concrete was placed to fill the voids. > Archival photographs of the sleepers were taken and their remnants will be > turned over to the local historical commission. At the approaches to the > viaduct, a series of granite walls were uncovered running perpendicular to > the tracks. These walls were approximately 7' on center, and it was thought > that they might have carried a timber approach structure. The locations of > the walls conflicted with new abutments for the PPC beams, and they made it > difficult to install sheet piling for the contractor's support of excavation > system. The walls were left in place undisturbed beneath the new track > structure. HDR, Inc. redesigned the abutments to minimize their depths, > eliminate the conflicts and reduce the loading of the temporary support of > excavation system. When the railroad was complete except for the viaduct, trains ran to the viaduct abutments where passengers would exit and descend the embankment. Passengers crossed the river on a hand-operated cable ferry, boarded horse- drawn carriages on a temporary wagonway to cross the valley, then ascended the embankment to board a waiting train at the opposite abutment. The approach walls are believed to have supported the temporary (covered) train platforms to which wooden staircases were attached. These wooden staircases led from the train platforms to stone abutment staircases (with railings) for passengers to descended to the valley floor. A photo from 1871 may have captured one of those walls (bottom left), at the north end, west side of the viaduct. The approach walls may have also served as foundations for the guard houses during World War II. Many coping stones were discarded during the deck replacement project; they were placed in the field behind the viaduct. Some Canton residents recovered smaller stones from the massive pile before it was hauled off to an unknown destination. Portland Cement Association's Historic Canton Viaduct case study has more project details. Three interior inspections were performed in the winter by two structural engineers using rock climbing equipment to scale the interior walls. The inspectors noticed small, insignificant cracks in the walls and larger cracks in the deck stones that eventually led to the deck being replaced. The stones of the viaduct were placed in such a way as to allow interior access at just three locations. Between the longitudinal walls occasional tie stones connect the walls together. Some tie stones have large, loose stones placed on them to support work planks. The local film crew noticed rock crystal formation taking place, associated with the moist air inside and a rotting wooden platform. They also noticed some thin wood or iron pieces connecting the walls. It is unknown if these iron pieces or the platforms were used during construction or inspection. Stone stiles protrude into the airspace but do not reach the opposite side. The stiles were used to support work planks instead of traditional scaffolding due to the narrow space between the walls. Proposed renovations *1941 - Canton's Planning Board proposed adding a matching roadway portal, two pedestrian portals with sidewalks and widening the roadway. The road was widened and a concrete roadway portal was eventually added in 1953. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Co. rejected the addition of pedestrian portals and sidewalks. *1993 - The MBTA rejected a proposal to raise the height of the smaller roadway portal by replacing the segmental arch with a semi-circular arch and replacing the concrete with granite to match the original roadway portal. This proposal would have restored the historical integrity of the viaduct while preventing large trucks from colliding with the viaduct. *2000 - The MBTA rejected a proposal by the town of Canton to provide a third opening in the viaduct for pedestrian passage. Over the years the town of Canton has proposed the addition of pedestrian portals to provide safe passage under the viaduct but owners have consistently rejected these proposals. Ownership *1834–1888, Boston & Providence Railroad Corp. *1888–1893, Old Colony Railroad Co. *1893–1969, New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Co. *1969–1973, Penn Central Transportation Company *1973–present, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Critical infrastructure *World War I - A detachment of the 9th Regiment National Guard arrived in April 1917 to guard the viaduct from sabotage, via sentry duty. *World War II - Canton's Civil Defense Corps and railroad employees guarded the viaduct against sabotage since the train line is part of the direct link between Boston and New York City. The structure is a critical transportation link between the two cities and had extra protection as a result. *War on Terrorism - Shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 the Canton Viaduct was guarded by various security entities until the U.S. threat level decreased. In a letter to Canton's Board of Selectmen on February 27, 2002, former Police Chief Peter Bright noted that Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency training for worst-case situations highlights the destruction of the Canton Viaduct for its disruption of the national railroad system; the Federal Government also considers the viaduct a high-risk target.Former Canton Police Chief Bright's letter is public record, available at the Canton Police Department and Canton's Board of Selectmen. Public safety An east side view of the viaduct's roadway portals. The safety shelf is located on the south end of the granite roadway portal. Damage to the smaller roadway portal from frequent vehicle strikes is clearly evident. This photo was taken before the 1993 renovations. A west side view of the viaduct's roadway portals. This is where Neponset St., Walpole St. and the electrical substation road converge. The USNGS survey marker is located at the west side of concrete roadway portal, south end. This photo was taken after the 1993 renovations. A map showing sidewalks near Canton Viaduct. The Canton Viaduct is a congested, high volume traffic area with an average of 16,400 motor vehicles passing under the viaduct each day. There are many safety issues with the Canton Viaduct and surrounding area: *Sidewalks - Neponset St. is an arterial road in Canton and has 4' sidewalks except in the viaduct area. Pedestrian passage under the viaduct has always been a dangerous undertaking due to the confined space under the viaduct. The northbound lane has no sidewalk and the southbound lane has a narrow \\"safety shelf\\" (a.k.a. the runway) which is only 2'-6\\" wide and not intended for pedestrian use. This passage is not ADA compliant. For pedestrians to travel safely from the west side of the viaduct to the east side would require taking a circuitous route approximately 2.3 miles long, that would take the average person about 45 minutes to walk. The direct route under the viaduct is a matter of only 14 feet. *Crosswalks - A northbound pedestrian must cross Neponset St. to access the safety shelf in the southbound lane; once through the viaduct the pedestrian must cross the electrical substation road, Walpole St. and Neponset St. A southbound pedestrian must cross Walpole St. and the electrical substation road to reach the safety shelf. Many northbound pedestrians increase their risks by jumping into the road and running under the viaduct rather than crossing Neponset St. to reach the safety shelf in the southbound lane. There are no crosswalks in the Canton Viaduct area to facilitate safe pedestrian road crossing. *Lighting - Neponset St. has sharp (90 degree) curves before and after the viaduct, causing poor forward visibility especially at night due to inadequate street lighting and lack of any viaduct lighting. *Signage - There are no traffic signs in the area to warn drivers of the sharp curves before and after the viaduct, to slow down when approaching the viaduct, or to watch for pedestrians. The only speed limit sign (30 MPH) in the area is located between Canton Viaduct monument and the waterfall on the northbound lane of Neponset St., where drivers are traveling away from the viaduct. There are also no structure gauge signs to warn drivers with large vehicles of potential collisions with the viaduct. *Roadway - The speed limit is 30 MPH in this area and the road lanes narrow under the viaduct, leaving little margin for error, especially when slippery road conditions exist. Four roads converge at the Canton Viaduct: Neponset St., Walpole St., Neponset Place and the electrical substation road. There is also a residential driveway adjacent to the viaduct on the east side at the concrete roadway portal and the main entrance to a condominium complex is located on the west side just north of the Neponset St. and Walpole St. convergence (directly across from Canton Viaduct monument), making this area the most complex intersection in town. *Clearance - The concrete roadway portal was designed for straight- through passage of semi-trailer trucks, but the sharp curves before and after the viaduct require serpentine turning to navigate the portal resulting in truck/viaduct collisions. Over the past 57 years the viaduct has been struck thousands of times causing damage to vehicles and the viaduct at its most vulnerable point. Unsuspecting truck drivers easily pass through the larger portal but on their return trip are faced with tighter turns and a smaller portal. Northbound truck drivers who do not heed the height limitation often get stuck in the smaller portal due to their vehicles' large wall-to-wall turning circle, resulting in major traffic delays while rescue crews extract the wedged vehicle. When trucks get stuck under the viaduct they also block access to Neponset Place, a residential driveway and a business. Some truck drivers avoid the northbound passage by waiting until there is no traffic in the southbound lane, then hastily driving the wrong way through the larger portal, creating a potential hazard to oncoming traffic. *Resources - Between 1953 and 1999 at least three trucks per day were stuck in the viaduct;Non- scientific 2009 collision frequency estimate provided by Kessler Machine & Fabricating, located at the Canton Viaduct's roadway portals since 1936. after the Neponset St. improvements in 1999 the frequency was reduced to one truck every other day. Over the years these incidents have cost the town millions of dollars for emergency response and caused reduced public safety availability. The lack of sidewalks, crosswalks, signage and lighting, plus the narrow roadway, limited lines of sight and low clearance makes the Canton Viaduct a dangerous crossing for pedestrians and vehicles. Additional safety issues *Parking and visiting - Land east of the Canton Viaduct is owned by residents and a private business, land south of the waterfall (Canton Viaduct Park) is owned by the MBTA and land north of the waterfall is owned by a private business. Canton Viaduct Park is open to the public all year but it is only accessible by foot with no sidewalk, guardrails or public parking. There are no parking spaces provided on the nearby streets and parking at businesses to visit the park is prohibited. *Passing over - Although the new deck provides much needed safety improvements, with 4' walkways on each side, only railroad and public safety personnel are allowed to walk across the viaduct. *Utility bridge - The concrete utility bridge crosses the Canton River about 100 yards east of the viaduct; it is only 12\\" wide, with no railings. Known as the \\"catwalk\\", it is a popular location for taking pictures of the viaduct. However, only utility and public safety personnel are allowed on it. *Vandalism - The Canton Viaduct has been spray painted by vandals many times over the years. The most recent graffiti attack took place in April 2009. *Watercraft - No boats of any kind are allowed in the area due to the narrow and low clearance of the river portals, the close proximity of the waterfall and the potential for acts of terrorism. *Fishing - A fish consumption advisory is in effect for this section of the Canton River due to heavy metal (lead and copper) and high PCB levels. *Swimming - The section of the Canton River between the viaduct and the dam is fenced off; no swimming is allowed due to the close proximity to the waterfall and poor water quality.

(ASCE nomination form) It is \\"one of the two oldest surviving multiple arch stone railroad bridges still in active mainline use in the United States\\". The Thomas Viaduct is older (completed two weeks prior) but the viaducts are not comparable since their main support systems are different. The Thomas Viaduct's main support system is open arches and the Canton Viaduct's main support system is solid walls. *In 1999 Canton Viaduct Park was created, it is located south of the waterfall over the old channel on land taken via eminent domain by the MBTA in 1997. A monument was built with discarded coping from the 1993 deck renovation project. The curved wall was built in the shape of a segmental arch - the same shape as the viaducts deck arches including a symbolic keystone. Atop the monument sit a commemorative plaque stone and the Dedication Stone - serving as the last stop in the Dedication Stone's journey. A brick walk with a granite bench (also made from discarded coping), leads to the monument. The monument was designed in consultation with the Canton Historical Commission and McGinley Hart & Associates as part of the landscape after the deck renovation was completed. Without public parking, sidewalks or crosswalks in the area, park access is difficult, and many people can only view the park as they drive by. *A scale model of the viaduct was built by a former Canton resident (Ed Costanza) using Legos; the model is on display in the Canton Public Library's Reference room. *For the town of Canton's 175th anniversary (1972) commemorative silver and copper medals were created with the Canton Viaduct engraved. *For the Boston Society of Civil Engineers' 150th Anniversary a commemorative pen and ink limited edition print was commissioned featuring 13 significant design and construction achievements in Massachusetts between 1804 and 2002. The Canton Viaduct is shown at the bottom right corner of the print. *The Canton Police Department honors the Canton Viaduct on their uniform patch. *The viaduct is the most photographed landmark in Canton, and many local businesses have used the Canton Viaduct's image and name throughout the years. Most recognizable was an image of the viaduct used in the Canton Journal's masthead for many years. *The viaduct is featured in many civil engineering, bridge and railroad magazines and books; it has also been the subject of many artists' paintings and postcards. *The Viaduct has been the subject of documentary films such as: A Look Back At Canton 1939–1940 by Amateur Services Productions narrated by Ed Bolster Viaduct by George T. Comeau, 1987 Inside The Viaduct by Canton's Cable 8, 1995 ASCE National Historic Civil Engineering Landdmark Dedication of the Canton Viaduct by Canton's Cable 8, 1999 Current status In June 2004 the town of Canton developed a Master Plan that identifies what should be preserved and enhanced to meet evolving needs and improve the quality of life. Items from the Master Plan related to Canton Viaduct include: *Create the Viaduct Revitalization District. *Incorporate elements of Canton's history into school curriculum such as the viaduct to be documented and studied. *Existing cultural and historic resources and activities should be more heavily promoted and more events should be considered. *Develop the Canton Riverfront Trail for pedestrians and bicycles adjacent to the viaduct and increase river access. This trail could connect with the Warner Trail. *The former Plymouth Rubber site would be redeveloped and in doing so preserve scenic views of the viaduct. *Due to the \\"stuck truck in the viaduct\\" problem, add signs on approaches to the viaduct directing truck traffic to/from the town center to use Chapman St. as a by-pass route. *Explore an additional connection through the viaduct to the town center via Revere St. large enough to accommodate truck traffic to/from the town center. *Include the viaduct in Canton's Historic Resources Inventory, Historic Preservation Plan and a Historic District. *Develop wayside exhibits and other educational materials and methods to explain the history of the viaduct. *Build a museum of Paul Revere's Copper Rolling Mill and surrounding area. Some of these items have been implemented and others are in the planning stages. The Canton Viaduct celebrated its 175th anniversary (demisemiseptcentennial or quartoseptcentennial) on Wednesday, July 28, 2010. A committee was established in 2009 with members of the Canton Historical Commission and Canton Public Library Trustees to plan the anniversary celebration.

Born to a poor family, the Majaws could not afford a guitar or a radio. In a friend's house he was introduced to the music of Bill Haley and Elvis Presley, and taught himself the guitar as most boys and girls did in those days. His mother sent him to a boarding school where his love for music grew. Majaw then moved on to Kolkata (Calcutta) where he sang in bars and pubs for various groups such as the Dynamite Boys, Vanguards, Supersound Factory, and Blood and Thunder. In 1966, Lou was introduced to Bob Dylan's work. Inspired by his music, he later organized a \\"Dylan's birthday concert\\" in Shillong on 24 May 1972. Since then he has organized the concert each year on 24 May to pay obeisance to Dylan, with the shows generating national and international interest. On 24 May 2011, Lou Majaw celebrated the 70th birthday of Bob Dylan with a grand concert with one band each from 8 states of North East India.

It is located southeast of the abandoned settlement of Garibaldi above the eastern flank of the Cheakamus River valley. With a summit elevation of and a topographic prominence of , it rises above the surrounding landscape on the western shore of Garibaldi Lake. A large provincial park surrounds Mount Price and other volcanoes in its vicinity. Its northern and western flanks are overlapped by smaller volcanic edifices, including Clinker Peak, which was the source for two thick lava flows 15,000–12,000 years ago that ponded against glacial ice. These volcanoes were formed by volcanic eruptions from secondary vents rather than individual ones. As a result, Clinker Peak and other flank volcanoes are interpreted to be part of Mount Price. The mountain is associated with a small group of related volcanoes called the Garibaldi Lake volcanic field. This forms part of the larger Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, a north-south trending volcanic zone that represents a portion of the Canadian Cascade Arc. Mount Price began its formation 1.2 million years ago and activity continued intermittently until about 12,000 years ago. Although the mountain has not erupted since the early Holocene epoch, it could erupt again, which would potentially pose danger to the nearby populace. If this were to happen, relief efforts would be quickly organized. Teams such as the Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) are prepared to notify people threatened by volcanic eruptions in Canada. Geology Mount Price is one of the three principal volcanoes in the southern segment of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. In contrast to most stratovolcanoes in Canada, Mount Price has a nearly symmetrical structure. It is one of the several Garibaldi Belt volcanoes that have been active in the Quaternary period. Clinker Peak, a breached volcanic crater on its western flank, was formed during a period of volcanic activity about 10,000 years ago. Oxidation of Price's volcanic rocks has given the mountain a red colour. Like other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, Mount Price formed as a result of subduction zone volcanism. As the Juan de Fuca Plate subducts under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone, it forms volcanoes and volcanic eruptions. Unlike most subduction zones worldwide, there is no deep oceanic trench present along the continental margin in Cascadia. There is also very little seismic evidence that the Juan de Fuca Plate is actively subducting. As a result, the existence of active volcanism in the Cascade Volcanic Arc is the best evidence for ongoing subduction. However, volcanic activity along the Cascade Arc has been declining over the last few million years. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. These two tectonic plates currently converge at a rate of to per year, only about half the rate of convergence from seven million years ago. This slowed convergence likely accounts for reduced seismicity and lack of an oceanic trench. Volcanic history At least three phases of eruptive activity have been identified at Mount Price. The first event 1.2 million years ago deposited hornblende andesite lava and pyroclastic rocks on the floor of a cirque-like basin after an Early Pleistocene glacial event. The Black Tusk, a deeply dissected stratovolcano north of Mount Price, was also active during this period. Because older volcanic events have not been identified in the Garibaldi area, this is the oldest known eruptive period in the Garibaldi Lake volcanic field. The Barrier is part of a thick lava flow that erupted from Clinker Peak between 15,000 and 12,000 years ago. Person in middle of image for scale During the Middle Pleistocene about 300,000 years ago, volcanism shifted westward and constructed the nearly symmetrical stratovolcano of Mount Price. Episodic eruptions produced andesite and dacite lavas, as well as pyroclastic flows from Peléan activity. Later, the volcano was overridden by the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, which covered a large area of North America during glacial periods of the Quaternary. After the Cordilleran Ice Sheet had retreated from higher elevations less than 15,000 years ago, andesite eruptions from a satellite vent at Price Bay created a small lava dome or scoria cone on Price's northern flank. Possibly contemporaneous volcanism occurred at Clinker Peak with the eruption of two hornblende-biotite andesite lava flows. They are both at least thick and long, extending to the northwest and southwest. The unusually large thickness of these lava flows is from them ponding and cooling against the Cordilleran Ice Sheet when it still filled valleys at lower elevations. A prominent feature of these lava flows are the levees that demarcate the lava channels. The northwest lava flow forms a volcanic dam known as The Barrier. This retains the Garibaldi Lake system and has been the source for two large landslides in the past. The most recent major landslide in 1855-1856 resulted from failure along vertical rock fractures. It travelled down Rubble Creek to the Cheakamus valley, depositing of rock. The southwest lava flow forms a mountain ridge called Clinker Ridge. In contrast to the Mount Cayley and Mount Meager massifs, no hot springs are known in the Garibaldi area. However, there is evidence of anomalously high heat flow in Table Meadows near the southern flank of Mount Price. This indicates that magmatic heat is still present under the Garibaldi area and it is probably related to recent volcanic activity. Human history Naming Garibaldi Lake with Mount Price in the background Mount Price has had at least two names throughout its history. It was originally named Red Mountain for its red appearance, but the date when this name was adopted has not been cited. Another peak west of Overlord Mountain was identified as Red Mountain on a 1923 sketch by Canadian mountaineer Neal M. Carter. To avoid confusion, the name of this mountain was changed to Fissile Peak on September 2, 1930 for its fissility. In 1927, Canadian volcanologist William Henry Mathews (1919–2003) identified Mount Price as Clinker Mountain in articles and journals. The name Mount Price was adopted on September 2, 1930 after a committee of the Garibaldi Park Board was set up to deal with nomenclature. It was requested that the Geographic Board of Canada to adopt Mount Price for this mountain after Thomas E. Price, a former mountaineer and engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Clinker Peak and Clinker Ridge were both officially named on September 12, 1972 to retain Price's earlier name Clinker Mountain. Protection and monitoring The volcano and its eruptive products are protected in Garibaldi Provincial Park. Founded in 1927 as a Class A provincial park, this wilderness park covers an area of . Lying within its boundaries are a number of other volcanoes, such as Mount Garibaldi and The Black Tusk. Located north of Vancouver in the glaciated Coast Mountains, Garibaldi Provincial Park contains diverse vegetation, iridescent waters and a rich geological history. The park also has abundant wildlife, such as squirrels, chipmunks, Canada jays and flickers. Garibaldi Provincial Park is named after Mount Garibaldi, which is in turn named after the Italian patriot and soldier Giuseppe Garibaldi. Like other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Lake volcanic field, Mount Price is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is. The Canadian National Seismograph Network has been established to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, but it is too far away to provide an accurate indication of activity under the mountain. It may sense an increase in seismic activity if Price becomes highly restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption; the system might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting. If Price were to erupt, mechanisms exist to orchestrate relief efforts. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would respond to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada–United States border or any eruption that would affect Canada. Volcanic hazards At least 63 volcanic events have occurred in the Garibaldi Lake volcanic field in the last 1.3 million years. Since the early Holocene epoch, there has been no eruptive activity. Future eruptions of Mount Price will probably be similar in character to those that have occurred throughout its 1.2 million year eruptive history. The minimum annual probability of an eruption occurring in Canada is about one every 200 years; for an effusive eruption the probability is about one every 220 years and for a large explosive eruption the probability decreases to about one every 3,333 years. This indicates that an eruption in the foreseeable future is more likely to be characterized by fluid lava rather than major explosivity. However, the majority of these effusive eruptions occur in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province of northwestern British Columbia and central Yukon, which is the most active volcanic zone in Canada. In the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, eruptions occur less often, but it is the site of Canada's most explosive volcanism. The change in eruptive style between the two volcanic zones is caused by the different tectonic processes that formed them. Nevertheless, the possibility of passive lava eruptions occurring in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt cannot be ruled out. Effects Mount Price is near the highly populated southwest corner of British Columbia, indicating that it poses a serious threat to the surrounding area. Even though Plinian eruptions have not been identified at Mount Price, Peléan eruptions can also produce large amounts of volcanic ash that could significantly affect the nearby communities of Whistler and Squamish. Mount Price is also situated in the immediate proximity of a major air traffic route. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems. Peléan eruptions may cause short and long term water supply problems for the city of Vancouver and most of the Lower Mainland. The catchment area for the Greater Vancouver watershed is downwind from Mount Price. An eruption producing floods and lahars could destroy parts of the Sea to Sky Highway, threaten communities such as Brackendale and endanger water supplies from Pitt Lake. Fisheries on the Pitt River would also be at risk. These volcanic hazards become more serious as the Lower Mainland grows in population. More than 60% of British Columbia's people live in the Lower Mainland and it is one of Canada's most rapidly changing ecoregions. This is mostly because of its increasing population and economic development. Mount Price rising above Garibaldi Lake with the Pacific Ranges in the background Because andesite is the main type of lava erupted from Mount Price, lava flows are a low to moderate hazard. Andesite lava is intermediate in silica content, indicating that it has a higher viscosity than basaltic lava, but less viscous than dacite and rhyolite lava. As a result, andesite lava flows typically move slower than basaltic lava flows and are less likely to travel far from their source. Dacite and rhyolite lavas are normally too viscous to flow far from a volcanic vent, resulting in the formation of lava domes. An exception is the long Ring Creek dacite lava flow from Opal Cone on the southeastern flank of Mount Garibaldi, a length that is normally attained by basaltic lava flows. Concerns about The Barrier's instability due to volcanic, tectonic or heavy rainfall activity prompted the provincial government to declare the area immediately below it unsafe for human habitation in 1980. This led to the evacuation of the small resort village of Garibaldi nearby and the relocation of residents to new recreational subdivisions away from the hazard zone. Should The Barrier completely collapse, Garibaldi Lake would be entirely released and downstream damage in the Cheakamus and Squamish rivers would be considerable, including major damage to the town of Squamish and possibly an impact-wave on the waters of Howe Sound that would reach Vancouver Island. The landslide area is referred to as the Barrier Civil Defence Zone. Although landslides are unlikely to happen in the near future, warning signs are posted at the zone to make visitors aware of the potential danger and to minimize the chance of fatalities in the event of a slide. For safety reasons, BC Parks recommends visitors not to camp, stop or linger in the Barrier Civil Defence Zone.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 2 to 15% of those infected with HIV are also affected by HCV, increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality due to accelerated liver disease. The burden of co-infection is especially high in certain high-risk groups, such as intravenous drug users and men who have sex with men. These individuals who are HIV-positive are commonly co-infected with HCV due to shared routes of transmission including, but not limited to, exposure to HIV-positive blood, sexual intercourse, and passage of the Hepatitis C virus from mother to infant during childbirth. Infection with HCV can be asymptomatic, resolve itself without treatment, or can lead to cirrhosis or cancer.  Diagnosis   HIV  To diagnose an individual with HIV, a test must be taken to determine if the virus is present in their system. There are several test options including ELISA, at-home, saliva, viral load, and western blot. To establish the presence of the HIV virus, some tests measure the level of HIV antibodies in the blood and/or saliva or the level of both HIV antigens and antibodies in the blood. Other tests can detect the presence of the HIV virus by calculating the amount of actual virus present in the blood. None of the tests available can determine if a person is positive immediately after they believe they have been exposed to the virus. Each test has a window of time after the initial exposure occurred until the test can accurately tell if an individual has been infected or not. One reason for this is because the focus of some of the tests are antibodies. After the initial exposure to the virus, it usually takes 3–4 weeks but it can take up to six months for antibodies to be produced by the body. For nucleic acid tests, like the viral load blood test, it can take anywhere from 10–33 days for the test to provide an accurate result. If an individual's first HIV test is positive, it is recommended for them to take a second test to confirm the results. If this follow-up test is also positive, an HIV positive diagnosis can likely be made.  HCV  For an individual to be diagnosed with HCV, they must first take the hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) screening test. This test is used to determine the presence of HCV antibodies in the blood. It can take anywhere from 3–12 weeks after the time of initial exposure for antibodies to appear in the blood. Therefore, even if a person is infected with HCV, an HCV Ab test may not show a positive result until after that amount of time has passed. If the HCV Ab test result is positive for HCV antibodies, then the individual either has an active HCV infection or previously had an infection which has since cleared. The individual must follow-up with a quantitative and/or qualitative HCV RNA blood test which provides a count of the HCV viral load and indicates if the infection is chronic or not. The virus RNA can be detected in the blood 1–2 weeks after exposure. For a quantitative test, a low viral load is any value below <800,000 IU/L and anything above 800,000 IU/L is considered a high viral load. Lower viral loads at the start of treatment have been associated with greater likelihood to clear the infection. A positive result for a qualitative HCV RNA blood test confirms that the active virus is present in the individual's bloodstream and that the infection is chronic. A negative result can indicate that the person's immune system was able to spontaneously clear their body of the infection without treatment. Lastly, there is an HCV genotype test which is done to identify the particular genotype (or strain) of the HCV virus the individual is infected with. There are a total of six different HCV genotypes. Knowing the specific genotype of the virus is important when deciding on treatment options because some antiviral medications are more effective against certain genotypes.  Mechanism   HIV  HIV is contracted by coming in contact with the bodily fluids of someone HIV positive. These fluids include blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. An individual can become infected with HIV if these fluids enter the bloodstream by way of a mucous membrane, damaged tissue or injection. Common HIV routes of transmission include sharing needles, having unprotected sex with someone who is HIV positive, mother to fetus during pregnancy, being stuck with an HIV-contaminated sharp object, etc. Once the virus has entered the blood stream, it attaches to and enters t-helper cells (CD4 cells) in order to replicate. After reverse transcription, the new viral DNA integrates itself into the host cell's DNA and instructs the cell to produce viral proteins. These viral proteins bud off of the host CD4 cell and move on to infect other CD4 cells which is how the virus spreads in the body and destroys the immune system.  HCV  HCV is transmitted by coming in contact with the blood of someone infected with HCV. The virus is commonly spread by sharing needles, mother to infant during birth, improperly sterilized medical equipment, intercourse with an infected individual, and unregulated tattoos. Once inside the body, the virus enters the liver's hepatocyte cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Inside the cell, the viral RNA undergoes translation and at the end of the whole process, viral proteins are created. These proteins fuse with lipid droplets in the cytosol of the hepatocyte to form a cell known as a high-density HCV precursor. In the golgi apparatus, the HCV precursor cell fuses with two more cells before becoming the HCV lipoviral particle. HCV in this particle form is protected from antibody neutralization which would normally stop the virus from spreading. These lipoviral particles are released out of the hepatocyte to find other hepatocytes to infect.  HIV/HCV  Since the two viruses can be spread in similar ways, it is possible for cotransmission to occur where an individual gets infected with both viruses at the same time. People who are coinfected with HIV and HCV by way of blood contact are more likely to be infected with HCV before HIV. Studies have shown that in comparison to HIV, there is up to a 10 fold greater risk of transmitting HCV after contact with an infected needle.  Signs and Symptoms  Although symptoms of HIV and HCV mono-infection have been well- studied over the years, the symptoms associated with HIV and HCV co-infection remain a developing field of research. Many co-infected individuals report a difficulty in attributing their symptoms to a particular viral infection, indicating an overlap in symptoms of both diseases. This suggests that interventions aiming to reduce the disease burden associated with HIV and HCV co-infection must consist of strategies to manage symptoms of each individual infection. In contrast to HIV and HCV co-infection, there has been significant research delineating the signs and symptoms of each of these individual illnesses. Common symptoms experienced by HIV-infected individuals include fever, night sweats, diarrhea, nausea, headache, and fatigue. On the other hand, symptoms associated with HCV infection include fatigue, depression, urticaria, peripheral neuropathy, joint pain, and irritability. Co-infected individuals can experience a range of these symptoms, with some studies showing fatigue to be the most prevalent symptom.  Risk Factors  Due to the similar routes of transmission of HIV and HCV, HIV-positive individuals are at great risk of HIV and HCV co-infection. These routes of transmission include percutaneous blood exposure, sexual intercourse, and mother-to-child transmission. In the United States, injection drug use is known to be the most common mode of transmission of HCV. Some studies have shown that co-infection is significantly associated with older age as well as illicit intravenous and non-intravenous drug use, and HIV-infected individuals have a higher overall risk of HCV infection irrespective of intravenous drug use or other risk factors.  Epidemiology  At the lowest estimate, there are 35 million individuals infected with HIV and 80 million infected with Hepatitis C worldwide. With the significant global effect of each of these viruses, it is also important to note that there is a considerable overlap of HIV-positive individuals co-infected with HCV. In fact, 20% of HIV-positive individuals also have Hepatitis C. This overlap is related to the common ways these viruses are spread, including contaminated blood and bodily fluids such as semen and vaginal fluids. There are marked differences between groups affected by this co-infection. However, it is consistent that HIV-positive individuals have a higher prevalence of Hepatitis C infection. Of those co-infected with HIV and HCV, almost 60% are intravenous drug users, a high risk group for mono-infection with HIV or HCV. Additionally, prevalence varies by geographical location with the highest prevalence of co-infection located in North Africa and the Middle East versus the lowest prevalence located in East Africa.  History  Over time, liver disease and its complications have arisen as both a morbidity and mortality concern for people with HIV. Studies have determined that co-infection with HIV and HCV is associated with both faster and more severe liver damage than HCV infection alone. In fact, mortality due to liver disease is now one of the top three causes of death in HIV-infected individuals, with 66% of these liver disease-related deaths due to concurrent HCV infection. Additionally, due to the development of novel therapies to treat HIV, antiretroviral therapies, HIV-positive individuals are taking chronic medications to prevent the progression of HIV to AIDS. However, these medications can have negative side effects on the liver, and can therefore worsen liver disease. This is especially important when considering those co-infected with HCV. The effects of HIV infection on HCV have been widely studied. However, the data on the effects of HCV infection on HIV are conflicting. Some studies show that HCV infection does not affect HIV progression, while others have shown a faster progression of HIV in those co- infected with HCV. When considering this conflicting information, it is important to note that many of these studies were completed before the introduction of antiretroviral therapies for HIV, which are now the standard- of-care for HIV-positive individuals. Further research in this area would be beneficial, and is necessary, to determine the effects of HCV infection on HIV disease progression.  Treatment Persons living with an HCV-HIV co- infection are at higher risk for certain adverse medical outcomes, such as accelerated hepatic fibrosis, hepatic decompensation, and immune dysregulation. Due to higher mortality rates in co-infected individuals as a result of accelerated liver disease - in comparison to individuals with HIV mono-infection  the treatment objective would be to primarily target the HCV infection in these individuals. In individuals living with HIV, anti- retroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to preserve immune function, reduce the effects of HIV-related inflammation, and delay hepatic disease. Therefore, treatment plans for individuals with HIV/HCV co-infection include: an initial ART regimen (as recommended for HIV mono-infected individuals); simultaneous HCV treatment involving oral direct-acting antivirals (DAA); and special consideration given to potential for severe drug-drug interactions between the selected medication regimens. When initiating DAA therapy, the individual is typically assessed for ART-naivety. It is recommended that the individual, if not previously already on ART for HIV maintenance, initiate ART 4–6 weeks prior to DAA administration in order to adequately adjust to regimen and provide a greater foundation for efficacious response to HCV treatment. HCV Treatment Options: The overall goal of HCV DAA therapy is to create a Sustained Virological Response for 12 consecutive weeks (SVR12) to ensure the Hepatitis C virus is not detected in the blood. In clinical trials, the use of the following DAA combinations have shown similar efficacy rates (by achieving SVR12) in individuals with HIV/HCV co-infection as those with HCV mono- infection: Elbasvir/Grazoprevir * The Phase 3, open-label, single-arm C-EDGE CO-INFECTION Study showed that 96% (210 out of 218) of individuals with HCV genotype 1,4, or 6 and HIV co-infection were able to attain SVR12 at the end of the 12-week course of treatment. Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir * The Phase 3, multi-center EXPEDITION-2 Study showed that an 8-week treatment in HIV/HCV co- infected individuals with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 without cirrhosis provided an overall SVR12 of 100% (136 out of 136 individuals), while a 12-week treatment in HIV/HCV co-infected individuals with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 with compensated cirrhosis provided an overall SVR12 of 93% (14 out of 15 individuals). Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir * The multi-center, open-label, ION-4 Study showed that a 12-week course of treatment provided an overall SVR12 of 96% (321 out of 335 individuals) in individuals co-infected with HIV and HCV genotype 1 or 4. Due to limited clinical safety data, the following DAA combinations, while available, are not be considered as first-line therapies: Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir/Voxilaprevir  Barriers to Care  Barriers to care exist when discussing therapeutic options for HCV/HIV co-infected individuals. For example, other co-morbidities such as severe hepatic decompensation, cardiac disease, and renal disorders contribute to treatment barriers since these individuals would not be eligible for anti- retroviral therapy. Individuals with continued alcohol/drug/substance abuse and those that exhibit depressive symptoms along with suicidal ideations are also subject to ineligible status for HCV treatment in HCV/HIV co-infected persons.

Illuzzi was first elected to the Vermont Senate in 1980. At 27, he was the youngest person ever elected to the Vermont Senate. He served from 1981 to 2013. He did not run for reelection in 2012, and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for Vermont Auditor of Accounts. Background and personal life Vincent Illuzzi was born in Montpelier, Vermont, on September 17, 1953. An attorney, he received his A.B. degree from Saint Michael's College in 1975 and a J.D. degree from Vermont Law School in 1978. Illuzzi is married to Eileen Maher. The couple live in Derby and have one son. Illuzzi is the son of Vincent Illuzzzi, Sr. (1920-2013), born in Giovinazzo, Italy, who emigrated to the US at the age of 17 and became a granite sculptor. Illuzzi, Sr. carved one of the largest monuments ever shipped from Barre, a granite sculpture depicting a person chained to a wall that is part of the Taras Shevchenko Memorial located near Dupont Circle, Washington DC. He also supported the restoration of the Old Labor Hall and the Vermont Granite Museum in Barre. As Illuzzi, Jr. summed it up when he delivered his father's eulogy: \\"Not bad for a 17 year old kid with an eighth grade education who couldn’t speak English who left home and traveled to a faraway place called America to make his mark on life.\\" Public life Senate Illuzzi was first elected to the Senate in 1980 and was re- elected every two years through 2010. In the Senate, he served as Assistant Minority leader from 1985 to 1988 and Assistant Republican leader from 1991 to 1992 and 1997 to 2005. He served as Republican leader in 2005.Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation, Advisory Board Member biography, Vincent Illuzzi, 2013  Legislative Accomplishments  In 2005, Sen. Illuzzi was appointed chair of the Senate Economic Development, General Affairs & Housing Committee, and served on the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Economic Development Committee was substantially responsible for the Vermont Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Act 54 of 2009, or H. 313) the purpose of which was “to promote the economic development of the state and the prosperity of its businesses and citizens. In the near-term . . . to address the immediate economic crisis facing Vermont.” Six years later, the Farm to Plate initiative, a part of that Act, appeared \\"to be doing its job and has noticeably helped bolster Vermont’s farm and food economy\\" according to a report conducted by the Vermont Sustainable Jobs Fund. Another major bill introduced by the Economic Development Committee was S. 288, the “Jobs Bill,” which became Act 78 of 2010. This law appropriated $8.665 million to build on the work in Act 54 of 2009. It included funding for: the Vermont Economic Development Authority to buy down interest rates on approved projects; the Vermont Telecommunications Authority for rural broadband deployment; the Vermont Employment Training Program to assist with training Vermont workers; marketing tourism in regional markets; assisting Vermont farmers to restructure and refinance debt and other projects. The Committee also cleaned up the law regarding the sale and ownership of mobile homes, making clear to municipalities, and to the buyers and sellers of mobile homes, their rights and responsibilities. Mobile homes are the only way that many Vermonters can secure affordable housing, but the law never had been comprehensively updated. Act 140 of 2010, or H. 542 The committee was also charged with finding cost savings and efficiencies in the Unified Economic Development Budget, which includes regional development corporations, regional planning commissions and workforce development programs. To that end, it implemented \\"Challenges for Change. Act 146 of 2010, or H. 792 Governor Howard Dean, whose tenure as governor largely tracked Illuzzi's tenure as chair of Senate Institutions, on December 10, 2002, said at the dedication ceremony of the McFarland House that Illuzzi had been particularly sympathetic to the appropriation requests from Washington County. Dean said if you got Illuzzi's answering machine, you were prompted to push one if you want projects for the Northeast Kingdom and two if you want projects for Barre. Illuzzi was Chair of the Senate Committee on Economic Development, General and Military Affairs from 2005. In that capacity, March 30, 2012, Illuzzi, along with fellow committee members, Senators Peter Galbraith and Bill Doyle, visited Windham County to be accessible to and to hear testimony from local officials, business owners on the effects of the uncertainty surrounding the possible closure of the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Plant and the region’s recovery from Tropical Storm Irene. Numerous individuals testified, likely even more than listed in the official meeting record A video of the hearing is available, courtesy of Brattleboro Community Television. After serving in the State Senate for 31 years, the Caledonian Record summed up his career by saying: \\"His ability to work with both sides of the aisle has been praised by moderates who admire his work ethic and his ability to get things done.\\" In that article, Illuzzi said by way of summary: \\"When I entered the political arena as a Republican almost a third of a century ago, I quickly found myself voting as a moderate Vermont Republican. In those early years, I served with independent-thinking individuals like Senators Arthur Gibb, Robert Gannett and George Little. They too were moderate Vermont Republicans. \\"I learned from them that Vermont leaders have a responsibility to act in the best interest of all Vermonters regardless of party affiliation.\\"  Vermont Veterans' Cemetery  An example of how Sen. Illuzzi used the legislative appropriation process to champion Vermont values is his inclusion of the following provision in a 1992 Capital Construction Bill: > The Vermont veterans' memorial cemetery. . . shall allow for freedom of > choice by the family of a veteran, a veteran's spouse and a veteran's minor > child, who will be interred, of an upright or flat memorialization to mark > the grave. Preference shall be given to the use of Vermont granite, Vermont > slate, and Vermont marble for all memorialization. Cf: 20 V.S.A. § 1585 Act > 256, enacted by the adjourned session of the 1991 Vermont General Assembly, > cf.: While the national Veterans' Administration preferred to use markers flush to the ground to make it easier to mow the grass and maintain the grounds, Illuzzi recalled his father’s work as a sculptor in the granite industry and knew that markers flush to the ground are not as visually significant and their use would certainly undercut the Barre granite industry and the West Rutland and Proctor marble industry. After including that requirement as a condition of the appropriation, the US Department of Veterans Affairs reconsidered its national policy and about six months after the Vermont cemetery opened, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on Jan. 19, 1994 authorized the nationwide reintroduction of upright granite headstones. While Sen. Illuzzi was unable to attend on the day of the dedication of the cemetery, as chair of the Senate Institutions Committee, he designated a member of the committee, Senator Julius Canns of St. Johnsbury, Caledonia County, to appear and speak in his place. Senator Canns was a World War II veteran who served in the Pacific Theatre as a sergeant in the U. S. Marine Corps and he is now buried at that cemetery.  Old Labor Hall In Barre  Illuzzi led the effort to secure the first state appropriation to save the likely demolition of the Socialist Labor Party Hall, also known as the Old Labor Hall, at 46 Granite Street in Barre. It was slated for a foreclosure auction and several Barre residents were concerned the building would be torn down. As chair of the Senate Institutions Committee (1991-2015), and with support from Washington County Sen. Bill Doyle, who was a member of that committee, Illuzzi successfully secured a $40,000 appropriation to stave off the foreclosure and convince the local bank that the Barre Historical Society could raise the necessary funds to pay off the mortgage and restore the building.  Barre Granite Museum  The Barre Granite Museum, now known as the Vermont Granite Museum of Barre, was another project spearheaded by Illuzzi, also when he was chair of the Senate Institutions Committee. Jones Brothers Company from 1870 to 1975 had operated two granite sheds on North Main Street in Barre. The remaining shed was falling into a state of disrepair. Washington County Senators Bill Doyle, Matt Krauss and other Washington County legislators approached Illuzzi to help Barre residents secure state funding to preserve the building before it collapsed. At Illuzzi's recommendation, a $200,000 appropriation jump-started fundraising efforts to purchase the property in 1997, put on a new roof and secure the foundation. Resolutions Sen. Illuzzi was also instrumental in using the March 2012 meeting to honor former State Senator Robert Gannett in what would turn out to be his last public appearance. State Representative Sarah Edwards read the Senate Concurrent Resolution honoring Sen. Gannett. In 1992, Sen. Illuzzi authored what became a Joint Resolution ordering that the new Addison County courthouse in Middlebury, Vermont be named the “Judge Frank Mahady Courthouse.” Illuzzi led the effort to name the courthouse in Chittenden County after Judge Edward Costello, who served as chief trial judge from 1967 to 1980. The resolution is quoted as stating that “…during all of those years, Judge Costello was known as a fair, efficient and impartial judge…” During his tenure in the Senate, Illuzzi either led or otherwise guided the effort to rename a number of other State facilities, including: the Asa Bloomer State Office Building in Rutland; the Robert H. Wood, Jr. Criminal Justice and Fire Service Training Center of Vermont in Pittsford; the Edgar M. Weed State Fish Hatchery in Grand Isle; the John J. Zampieri State Office Building in Burlington; the Emory A. Hebard State Office Building and the adjacent Warren \\"Jersey\\" Drown Parking Facility in Newport. cf 29 V.S.A. § 821 Other government service Illuzzi holds the office of Essex County State's Attorney, to which he was first elected in 1998. He has uniquely been endorsed by and accepted the nomination of all Parties to serve in this office. He also served on the Governor's Committee on Children and Youth and the Governor's Commission on the Administration of Justice. Statewide office In 2007, Illuzzi was mentioned by then State Senator Peter Shumlin (a Democrat) as a potential independent candidate for governor. In 2012, Illuzzi chose to run for State Auditor, as Republican incumbent Tom Salmon was retiring. Illuzzi had reportedly considered running as an independent. He had some endorsements from labor unions, and had hoped that would make voters not see him as a typical Republican. The Caledonian Record endorsed his candidacy, saying: > The Republican candidate, Senator Vince Illuzzi of Newport, has served 32 > years in the Senate, and also for many years as Essex County state's > attorney. A liberal Republican who has been elected on both party tickets, > he has earned high marks from both sides for his mastery of the legislative > process and his knowledge of the workings of state government. Iluzzi lost in the general election to Democratic and Progressive candidate Doug Hoffer. He said after the election, \\"It was a tsunami for Democrats... I can sense that running as a Republican was a real liability.\\"Hallenbeck, Terri. \\"Hoffer's win surprising to many: 'Forgotten man' to become Vt. auditor\\" Burlington Free Press November 7, 2012 Controversy In 1993, Illuzzi received a six-month suspension of his law license for filing three complaints to the Judicial Conduct Board against Vermont Judge David Suntag. The complaints related to Judge Suntag's scheduling Essex County cases in other courtrooms. During the fifth month of his suspension, the Vermont Supreme Court and the Vermont Professional Conduct Board found that Illuzzi had made unfounded complaints against a trial judge, and his law license suspension was continued. He had his license restored in 1998.Jon Margolis, VTDigger, Will Illuzzi’s past hurt his chances – and should it?, June 28, 2012 The Vermont Supreme Court, over the years, has attempted to close some of the more rural courthouses.

In 1992, responding to appeals from Essex County's assistant judges that Judge David Suntag was hearing Essex County family court cases as far away as Chelsea, over away, Senator Illuzzi inserted a provision in that year’s Capital Construction BillAct 256 of 1992, Sec. 31g that read included the sentence: \\"No Essex Family Court cases shall be heard at any other location, except Guildhall.\\"jvwalt, Green Mountain Daily, Illuzzi Whitewash Streak over: Mark Johnson FTW, March 12, 2012Paul Lefebvre, Barton Chronicle, A day in Vince Illuzzi’s quest for statewide office, October 23, 2012 Judge Suntag subsequently scheduled cases elsewhere. Senator Illuzzi, on his Senate letterhead, then filed complaints against Suntag with the Judicial Conduct Board. The leading complaints related to Suntag's continued refusal to hold Family Court hearings in the Essex County at the court house in Guildhall. Senator Illuzzi was not involved in those cases as an attorney. The Judicial Conduct Board of the Vermont Supreme Court dismissed the complaints against Suntag and filed a complaint against Illuzzi for filing them. Since Illuzzi was a lawyer, the Supreme Court had jurisdiction over his law license. The Professional Conduct Board, which is appointed by the Supreme Court, investigated the Court's complaint and recommended Illuzzi be disbarred for filing the complaint in his capacity as a state senator against Suntag. Judge Suntag's wife, the Bar Counsel, prosecuted Illuzzi. The charges were that Senator Illuzzi violated the Vermont Bar's Disciplinary Rule DR 8-101(A)(2) (lawyer who holds public office shall not use position to influence tribunal to act in favor of himself or client); DR 1-102(A)(5) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct prejudicial to administration of justice); and DR 1 -102(A)(7)(lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on fitness to practice law). Illuzzi stipulated to an 18 month suspension with the expectation that his stipulations would mitigate the Supreme Court's complaint, but the Professional Conduct Board recommended disbarment. Illuzzi appealed the Board’s recommendation to the Vermont Supreme Court and he asked that Justices Gibson, Dooley, Johnson and Morse recuse themselves because they filed the complaint and would be sitting in judgment of the resolution of the complaint, and other reasons. When Dooley, Johnson and Morse refused, he sued them in U.S. District Court. The presiding federal district court judge delayed ruling on the case until Dooley, Johnson and Morse recused themselves (164 VT 623). A substitute Supreme Court then agreed to a negotiated 18-month suspension of his law license (165 VT 598). In ratifying the suspension, the Supreme Court noted that Illuzzi had been guilty of five prior disciplinary offenses. As of February 9, 1998, Attorney Illuzzi had completed all requirements for reinstatement of his license to practice law, including successful completion of an ethics course and support from other lawyers and judges. However, the Court refused to sign the two-sentence reinstatement order until July 28, 1998. Three days later, the state's largest newspaper, The Burlington Free Press, editorialized that Illuzzi was being unfairly treated by the Supreme Court. The editorial was titled \\"Disorder in the court: Vermont's Supreme Court behaved in far too political and personal a fashion in the case of state Sen. Vincent Illuzzi.\\" The editorial criticized the Court for its handling of the case and commented: \\"The court restored Illuzzi's license to practice law this week, but that is no more remedy than a bank robber's returning the cash. Illuzzi, who never deserved to lose his license in the first place, should have had it back six months ago.\\"The text of the full Free Press editorial read as follows: \\"Reasonable people would think, with the state Supreme Court under political attack, the justices would make a point of excessive scrupulousness these days. Instead, the court's mishandling of state Sen. Vincent Illuzzi reveals shabby procedures at best, and a susceptibility to petty politics at worst. It does not demonstrate the professionalism and impartiality Vermonters expect from the state's highest court. The court restored Illuzzi's license to practice law this week, but that is no more remedy than a bank robber's returning the cash. Illuzzi, who never deserved to lose his license in the first place, should have had it back six months ago. Not that the Essex-Orleans Republican is a saint. A controversial lawmaker, he remains one of Vermont's most censured lawyers, and some of these reprimands were deserved. However, in 1993 he filed a valid complaint that Judge David Suntag was ignoring the state law requiring him to hear Essex County family court cases in that county. Suntag was making families, lawyers, witnesses and assistant judges trek to him instead. Parties in one child support case, for example, had to drive 100 miles for a hearing. The Supreme Court offhandedly dismissed the complaint against Suntag, and initiated action against Illuzzi. His prosecution was a masterpiece of character assassination, from inviting testimony by political opponents, to reviewing 10 years of Illuzzi's financial records, to asking witnesses whether he had ever molested children. The prosecution even sent Illuzzi a bill for the cost of its investigation. The result: Illuzzi lost his license to practice law. As for the dismissed complaint, at least three other senators raised the same issue without paying a penalty. When Suntag faced reappointment by the Legislature, he came within a dozen votes of being fired. The American Bar Association has since recommended that Vermont overhaul its lawyer discipline system. The injustice did not end there; it lasted till this week. Illuzzi's suspension required him to take an ethics course and pass an exam, both of which he did long ago. He applied for reinstatement properly, last year. Favorable witnesses at his hearing last winter included lawyers and current and former judges. No one spoke against him. The deadline for action was Feb. 9. Yet the court did not return his license till July 28. That is not merely a case of denying a man his livelihood without justification; it is also a violation of the court's own rules. Only after news accounts last week did the five justices sign the two-sentence reinstatement. Part of the purpose of the court system is to stand apart from political concerns and provide just resolution of disputes. In this instance, from 1993 till now, the court has fallen far below that standard.\\" However, the General Assembly came close to not reelecting Suntag for another six-year term of office. (Vermont judges are reelected by the General Assembly every six years.)USLegal, State-by-State Summary of Judicial Selection, accessed April 6, 2013 Illuzzi was profiled in a Boston Globe article by Jon Margolis shortly after he was reinstated to practice.

Firestone's and Koedt's desire to start this new group was aided by Vivian Gornick's 1969 Village Voice article, \\"The Next Great Moment in History Is Theirs\\". The end of this essay announced the formation of the group and included a contact address and phone number, raising considerable national interest from prospective members.Echols, Daring to Be Bad, p 187.Gornick, Vivian.

NYRF was organized into small cells or \\"brigades\\" named after notable feminists of the past; Koedt and Firestone led the Stanton-Anthony Brigade. Central to NYRF's philosophy was the idea that men consciously maintained power over women in order to strengthen their egos, and that women internalized their subordination by diminishing their egos.Echols, Daring to Be Bad, p 187–189. :Reprinted as: Preview. This analysis represented a rejection of the two other prevailing theories of women's subordination current at the time – Redstockings' \\"Pro-Woman Line\\", which emphasized men's subordination of women and women's often deliberate adaptations to that reality, and The Feminists' theory that emphasized women's subordination as being rooted in the unconscious playing out of internalized sex roles.Echols, Daring to Be Bad, p 188–189.Willis, Ellen.

A year later Christian Krogh, Erik Werenskiold, Eilif Peterssen, and Hans Heyerdahl started another art school, where Boeckmann was a student until 1885. In 1886, Boeckmann emigrated to America. He created paintings of several well-known Norwegian immigrants, including Reverend Elling Eielsen and Colonel Hans C. Heg of the 15th Wisconsin Volunteer Regiment in the Civil War Battle of Chickamauga. Other well-known Americans who posed for Boeckmann included President William McKinley, Governor William Merriam, Governor John Sargent Pillsbury, Cyrus Northrop, and John Burroughs. In 1893, Boeckmann won a gold medal at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He also received a silver medal for a portrait of Congressman Edmund Rice of St. Paul. In 1905, Boeckmann permanently settled in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1914, he received an honorarium and an award for painting the historic fight that took place at Killdeer Mountain in North Dakota on July 26, 1864.

He was a professor at the University of Bordeaux, at Montpellier, at Université de Paris and finally at Collège de France. His nephew was the author André Gide.  Academic work  An initiator of the Revue d'économie politique in 1887, Gide was a proponent of the French historical school of economics. Gide was one of the few endorsers of Léon Walras, as they shared a social philosophy, social activism, and disdain for the \\"Manchester-style\\" economics of the journalistes.\\"History of Economic Thought\\" , The French Liberal School Website. Note: The French Liberal School had lost interest in serious economic theory by the 1830s.  Social activism  During the early 1880s Gide worked with Édouard de Boyve, founder in 1884 of the cooperative Abeille Nîmoise, and with the former manufacturer Auguste Marie Fabre. These three men founded the French cooperative philosophy that came to be known as the École de Nîmes. The Sociétés Coopératives de Consommation de France had its first national congress in Paris on 27 July 1885. The journal l'Émancipation was initiated at this meeting, and was published first on 15 November 1886 in Nîmes. Gide, de Boyve and Fabre all contributed to the journal. Gide was active in the social Protestant movement, as were other Musée social members such as Jules Siegfried (1837–1922), Édouard Gruner (1849–1933), Henri Monod (1843–1911) and Pierre-Paul Guieysse (1841–1914). As a Protestant Christian Socialist, Gide was involved with progressive politics in France, endorsing the université populaire philosophy after the Dreyfus Affair. He promoted the establishment of a School for Advanced Social Studies (École supérieure de sciences sociales) (1899). Additionally, he served among the early faculty of the École supérieure de journalisme de Paris.\\"Histoire\\" , Ecole Supérieure de Journalisme de Paris website, accessed 4 July 2011 Together with the School for Social Studies, it was established in 1899 as one of three grandes écoles developing from the Collège libre de science sociales initiated in 1895. Gide endorsed the Union pour la Verite (League for Truth) created by philosopher Paul Desjardins in 1892 promoting the cause of the Jewish army officer Alfred Dreyfus during the political scandal involving him. Gide was interested in reform projects as well, such as the Alliance d'Hygiène Sociale (Alliance of Social Hygiene, created in 1905), and reported on the social economy exhibition at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900.Pierre- Yves Saunier, \\"Review of Marc Penin, 'Charles Gide 1847–1932.

His book, Consumers' Co-operative Societies, which was published first in French in 1904, and in English in 1921, is a classic of co-operative economics, in the tradition of Co-operative Federalism.

From there, he relates the struggles and alliances between Persia and Byzantium. The second section narrates the ascent of a new political and military force, the Ishmaelites (i.e. Arabs) in year 622 CE. This section describes how Mahmed first established a community comprising Ishmaelites and Jews based on their common descent from Abraham; the Arabs via Ishmael, and the Jews via Isaac. From there, the Ishmaelites made dramatic territorial gains, including their victory over the Sassanian dynasty, and the narrative goes in to the division of the Ishmaelite armies and the beginnings of the First Fitna.

In the meter gauge era Purna was the most important Junction. Hundreds of railway employees were then stationed at Purna. Nearly 50% of the population of the Purna city then was constituted with railway employees and their families. Purna has massive land occupied by the Railway Department for staff quarters, filling point, washing area, etc. Railway Department has its own schools in Marathi and English, community cultural hall, sports complexes, and fields. The economy of the city was mainly dependent of the railway population. All the trains then would halt here for 20 minutes to 90 minutes. The crew would change here and fueling/watering to the trains would be done here. The engines of the majority trains would be changed here then. The railway population had then enriched the sports culture of the city. After creation of the Nanded division, all major operations of railways were diverted from Purna junction to Nanded.

He served on the North York City Council and the Metropolitan Toronto Council for several years, and challenged Mel Lastman for Mayor of North York in 1976. Early life and career Sutherland was born in Toronto, received a journalism degree from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute, and worked for a large electrical manufacturing firm before entering political life. North York councillor Sutherland was elected to North York's eleventh ward in 1964, following failed bids in 1960 and 1962. He remained a ward councillor until 1974, when he was elected to a seat on the North York Board of Control. The position also gave him an automatic place on the Metropolitan Toronto council. Sutherland campaigned for Mayor of North York in 1976, as the primary challenger to incumbent mayor Mel Lastman. A The Globe and Mail editorial from the election campaign indicates that his area of expertise was finance, and that his approach to politics was \\"responsible - if somewhat stiff\\".\\"Those borough ballots\\" [editorial], The Globe and Mail, 29 November 1976, p. 6. He said that North York's council had developed a \\"circus image\\" under Lastman, and promised to restore dignity and respect to the institution. Lastman argued that Sutherland's approach to politics was grounded in secretive backroom deals.\\"The tortoise and hare mayoral race in North York\\", The Globe and Mail, 4 December 1976, p. 4. Lastman won by a convincing margin. Sutherland spent two years out of politics after losing to Lastman; a newspaper report from 1977 lists him as chair of the North York Historical Board.Zena Cherry (column), The Globe and Mail, 5 December 1977, P29. He was elected to a position on the North York Hydro Commission in 1978, and was later chosen as Commission Chair.\\"Hydro customers prefer old name\\", The Globe and Mail, 10 August 1979, P4. In 1980, he encouraged North York residents to delay washing their dishes to preserve electricity during peak hours.\\"Hydro persuading housewives to put off doing those dishes\\", The Globe and Mail, 3 January 1980, T8. After two years on the Hydro Commission, Sutherland was re-elected to North York's Board of Control in 1980 and re- assumed his position on the Metro Council. He was re-elected in 1982. Sutherland frequently supported the autonomy of municipal councils over perceived encroachments from the provincial and federal governments.Alden Baker, \\"5-year deal raises Metro rent in City Hall 50%\\", The Globe and Mail, 23 April 1981, P20; Denys Horgan, \\"\\"Greene bid shakes North York\\", The Globe and Mail, 2 November 1982, P4. He was also critical of the degree of power centred in Metro Chairman Paul Godfrey.Alden Baker, \\"Pushes buttons and pulls strings Godfrey's in charge of Metro\\", The Globe and Mail, 19 July 1982, P4. As a Metro Councillor, Sutherland was entrusted with overseeing the police budget. He was also a prominent advocate of the SkyDome and the Metro Zoo.Ross Laver, \\"Metro approves $30 million stadium grant\\", The Globe and Mail, 29 February 1984, S1. Sutherland was quoted as saying \\"damn the torpedoes - full speed ahead\\" on the plan to construct the Skydome. He once advocated against a proposal to study the feasibility of a bridge or tunnel to the Toronto Islands, speaking on the joys of ferry travel. His speech is believed to have helped defeat the proposal. He opposed an affirmative action plan for North York in 1984, arguing that women in the city were not discriminated against.Dyanne Rivers, The Globe and Mail, 27 September 1984, M5. Sutherland also supported an extension of the Spadina Expressway into downtown Toronto.Geoffrey York, \\"Stadium backers irked by Spadina decision\\", The Globe and Mail, 25 January 1985, M5.

They both retired from council in 1985. Their son, Paul Sutherland, was also a North York and Toronto city councillor, and an unsuccessful candidate for the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party. Retirement Early in 1986, Sutherland wrote against a plan to make the North York Hydro Commission a city department and directly responsible to council. He argued that plans to roll the city's Hydro surplus into general revenue would result in higher electricity rates.William Sutherland, \\"Hydro's surplus shouldn't be seen as tax revenue\\", Toronto Star, 27 May 1986, N4.

Solum depth is 11 inches and soil depth is 14 inchesThe solum (plural, sola) in soil science consists of the surface and subsoil layers that have undergone the same soil forming conditions. The base of the solum is the relatively unweathered parent material. Solum and soils are not synonymous. Some soils include layers that are not affected by soil formation. These layers are not part of the solum. The number of genetic horizons ranges from one to many. A surface layer that is 10 cm thick overlying bedrock can be by itself the solum. A soil that consists only of recently deposited alluvium or recently exposed soft sediment does not have a solum. In terms of soil horizon designations, a solum consists of A, E, and B horizons and their transitional horizons and some O horizons. Included are horizons with an accumulation of carbonates or more soluble salts if they are either within, or contiguous, to other genetic horizons and are at least partly produced in the same period of soil formation. The solum of a soil presently at the surface, for example, includes all horizons now forming. The solum of a soil is not necessarily confined to the zone of major biological activity. A solum does not have a maximum or a minimum thickness. The lower limit should relate to the depth of rooting to be expected for perennial plants assuming that soil moisture conditions and soil chemistry are not limiting. In some soils the lower limit of the solum can be set only arbitrarily and needs to be defined in relation to the particular soil. For example, horizons of carbonate accumulation are easily visualized as part of the solum in many soils in arid and semiarid environments. To conceive of hardened carbonate accumulations extending for 5 meters or more below the B horizon as part of the solum is more difficult. Gleyed soil material begins in some soils a few centimeters below the surface and continues practically unchanged to a depth of many meters. Gleying immediately below the A horizon is likely to be related to the processes of soil formation in the modern soil. At great depth, gleying is likely to be relict or related to processes that are more geological than pedological. Much the same kind of problem exists in some deeply weathered soils in which the deepest material penetrated by roots is very similar to the weathered material at much greater depth. In Scottish law, the solum is the area of ground that lies inside the walls or foundations of a building.

They drew nationwide media attention when they unfurled a banner inside the 1968 Miss America pageant displaying the words \\"Women's Liberation\\". Origins The protest group was founded in New York City in the fall of 1967, by former television child star Robin Morgan, Carol Hanisch, Shulamith Firestone, and Pam Allen. Early members included Ros Baxandall, Patricia Mainardi, Irene Peslikis, Kathie Sarachild, and Ellen Willis.Maren Lockwood Carden, The New Feminist Movement (1974, Russell Sage Foundation)Echols, Alice. Daring to be Bad: Radical Feminism in America New York Radical Women were a group of young friends in their twenties who were part of the New Left, who had grown tired of the male-dominated civil rights and antiwar movements, and men who they saw as still preferring their female counterparts to stay at home.Maurice Isserman & Michael Kazin, America Divided, (New York, Oxford University press, 2000) Because Carol Hanisch was the head of the New York office of the Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF), by early 1968 Hanisch had secured the SCEF offices for the weekly meetings of New York Radical Women, and it remained their base until the group dissolved in the early 1970s.Brownmiller, Susan (1999). In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution. Dial Press, pp. 20–21, 23.  Protests  New York Radical Women's first public action was at the convocation of the Jeannette Rankin Brigade. Members of the group led an alternative protest event, a \\"burial of traditional womanhood\\", held in Arlington National Cemetery. Kathie Sarachild wrote a flier for the keynote speech she gave at the convocation, and in this flier she coined the phrase \\"Sisterhood is Powerful\\". The group also participated in the Miss America protest with their brochure No More Miss America in Atlantic City, NJ, on September 7, 1968. About 400 women were drawn together from across the United States to a protest outside the event. The women symbolically threw a number of \\"feminine\\" products into a large trash can. These included mops, pots and pans, Playboy magazines, false eyelashes, high-heeled shoes, curlers, hairspray, makeup, girdles, corsets, and bras, items the protestors called \\"instruments of female torture.\\" Carol Hanisch, one of the protest organizers, said \\"We had intended to burn it, but the police department, since we were on the boardwalk, wouldn't let us do the burning.\\" A New York Post story about the protest made an analogy between the feminist protest and Vietnam War protesters who burned their draft cards. It has been argued there was no bra burning, nor did anyone take off her bra. A local news story reporting on the event did report there was a burning of bras and other items. It said \\"as the bras, girdles, falsies, curlers, and copies of popular women's magazines burned in the 'Freedom Trash Can'...\\" Hanisch said, \\"Up until this time, we hadn't done a lot of actions yet. We were a very small movement. It was kind of a gutsy thing to do. Miss America was this 'American pie' icon. Who would dare criticize this?\\" Along with tossing the items into the trash can, they marched with signs, passed out pamphlets, and crowned a live sheep, comparing the beauty pageant to livestock competitions at county fairs. A small group bought tickets and entered the hall. While 1967 Miss America, Debra Barnes Snodgrass, was giving her farewell address, four protestors unfurled a bed sheet from the balcony that said \\"Women's Liberation\\" and began to shout. They were quickly removed by police but drew coverage by newspapers from across the United States. \\"The media picked up on the bra part,\\" Hanisch said later. \\"I often say that if they had called us 'girdle burners,' every woman in America would have run to join us.\\" In January 1969, the last event they attended was the Counter-Inauguration in Washington D.C. The protest targeted women who supported the Vietnam War. Protestors were sent invitations telling them not to bring flowers or even to cry at the 'burial', but to be prepared to bury traditional female roles.  Publications  Notes from the Second Year: Women's Liberation (1970) The organization compiled and published feminist texts in Notes from the First Year (1968), followed by Notes from the Second Year (1970). \\"Principles\\" by New York Radical Women was included in the 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women's Liberation Movement, edited by Robin Morgan. Notes from the First Year is based on speeches given by members and discussions held at the weekly meetings of the New York Radical Women in 1968. This pamphlet was part of a movement of mimeographed movement journals that coincided with the new radical feminism erupting in the United States. Many pieces from this pamphlet were foundational in the development of what we now call women and gender studies. The pamphlet notably marks the first appearance of the theory that would later grow into Anne Koedt's well-known pamphlet and book, The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm. Notes from the Second Year was created in response to the popularity and demand for Notes from the First Year.Firestone, Shulamith and Anne Koedt, “Editorial.” Notes from the Second Year: Women’s Liberation: Major Writings of the Radical Feminists, 1970, pp. 1. It was produced as a radical feminist periodical to present new ideas and clarify relevant political issues. Articles chosen were seen to be politically important and/or influential and have the potential to open up further debate. With its choice to publish new material rather than material that had already been widely circulated, the publication notably marks the first appearance of foundational women and gender studies theories such as Carole Hanisch’s “The Personal is Political,” and Kate Millet’s “Sexual Politics: A Manifesto for Revolution,” which would later become part of her classic feminist book Sexual Politics.  Dissolution  By 1969, ideological differences split the group into a radical feminist faction and a socialist feminist (or \\"politico\\") faction. Tension grew between the two splinter groups until January 1969 when the organization fell apart. Socialist feminists like Robin Morgan left to form Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell (W.I.T.C.H.), while radical feminists led by Shulamith Firestone and Ellen Willis started Redstockings.

The 1991 film is based upon the character of the same name, created by comic book artist and writer Dave Stevens. Set in 1938 Los Angeles, California, The Rocketeer tells the story of stunt pilot Cliff Secord who stumbles upon a hidden rocket-powered jet pack that he thereafter uses to fly without the need of an aircraft. His heroic deeds soon attract the attention of Howard Hughes and the FBI, who are hunting for the missing jet pack, as well as the Nazi operatives that stole it from Hughes. Development for The Rocketeer started as far back as 1983, when Stevens sold the film rights. Steve Miner and William Dear considered directing The Rocketeer before Johnston signed on. Screenwriters Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo had creative differences with Disney, causing the film to languish in development hell.Mitchell, Kerrie. \\"Dept. of development hell.\\" Premiere (American edition), Volume 18, Issue 5, February 2005, p. 40. The studio also intended to change the trademark helmet design; Disney CEO Michael Eisner wanted a straight NASA-type helmet, but Johnston convinced the studio otherwise. Johnston also had to convince Disney to let him cast actor Billy Campbell in the lead role. Filming for The Rocketeer lasted from September 19, 1990 to January 22, 1991. The visual effects sequences were created and designed by Industrial Light & Magic, and were supervised by animation director Wes Takahashi. The film was released on June 21, 1991, and received positive reviews from critics.Maltin 2000, p. 302. Plans for Rocketeer sequels were abandoned after the film was a disappointment at the box office, grossing a relatively modest $46 million on a $35 million budget. However, a television series based on the movie, premiered on Disney Junior in November 2019. Plot In 1938 Los Angeles, two gangsters in Eddie Valentine's gang steal a rocket pack from Howard Hughes. During their escape from the authorities that ends up on an airfield, one gangster is killed, the getaway driver hides the rocket pack, and stunt pilot Cliff Secord's Gee Bee racer is destroyed in the resulting auto-airplane accident, crippling his career. Cliff and airplane mechanic Peevy later find the rocket pack hidden inside a biplane cockpit. Movie star Neville Sinclair had hired Valentine's gang to steal the rocket pack, and he sends his monstrous, yet skilled henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him about his hiding the rocket pack at the airfield. Cliff's girlfriend is aspiring actress Jenny Blake, who has a small part in Sinclair's latest swashbuckling film, but recent events begin to drive a wedge in their relationship. Sinclair overhears Cliff attempting to tell Jenny about the rocket pack, so he invites her to dinner. Afterward, at a local air show, Cliff uses the rocket pack (and Peevy's newly designed face- hiding finned helmet) to rescue his elderly friend Malcolm, who is piloting the over-aged biplane. The newsreel press and Valentine's gangsters all see him from the airshow audience, whereupon \\"The Rocketeer\\" becomes a media sensation, but also sets Sinclair and the FBI on Cliff's tail. Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to find the rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape while Lothar steals the rocket pack's detailed schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy are trapped by several Valentine mobsters; they learn about Jenny's date with Sinclair, and the actor's involvement in the hunt for the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket pack's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum. Cliff proceeds to the South Seas Club, where he tells Jenny about his new rocket-powered alter ego. The Valentine gang arrives, and Jenny is kidnapped by Sinclair in the ensuing melée. At Sinclair's home, Jenny discovers that he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out, but is soon re-detained and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing; he shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of soldiers using rocket packs to invade the United States. He also then mentions the FBI are trying to locate a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes and the FBI demand the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes (using a scale model prototype of the Spruce Goose as a glider), but inadvertently leaves behind a clue to where he is headed. Cliff flies to the rendezvous, where Sinclair demands for Cliff to hand over the rocket pack, but Cliff divulges to Eddie and his gang that the actor is a Nazi, and the evidence quickly backs Cliff up. The infuriated Valentine and his gang turn their weapons on the seemingly off-guard Sinclair and Lothar, but Sinclair summons a troop of heavily armed Nazi S.A. hidden at the observatory. The Nazi rigid airship Luxembourg (under the guise of a peace mission) appears overhead to evacuate Sinclair. FBI agents suddenly announce their presence, having secretly surrounded the area; they and the mobsters join forces to battle the Nazis. Sinclair and Lothar escape, dragging Jenny with them aboard the airship. Cliff flies to and boards the airship, but during the ensuing showdown, Jenny accidentally sets the bridge on fire with a flare gun. Sinclair holds Jenny hostage, forcing Cliff to give him the rocket pack, but not before he covertly removes the chewing gum patch, allowing fuel to leak near the rocket pack's exhaust. Sinclair dons the rocket pack and flies off, but the leaked fuel causes the rocket pack to catch on fire, causing Sinclair to plummet to his death on fire behind the HOLLYWOODLAND sign; the resulting explosion destroys the \\"LAND\\" part of the sign. Lothar is engulfed in flames as the airship explodes, but Cliff and Jenny are rescued at the last moment by Hughes and Peevy flying an autogyro. Hughes later presents Cliff with a brand-new Gee Bee air racer and a fresh pack of Beemans gum. As Hughes leaves, Jenny returns Peevy's rocket pack blueprints, which she found in Sinclair's home; Peevy decides that, with some modifications, he can build an even better one.

Fields * Julian Barnes as Charlie Production Development Comic book writer/artist Dave Stevens created the Rocketeer in 1982 and immediately viewed the character as an ideal protagonist for a film adaptation. Steve Miner purchased the film rights from Stevens in 1983, but he strayed too far from the original concept and the rights reverted to Stevens. In 1985 Stevens gave writers Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo a free option on The Rocketeer rights. Stevens liked that \\"their ideas for The Rocketeer were heartfelt and affectionate tributes to the 1930s movie serials with all the right dialogue and atmosphere. Most people would approach my characters contemporarily, but Danny and Paul saw them as pre-war mugs\\". Stevens, Bilson and De Meo began to consider making The Rocketeer as a low-budget film, shot in black-and-white and funded by independent investors. Their plan was to make the film a complete homage to Republic's Commando Cody serials, and use a cast largely associated with character actors. However, that same year, the trio approached William Dear to direct/co-write The Rocketeer, and they eventually dropped the low-budget idea. Bilson, De Meo, and Dear kept the comic book's basic plot intact, but fleshed it out to include a Hollywood setting and a climactic battle against a Nazi Zeppelin. They also tweaked Cliff's girlfriend to avoid comparisons to Bettie Page (Stevens' original inspiration), changing her name from Betty to Jenny and her profession from nude model to Hollywood extra (a change also made to make the film more family friendly). Dear proceeded to transform the climax from a submarine into a Zeppelin setpiece. Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear began to pitch The Rocketeer in 1986 to the major film studios but were turned down. \\"This was 1986, long before Batman or Dick Tracy or anything similar\\", Stevens explained. \\"In those days, no studio was interested at all in an expensive comic book movie. We got there about three years too early for our own good!\\" Walt Disney Studios eventually accepted The Rocketeer because they believed the film had toyetic potential and appeal for merchandising. The Rocketeer was set to be released through the studio's Touchstone Pictures label; Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, and Dear all signed a contract which would permit them to make a trilogy of Rocketeer films. However, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release. According to Stevens, \\"immediately, Betty and anything else 'adult' went right out with the bathwater. They really tried to shoehorn it into a kiddie property so they could sell toys. All they really wanted at the end of the day, was the name\\". Initially, Disney executives wanted to set the film in contemporary times, out of concern that a period piece might not appeal to a large audience. Bilson and DeMeo argued that the success of the Indiana Jones trilogy proved that moviegoers would enjoy an adventure film set in the 1930s, and the studio finally agreed. Bilson and DeMeo then submitted their seven-page film treatment to Disney, but the studio put their script through an endless series of revisions. Over five years, Disney fired and rehired Bilson and DeMeo three times. DeMeo explained that \\"Disney felt that they needed a different approach to the script, which meant bringing in someone else. But those scripts were thrown out and we were always brought back on\\". They found the studio's constant tinkering with the screenplay to be a frustrating process as \\"executives would like previously excised dialogue three months later. Scenes that had been thrown out two years ago were put back in. What was the point\\"? DeMeo said. One of Bilson and De Meo's significant revisions to the script over the years was to make Cliff and Jenny's romance more believable and avoid cliché aspects that would stereotype Jenny as a damsel in distress. The numerous project delays forced Dear to drop out as director. Joe Johnston, a fan of the comic book, immediately offered his services as director when he found out Disney owned the film rights. Johnston was quickly hired and pre-production started in early 1990. After Bilson and De Meo's third major rewrite, Disney finally greenlit The Rocketeer. The characterization of Neville Sinclair was inspired by movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known for his work in swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous process of writing and re- writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.In the original story, the character of Howard Hughes was the pulp adventure hero Doc Savage. Casting Casting the lead role of Cliff Secord was a struggle for the filmmakers.Mills 1991, p. 10. Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg even had one of the studio's then-staff writers, Karey Kirkpatrick, audition for the part. Kevin Costner and Matthew Modine were the first actors considered for the role. When they both proved to be unavailable, Dennis Quaid, Kurt Russell, Bill Paxton and Emilio Estevez auditioned for the part. Johnny Depp was Disney's favorite choice, while Paxton commented he came \\"really close\\" to getting the lead. Vincent D'Onofrio turned down the role and the filmmakers were forced to continue their search. The decision to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions among Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell was perfect for the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was not familiar with the comic book when he got the part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it with the help of the film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a scale model devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.Vaz and Duignan 1996, pp. 68, 70. For the female lead of Cliff's girlfriend Jenny, Sherilyn Fenn, Kelly Preston, Diane Lane and Elizabeth McGovern were considered before Jennifer Connelly was eventually cast. Campbell and Connelly's working relationship eventually led to a romantic coupling, which Johnston found to be a technique for method acting that helped with their on- screen chemistry. For Secord's sidekick, Peevy, Dave Stevens hoped that Lloyd Bridges would play the part, but Bridges turned it down and Alan Arkin was cast. The part of Neville Sinclair was offered to Jeremy Irons and Charles Dance before Timothy Dalton accepted the role. Lastly, the part of Eddie Valentine was written with Joe Pesci in mind, but he turned down the part, which went to Paul Sorvino.\\"Rocketeer To The Rescue!\\" Prevue, Issue #84, August 1991. Remaining cast members included Tiny Ron Taylor as Lothar, Terry O'Quinn as Howard Hughes, Jon Polito as Otis Bigelow, Ed Lauter as Agent Fitch, Eddie Jones as Malcolm the Mechanic and Robert Miranda as Spanish Johnny. Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens has a cameo as the German test pilot who is killed when the Nazis' version of a rocket backpack explodes during the takeoff sequence. Filming Principal photography for The Rocketeer lasted from September 19, 1990 to January 22, 1991. Filming at the Griffith Observatory took place in November 1990. The film ended up going 50 days over schedule due to weather and mechanical problems. Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens allied himself with director Joe Johnston and production manager Ian Bryce in an effort to be as heavily involved in the production process as possible and to try and secure as much artistic control as he could from Disney. Disney, in particular, was not enthusiastic with Stevens' involvement. \\"I was on the set day and night\\", Stevens reflected, \\"from pre-production till post-production! And initially, I had to fight to prove that I was there for the benefit of the film, and not for my own ego\\". The original production budget was set at $25 million, but rose to $35 million. This happened after Disney became impressed with the dailies; \\"they realized this was a bigger movie than they were anticipating\\", Johnston explained, \\"and they approved overages. It never got completely out of control\\". An abandoned World War II runway at the Santa Maria, California airport set the scene for the fictional Chaplin Air Field. Additional scenes were shot at Bakersfield.The large hangar built for the movie at the Santa Maria airport was purchased and moved across the field and placed next to the original at the airport. The Santa Maria Air Museum is filled with historical aircraft artifacts. The hangar was modified and upgraded by a team of volunteers over two years to bring up it to code to enable it to be used by the public. Much of the original film set detail is visible inside, and there is an added library that can be used for researchers. For the air circus scene, 700 Santa Maria extras and 25 vintage aircraft were employed. Aerial coordinator Craig Hosking remarked in an interview, \\"What makes The Rocketeer so unique was having several one-of-a- kind planes that hadn't flown in years\\", including a 1916 Standard biplane and a Gee Bee Model Z racer. The sequence where Cliff rescues Malcolm was adapted shot-for-shot from Stevens' comic book. Design A Rocketeer uniform on display at Planet Hollywood in Disney Springs. Stevens gave the film's production designer Jim Bissell and his two art directors his entire reference library pertaining to the Rocketeer at that time period, including blueprints for hangars and bleachers, schematics for building the autogyro, photos and drawings of the Bulldog Cafe, the uniforms for the air circus staff, and contacts for locating the vintage aircraft that were to be used. Stevens remembers that they \\"literally just took the reference and built the sets\\". Disney originally intended to change the Rocketeer's trademark helmet design completely. President Michael Eisner wanted a straight NASA-type helmet but director Johnston threatened to quit production on The Rocketeer. Disney relented, but only after creating a number of prototype designs that were ultimately rejected by the filmmakers. Stevens asked Johnston for one week to produce a good helmet design. He proceeded to work with a sculptor he knew, made a cast of the film's main stunt man's head and brainstormed ideas with the help of his sketches. They produced a helmet that the filmmakers agreed looked appropriate from all angles; in most respects it was identical to the helmet design Stevens had used for his comics series. Rick Baker designed the Rondo Hatton-inspired prosthetic makeup designs for the Lothar character, portrayed by Tiny Ron Taylor.Maltin, Leonard et al. 2003, pp. 1178–1179. Visual effects ILM's scale modeled-explosion of the Hollywood Sign The visual effects were designed and created by George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) with Ken Ralston (Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Sony Pictures Imageworks founder) serving as the VFX supervisor. Rocketeer director Joe Johnston previously worked as an art director/model maker at ILM before his film directing career took off. Johnston's insistence on a realistic flying rocketman led ILM to devise a lifelike Cliff Secord model that was filmed in \\"stop-motion-animation\\" coupled with an 18\\" figurine that was manipulated by hand and in \\"go-motion\\" to create \\"motion-blur.\\" Speeded-up Moviola effects were also used to advantage in the air circus sequence where a combination of live action and stop-motion animation was also employed.Vaz and Duignan 1996, p. 71. The Rocketeer's attack on the Nazi Zeppelin was filmed over four months near Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park in Valencia, California through pick-ups. Remaining visual effects footage took place at ILM's headquarters in San Rafael and Hamilton Air Force Base. There, they constructed a 12 ft scale model of the Zeppelin, which was photographed against matte paintings that resembled 1938 Los Angeles for intercutting purposes. The Zeppelin explosion special effect alone cost $400,000. Soundtrack The music for The Rocketeer was composed and conducted by James Horner. The soundtrack received positive reviews and is often mentioned as being one of the film's stronger elements. The soundtrack was released by Hollywood Records and features nearly an hour of music with eight tracks of score and two vocal tracks performed by actress/singer Melora Hardin. An expanded edition was issued in 2016 by Intrada Recordshttp://store.intrada.com/s.nl/it.A/id.10318/.f. The two songs were arranged by Billy May, who had collaborated with Horner several times in the past. Release Marketing To promote The Rocketeer, Disney made tie-in endorsements with Pizza Hut and M&M;'s/Mars candies. An extensive product line followed of computer games, toys, posters, trading cards, pins, patches, buttons, T-shirts, and children's clothing, licensed to coincide with the film's opening. The studio also spent a further $19 million on TV advertising alone.Magiera, Marcy. \\"Disney adds to tie-ins.\\" Advertising Age, February 11, 1991. A television special documentary, titled The Rocketeer: Excitement in the Air, was broadcast on the Disney Channel in June 1991. That same month, a young adult novelization written by Peter David was published by Bantam Books, while a similar novelization by Ron Fontes, for younger readers, was published by Scholastic Books for Disney Press.Fontes 1991, p. Flyleaf and verso. The Rocketeer had its premiere at the 1,100 seat El Capitan Theatre on June 19, 1991.

Reception Box office The Rocketeer was released in the United States on June 21, 1991, earning $9.6 million in its opening weekend in 1,616 theaters. Dick Cook, president of Disney’s Buena Vista Distribution unit said \\"We’ve got to be pleased with the way it’s performed, especially since it’s not a sequel and has no big-time stars\\". The film opened #4 behind Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, City Slickers and Dying Young. Rocketeer eventually grossed only $46.6 million in US box office, making it a commercial disappointment. Outside the US and Canada, the film was released through Touchstone Pictures rather than Walt Disney Pictures, in an attempt to attract the teenage audience it did not reach in North America.\\"Disney rebrands Rocketeer to reach wider audience.\\" Screen Finance, August 21, 1991. Rocketeer's original Art Deco poster, artistically similar to a famous Yuri Gagarin's monument, was changed because it failed to draw attention to the cast, including then-current James Bond, Timothy Dalton. A new poster was designed to feature Dalton, Billy Campbell, and Jennifer Connelly prominently. The film also failed in Britain, grossing just over £1 million in its first two weeks at just under 250 screens. The new advertising campaign was being designed while the British promotional campaign for the film was already under way and some theaters still had the stylized United States film poster. Critical response The film received positive reviews from critics. Based on 62 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 65% of the critics enjoyed The Rocketeer with an average score of 5.98/10. The site's consensus states: \\"An action-packed, if anachronistic, look back at pulp matinee serials, The Rocketeer may ring hollow with viewers expecting more than simple fun and gee-whiz special effects.\\" Metacritic gave the film a score of 61 out of 100, based on reviews from 8 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A- on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert enjoyed the film, noting its homages to the film serials of the 1930s–1950s. Although Ebert cited the visual effects as being state of the art, he described them \\"as charmingly direct as those rockets in the Flash Gordon serials—the ones with sparklers hidden inside of them, which were pulled on wires in front of papier-mâché mountains\\". Leonard Maltin wrote that the \\"film captures the look of the '30s, as well as the gee- whiz innocence of Saturday matinée serials, but it's talky and takes too much time to get where it's going. Dalton has fun as a villain patterned after Errol Flynn\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine also gave a positive review. \\"The Rocketeer is more than one of the best films of the summer; it's the kind of movie magic that we don't see much anymore\\", he continued, \\"the kind that charms us, rather than bullying us, into suspending disbelief\\". Internet reviewer James Berardinelli commented that \\"The Rocketeer may not be perfect, but it's an excellent example of how to adapt a comic book to the screen\\". Janet Maslin from The New York Times gave a mixed review. She called The Rocketeer \\"a benign adventure saga that has attractive stars, elaborate gimmicks and nice production values—everything it needs except a personality of its own\\". Maslin believed that by setting the story in 1938, the filmmakers were more interested in the Art Deco production design and visual effects instead of imbuing the storyline with \\"inspiration, which may be why it finally feels flat\\". Hal Hinson, writing in The Washington Post, felt the film was too concerned with family-friendliness. Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader believed both the editing and the storyline were not well balanced and felt The Rocketeer ripped-off elements of Indiana Jones and Back to the Future. Rosenbaum also cited the casting decision of character actors as being too practical. \\"The whole thing is good-natured enough\\", he explained, \\"but increasingly mechanical\\". Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens acknowledged he was \\"satisfied with 70% of the film\\" and highly praised Joe Johnston's direction. \\"The overall spirit and sweetness of the series is still there, intact\\", Stevens remembers. \\"We lost some good character stuff in editing for time, but the tone of it is still what I was trying to project in the comic pages. I also thought Joe's casting choices were excellent. To his credit, Joe did not fill out the cast with a bunch of Beverly Hills, 90210 Barbie and Ken-type kids\\". Stevens found Billy Campbell to be \\"a good-looking guy, but he also happens to be Cliff! I would never have cast him based on good looks alone, but he came into the audition and just nailed it shut. He was made for it. The part was his\\". Accolades The Rocketeer was nominated for both the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film, but lost both categories to Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Costume designer Marilyn Vance won the Saturn Award for Best Costumes, while Jennifer Connelly (Best Supporting Actress) and VFX supervisor Ken Ralston (Best Special Effects) also received nominations. The Rocketeer Minute Podcast The Rocketeer is one of many films to have been featured in a \\"Movies by Minute\\" podcast, wherein hosts and guests discuss one minute of a film per episode until the entire film has been dissected. The Rocketeer Minute was hosted by Hal Bryan and Jim O'Kane. Billy Campbell became recurring guest host on the podcast as well.https://www.rocketeerminute.com/ The Rocketeer Minute began in April 2017 and completed its run in September 2017. TV series A TV series based on the movie premiered on Disney Junior on November 8, 2019. It focuses on Kit Secord, the 7-year-old great granddaughter of Cliff who receives the jetpack and becomes the new Rocketeer. Possible sequel From the beginning of the process of making The Rocketeer, creator Dave Stevens and screenwriters Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo envisioned it as the first entry of a trilogy. Disney, in particular, hoped the film would carry a vein similar to the Indiana Jones franchise. Both Campbell and Connelly were contracted for sequels, Campbell for two more and Connelly for only one.Salem, Rob. \\"Rocketing romance\\". Toronto Star, August 16, 1991. However, with the film's disappointing box office performance, plans for a sequel were halted in July 1991.Stewart 2005, pp. 115, 142. \\"[Unfortunately] the movie didn't make as much money as Disney had hoped\\", Campbell reflected in a January 2008 interview with MTV News. \\"And that coupled with the acrimonious relationship that the director [Joe Johnston] and the studio had, contributed to them not even considering it\\". Although the calls for a sequel remain unrequited, as with many films of this genre, the film has built up a cult following in both the United States and Japan, where until 2008, Medicom, a major toy manufacturer, issued two versions of 12\\" poseable action figures and replica helmets based on the film. The original Dave Stevens comics are still in demand and movie memorabilia continues to have a ready audience. In addition, Johnston's work on this film led to him being hired 20 years later to direct another period superhero film, Captain America: The First Avenger in 2011. , Disney was reported to be developing a remake of The Rocketeer. Saw series creator James Wan has talked about directing the film. On July 28, 2016, it was confirmed that Walt Disney Pictures will be rebooting The Rocketeer, titled The Rocketeers, with the film being written by Max Winkler and Matt Spicer. Brigham Taylor is producing the film, as is Blake Griffin of the Detroit Pistons and Ryan Kalil of the Carolina Panthers. It was reported that The Rocketeers will be a \\"reboot sequel\\" that takes place six years after the original film with a black female pilot in the lead role. The film's plot sees the lead take on the mantle of The Rocketeer after Cliff Secord has gone missing while fighting the Nazis. The new Rocketeer goes on a mission to stop a corrupt scientist from stealing jetpack technology and shifting the balance of the Cold War. Peter Ramsey expressed interest in directing the sequel and also suggested several other directors like Gina Prince-Bythewood, Darnell Martin and Amma Asante for the project, as well. On April 6, 2016, Taylor confirmed that the film will be a sequel. On February 8, 2020, it was reported that Azia Squire wrote a new draft for the sequel, which will be released on Disney's streaming service, Disney+ and directed by J.D Dillard.

The town is well known for Puzhal central prison. Puzhal is located on the banks of Puzhal Lake. The area is one of the 163 notified areas (megalithic sites) in the state of Tamil Nadu.  History  In ancient times, the region was ruled by a chief of the Kurumbars variously titled as Kamunda Kurumba Prabhu and Puzhal Raja who is also credited with building a royal fort at this site. The fort and the land was later overran by the Chozha sovereign from Thanjavur. Demographics India census, Puzhal had a population of 20,297. Males constitute 49% of the population and females 51%. Puzhal has an average literacy rate of 76%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy is 84%, and female literacy is 68%. In Puzhal, 14% of the population is under 6 years of age. Puzhal is now in Chennai District. Major to supply water to Chennai people. The landscaped frontage of the huge complex resembles that of a luxury hotel; this is the Puzhal Prison Complex, a bold attempt by the Tamil Nadu Government to redefine the very concept of jail, which is ready to host the \`guests'. Bold, because every idea conceived for an ideal prison, but remained on paper, has been translated into reality in the ₹ 75-crore project. Puzhal Lake Puzhal aeri, or Puzhal lake, also known as the Red Hills Lake, is located in Ponneri Taluk of Thiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the two rain-fed reservoirs from where water is drawn for supply to Chennai City, the other one being the Chembarambakkam Lake / Porur Lake.  Puzhal Camp or Srilankan Refugee camp  Puzhal camp is one of the Sri Lankan refugee camps out of 115 camps were found in Tamil Nadu. According to Indian census Thiruvallur districts has second highest Sri Lankan refugee population. It has 1,646 households with a total of 5,387 refugees. Particularly Puzhal camp has second highest refugee population in Thiruvallur district. It accounts for 408 households with a refugee population of 1,283. That is why Puzhal Town is also expressed as Camp. Puzhal Jail Puzhal Central Prison is located in the neighbourhood. The prison began operation in 2006, replacing the erstwhile Chennai Central Prison. The plan for the construction of Puzhal Central Prison was conceived during the early 2000s.

Measuring long and towering when measured from the creek bed ( from bedrock), it was the largest concrete structure in the world when completed in 1915 and still merited \\"the title of largest concrete bridge in America, if not the world\\" 50 years later. Built by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W;), the bridge is owned today by Norfolk Southern Railway and is used daily for regular through freight service.Norfolk Southern completes acquisition of Delaware & Hudson South Line, PRNewswire, September 18, 2015 The DL&W; built the viaduct as part of its Nicholson Cutoff, which replaced a winding and hilly section of the route between Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Binghamton, New York, saving , 21 minutes of passenger train time, and one hour of freight train time. The bridge was designed by the DL&W;'s Abraham Burton Cohen; other key DL&W; staff were G. J. Ray, chief engineer; F. L. Wheaton, engineer of construction; and C. W. Simpson, resident engineer in charge of the construction. The contractor was Flickwir & Bush, including general manager F. M. Talbot and superintendent W. C. Ritner. In 1975 the American Society of Civil Engineers or ASCE designated the bridge as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. ASCE noted that at the time of its construction in 1912-1915, it was the largest reinforced concrete railroad bridge ever built.

In 1990, the National Railway Historical Society placed a historical plaque on the structure noting its size as the world's largest concrete bridge, completing the Summit cut-off project for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad.  History  Construction on the bridge began in May 1912 by excavating all 11 bridge piers to bedrock, which was up to below ground. In total, excavation for the viaduct removed of material, more than half of that rock. Almost half of the bulk of the bridge is underground. At mid-construction, of concrete had gone into its substructures, and it was estimated that construction would require of concrete and of steel. The steel estimate proved accurate; the bridge ultimately used a bit less concrete than expected: , making the total weight approximately . The bridge was dedicated on November 6, 1915, along with the opening of the Nicholson Cutoff. Construction photos along with a short history of the bridge were published by the Nicholson Area Library in a brochure in 1976.\\"The Bridge Was Built,\\" Nicholson Area Library, 1976. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 11, 1977. Since 1990, the local community has celebrated the building of the bridge on the second Sunday of September with \\"Nicholson Bridge Day\\", a street fair, parade, and other activities. The 100th-anniversary celebration was held in September 2015.

It began with the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in April 1898, when the Philippines was still a colony of the Spanish East Indies, and concluded when the United States formally recognized the independence of the Republic of the Philippines on July 4, 1946. With the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States, thereby beginning the era of American colonization. The interim U.S. military government of the Philippine Islands experienced a period of great political turbulence, characterised by the Philippine–American War. Beginning in 1901, the military government was replaced by a civilian government—the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands—with William Howard Taft serving as its first Governor-General. Also, a series of insurgent governments that lacked significant international and diplomatic recognition existed between 1898 and 1904. Following the passage of the Philippine Independence Act in 1934, a Philippine presidential election was held in 1935. Manuel L. Quezon was elected and inaugurated second President of the Philippines on November 15, 1935. The Insular Government was dissolved and the Commonwealth of the Philippines, intended to be a transitional government in preparation for the country's full achievement of independence in 1946, was brought into existence. After the World War II Japanese invasion in 1941 and subsequent occupation of the Philippines, the United States and Philippine Commonwealth military recaptured the Philippines in 1945. The United States formally recognised the independence of the Republic of the Philippines on July 4, 1946, according to the terms of the Philippine Independence Act. Historical perspective President Emilio Aguinaldo The Philippine Revolution began in August 1896 and ended with the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, a ceasefire between the Spanish colonial Governor- General Fernando Primo de Rivera and the revolutionary leader Emilio Aguinaldo which was signed on December 15, 1897. The terms of the pact called for Aguinaldo and his militia to surrender. Other revolutionary leaders were given amnesty and a monetary indemnity by the Spanish government in return for which the rebel government agreed to go into exile in Hong Kong. Ch.1 Ch.2Ch.5 Spanish–American War (1898) The failure of Spain to engage in active social reforms in Cuba as demanded by the United States government was the basic cause for the Spanish–American War. American attention was focused on the issue after the mysterious explosion that sank the American battleship on February 15, 1898 in Havana Harbor. As public political pressure from the Democratic Party and certain industrialists built up for war, the U.S. Congress forced the reluctant Republican President William McKinley to issue an ultimatum to Spain on April 19, 1898. Spain found it had no diplomatic support in Europe, but nevertheless declared war; the U.S. followed on April 25 with its own declaration of war... Theodore Roosevelt, who was at that time Assistant Secretary of the Navy, ordered Commodore George Dewey, commanding the Asiatic Squadron of the United States Navy: \\"Order the squadron ...to Hong Kong. Keep full of coal. In the event of declaration of war Spain, your duty will be to see that the Spanish squadron does not leave the Asiatic coast, and then offensive operations in Philippine Islands.\\" Dewey's squadron departed on April 27 for the Philippines, reaching Manila Bay on the evening of April 30. Battle of Manila Bay Battle of Manila Bay The Battle of Manila Bay took place on May 1, 1898. In a matter of hours, Commodore Dewey's Asiatic Squadron defeated the Spanish squadron under Admiral Patricio Montojo.Battle of Manila Bay, 1 May 1898 , Department of the Navy — Naval Historical Center. Retrieved on October 10, 2007 The U.S. squadron took control of the arsenal and navy yard at Cavite. Dewey cabled Washington, stating that although he controlled Manila Bay, he needed 5,000 additional men to seize Manila itself. U.S. preparation for land-based operations The unexpected rapidity and completeness of Dewey's victory in the first engagement of the war prompted the McKinley administration to make the decision to capture Manila from the Spanish. The United States Army began to assemble the Eighth Army Corps—a military unit which would consist of 10,844 soldiers under the command of Major General Wesley Merritt—in preparation for deployment to the Philippines. While awaiting the arrival of troops from the Eighth Corps, Dewey dispatched the cutter USRC McCulloch to Hong Kong to transport Aguinaldo back to the Philippines. Aguinaldo arrived on May 19 and, after a brief meeting with Dewey, resumed revolutionary activities against the Spanish. On May 24, Aguinaldo issued a proclamation in which he assumed command of all Philippine forces and announced his intention to establish a dictatorial government with himself as dictator, saying that he would resign in favor of a duly elected president. Public jubilation marked Aguinaldo's return. Many Filipino enlisted men deserted local Spanish army units to join Aguinaldo's command and the Philippine Revolution against Spain resumed. Soon, many cities such as Imus, Bacoor, Parañaque, Las Piñas, Morong, Macabebe and San Fernando, as well as some entire provinces such as Laguna, Batangas, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Tayabas (now Quezon), and the Camarines provinces, were liberated by the Filipinos and the port of Dalahican in Cavite was secured. Thomas M. Anderson The first contingent of American troops arrived on June 30 under the command of Brigadier General Thomas McArthur Anderson, commander of the Eighth Corps' 2nd Division (U.S. brigade and division numbers of the era were not unique throughout the army). General Anderson wrote to Aguinaldo, requesting his cooperation in military operations against the Spanish forces.Ch.3 Aguinaldo responded, thanking General Anderson for his amicable sentiments, but saying nothing about military cooperation. General Anderson did not renew the request. The 2nd Brigade and the 2nd Division of the Eighth Corps arrived on July 17, under the command of Brigadier General Francis V. Greene. Major General Merritt (the Commander in Chief of the Philippine Expedition) and his staff arrived at Cavite on July 25. The 1st Brigade of the corps' 2nd Division arrived on July 30, under the command of Brigadier General Arthur MacArthur.ch.10 Philippine declaration of independence Aguinaldo Shrine, where the Flag of the Philippines was raised during the declaration of independence from Spain. Marcela Agoncillo On June 12, 1898, Aguinaldo proclaimed the independence of the Philippines at his house in Cavite El Viejo. Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista wrote the Philippine Declaration of Independence, and read this document in Spanish that day at Aguinaldo's house.Appendix A On June 18, Aguinaldo issued a decree formally establishing his dictatorial government. On June 23, Aguinaldo issued another decree, this time replacing the dictatorial government with a revolutionary government (and naming himself as President).Appendix C. Writing retrospectively in 1899, Aguinaldo claimed that an American naval officer had urged him to return to the Philippines to fight the Spanish and said \\"The United States is a great and rich nation and needs no colonies.\\" Ch.3 Aguinaldo also wrote that after checking with Dewey by telegraph, U.S. Consul E. Spencer Pratt had assured him in Singapore: Aguinaldo received nothing in writing. House of Marcela Agoncillo the mother of the Philippine flag On April 28 Pratt wrote to United States Secretary of State William R. Day, explaining the details of his meeting with Aguinaldo: There was no mention in the cablegrams between Pratt and Dewey of independence or indeed of any conditions on which Aguinaldo was to cooperate, these details being left for future arrangement with Dewey. Pratt had intended to facilitate the occupation and administration of the Philippines, and also to prevent a possible conflict of action. In a communication written on July 28, Pratt made the following statement: On June 16, Secretary Day cabled Consul Pratt: \\"Avoid unauthorized negotiations with the Philippine insurgents,\\" and later on the same day:Ch.28 Independence Day held in Aguinaldo Shrine at the back of the old 5 peso bill Filipino scholar Maximo Kalaw wrote in 1927: \\"A few of the principal facts, however, seem quite clear. Aguinaldo was not made to understand that, in consideration of Filipino cooperation, the United States would extend its sovereignty over the Islands, and thus in place of the old Spanish master a new one would step in. The truth was that nobody at the time ever thought that the end of the war would result in the retention of the Philippines by the United States.\\"Ch.5 Tensions between U.S. and revolutionary forces On July 9 General Anderson informed Major General Henry Clark Corbin, the Adjutant General of the U.S. Army, that Aguinaldo \\"has declared himself Dictator and President, and is trying to take Manila without our assistance\\", opining that that would not be probable but, if done, would allow him to antagonize any U.S. attempt to establish a provisional government. On July 15, Aguinaldo issued three organic decrees assuming civil authority of the Philippines.Ch.7 Felipe Agoncillo house On July 18, General Anderson wrote that he suspected Aguinaldo to be secretly negotiating with the Spanish authorities. In a July 21 letter to the Adjutant General, General Anderson wrote that Aguinaldo had \\"put in operation an elaborate system of military government, under his assumed authority as Dictator, and has prohibited any supplies being given us, except by his order,\\" and that Anderson had written to Aguinaldo that the requisitions on the country for necessary items must be filled, and that he must aid in having them filled. On July 24, Aguinaldo wrote a letter to General Anderson in effect warning him not to disembark American troops in places conquered by the Filipinos from the Spaniards without first communicating in writing the places to be occupied and the object of the occupation. Murat Halstead, official historian of the Philippine Expedition, writes that General Merritt remarked shortly after his arrival on June 25, U.S. commanders suspected that Aguinaldo and his forces were informing the Spanish of American movements. U.S. Army Major John R. M. Taylor later wrote, after translating and analyzing insurgent documents, General Gregorio del Pilar On the evening of August 12, on orders of General Merritt, General Anderson notified Aguinaldo to forbid the insurgents under his command from entering Manila. On August 13, unaware of the peace protocol signing, U.S. forces assaulted and captured the Spanish positions in Manila. Insurgents made an independent attack of their own, as planned, which promptly led to trouble with the Americans. At 0800 that morning, Aguinaldo received a telegram from General Anderson, sternly warning him not to let his troops enter Manila without the consent of the American commander, who was situated on the south side of the Pasig River. General Anderson's request was ignored, and Aguinaldo's forces crowded forward alongside the American forces until they directly confronted the Spanish troops. Although the Spanish were waving a flag of truce, the insurgents fired on the Spanish forces, provoking return fire. 19 American soldiers were killed, and 103 more were wounded in this action.Ch.3Ch.10 General Anderson sent Aguinaldo a telegram, later that day, which read: Aguinaldo however demanded joint occupation of Manila. On August 13 Admiral Dewey and General Merritt informed their superiors of this and asked how far they might proceed in enforcing obedience in the matter.Ch.3 General Merritt received news of the August 12 peace protocol on August 16, three days after the surrender of Manila.Ch.10 Admiral Dewey and General Merritt were informed by a telegram dated August 17 that the President of the United States had directed: Insurgent forces were looting the portions of the city which they occupied, and were not confining their attacks to Spaniards, but were assaulting their own people and raiding the property of foreigners as well. U.S. commanders pressed Aguinaldo to withdraw his forces from Manila. Negotiations proceeded slowly and, on August 31, General Elwell Otis (General Merritt being unavailable) wrote, in a long letter to Aguinaldo: After further negotiation and exchanges of letters, Aguinaldo wrote on September 16: \\"On the evening of the 15th the armed insurgent organizations withdrew from the city and all of its suburbs, ...Ch.3 Peace protocol between the U.S. and Spain On August 12, 1898, The New York Times reported that a peace protocol had been signed in Washington that afternoon between the U.S. and Spain, suspending hostilities between the two nations. The full text of the protocol was not made public until November 5, but Article III read: \\"The United States will occupy and hold the City, Bay, and Harbor of Manila, pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace, which shall determine the control, disposition, and government of the Philippines.\\"Ch.15 After conclusion of this agreement, U.S. President McKinley proclaimed a suspension of hostilities with Spain. Capture of Manila By June, U.S. and Filipino forces had taken control of most of the islands, except for the walled city of Intramuros. Admiral Dewey and General Merritt were able to work out a bloodless solution with acting Governor- General Fermín Jáudenes. The negotiating parties made a secret agreement to stage a mock battle in which the Spanish forces would be defeated by the American forces, but the Filipino forces would not be allowed to enter the city. This plan minimized the risk of unnecessary casualties on all sides, while the Spanish would also avoid the shame of possibly having to surrender Intramuros to the Filipino forces. On the eve of the mock battle, General Anderson telegraphed Aguinaldo, \\"Do not let your troops enter Manila without the permission of the American commander. On this side of the Pasig River you will be under fire\\". On August 13, with American commanders unaware that a ceasefire had already been signed between Spain and the U.S. on the previous day, American forces captured the city of Manila from the Spanish in the Battle of Manila. The battle started when Dewey's ships bombarded Fort San Antonio Abad, a decrepit structure on the southern outskirts of Manila, and the virtually impregnable walls of Intramuros. In accordance with the plan, the Spanish forces withdrew while U.S. forces advanced. Once a sufficient show of battle had been made, Dewey hoisted the signal \\"D.W.H.B.\\" (meaning \\"Do you surrender?), whereupon the Spanish hoisted a white flag and Manila was formally surrendered to U.S. forces., This battle marked the end of Filipino- American collaboration, as the American action of preventing Filipino forces from entering the captured city of Manila was deeply resented by the Filipinos. This later led to the Philippine–American War,. which would prove to be more deadly and costly than the Spanish–American War. U.S. military government On August 14, 1898, two days after the capture of Manila, the U.S. established a military government in the Philippines, with General Merritt acting as military governor. During military rule (1898–1902), the U.S. military commander governed the Philippines under the authority of the U.S. president as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. After the appointment of a civil Governor-General, the procedure developed that as parts of the country were pacified and placed firmly under American control, responsibility for the area would be passed to the civilian. General Merritt was succeeded by General Otis as military governor, who in turn was succeeded by General MacArthur. Major General Adna Chaffee was the final military governor. The position of military governor was abolished in July 1902, after which the civil Governor-General became the sole executive authority in the Philippines.. Under the military government, an American-style school system was introduced, initially with soldiers as teachers; civil and criminal courts were reestablished, including a supreme court; and local governments were established in towns and provinces. The first local election was conducted by General Harold W. Lawton on May 7, 1899, in Baliuag, Bulacan.Ch.21 U.S. and insurgents clash In a clash at Cavite between United States soldiers and insurgents on August 25, 1898, George Hudson of the Utah regiment was killed, Corporal William Anderson was mortally wounded, and four troopers of the Fourth Cavalry were slightly wounded. This provoked General Anderson to send Aguinaldo a letter saying, \\"In order to avoid the very serious misfortune of an encounter between our troops, I demand your immediate withdrawal with your guard from Cavite. One of my men has been killed and three wounded by your people. This is positive and does not admit of explanation or delay.\\" Internal insurgent communications reported that the Americans were drunk at the time. Halstead writes that Aguinaldo expressed his regret and promised to punish the offenders.Ch.28 In internal insurgent communications, Apolinario Mabini initially proposed to investigate and punish any offenders identified. Aguinaldo modified this, ordering, \\"... say that he was not killed by your soldiers, but by them themselves [the Americans] since they were drunk according to your telegram\\". An insurgent officer in Cavite at the time reported on his record of services that he: \\"took part in the movement against the Americans on the afternoon of the 24th of August, under the orders of the commander of the troops and the adjutant of the post.\\"Ch.4 Philippine elections, Malolos Congress, Constitutional government Elections were held by the Revolutionary Government between June and September 10, resulting in Emilio Aguinaldo being seated as President in the seating of a legislature known as the Malolos Congress. In a session between September 15 and November 13, 1898, the Malolos Constitution was adopted. It was promulgated on January 21, 1899, creating the First Philippine Republic. Spanish–American War ends Felipe Agoncillo was the Filipino representative to the negotiations in Paris that led to the Treaty of Paris (1898), ending the Spanish–American War. He has been referred to as the \\"outstanding first Filipino diplomat.\\" Article V of the peace protocol signed on August 12 had mandated negotiations to conclude a treaty of peace to begin in Paris not later than October 1, 1898.Ch.15 President McKinley sent a five-man commission, initially instructed to demand no more than Luzon, Guam, and Puerto Rico; which would have provided a limited U.S. empire of pinpoint colonies to support a global fleet and provide communication links. In Paris, the commission was besieged with advice, particularly from American generals and European diplomats, to demand the entire Philippine archipelago. The unanimous recommendation was that \\"it would certainly be cheaper and more humane to take the entire Philippines than to keep only part of it.\\" On October 28, 1898, McKinley wired the commission that \\"cessation of Luzon alone, leaving the rest of the islands subject to Spanish rule, or to be the subject of future contention, cannot be justified on political, commercial, or humanitarian grounds. The cessation must be the whole archipeligo or none. The latter is wholly inadmissible, and the former must therefore be required.\\" The Spanish negotiators were furious over the \\"immodist demands of a conqueror\\", but their wounded pride was assuaged by an offer of twenty million dollars for \\"Spanish improvements\\" to the islands. The Spaniards capitulated, and on December 10, 1898, the U.S. and Spain signed the Treaty of Paris, formally ending the Spanish–American War. In Article III, Spain ceded the Philippine archipelago to the United States, as follows: \\"Spain cedes to the United States the archipelago known as the Philippine Islands, and comprehending the islands lying within the following line: [... geographic description elided ...]. The United States will pay to Spain the sum of twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) within three months after the exchange of the ratifications of the present treaty.\\"Appendix D 1898 US political cartoon. U.S. President William McKinley is shown holding the Philippines, depicted as a native child, as the world looks on. The implied options for McKinley are to keep the Philippines, or give it back to Spain, which the cartoon compares to throwing a child off a cliff. In the U.S., there was a movement for Philippine independence; some said that the U.S. had no right to a land where many of the people wanted self-government. In 1898 Andrew Carnegie, an industrialist and steel magnate, offered to pay the U.S. government $20 million to give the Philippines its independence. On November 7, 1900, Spain and the U.S. signed the Treaty of Washington, clarifying that the territories relinquished by Spain to the United States included any and all islands belonging to the Philippine Archipelago, but lying outside the lines described in the Treaty of Paris. That treaty explicitly named the islands of Cagayan Sulu and Sibutu and their dependencies as among the relinquished territories. Benevolent assimilation U.S. President McKinley's December 21, 1898 proclamation of Benevolent Assimilation was announced in the Philippines on January 4, 1899. Referring to the Treaty of Paris, it said that as a result of the victories of American arms, the future control, disposition, and government of the Philippine Islands are ceded to the United States. It enjoined the military commander (General Otis) to make known to the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands that in succeeding to the sovereignty of Spain, the authority of the United States is to be exerted for the securing of the persons and property of the people of the islands and for the confirmation of all their private rights and relations. It specified that it will be the duty of the commander of the forces of occupation to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come, not as invaders or conquerors, but as friends, to protect the natives in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious rights. On January 6, 1899, General Otis was quoted in The New York Times as expressing himself as convinced that the U.S. government intends to seek the establishment of a liberal government, in which the people will be as fully represented as the maintenance of law and order will permit, susceptible of development, on lines of increased representation, and the bestowal of increased powers, into a government as free and independent as is enjoyed by the most favored provinces in the world. Philippine–American War (1899–1902) Tensions escalate Gregorio del Pilar and his troops in 1898 The Spanish had yielded Iloilo to the insurgents in 1898 for the purpose of troubling the Americans. On January 1, 1899, news had come to Washington from Manila that American forces which had been sent to Iloilo under the command of General Marcus Miller had been confronted by 6,000 armed Filipinos, who refused them permission to land. A Filipino official styling himself \\"Presidente Lopez of the Federal Government of the Visayas\\" informed Miller that \\"foreign troops\\" would not land \\"without express orders from the central government of Luzon\\". On December 21, 1898, President McKinley issued a Proclamation of Benevolent Assimilation. General Otis delayed its publication until January 4, 1899, then publishing an amended version edited so as not to convey the meanings of the terms \\"sovereignty\\", \\"protection\\", and \\"right of cessation\\" which were present in the unabridged version.The text of the amended version published by General Otis is quoted in its entirety in See also Wikisource:Letter from E.S. Otis to the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands, January 4, 1899. Unknown to Otis, the War Department had also sent an enciphered copy of the Benevolent Assimilation proclamation to General Marcus Miller in Iloilo for informational purposes. Miller assumed that it was for distribution and, unaware that a politically bowdlerized version had been sent to Aguinaldo, published it in both Spanish and Tagalog translations which eventually made their way to Aguinaldo. Even before Aguinaldo received the unaltered version and observed the changes in the copy he had received from Otis, he was upset that Otis had altered his own title to \\"Military Governor of the Philippines\\" from \\"... in the Philippines\\". Aguinaldo did not miss the significance of the alteration, which Otis had made without authorization from Washington. Battle of Quingua, April 23, 1899, during the Philippine–American War On January 5, Aguinaldo issued a counter-proclamation summarizing what he saw as American violations of the ethics of friendship, particularly as regards the events in Iloilo. The proclamation concluded as follows: Battle before Caloocan After some copies of that proclamation had been distributed, Aguinaldo ordered the recall of undistributed copies and issued another proclamation, which was published the same day in El Heraldo de la Revolucion, the official newspaper of the Philippine Republic. There, he said partly, Battle of Santa Cruz Otis, taking these two proclamations as a call to arms, strengthened American observation posts and alerted his troops. In the tense atmosphere, some 40,000 Filipinos fled Manila within a period of 15 days.. Meanwhile, Felipe Agoncillo, who had been commissioned by the Philippine Revolutionary Government as Minister Plenipotentiary to negotiate treaties with foreign governments, and who had unsuccessfully sought to be seated at the negotiations between the U.S. and Spain in Paris, was now in Washington. On January 6, he filed a request for an interview with the President to discuss affairs in the Philippines. The next day the government officials were surprised to learn that messages to General Otis to deal mildly with the rebels and not to force a conflict had become known to Agoncillo, and cabled by him to Aguinaldo. At the same time came Aguinaldo's protest against General Otis signing himself \\"Military Governor of the Philippines\\". On January 8, Agoncillo gave out this statement: American troops guarding the bridge over the Pasig River The Filipino committees in London, Paris and Madrid about this time telegraphed to President McKinley as follows: Young's Scouts, including Marcus W. Robertson(2nd from right, front row squating), Richard Moses Longfellow(4th from right, front row squating), Medal of Honor recipients. Picture taken in Philippines. On January 8, Aguinaldo received the following message from Teodoro Sandiko: The New York Times reported on January 8, that two Americans who had been guarding a waterboat in Iloilo had been attacked, one fatally, and that insurgents were threatening to destroy the business section of the city by fire; and on January 10 that a peaceful solution to the Iloilo issues may result but that Aguinaldo had issued a proclamation threatening to drive the Americans from the islands. Attack on the barracks of Company C of the 13th Minnesota Volunteers by Filipino forces during the Tondo Fire in Manila, 1899 By January 10, insurgents were ready to assume the offensive, but desired, if possible, to provoke the Americans into firing the first shot. They made no secret of their desire for conflict, but increased their hostile demonstrations and pushed their lines forward into forbidden territory. Their attitude is well illustrated by the following extract from a telegram sent by Colonel Cailles to Aguinaldo on January 10, 1899: Aguinaldo approved the hostile attitude of Cailles, for there is a reply in his handwriting which reads:Ch.4 On January 31, 1899, The Minister of Interior of the revolutionary First Philippine Republic, Teodoro Sandiko, signed a decree saying that President Aguinaldo had directed that all idle lands be planted to provide food for the people, in view of impending war with the Americans.  Outbreak of general hostilities  Philippines, Manila, 1899– U.S. soldiers and insurrecto prisoners Worcester writes that General Otis' account of the opening of active hostilities was as follows: Emilio Aguinaldo boards the USS Vicksburg following his surrender, 1900. Other sources name the two specific U.S. soldiers involved in the first exchange of fire as Privates William Grayson and Orville Miller of the Nebraska Volunteers., Subsequent to the conclusion of the war, after analyzing captured insurgent papers, Major Major J. R. M. Taylor wrote, in part, War Filipino casualties Emilio Aguinaldo's quarters in Manila following his capture by the Americans. On February 4, Aguinaldo declared \\"That peace and friendly relations with the Americans be broken and that the latter be treated as enemies, within the limits prescribed by the laws of war.\\"Ch.28 On June 2, 1899, the Malolos Congress enacted and ratified a declaration of war on the United States, which was publicly proclaimed on that same day by Pedro Paterno, President of the Assembly.Ch.7 As before when fighting the Spanish, the Filipino rebels did not do well in the field. Aguinaldo and his provisional government escaped after the capture of Malolos on March 31, 1899 and were driven into northern Luzon. Peace feelers from members of Aguinaldo's cabinet failed in May when the American commander, General Ewell Otis, demanded an unconditional surrender. In 1901, Aguinaldo was captured and swore allegiance to the United States, marking one end to the war. First Philippine Commission President McKinley had appointed a five-person group headed by Dr. Jacob Schurman, president of Cornell University, on January 20, 1899, to investigate conditions in the islands and make recommendations. 1899 political cartoon by Winsor McCay. Uncle Sam (representing the United States), gets entangled with rope around a tree labelled \\"Imperialism\\" while trying to subdue a bucking colt or mule labeled \\"Philippines\\" while a figure representing Spain walks off over the horizon carrying a bag labeled \\"$20,000,000\\". The three civilian members of the Philippine Commission arrived in Manila on March 4, 1899, a month after the Battle of Manila which had begun armed conflict between U.S. and revolutionary Filipino forces. The commission published a proclamation containing assurances that the U.S. \\"... is anxious to establish in the Philippine Islands an enlightened system of government under which the Philippine people may enjoy the largest measure of home rule and the amplest liberty.\\" After meetings in April with revolutionary representatives, the commission requested authorization from McKinley to offer a specific plan. McKinley authorized an offer of a government consisting of \\"a Governor-General appointed by the President; cabinet appointed by the Governor-General; [and] a general advisory council elected by the people.\\". The Revolutionary Congress voted unanimously to cease fighting and accept peace and, on May 8, the revolutionary cabinet headed by Apolinario Mabini was replaced by a new \\"peace\\" cabinet headed by Pedro Paterno. At this point, General Antonio Luna arrested Paterno and most of his cabinet, returning Mabini and his cabinet to power. After this, the commission concluded that \\"... The Filipinos are wholly unprepared for independence ... there being no Philippine nation, but only a collection of different peoples.\\". In the report that they issued to the president the following year, the commissioners acknowledged Filipino aspirations for independence; they declared, however, that the Philippines was not ready for it.Ch.9 Specific recommendations included the establishment of civilian government as rapidly as possible (the American chief executive in the islands at that time was the military governor), including establishment of a bicameral legislature, autonomous governments on the provincial and municipal levels, and a system of free public elementary schools. Second Philippine Commission The Second Philippine Commission (the Taft Commission), appointed by McKinley on March 16, 1900, and headed by William Howard Taft, was granted legislative as well as limited executive powers.Appendix F On September 1, the Taft Commission began to exercise legislative functions.Ch.21 Between September 1900 and August 1902, it issued 499 laws, established a judicial system, including a supreme court, drew up a legal code, and organized a civil service. The 1901 municipal code provided for popularly elected presidents, vice presidents, and councilors to serve on municipal boards. The municipal board members were responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining municipal properties, and undertaking necessary construction projects; they also elected provincial governors. Establishment of civil government Governor General William Howard Taft addressing the audience at the Philippine Assembly in the Manila Grand Opera House On March 3, 1901 the U.S. Congress passed the Army Appropriation Act containing (along with the Platt Amendment on Cuba) the Spooner Amendment which provided the President with legislative authority to establish of a civil government in the Philippines. Up until this time, the President been administering the Philippines by virtue of his war powers. On July 1, 1901, civil government was inaugurated with William H. Taft as the Civil Governor. Later, on February 3, 1903, the U.S. Congress would change the title of Civil Governor to Governor-General.Ch.21 A highly centralized public school system was installed in 1901, using English as the medium of instruction. This created a heavy shortage of teachers, and the Philippine Commission authorized the Secretary of Public Instruction to bring to the Philippines 600 teachers from the U.S.A. — the so-called Thomasites. Free primary instruction that trained the people for the duties of citizenship and avocation was enforced by the Taft Commission per instructions of President McKinley. Also, the Catholic Church was disestablished, and a considerable amount of church land was purchased and redistributed. Official end to the war The Philippine Organic Act of July 1902 approved, ratified, and confirmed McKinley's Executive Order establishing the Philippine Commission, and also stipulated that the bicameral Philippine Legislature would be established composed of an elected lower house, the Philippine Assembly and the appointed Philippine Commission as the upper house. The act also provided for extending the United States Bill of Rights to the Philippines. On July 2, 1902 the Secretary of War telegraphed that the insurrection against the sovereign authority of the U.S. having come to an end, and provincial civil governments having been established, the office of Military Governor was terminated. On July 4, Theodore Roosevelt, who had succeeded to the U.S. Presidency after the assassination of President McKinley on September 5, 1901 proclaimed a full and complete pardon and amnesty to all persons in the Philippine archipelago who had participated in the conflict.Ch.9 On April 9, 2002, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo proclaimed that the Philippine–American War had ended on April 16, 1902 with the surrender of General Miguel Malvar, and declared the centennial anniversary of that date as a national working holiday and as a special non-working holiday in the Province of Batangas and in the Cities of Batangas, Lipa and Tanaun. Post-1902 hostilities Some sources have suggested that the war unofficially continued for nearly a decade, since bands of guerrillas, quasi-religious armed groups and other resistance groups continued to roam the countryside, still clashing with American Army or Philippine Constabulary patrols. American troops and the Philippine Constabulary continued hostilities against such resistance groups until 1913. Some historians consider these unofficial extensions to be part of the war. US colonialization: the \\"Insular Government\\" (1900–1935) Tranvia in Manila during the American Era with Bahay na Bato houses. Calle San Sebastian, present-day Felix Hidalgo St. The 1902 Philippine Organic Act was a constitution for the Insular Government, as the U.S. colonial administration was known. This was a form of territorial government that reported to the Bureau of Insular Affairs. The act provided for a Governor-General appointed by the U.S. president and an elected lower house, the Philippine Assembly. It also disestablished the Catholic Church as the state religion. The United States government, in an effort to resolve the status of the friars, negotiated with the Vatican. The church agreed to sell the friars' estates and promised gradual substitution of Filipino and other non-Spanish priests for the friars. It refused, however, to withdraw the religious orders from the islands immediately, partly to avoid offending Spain. In 1904 the administration bought for $7.2 million the major part of the friars' holdings, amounting to some , of which one-half was in the vicinity of Manila. The land was eventually resold to Filipinos, some of them tenants but the majority of them estate owners. Paris of the Asia was pushed forward even more by Daniel Burnham the Manila Urban planner. Plaza Goiti, present-day Plaza Lacson In socio-economic terms, the Philippines made solid progress in this period. Foreign trade had amounted to 62 million pesos in 1895, 13% of which was with the United States. By 1920, it had increased to 601 million pesos, 66% of which was with the United States. A health care system was established which, by 1930, reduced the mortality rate from all causes, including various tropical diseases, to a level similar to that of the United States itself. The practices of slavery, piracy and headhunting were suppressed but not entirely extinguished. Economy rose as reflected to the great edifices of the cities. El Hogar Filipino Building Two years after completion and publication of a census, a general election was conducted for the choice of delegates to a popular assembly. An elected Philippine Assembly was convened in 1907 as the lower house of a bicameral legislature, with the Philippine Commission as the upper house. Every year from 1907 the Philippine Assembly and later the Philippine Legislature passed resolutions expressing the Filipino desire for independence. Philippine nationalists led by Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osmeña enthusiastically endorsed the draft Jones Bill of 1912, which provided for Philippine independence after eight years, but later changed their views, opting for a bill which focused less on time than on the conditions of independence. The nationalists demanded complete and absolute independence to be guaranteed by the United States, since they feared that too-rapid independence from American rule without such guarantees might cause the Philippines to fall into Japanese hands. The Jones Bill was rewritten and passed Congress in 1916 with a later date of independence.Wong Kwok Chu, \\"The Jones Bills 1912–16: A Reappraisal of Filipino Views on Independence,\\" Journal of Southeast Asian Studies 1982 13(2): 252–269 Busy street of early American- era Manila. Plaza Moraga View of Binondo from Jones Bridge The law, officially the Philippine Autonomy Act but popularly known as the Jones Law, served as the new organic act (or constitution) for the Philippines. Its preamble stated that the eventual independence of the Philippines would be American policy, subject to the establishment of a stable government. The law maintained the Governor-General of the Philippines, appointed by the President of the United States, but established a bicameral Philippine Legislature to replace the elected Philippine Assembly (lower house); it replaced the appointive Philippine Commission (upper house) with an elected senate.Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916 (Jones Law) Americans and Filipinos choose to preserve Spanish-era buildings for historical, tourism and urban purposes. The Filipinos suspended their independence campaign during the First World War and supported the United States against Germany. After the war they resumed their independence drive with great vigor.Ch.24 On March 17, 1919, the Philippine Legislature passed a \\"Declaration of Purposes\\", which stated the inflexible desire of the Filipino people to be free and sovereign. A Commission of Independence was created to study ways and means of attaining liberation ideal. This commission recommended the sending of an independence mission to the United States.Ch.24 The \\"Declaration of Purposes\\" referred to the Jones Law as a veritable pact, or covenant, between the American and Filipino peoples whereby the United States promised to recognize the independence of the Philippines as soon as a stable government should be established. U.S. Governor-General of the Philippines Francis Burton Harrison had concurred in the report of the Philippine legislature as to a stable government. With Manila's Filipino Hispanic roots, Daniel Burnham developed the Urban planning of Manila through the City Beautiful Movement; Neo-Classical architecture of Paris through Manila's Government buildings, Canals of Venice through the Esteros of Manila, Sunset view of Naples through Manila Bay and Winding River of Paris through the Pasig River. A fine example of the Burnham plan is the Manila Central Post Office and Jones Bridge Manila circa 1930s. The central façade of the Legislative Building The Philippine legislature funded an independence mission to the U.S. in 1919. The mission departed Manila on February 28 and met in the U.S. with and presented their case to Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, in his 1921 farewell message to Congress, certified that the Filipino people had performed the condition imposed on them as a prerequisite to independence, declaring that, this having been done, the duty of the U.S. is to grant Philippine independence. The Republican Party then controlled Congress and the recommendation of the outgoing Democratic president was not heeded. After the first independence mission, public funding of such missions was ruled illegal. Subsequent independence missions in 1922, 1923, 1930, 1931 1932, and two missions in 1933 were funded by voluntary contributions. Numerous independence bills were submitted to the U.S. Congress, which passed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill on December 30, 1932. U.S. President Herbert Hoover vetoed the bill on January 13, 1933. Congress overrode the veto on January 17, and the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act became U.S. law. The law promised Philippine independence after 10 years, but reserved several military and naval bases for the United States, as well as imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports. The law also required the Philippine Senate to ratify the law. Manuel L. Quezon urged the Philippine Senate to reject the bill, which it did. Quezon himself led the twelfth independence mission to Washington to secure a better independence act. The result was the Tydings–McDuffie Act of 1934 which was very similar to the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act except in minor details. The Tydings-McDuffie Act was ratified by the Philippine Senate. The law provided for the granting of Philippine independence by 1946.Ch.24 The Tydings–McDuffie Act provided for the drafting and guidelines of a Constitution, for a 10-year \\"transitional period\\" as the Commonwealth of the Philippines before the granting of Philippine independence. On May 5, 1934, the Philippines legislature passed an act setting the election of convention delegates. Governor-General Frank Murphy designated July 10 as the election date, and the convention held its inaugural session on July 30. The completed draft constitution was approved by the convention on February 8, 1935, approved by U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt on March 23, and ratified by popular vote on May 14. The first election under the constitution was held on September 17, and on November 15, 1935, the Commonwealth was put into place.Ch.24 Philippine Commonwealth (1935–1946) Manila before the war It was planned that the period 1935–1946 would be devoted to the final adjustments required for a peaceful transition to full independence, a great latitude in autonomy being granted in the meantime. Instead there was war with Japan.. Manuel Quezon y Molina, once the President of the Senate of the Philippines (and the first to hold that office), was elected to become the President of the Philippines during the Commonwealth era of American colonization and occupation. On May 14, 1935, an election to fill the newly created office of President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines was won by Manuel L. Quezon (Nacionalista Party), and a Filipino government was formed on the basis of principles superficially similar to the U.S. Constitution. The Commonwealth as established in 1935 featured a very strong executive, a unicameral national assembly, and a supreme court composed entirely of Filipinos for the first time since 1901. The new government embarked on an ambitious agenda of establishing the basis for national defense, greater control over the economy, reforms in education, improvement of transport, the colonization of the island of Mindanao, and the promotion of local capital and industrialization. The Commonwealth however, was also faced with agrarian unrest, an uncertain diplomatic and military situation in South East Asia, and uncertainty about the level of United States commitment to the future Republic of the Philippines. In 1939–40, the Philippine Constitution was amended to restore a bicameral Congress, and permit the re-election of President Quezon, previously restricted to a single, six-year term. During the Commonwealth years, Philippines sent one elected Resident Commissioner to the United States House of Representatives, as Puerto Rico currently does today. Japanese occupation and World War II (1941–1945) Surrender of Filipino and American troops at Corregidor, Philippine Islands, May 1942. A few hours after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched air raids in several cities and US military installations in the Philippines on December 8, and on December 10, the first Japanese troops landed in Northern Luzon. Filipino pilot Captain Jesús A. Villamor, leading a flight of three P-26 \\"Peashooter\\" fighters of the 6th Pursuit Squadron, distinguished himself by attacking two enemy formations of 27 planes each and downing a much-superior Japanese Zero, for which he was awarded the U.S. Distinguished Service Cross. The two other planes in that flight, flown by Lieutenants César Basa and Geronimo Aclan, were shot down.Ch.25 As the Japanese forces advanced, Manila was declared an open city to prevent it from destruction, meanwhile, the government was moved to Corregidor. In March 1942, General MacArthur and President Quezon fled the country. Guerrilla units harassed the Japanese when they could, and on Luzon native resistance was strong enough that the Japanese never did get control of a large part of the island. Japanese troops on Bataan, Philippine Islands, circa 1942. Captured Japanese photograph. – NARA – 531353 General Douglas MacArthur, commander of the United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), was forced to retreat to Bataan. Manila was occupied by the Japanese on January 2, 1942. The fall of Bataan was on April 9, 1942 with Corregidor Island, at the mouth of Manila Bay, surrendering on May 6.Ch.25 Meeting of Jorge B. Vargas, a secretary of President Manuel Quezon, and Homma Masaharu, a General Lieutenant of the Imperial Japanese Army on February, 20th 1943 José P. Laurel became the President of the Philippines during the Japanese occupation. The Commonwealth government by then had exiled itself to Washington, DC, upon the invitation of President Roosevelt; however many politicians stayed behind and collaborated with the occupying Japanese. The Philippine Commonwealth Army continued to fight the Japanese in a guerrilla war and were considered auxiliary units of the United States Army. Several Philippine Commonwealth military awards, such as the Philippine Defense Medal, Independence Medal, and Liberation Medal, were awarded to both the United States and Philippine Armed Forces. The Hukbalahap, a communist guerilla movement formed by peasant farmers in Central Luzon, did most of the fighting. The Hukbalahap, also known as Huks, resisted invaders and punished the people who collaborated with the Japanese, but did not have a well- disciplined organization, and were later seen as a threat to the Manila government. Before MacArthur came back, the effectiveness of the guerilla movement had decimated Japanese control, limiting it to only 12 out of the 48 provinces. Gen. Douglas MacArthur wades ashore during initial landings at Leyte, Philippine Islands. In October 1944, MacArthur had gathered enough additional troops and supplies to begin the retaking of the Philippines, landing with Sergio Osmeña who had assumed the Presidency after Quezon's death. The Philippine Constabulary went on active service under the Philippine Commonwealth Army on October 28, 1944 during liberation under the Commonwealth regime. General Tomoyuki Yamashita surrenders to the Filipino soldiers and guerrillas in the presence of Generals Jonathan Wainwright and Arthur Percival. The battles entailed long fierce fighting and some of the Japanese continued to fight after the official surrender of the Empire of Japan on September 2, 1945.Ch.25 After their landing, Filipino and American forces also undertook measures to suppress the Huk movement, which was founded to fight the Japanese Occupation. The Filipino and American forces removed local Huk governments and imprisoned many high-ranking members of the Philippine Communist Party. While these incidents happened, there was still fighting against the Japanese forces and, despite the American and Philippine measures against the Huk, they still supported American and Filipino soldiers in the fight against the Japanese. Over a million Filipinos (including regular and constable soldiers, recognized guerrillas and non-combatant civilians) had been killed in the war. The 1947 final report of the High Commissioner to the Philippines documents massive damage to most coconut mills and sugar mills; inter-island shipping had all been destroyed or removed; concrete highways had been broken up for use on military airports; railways were inoperative; Manila was 80 percent destroyed, Cebu 90 percent, and Zamboanga 95 percent.J. L. Vellut, \\"Japanese reparations to the Philippines,\\" Asian Survey 3 (Oct. 1993): 496–506. Independence (1946) Philippine Independence, July 4, 1946. The Flag of the United States of America is lowered while the Flag of the Philippines is raised. Philippine independence came on July 4, 1946, with the signing of the Treaty of Manila between the governments of the United States and the Philippines. The treaty provided for the recognition of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines and the relinquishment of American sovereignty over the Philippine Islands. From 1946 to 1961, Independence Day was observed on July 4. On May 12, 1962, President Macapagal issued Presidential Proclamation No. 28, proclaiming Tuesday, June 12, 1962 as a special public holiday throughout the Philippines. In 1964, Republic Act No. 4166 changed the date of Independence Day from July 4 to June 12 and renamed the July 4 holiday as Philippine Republic Day. World War II veteran benefits During World War II, over 200,000 Filipinos fought in defense of the United States against the Japanese in the Pacific theater of military operations, where more than half died. As a commonwealth of the United States before and during the war, Filipinos were legally American nationals. With American nationality, Filipinos were promised all the benefits afforded to those serving in the armed forces of the United States. In 1946, Congress passed the Rescission Act () which stripped Filipinos of the benefits they were promised. Since the passage of the Rescission Act, many Filipino veterans have traveled to the United States to lobby Congress for the benefits promised to them for their service and sacrifice. Over 30,000 of such veterans live in the United States today, with most being United States citizens. Sociologists introduced the phrase \\"Second Class Veterans\\" to describe the plight of these Filipino Americans. Beginning in 1993, numerous bills titled Filipino Veterans Fairness Act were introduced in Congress to return the benefits taken away from these veterans, only to die in committee. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, signed into law on February 17, 2009, included provisions to pay benefits to the 15,000 remaining veterans. On January 6, 2011 Jackie Speier (D-CA), U.S. Representative for , serving since 2008, introduced a bill seeking to make Filipino WW-II veterans eligible for the same benefits available to U.S. veterans. In a news conference to outline the bill, Speier estimated that approximately 50,000 Filipino veterans survive.

History  The town was established by a Portuguese noble man Deão Jose Paulo, the dean (Deão) of the church in AD 1787 after he moved there just five years after the conquest of Quepem sub-district by the Portuguese. He built his famous Palácio do Deão, followed by a public market, hospital, a church and other facilities for the benefit of the inhabitants through his own expense. He was later awarded the unofficial title of Barão de Quepem by the then viceroy D. Manuel Francisco Zacarias de Portugal e Castro. Quepem city before AD 1787 was a scattered settlement surrounded by thick jungle. It was situated in the princely state ruled by the Soonda's. When Hyder Ali began raiding and annexing the state, the princely family turned to the Portuguese who immediately took on Hyder Ali's forces and repelled them back, as well as financed the administration of the state. Having no heir to succeed, the then ruler gave complete control of the provinces to the Portuguese for their generosity in 1783. In AD 1787, Deaõ. Jose Paulo de Almeida transferred his residence from Old Goa to Quepem and founded a hamlet. Quepem was, in those days, covered with forest. He ordered the planting of rice, coconut palms and other fruit trees. He established a public market, hospital and other facilities for the benefit of the inhabitants. He also founded the Santa Cruz church, at his own cost, as inscribed on the pyramidal structure in the churchyard. It is believed that the Deão, began by erecting two columns at the entrance of Quepem. Thereafter, he obtained permission that criminal offenders who entered this village across these columns to work could rehabilitate themselves in this village which he had founded. Thus, he was able to establish Quepem as arable, self-sustaining and habitable place. It is not known the origin of this story, but one is able to still see the bases of these columns at the entrance of Quepem. He constructed in Quepem, for his occasional stay, a spacious house that he modestly described as a ‘Farm House’. It was later, justifiably, come to be known as the Palácio Do Deão.

The return of democracy and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, disasters, a persistent communist insurgency, and a military conflict with Moro separatists. During Corazon Aquino's administration, U.S. forces withdrew from the Philippines, due to the rejection of the U.S. Bases Extension Treaty, and leading to the official transfer of Clark Air Base in November 1991 and Subic Bay to the government in December 1992. The administration also faced a series of natural disasters, including the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991.\\"Tarlac map\\". University of Texas in Austin Library. Retrieved on August 2, 2011.\\"Report of the Philippine Commission to the President, 1901 Vol. III\\", p. 141. Government Printing Office, Washington, 1901. After introducing a constitution that limited presidents to a single term, Aquino did not stand for re-election. Aquino was succeeded by Fidel V. Ramos. During this period the country's economic performance remained modest, with a 3.6% percent GDP growth rate. Political stability and economic improvements, such as the peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front in 1996, were overshadowed by the onset of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Ramos' successor, Joseph Estrada assumed office in June 1998 and under his Presidency the economy recovered from −0.6% growth to 3.4% by 1999. The government announced a war against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in March 2000 and attacked various insurgent camps, including their headquarters. In the middle of ongoing conflict with the Abu Sayyaf, and and and accusations of alleged corruption, and a stalled impeachment process, Estrada was overthrown by the 2001 EDSA Revolution and he was succeeded by his Vice President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on January 20, 2001. In Arroyo's 9-year administration, the economy grew at a rate of 4-7%, averaging 5.33% from 2002 to 2007, and did not enter recession during the Great Recession. Her rule was tainted by graft and political scandals like the Hello Garci scandal pertaining to the alleged manipulation of votes in the 2004 presidential elections.\\"Arroyo claims hollow victory\\" by Leslie Davis, Asia Times Online, September 27, 2005. On November 23, 2009, 34 journalists and several civilians were massacred in Maguindanao. Benigno Aquino III won the 2010 national elections and served as the 15th President of the Philippines. The Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro was signed on October 15, 2012, as the first step of the creation of an autonomous political entity named Bangsamoro. However, a clash that took place in Mamasapano, Maguindanao killed 44 members of the Philippine National Police-Special Action Force and put the efforts to pass the Bangsamoro Basic Law into law in an impasse. Tensions regarding territorial disputes in eastern Sabah and the South China Sea escalated. In 2013, two more years were added to the country's ten-year schooling system for primary and secondary education. In 2014 the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, was signed, paving the way for the return of United States Armed Forces bases into the country. Former Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte won the 2016 presidential election, becoming the first president from Mindanao. On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of the Philippines in its case against China's claims in the South China Sea. After winning the Presidency, Duterte launched an intensified anti-drug campaign to fulfill a campaign promise of wiping out criminality in six months. As of February 2019, the death toll for the Philippine Drug War is 5,176. The implementation of the Bangsamoro Organic Law led to the creation of the autonomous Bangsamoro region in Mindanao. Corazon Aquino administration (1986–1992) Corazon Aquino, president from 1986–1992 With the People Power Revolution, Corazon Aquino's assumption into power marked the restoration of democracy in the country. Aquino immediately formed a revolutionary government to normalize the situation, and provided for a transitional \\"Freedom Constitution\\" that restored civil liberties and dismantled the heavily Marcos- ingrained bureaucracy— abolishing the Batasang Pambansa and relieving all public officials. The Aquino administration likewise appointed a constitutional commission that submitted a new permanent constitution that was ratified and enacted in February 1987.Agoncillo, History of the Filipino People, p. 586 The constitution crippled presidential power to declare martial law, proposed the creation of autonomous regions in the Cordilleras and Muslim Mindanao, and restored the presidential form of government and the bicameral Congress. Progress was made in revitalizing democratic institutions and respect for civil liberties, but Aquino's administration was also viewed as weak and fractious, and a return to full political stability and economic development was hampered by several attempted coups staged by disaffected members of the Philippine military. Aquino privatized many of the utilities the government owned, such as water and electricity. This practice was viewed by many as Aquino catering to oligarchic as well U.S. interests, losing the government's power of regulation. Economic growth was additionally hampered by a series of natural disasters. In June 1991, Mount Pinatubo in Central Luzon erupted, after being dormant for 600 years. It was the 2nd largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. It left 700 dead and 200,000 homeless, and cooled global weather by 1.5 °C. The alt=On September 16, 1991, despite lobbying by President Aquino, the Philippine Senate rejected a treaty that would have allowed a 10-year extension of the U.S. military bases in the country. The United States turned over Clark Air Base in Pampanga to the government in November, and Subic Bay Naval Base in Zambales in December 1992, ending almost a century of U.S. military presence in the Philippines. Fidel Ramos administration (1992–1998) In the 1992 elections, Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos (Lakas-NUCD), endorsed by Aquino, won by just 23.6% of the vote, over Miriam Defensor Santiago (Mds), Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. (NPC), House Speaker Ramon Mitra (LDP), former First Lady Imelda Marcos (KBL), Senate President Jovito Salonga (LP) and Vice President Salvador Laurel (NP). Early in his administration, Ramos declared \\"national reconciliation\\" his highest priority. He legalized the Communist Party and created the National Unification Commission (NUC), chaired by lawyer Manuel C. Herrera, to lay the groundwork for talks with communist insurgents, Muslim separatists, and military rebels. In June 1994, Ramos signed into law a general conditional amnesty covering all rebel groups, and Philippine military and police personnel accused of crimes committed while fighting the insurgents. In October 1995, the government signed an agreement bringing the military insurgency to an end. A standoff with China occurred in 1995, when the Chinese military built structures on Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands claimed by the Philippines as Kalayaan Islands.Fidel Ramos, president from 1992–1998 Ramos was heavily criticized for passing an oil-deregulation law, thus inflating prices of gasoline products. Ramos was also criticized for alleged corruption in his handling of the Philippine Centennial Exposition and the PEA-AMARI land deal, in which Ramos allegedly received kickbacks amounting to millions of pesos. A peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) under Nur Misuari, a major Muslim separatist group fighting for an independent Bangsamoro homeland in Mindanao, was signed in 1996, ending the 24-year-old struggle. However an MNLF splinter group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) under Salamat Hashim continued the armed Muslim struggle for an Islamic state. The 1998 elections were won by former movie actor and Vice President Joseph Ejercito Estrada (PMP-LAMMP) with overwhelming mass support, with close to 11 million votes. The other ten candidates included his closest rival and administration candidate, House Speaker Jose De Venecia (Lakas-NUCD-UMDP) with 4.4 million votes, Senator Raul Roco (Aksyon Demokratiko), former Cebu governor Emilio Osmeña (PROMDI) and Manila mayor Alfredo Lim (LP). Joseph Estrada administration (1998–2001) Joseph Estrada, president from 1998–2001 Estrada assumed office amid the Asian Financial Crisis. The economy did, however, recover from it. From a low −0.6% growth in 1998 to a moderate growth of 3.4% by 1999.Antonio C.

Economic Trends and Prospects in Developing Asia : Southeast Asia , Asian development Bank Like his predecessor there was a similar attempt to change the 1987 constitution. The process is termed as CONCORD or Constitutional Correction for Development. Unlike the Charter changes under Ramos and Arroyo, the CONCORD proposal, according to its proponents, would only amend the 'restrictive' economic provisions of the constitution that are considered as impediments to the entry of more foreign investments in the Philippines. However, Estrada was not successful in amending the constitution. On March 21, 2000, President Estrada declared an \\"all-out-war\\" against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) after the worsening secessionist movement in Mindanao.Speech of Former President Estrada on the GRP-MORO Conflict, Human development Network, September 18, 2008In the Spotlight: Moro Islamic Liberation Front , CDI Terrorism Project, February 15, 2002 The government later captured 46 MILF camps including the MILF's headquarters: Camp Abubakar.Speech of Former President Estrada on the GRP-MORO Conflict, Human development Network, September 18, 2008,Philippine Military Takes Moro Headquarters, People's Daily, July 10, 2000Mike Banos, AFP-MILF 2000 War in Mindanao Remembered , American Chronicle, April 13, 2006 In October 2000, Ilocos Sur governor Luis \\"Chavit\\" Singson, a close friend of Estrada, accused the President of receiving collections from jueteng, an illegal numbers game. On November 13, 2000, the House of Representatives impeached Estrada on grounds of bribery, graft and corruption, betrayal of public trust and culpable violation of the constitution. His impeachment trial in the Senate began on December 7, but broke down on January 17, 2001, after 11 senators allied with Estrada successfully blocked the opening of confidential bank records that would have been used by the prosecution to incriminate the President. In response, millions of people massed up at the EDSA Shrine, where in 1986 the People Power Revolution had ousted Marcos, demanding Estrada's immediate resignation. Estrada's cabinet resigned en masse and the military and police withdrew their support. On January 20, the Supreme Court declared the presidency vacant and swore in Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo as the country's 14th President. Estrada and his family evacuated the Malacañan Palace soon after. Nevertheless, Estrada himself stood before the Supreme Court on grounds that he did not resign, but just went on an indefinite leave. The Supreme Court upheld the legitimacy of Arroyo with finality on March 2, 2001. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo administration (2001–2010) Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, president from 2001–2010 Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (the daughter of the late President Diosdado Macapagal) was sworn in as Estrada's successor on the day of his departure. Estrada later challenged the legitimacy of Arroyo's government, claiming he did not resign from office, but the Supreme Court twice upheld Arroyo's legitimacy. After Estrada was arrested on corruption charges in April 2001, thousands of his supporters staged an \\"EDSA III\\" to overthrow the Arroyo government, but the attempt failed when the protest rallies degraded into violence. Arroyo's accession to power was further legitimated by the mid-term congressional and local elections held in May 2001, when her coalition won an overwhelming victory. Arroyo's initial term in office was marked by fractious coalition politics as well as a military mutiny in Manila in July 2003 that led her to declare a month-long nationwide state of rebellion. Although she had declared in December 2002 that she would not contest the May 2004 presidential election, citing a need to heal divisiveness, she reversed herself in October 2003 and decided to run. She was re-elected and sworn in for her own six-year term as president on June 30, 2004. In 2005, a tape of a wiretapped conversation surfaced bearing the voice of Arroyo apparently asking an election official if her margin of victory can be maintained. The tape sparked protests calling for Arroyo's resignation. Arroyo admitted to inappropriately speaking to an election official, but denied allegations of fraud and refused to step down. Attempts to impeach the president failed later that year. Toward the end of her term, Arroyo spearheaded a controversial plan for an overhaul of the constitution to transform the present unitary and presidential republic with a bicameral legislature into a federal parliamentary government with a unicameral legislature. Benigno Aquino III administration (2010–2016) Benigno Aquino III, President of the Philippines from 2010 to 2016. On June 9, 2010, at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, in Quezon City, the Congress of the Philippines proclaimed Aquino as the President-elect of the Philippines, following the 2010 election with 15,208,678 votes, while Jejomar Binay, the former mayor of Makati City, was proclaimed as the Vice President-elect of the Philippines with 14,645,574 votes, defeating runner-up for the vice presidency Mar Roxas, the standard- bearer of the Liberal Party for Vice President. The presidential transition began when Aquino won the 2010 Philippine presidential election. The transition was in charge of the new presidential residence, cabinet appointments and cordial meetings between them and the outgoing administration. On May 11, 2010, outgoing President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed an administrative order, creating the Presidential Transition Cooperation Team. Arroyo instructed outgoing Executive Secretary Leandro Mendoza to lead the transition team. The transition team was created \\"to ensure peaceful, orderly and [efficient] transition on the 30th of June\\". On June 9, 2010, the transition team started informal meetings with the Aquino transition team. On June 16, 2010, Aquino organized his transition team in a letter to outgoing Presidential Management Staff Secretary Elena Bautista- Horn. Aquino appointed the members of his transition team; defeated runner-up for the vice presidency Mar Roxas, incoming Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa, Jr., former Secretary of Education Florencio Abad, former Secretary of Finance Cesar Purisima, and Julia Abad, daughter of Florencio Abad and Aquino's chief of staff. The presidential residence of Aquino is the Bahay Pangarap (English: House of Dreams), located inside of Malacañang Park, at the headquarters of the Presidential Security Group across the Pasig River from Malacañan Palace. Aquino is the first president to make Bahay Pangarap his official residence. Aquino refused to live in Malacañan Palace, the official residence of the President of the Philippines, or in Arlegui Mansion, the residence of former presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel V. Ramos, stating that the two residences are too big, and also stated that his small family residence at Times Street in Quezon City would be impractical, since it would be a security concern for his neighbors. Aquino named long-time friend, Paquito Ochoa, Jr., as Executive Secretary. Aquino appointed Corazon Soliman as Secretary of Social Welfare & Development, a position she once held under the Arroyo administration but later resigned in 2005. On June 22, 2010, Leila de Lima accepted the offer to join the cabinet and later took over the helm of the Department of Justice on July 2, 2010. On July 15, 2010, Vice President Jejomar Binay was appointed as chairman of HUDCC. On June 24, 2010, Br. Armin Luistro FSC, president of De La Salle University, accepted the post of Secretary of Education after meeting with the school's stakeholders. On June 27, 2010, Aquino reappointed incumbent Secretary of Foreign Affairs Alberto Romulo. On June 29, 2010, Aquino officially named the members of his Cabinet, with Aquino himself as Secretary of the Interior and Local Government. Aquino also announced the formation of a truth commission that will investigate various issues including corruption allegations against outgoing President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Aquino named former Chief Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. to head the truth commission. The inauguration of President Benigno Aquino III and Vice President Jejomar Binay was held at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park, Manila on June 30, 2010. The oath of office was administered by Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Conchita Carpio-Morales, who officially accepted Aquino's request to swear him into office, reminiscent of the decision of his mother, who in 1986, was sworn into the presidency by Associate Justice Claudio Teehankee. Aquino refused to allow Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Renato Corona to swear him into office, due to Aquino's opposition to the appointment of Corona by outgoing President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Aquino was congratulated by the President Barack Obama of the United States, Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, and the government of Australia.Queen Elizabeth II, other foreign leaders hail Aquino (June 30, 2010), Manila Bulletin (archived from the original on June 29, 2012)  Rodrigo Duterte administration (2016–present)  Rodrigo Duterte takes his oath as he is sworn in as the 16th President of the Philippines alt= Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte of PDP–Laban won the 2016 presidential election by a landslide, garnering 39.01% or 16,601,997 of the total votes, becoming the first Mindanaoan to become president. On the other hand, Camarines Sur 3rd District representative Leni Robredo won with the second-narrowest margin in history, against Senator Bongbong Marcos. On May 30, the Congress had proclaimed Rodrigo Duterte, despite his absence, as president-elect and Leni Robredo as vice president-elect. The presidential transition of Rodrigo Duterte began when Duterte won the 2016 Philippine presidential election. The transition was in charge of the new presidential residence, cabinet appointments and cordial meetings between them and the outgoing administration. Duterte's presidency began following his inauguration on June 30, 2016 at the Rizal Ceremonial Hall of the Malacañang Palace in Manila, which was attended by more than 627 guests. On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in favor of the Philippines in its case against China's claims in the South China Sea. On August 1, 2016, the Duterte administration launched a 24-hour complaint office accessible to the public through a nationwide hotline, 8888, and change the nationwide emergency telephone number from 117 to 911. By October 2016, one hundred days after Duterte took office, the death toll for the Philippine Drug War passed 3,000 people. As of February 2019, the death toll for the Philippine Drug War is 5,176. In middle of October to November 2016, President Duterte announced numerous times his shift to ties with China and Russia. The president also blasted the United States and Barack Obama, as well as the United Nations and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, numerous times in various live interviews and speeches while in the Philippines, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brunei, and Laos. In November 8, 2016, the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled in favor of the burial of the late president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani, the country's official cemetery for heroes, provoking protests from various groups. Duterte initiated the \\"Build, Build, Build\\" program in 2017 that aimed to usher the Philippines into a new \\"golden age\\" of infrastructure and was expected to create more jobs and business opportunities, which, in turn, would sustain the country's economic growth and accelerate poverty reduction. The construction industry needs two million more workers to sustain the program. The program is made up of numerous projects in various sectors, such as air, rail, and road transport as well as other public utilities and infrastructures. The country is expected to spend $160 billion to $180 billion up to 2022 for the public investments in infrastructure. In 2017, Duterte signed the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act, which provides for free tuition and exemption from other fees in public universities and colleges for Filipino students, as well as subsidies for those enrolled in private higher education institutions. He also signed 20 new laws, including the Universal Health Care Act, the creation of the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development, establishing a national cancer control program, and allowing subscribers to keep their mobile numbers for life.

Football career Standing at just 170 centimetres tall and weighing 62 kg, Chicken (so nicknamed because his mother could never catch him when he was young) was a deceptively quick winger who played 150 games (kicking 31 goals) for Fitzroy between 1930 and 1940. Recruited from Collingwood Technical School and East Brunswick Methodists, where he was coached by former Fitzroy player Arnold Beitzel, Smallhorn later became a long-time panellist on Harry Beitzel's TV show (Harry was Arnold's son). His early football was played as a rover, but a best-on-ground performance on a wing in his debut with Fitzroy had him permanently shifted to that position.

Relevance in history  Following the Upadesamrta (Nectar of Instruction) by early 16th-century saint Rupa Goswami of Vrindavan, a close associate of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, many Vaishnavas consider Radha Kund to be the supreme of all holy places.Rupa Gosvami: Sri Upadeshamrita, verse 9. Gaudiya Vedanta Publications, 2003. Legend has it that when Lord Krishna slew a mighty asura (demon) in the form of a bull, his consort Radha tersely told Krishna to wash off his sins by taking dips in various holy rivers. Krishna laughed it off and struck the ground with his foot whereupon the mighty rivers emerged, welled up and formed a kunda (temple tank). Subsequently, the Lord bathed in the water to please Radha. The kunda came to be called \\"Shyam-Kund\\". Indignant that Krishna used his powers for this, Radha and her girl attendants dug out another kunda nearby with their bangles. However, as the water did not raise up in the Kund, it had to be filled with water from \\"Manasi-Ganga\\", another holy kunda at Govardhan which was a little far off. Taking piety on Radha and other Gopis, with their permission, and Krishna's divine grace, sacred waters from Shyam Kund broke its banks close to midnight on the eighth day of the waning moon in Kartik (Damodar, October-November) and started filling the Radhakund.Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana Gosvami Maharaja: Sri Vrajmandala- Parikrama, pages 139-144. Gaudiya Vedanta Publications, 2007. Krishna then took bath in Radhakund and announced that to whoever takes bath in Radhakund on this day of the year or any day in the future, the seed of intense love (Prema-Bhakti) which Radharani has for Him would be given. Similarly, Radharani took bath in Syamakund and announced that to anyone who takes bath in Syamakund, She would also give the seed of love that Krishna has for Her. To this day, millions of pilgrims desiring love for Radha-Krishna come to this holy spot on the occasion of Ardha-Ratri-Snan (Midnight bath) to take bath in a reverential mood, bathing first in Radha-Kund, then in Shyam-kund, and then again in Radha-kund. This is the only place of pilgrimage where an auspicious bath is taken at midnight. Demographics India census, Radha-Kund had a population of 5889. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Radha-Kund has an average literacy rate of 65%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 76%, and female literacy is 53%. In Radha- Kund, 16% of the population is under 6 years of age.

Bérubé, Michael. Written in Memory, The Nation. July 17, 2003. Keller's teacher, Anne Sullivan, had mentioned that the autumn leaves were \\"painted ruby, emerald, gold, crimson, and brown,\\" and Keller, by her own account, imagined fairies doing the work. Keller wrote a story about how a cask of jewels, being transported by fairy servants, had melted in the sun and covered the leaves. As a birthday gift, Keller sent the story to Michael Anagnos, the head of the Perkins School for the Blind, who published the story in The Mentor, the Perkins alumni magazine. It was picked up by The Goodson Gazette, a journal on deaf-blind education, based in Virginia.  Controversy  A friend, one of the Perkins teachers informed the Gazette that Keller's story was a reproduction of \\"Frost Fairies\\" from Margaret Canby's book Birdie and His Fairy Friends. The Gazette ran both stories, and the editor commented that he believed it a deliberate attempt at fraud by Keller's handlers. Keller insisted she had no memory of having read the book or having had it read to her, but passages in her letters from the period, which she describes as \\"dreams\\", strongly resembled other episodes in the book. In Sullivan's account of the incident, addressed to John Hitz of the Volta Bureau, she had investigated to see who could have read the story to Helen or even owned a copy of the book. It seemed her own mentor, Sophia Hopkins, had taken charge of the then eight-year-old Keller while Sullivan was on vacation, and had read the book to her through finger spelling. Keller stated that she remembered nothing of that and that she was devastated that people she had loved and trusted would accuse her of lying.\\"It made us feel so bad to think that people thought we had been untrue and wicked. My heart was full of tears, for I love the beautiful truth with my whole heart and mind.\\" From \\"Helen Keller's Own Statement,\\" from her diary, dated 1892, January 30, and printed in The Story of My Life in the chapter \\"Literary Style.\\" Similar stories Father Frost Jack Frost folklore Old Man Winter References to King Frost in popular culture include the temporal \\"The reign of King Frost had begun\\" in a 1920s dime romance novel. Anagnos was apparently willing to believe that Keller had simply adapted the story from buried memories. However, Keller further discussed the matter with one of the Perkins teachers and, as she remembered it, \\"something I said made her think she detected in my words a confession\\" that she had knowingly plagiarized the story. The teacher's own detailed account, which was only discovered in 1978 and published in Joseph Lash's Helen and Teacher, confirms that Keller told her Sullivan had read her \\"Frost Fairies\\" the previous fall and that she had adapted her own story out of that one.Quoted by Joseph P. Lash in Helen and Teacher (DaCapo, 1997), p. 136-138. He cites it as coming from the document Miss Sullivan's Methods, referenced below. By all accounts, the teacher reported what Keller had told her to Anagnos. A storm of outrage swept through the school, apparently headed by the teachers. Keller's biographers, particularly Joseph P. Lash, suggest that they were also incensed by the fact that Sullivan and Keller used the facilities although they were neither employed by nor officially registered with the school.Lash, Joseph P., Helen and Teacher. DaCapo, 1997, p. 141. An in-house \\"trial\\" ensued to determine whether or not Sullivan had deliberately falsified Keller's abilities; eight teachers interrogated the 12-year-old child for two hours and fought the issue to a draw, the tie-breaking vote being cast by Anagnos in Keller's favor. Although Sullivan protested that \\"all use of language is imitative, and one's style is made up of all other styles that one has met,\\" and even Canby came forward to say that Keller's version was superior to her own,\\"What a wonderfully active and retentive mind that gifted child must have! If she had remembered and written down accurately, a short story, and that soon after hearing it, it would have been a marvel; but to have heard the story once, three years ago, and in such a way that neither her parents nor teacher could ever allude to it or refresh her memory about it, and then to have been able to reproduce it so vividly, even adding some touches of her own in perfect keeping with the rest, which really improve the original, is something that very few girls of riper age, and with every advantage of sight, hearing, and even great talents for composition, could have done as well, if at all.\\" Margaret Canby, quoted by John A. Macy, in Literary Style, supplemental chapter to Keller's Story of My Life, entire text online and found 2008-03-07. Anagnos never regained his faith in Sullivan or Keller and described them years later as \\"a living lie.\\" Keller had a nervous breakdown over the incident, and never wrote fiction again. In 1978, an anonymously written typescript, \\"Miss Sullivan's Methods,\\" was uncovered at the Perkins Institute library., p. 134. See also \\"Touching Words,\\" by Jim Swan, in The Construction of authorship: textual appropriation in Law and Literature, ed. by Martha Woodmansee, p. 57. Joseph Lash describes it as an analysis of The Story of My Life, probably written by David Prescott Hall in 1906 just after the death of Michael Anagnos. The text identifies many of Keller's letters as containing paraphrases of Canby's writing as well as verbatim passages. Keller and Sullivan cited some of them in their own explanation of what happened, and Sullivan stated several times Keller's writings at the time contained extensive paraphrases of either what she had read or what she had had read to her. The document also contains the text of the letter written by the Perkins teacher in which she transcribed the conversation with Keller that had led to the inquiry. Lash believes the author of the document was trying to prove Sullivan, not Hopkins, had read Birdie and his Fairy Friends to Keller and had done so the same autumn, not four years previously. He concludes that if that was the case: * Keller wrote \\"The Frost King\\" as another of her paraphrased stories, which was similar to what she had been writing in her letters of the period. * Sullivan, who always checked Keller's writings before allowing them to be mailed, would have recognized \\"The Frost King\\" as a paraphrase but considered it to be sufficiently original that she passed it on as Keller's own work. * Sullivan may not have understood what plagiarism is. * When Keller was accused, Sullivan attempted a cover-up by denying she had read the Birdie stories and impressing upon Keller the importance of stating that Hopkins had read her the stories years before. The story was later published in Keller's 1903 biography with a complete analysis of both stories and the incident. Also in 1903, Mark Twain described the controversy as \\"owlishly idiotic and grotesque.\\"  Notes   References  * What Helen Saw, New Yorker article discussing Helen's life and accusations of plagiarism and coaching throughout her life.

Geography Rahon is situated on the Jullundur City Jaijon Doaba line of the Northern Railway, Rahon is 7 km from Nawanshahr, the tahsil/subdivision headquarters, and 65 km from Jalandhar, the district headquarters. It is also connected by road with Nawashahr (8 km), Jadla (12 km), Ludhiana (51 km), and Phillaur (37 km), Machhiwara (18 km). Its population was 12,046 in 2001. It is a Class-III municipality. In 2017-18 Sh. Hemeant Randeav Bobi is the current Municipal Corporation Chairman of the city. History Population Rahon is the one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in India. It was also among the 50 most populous cities in the world for many centuries, particularly in the period between 52 B.C.-1750 A.D.. After that period, Rahon started witnessing gradual decline due to epidemics, attacks from foreign invaders, and a reduction in merchant activity when the silk route began to bypass Rahon in favor of Kabul. Rahon had Asia's oldest mandi bazaar (now ruined) situated at the city's Delhi gate. The bazaar was famous for its variety and quality of products, including spices, weapons, apparel, and footwear. Rahon's population also declined due to outbreaks of malaria, the immigration of a large proportion of its Muslim population to Pakistan during partition, and civilian casualties resulting from attacks by outside invaders. Rahon has the oldest Government High School in the Punjab state, which was constructed in 1857. Founding Rahon is said to have been founded in the first century B.C. by Raja Raghab, a Brahmin ruler, who called it Raghupur, by which name it continued to be called in correspondence by the Pandits of the city until the twentieth century. After its founding, the city came into the possession of Gujars, who were eventually driven out by the Sikh Rajputs, who in turn succumbed to the Ghorewaha Rajputs, whose conquest of the country is put down as having occurred in the time of Muhammad Ghori (d. 1206 AD). The ruler Raja Rajpal renamed the town ‘Rahon’, reportedly as tribute to a lady named ‘Raho’. Some contemporaries had written that it was considered unlucky to speak of Rahon by its proper name, in the morning, when fasting. According to them, until breakfast Rahon should be referred to as ‘Zanana shahr’, or ‘Women town’. In the time of Ibrahim Lodhi (1517-1526 AD), the city was reported to have a population of 145,000 and was a flourishing trading center on the route to Tibet and Central Asia. Local shoemaking attained a high degree of skill and a pair prepared by one Mian Khaki Shah of Rahon is said to still be on exhibit in a museum at Lahore, Pakistan. Toward the beginning of the Mughal period, the town was occupied by the Ghorewaha Raja of Machhiwara, Rana Udho. He actively assisted Akbar (1556-1605 AD). During his fight for the Delhi throne, he defeated and captured the rebellion leader Bairam Khan. As a reward, the Raja allowed Rana to retain the jagir of Rahon. In Akbar's time, Rahon was the capital of the Dardhak Mahal and gave its name to one of the two tarafs into which the mahal was divided. In Aurangzeb’s reign (1658-1707 AD) a brick fort was built here. The Rajputs of Rahon were Chaudhris and men of much influence during the period of Muhammadan rule. However, after the Raja of Rahon converted to Islam, he was beheaded and his territories seized by the Rana of Jadla. Medieval to present In 1710 AD, Rahon was conquered by Banda Singh Bahadur after defeating mughals in the Battle of Rahon (1710).Later, it fell back into the hands of the Mughals. In 1759 AD, Rahon was seized by Dhallewali Confederacy Sikhs led by Tara Singh Gheba, and remained in their possession until Tara Singh's death, when it was added to Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s dominions. However, Pandits continued to dominate local politics. Pandit Sardars ran the city's administration for centuries. After the collapse of the Sikh Empire, the descendants of the Rana of Rahon came to prominence again and the Rana of Rahon, Chaudhry Abdul Rehman Khan of Rahon was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Punjab from the Unionist Party before Indian Independence. Until independence in 1947 the Rana of Rahon and the Rajrana of Jadla controlled most of the estates, while the Muslim Rana of Rahon fled to Pakistan, first moving to Sahiwal and later settling in Rehamnabad Khanqa Dogran. After Partition, Pandit Buta Ram Qasir Jagirdar continued to serve as Municipal Councilor and local leader of Rahon for next two and half decades. Pandit Butar Ram's father Sansar Chand was Zaildar of the region. Rahon is an old city and it overlooks the low valley of the Satluj, it held social, economic, and political significance during various periods of history. This significance stemmed primarily from the city's location along the ancient trade route to Tibet and Central Asia and it began to fade in importance as soon as a new route through Kabul was opened during Mughal times. Further, Rahon's proximity to marshes made it a victim of periodic large-scale outbreaks of malaria. Over time, the city's population declined greatly, falling to 69,000 when the British took over after the First Anglo Sikh War in 1846 and falling further to 6,607 by 1971. After the division of the country in 1947, the Muslim population of Rahon was uprooted to Pakistan, with most settling in Fasalabad and Rahwali. Demographics In the 2001 Indian census, Rahon had a population of 12,046. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Rahon had an average literacy rate of 81%, higher than the national average of 65.38%: male literacy was 88%, and female literacy was 75%. 11% of the population was under 6 years of age.

The Canyon Dam in Texas is a rolled-earth dam on the Guadalupe River in the Hill Country. The water impounded by the dam forms Canyon Lake. Geography The dam is located 36 miles (58 km) northeast of San Antonio and 38 miles (61 km) southwest of Austin. The dam is 6,830 feet (2,082 m) long, across a narrow section of the Guadalupe River valley. The top of the dam is 974 feet (297 m) above sea level, or 224 feet (68 m) above the riverbed. A spillway, located south of the dam, protects the dam by releasing water when the lake level rises to 943 feet (287 m) above sea level. The dam is located near the Balcones Escarpment. The rocky canyons to the west of the escarpment can carry more water than the riverbeds of the plains to the east; this has caused problems with flash flooding in cities and towns east of the escarpment. History After major floods on the Guadalupe River in 1936 and 1938, state and community leaders pressured the federal government to help control flooding of the river. Congress authorized initial funds for construction of a dam in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945; final construction approval came in the Flood Control Act of 1954. Construction of Canyon Dam began in 1958 to provide both flood control and water conservation. Impoundment of the lake began in 1964, and the lake was filled to its conservation level in 1968. The dam was built by the Tencon Corporation of Fort Worth, Texas. The United States Army Corps of Engineers controls the physical operations; and water in the lake is managed by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority.

The roll is made up of pupils of all ages. The majority of pupils are in the girls secondary, day and boarding school, but there is also a primary school consisting of boys and girls in years 1-6. History Bishopscourt building, a Category I Historic Place Columba College was established in 1915 by the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand as a private day and boarding school for girls with co-educational primary classes. The Rev'd Alexander Whyte was a key figure in the foundation of Columba College, through his vision for a Presbyterian girls' school. Columba College was created from two earlier Dunedin girls' schools, Girton College and Braemar House. Girton College had been founded in 1886 by the first woman graduate of the University of Otago, Caroline Freeman, who later sold it to Frances Ross in 1891. Ross subsequently purchased Braemar House, combined it with Girton College, and became the first Head Mistress of the newly created Columba College. The schools moved to the current site, at Bishopscourt, a property purchased from the first Anglican bishop for Otago and Southland, Bishop Nevill which had a large house on it designed by William Mason built in 1872. Columba College became integrated as a composite school under the terms of the Private Schools' Integration Act in 1994. Boarding facilities Attached to the school are boarding facilities, catering for approximately 110 students, both domestic and international from years 7 to 13.

It was the first of Arbuckle's \\"Comique\\" films to be filmed on the west coast, the previous five having been filmed in and around New York City. The idea for the story came from Natalie Talmadge, who was later to become Keaton's first wife. The film contains racial stereotypes and attitudes, including a scene in which a gang of rowdy cowboys make a black man, played by Ernie Morrison Sr., dance by shooting at his feet.  Plot  Arbuckle plays a drifter who has caught a ride hiding in a train's water tank but is thrown off the train after being discovered stealing food from the passengers. He is chased by a group of Indians who intend to kill and eat him. He runs to a town called Mad Dog Gulch where he inadvertently foils a robbery attempt by Wild Bill Hickup (St John) and his gang after which the town sheriff (Keaton) appoints him the new bar tender of the local bar \\"The Last Chance Saloon\\". Later Hickup returns, this time drunk and causing chaos in the bar. After he begins forcing himself on a young lady \\"Salvation Sue\\" (Lake), The Bartender and the sheriff attempt to eject Hickup once again. When their attempts to knock him out by breaking bottles over his head and even shooting him in the back prove ineffective, they manage to subdue him by tickling him until he flees. Humiliated, Hickup attempts to gain his revenge by kidnapping Sue and riding out of the town with her as his gang keep the bartender and the sheriff at bay. The bartender eventually breaks free and chases Hickup back to his shack as the Sheriff holds off Hickup's men. After once again subduing Hickup by tickling him, the bartender and Sue push his shack off a hill with him still inside.

For example, the Chicago Board of Censors required a cut of the scene of arrows in man's back and their removal, man burning back with gas flames, and the shooting of the bartender. Film clip  Critical response  Variety gave the film a positive review in its January 25, 1918 issue, saying it \\"hits a better comedy tempo than any of his [Arbuckle's] recent productions.\\" Keaton's comic tumbles were singled out for praise, as was Arbuckle's direction of the film: \\"Good camera work aids the comedy.\\" See also * List of American films of 1918 * Fatty Arbuckle filmography * Buster Keaton filmography  References  *\\"Out West\\" (film review) in Variety Weekly.

In Rajapur, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. History During the days of the Bijapur Sultanate, Rajapur was important maritime trade centre due to a navigable creek that connects it to the Arabian sea. It became an access point to the rich cities of Deccan for those involved in the Arabia-India commerce.  Doroji's attack on Rajapur  After defeating the Bijapuri general Afzal Khan, Shivaji entered the present-day Ratnagiri district and started capturing the important ports and towns. Many Bijapuri generals fled to Rajapur because its governor, known by the title Rustam-i-Zamani, was on friendly terms with Shivaji.Shivaji and the English in Western India by Jadunath Sarkar, in The Journal of the Bihar Research Society (p. 418-427) However, Doroji, one of Shivaji's generals, attacked Rajapur. The East India Company had stationed several men in the town, under the charge of Henry Revington to facilitate the trade of saltpeter, pepper, calicoes and cotton. When Rustam-i-Zamani heard about the approach of the Maratha army, he procured funds from one of the Company's brokers and escaped with the money in a junk (ship). Revington sent an English ship Diamond to stop him. When confronted by the English, Rustam offered the company the ownership of two of his junks in lieu of payment. At the same time, the Marathas also arrived, and asked the English to hand over the junks to them. The English declined to oblige, unless they were given the money that Rustam owed them. The angry Marathas seized two of the Company's brokers, Baghji and Balaji, in Jaitapur. When the English sent Philip Gyffard to demand their release, he was arrested as well. The three prisoners were taken to Kharepatan fort on 18 January 1660. Henry Revington wrote to Shivaji in February 1660, requesting their release. Meanwhile, the brokers had also pleaded for their release, and Shivaji issued an order to set them free. Shivaji also condemned the attack on Rajapur, dismissed Doroji and issued an order to restore all the loot from Rajapur. However, a rogue officer at Kharepatan refused to set Gyfford free unless he received a bribe. He decided to move Gyfford to another location, escorted by his small Maratha contingent. Revington dispatched an armed party that waylaid the contingent and rescued Gyfford by force.  Shivaji's relations with the Company  The East India Company personnel at Rajapur maintained amicable relations with Shivaji until June 1660, when the Adilshahi general Siddi Jauhar attacked Shivaji's camp at Panhala. During this siege, Siddi Jauhar used grenades purchased from the English at Rajapur. He also hired some English artillerymen, who came to Panhala with an English flag, although the Company did not officially support him. Shivaji managed to escape from Panhala, and decided to take revenge as he assumed that the Company had supported Siddi Jauhar. He plundered the English factory at Rajapur in December 1661. During the attack, Shivaji captured four Englishmen - Henry Revington, Richard Taylor, Randolph Taylor and Philip Gyffard - who were imprisoned, first at Vasota and later at Songd. Shivaji's officer Raoji Pandit treated them well, but the Marathas demanded ransom for their release. The English insisted that they had lost everything at Rajapur and would be unable to pay a ransom. Instead, they tried to negotiate their release in exchange for their support in capturing the Danda Rajpuri sea fort. This negotiation could not happen due to the absence of Shivaji, who was away on an expedition near Kalyan. The English prisoners wrote an angry letter to the Company's President, who replied that they had been imprisoned not for performing the Company duties, but for illegally supporting Siddi Jauhar without the Company's permission. Subsequently, the four made an escape attempt, but they were caught and moved to Raigad. Later, Shivaji came to know that the Company had not officially supported Siddi Jauhar, and that some rogue personnel had joined Jauhar without the Company's permission. He ordered the release of the English prisoners in 1663. In a letter dated 6 February 1663, Shivaji also assured that the English would enjoy his protection in the future. The English informed him about the losses suffered by them at Rajapur, and tried to negotiate a settlement. In 1672, Shivaji offered them 5000 pagodas towards the losses. He also promised that if the English decided to set up a new factory at Rajapur, he would \\"show all kindness and civility imaginable to the said factory\\".  Later developments  The English and French East India Companies had factories which were located near the creek. It is known that these factories were abandoned in the early 18th century and appear to be used later for offices (kacheris).

It resulted in a victory for the union and was followed in 1903 by the Colorado Labor Wars. It is notable for being the only time in United States history when a state militia was called out (May/June 1894) in support of striking workers.Philpott, p. 26. The strike was characterized by firefights and use of dynamite, and ended after a standoff between the Colorado state militia and a private force working for owners of the mines. In the years after the strike, the WFM's popularity and power increased significantly through the region. Causes of the strike At the end of the 19th century, Cripple Creek was the largest town in the gold-mining district that included the towns of Altman, Anaconda, Arequa, Goldfield, Elkton, Independence and Victor, about 20 miles from Colorado Springs on the southwest side of Pikes Peak. Surface gold was discovered in the area in 1891, and within three years more than 150 mines were operating there.Philpott, p. 26.Holbrook, p. 73. The Panic of 1893 caused the price of silver to crash; the gold price, however, remained fixed, as the United States was on the gold standard. The influx of silver miners into the gold mines caused a lowering of wages. Mine owners demanded longer hours for less pay. In January 1894, Cripple Creek mine owners J. J. Hagerman, David Moffat and Eben Smith, who together employed one-third of the area's miners, announced a lengthening of the work-day to ten hours (from eight), with no change to the daily wage of $3.00 per day. When workers protested, the owners agreed to employ the miners for eight hours a day – but at a wage of only $2.50.Holbrook, pp. 73–4.Suggs, p. 17. Not long before this dispute, miners at Cripple Creek had formed the Free Coinage Union. Once the new changes went into effect, they affiliated with the Western Federation of Miners, and became Local 19. The union was based in Altman, and had chapters in Anaconda, Cripple Creek and Victor. On February 1, 1894, the mine owners began implementing the 10-hour day. Union president John Calderwood issued a notice a week later demanding that the mine owners reinstate the eight-hour day at the $3.00 wage. When the owners did not respond, the nascent union struck on February 7. Portland, Pikes Peak, Gold Dollar and a few smaller mines immediately agreed to the eight-hour day and remained open, but larger mines held out.Holbrook, p. 74. Events of the strike The strike had an immediate effect. By the end of February, every smelter in Colorado was either closed or running part-time. At the beginning of March, the Gold King and Granite mines gave in and resumed the eight-hour day.Holbrook, pp. 74–5. Mine owners still holding out for the 10-hour day soon attempted to re-open their mines. On March 14, they obtained a court injunction ordering the miners not to interfere with the operation of their mines, and hired strikebreakers. The WFM initially attempted to persuade these men to join the union and strike, but when they were unsuccessful, the union resorted to threats and violence. These tactics succeeded in driving non-union miners out of the district.Suggs, p. 18.Holbrook, p. 75. On March 16, an armed group of miners ambushed and captured six sheriff's deputies en route to the Victor mine. A fight broke out, in which one deputy was shot and another hit by a club. An Altman judge, a member of the WFM, charged the deputies with carrying concealed weapons and disturbing the peace, then released them. Involvement of the state militia After the assault on his deputies, El Paso CountyIn 1899, after a second WFM strike in Cripple Creek was brutally repressed by the state militia, the far western section of El Paso County was made into its own county. Today, Cripple Creek and the surrounding district lie within Teller County, Colorado. Sheriff M. F. Bowers wired the governor and requested the intervention of the state militia (predecessor to the Colorado National Guard). Governor Davis H. Waite, a 67-year-old Populist, dispatched 300 troops to the area on March 18 under the command of Adjutant General T. J. Tarsney. Tarsney found the area tense but quiet. Union president Calderwood assured him that union members would cooperate with his operations, even surrendering for arrest if requested. Convinced that Bowers had exaggerated the extent of the chaos in the region, Tarsney recommended the withdrawal of troops; Waite concurred. The state militia left Cripple Creek on March 20.Holbrook, pp. 75–6. In response to the recall of the state militia, the mine owners closed the mines. Bowers arrested Calderwood, 18 other miners, and the mayor and town marshal of Altman (who had supported the miners). They were taken to Colorado Springs and quickly tried on several different charges, but found not guilty. Meanwhile, outbursts of violence, such as stone-throwing and fights between union miners and scabs, increased in frequency. Stores and warehouses were broken into, and guns and ammunition stolen.Holbrook, p. 76. In early May, the mine owners met with representatives of the WFM in Colorado Springs in an attempt to end the strike. The owners offered to return to the eight-hour day, but at a daily wage of only $2.75. The union rejected the offer and talks broke down. County sheriff deputizes an army Shortly after negotiations with the union ended, the mine owners met secretly with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado Springs. They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of nonunion workers, and asked if he could protect such a large force of men. Bowers said he could not, for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm more than a few deputies. The mine owners offered to subsidize an initial force of a hundred or so men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.Suggs, pp. 18–9. News of the mine owners' meeting with Bowers soon leaked out, and the miners organized and armed themselves in response. Calderwood was leaving on a tour of the WFM locals in Colorado to raise funds for the Cripple Creek strike, and so appointed Junius J. Johnson, a former U.S. Army officer, to take over strike operations. Johnson immediately established a camp atop Bull Hill, which overlooked the town of Altman. He ordered that fortifications be built, a commissary stocked and the miners be drilled in maneuvers.Holbrook, pp. 76–7.Suggs, p. 19. Dynamiting the Strong mine On May 24, the strikers seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which overlooked the town of Victor. The next day, at about 9 am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp at the base of Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 feet into the air. A few moments later, the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.Holbrook, p. 77–8. A celebration broke out among the miners, who broke into liquor warehouses and saloons. That night, some of the miners loaded a flatcar with dynamite and attempted to roll it toward the deputies' camp. It overturned short of its goal and killed a cow. Other miners wanted to blow up every mine in the region, but Johnson quickly discouraged them. Frustrated, several drunken miners then stole a work train and steamed into Victor. They caught up with the group of fleeing deputies, and a gun battle broke out. One deputy and one miner died, a man on each side was wounded, and six strikers were captured by the deputies.Holbrook, pp. 78–9. The miners subsequently captured three officials of the Strong mine who had been present when the shafthouse was blown up. A formal prisoner exchange later freed all prisoners on both sides. Calderwood returned during the night and restored calm. He asked saloons to close, and he imprisoned several miners who had instigated outbursts of violence.Holbrook, p. 79. On May 26, mine owners met again with Sheriff Bowers in Colorado City. The owners agreed to provide more funding to allow the sheriff to raise 1,200 additional deputies. Bowers quickly recruited men from all over the state, and established a camp for them in the town of Divide, about 12 miles away from Cripple Creek. Waite intervenes Warned about the size of the force Bowers was raising, Gov. Davis Hanson Waite interceded again in the strike. He issued a proclamation on May 27 in which he called on the miners to disband their encampment on Bull Hill. In a development unparalleled in American labor history, he also declared the force of 1,200 deputies to be illegal and ordered the group disbanded. He also ordered the state militia to be on the alert for a possible move on Cripple Creek. On May 28, the governor visited the miners, who authorized Waite to negotiate on their behalf.Holbrook, pp. 79–80. An initial meeting on May 30 nearly ended in disaster. Waite and several local civic leaders called union president Calderwood and mine owners Hagerman and Moffat to a conference in a meeting hall on the campus of Colorado College in Colorado Springs. Talks were under way and proceeding well when a mob of local citizens attempted to storm the building. Blaming Calderwood and Waite for the violence in Cripple Creek, they intended to lynch both men. As a local judge distracted the mob, Calderwood and Waite escaped out a rear door and onto the governor's waiting train. Negotiations resumed in Denver on June 2, and the parties reached an agreement on June 4. The agreement provided for resumption of the $3.00-per-day wage and the eight-hour day. The mine owners agreed not to retaliate against or prosecute any miner who had taken part in the strike, and the miners agreed not to discriminate against or harass any nonunion worker who remained employed in the mines. The state militia returns Cripple Creek, Colo., under martial law in 1894. With 1,300 deputies still in Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers was unable to control the army he had created. On June 5, the deputies moved into Altman, perhaps as a prelude to storming Bull Hill. The deputies cut the telegraph and telephone wires leading out of town, and imprisoned a number of reporters. Concerned that the paramilitary force might get out of hand, Waite again dispatched the state militia, this time under the command of General E.J. Brooks. When Colorado state troops arrived in Cripple Creek early on the morning of June 6, more violence had already broken out. The deputies were exchanging gunfire with the miners on Bull Hill. Gen. Brooks quickly moved his troops from the train station to the foot of Bull Hill. As Sheriff Bowers and Gen. Brooks began to argue about what course of action to take next, the deputies took advantage of the lull and attempted to charge the miners.Each miner carried a rifle, a cartridge belt and five dynamite charges with percussion caps. The hill had been mined with dynamite as well, and the miners had rigged a ballista capable of throwing Molotov cocktails a quarter- mile. The grade of the hill was steeper than that which faced the British at the Battle of Bunker Hill. See Holbrook, p. 81. The miners sounded the whistle at the Victor mine, alerting Gen. Brooks. Soldiers of the state militia quickly intercepted the deputies and stopped their advance. Brooks ordered his men to occupy the top of Bull Hill, and the miners offered no resistance.Holbrook, p. 81. The deputies turned their attention to Cripple Creek itself. They arrested and imprisoned hundreds of citizens without cause. Many inhabitants of the town were seized on the street or pulled from their homes, then clubbed, kicked or beaten. The deputies formed a gauntlet and forced townspeople to pass through it, spitting, slapping and kicking them. With Bull Hill in his possession, Gen. Brooks began detaining the deputies. By nightfall, Brooks had seized the town and corralled all of Bowers' men.Holbrook, pp. 81–2. Illegal sheriff's deputies under military guard in Cripple Creek, Colo., 1894 Waite threatened to declare martial law, but the mine owners refused to disband their deputy force. Gen. Brooks then threatened to keep his troops in the region for another 30 days. Faced with the prospect of paying for a paramilitary force which could only sit on its hands, the owners agreed to disband it. The deputies, which Gen. Brooks had dispatched via rail to Colorado Springs, began dispersing on June 11. The Waite agreement became operative the same day, and the miners returned to work.Suggs, pp. 19–20.Holbrook, p. 82. Union president Calderwood and 300 other miners were arrested and charged with a variety of crimes. Only four miners were convicted of any charges, and were quickly pardoned by the sympathetic populist governor. Impact of the strike The Cripple Creek strike was a major victory for the miners' union. The Western Federation of Miners used the success of the strike to organize almost every worker in the Cripple Creek region – including waitresses, laundry workers, bartenders and newsboys – into 54 local unions. The WFM flourished in the Cripple Creek area for almost a decade, even helping to elect most county officials (including the new sheriff).Suggs, p. 20. The Cripple Creek strike also transformed the Western Federation of Miners enormously as a political entity. The year-old union, weak and penniless before the strike, became widely admired among miners throughout the West. Thousands of workers joined the union over the next few years. Politicians and labor officials throughout the country became steady allies of the union, and the WFM became a political force throughout much of the Rocky Mountain West. But the WFM's success at Cripple Creek also created a significant backlash. The WFM was forever tarred as a dangerous and violent organization in the eyes of employers. Never again would the WFM have in a local strike the level of public support it enjoyed at Cripple Creek in 1894. Indeed, when the union struck the Cripple Creek mines again in 1898, its public support ended after violence broke out. During another strike in 1903–4, whose violent significance earned it the name Colorado Labor Wars, the union went up against the power of the employers and the state combined. The union's success also altered the course of Colorado politics. Colorado citizens blamed Waite for protecting the miners' union and encouraging violence and anarchy.Waite did not dispute charges that his administration was partial to union organizing, saying: \\"Well, what if it is? Is it not the truth that for thirty years the two old parties have been legislating for the creditor class? It is true, and turn about is fair play.\\" The backlash led to Waite's defeat at the polls in November 1894 and the election of Republican Albert McIntire. The Populist movement in Colorado never recovered.Philpott, pp. 25, 27. The Cripple Creek strike of 1894 also hardened the attitudes of mine owners. Under Gov. McIntire, the government of Colorado formed a political alliance with the mine owners. Mine owners increasingly turned to the Thiel Detective Service Company and Pinkerton National Detective Agency for spies, increased the use of strikebreakers, and implemented the lockout and blacklist as a means of controlling union members. After a nighttime rifle and dynamite attack by striking miners on two mines during the Leadville Miners' Strike in 1896, which succeeded in burning down the surface works of one of the mines, even the pro-union county sheriff requested Gov. McIntire to send in the state militia, and the WFM lost the strike, and its influence in Leadville.Philpott, pp. 27, 90–3. The collapse of the 1896 Leadville strike caused the WFM to sever its relationship with the American Federation of Labor and to turn strongly to the left politically. After the Colorado Labor Wars, the WFM was instrumental in launching the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1905, but withdrew from the IWW a few years later. Although the IWW's heyday was short-lived, the union was symbolically important and the ideals embodied by it continue to deeply influence the American labor movement to this day.

It is one of the sources of jute fibre, considered to be of finer quality than fibre from Corchorus olitorius, the main source of jute. The leaves are used as a foodstuff and the leaves, unripe fruit and the roots are used in traditional medicine. Description Corchorus capsularis is an erect, annual shrub, with acute leaves, yellow five-petaled flowers and growing to two or more metres in height. It has globular fruits. It probably originated in China but is now grown in Bangladesh and India, and found spread across much of tropical Africa. It is also cultivated in the Amazon region of Brazil. Uses Fibre made from C. capsularis is whiter and of a higher quality than that made from 'C. olitorius'. The fibre is extracted from the cut stems by retting in water, removing the soft tissue, curing the fibre and drying it. It is used for making sacks, bags, carpets, curtains, fabrics and paper. C. olitorius and C. capsularis are the main sources of jute. The world production is concentrated in India and Bangladesh, where the crop grows well in the Ganges and Brahmaputra floodplains and delta region. The leaves and shoots of this plant are widely eaten in salads when young and are used as a cooked leafy vegetable when older. The leaves are dried and powdered to use as a thickener in soups or as a tea. The immature fruits are also eaten, raw or cooked. The plant is also used in herbal medicine. The leaves have been used to increase appetite, as an aid to digestion, as a laxative and as a stimulant. An infusion of the leaves has been used to reduce fever, and the roots and leaves have been used against dysentery. The seeds contain a digoxin-like substance and are poisonous to both animals and insects.

It is a part of the area covered by the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). Rajpur and Sonarpur are two separate towns. Since the formation of the municipality, these twin towns are known together as Rajpur Sonarpur. History Many janapadas grew up along the old Bhagirathi channel from the ancient times till around the 16th century: Kalighat, Boral, Rajpur, Harinavi, Mahinagar, Baruipur, Baharu, Jaynagar, Majilpur, Chhatrabhog etc. Bipradas Pipilai's Manasavijaya, composed in 1495, mentions many places in this region. \\"Chand Sadagar, a merchant character of the Manasavijaya, reached Baruipur, from Kalighat, through the old Bhagirathi channel. From there he proceeded towards Chhatrabhog, and then traveling through Hatiagarh pargana reached the open sea\\". Chaitanyadeva (1486–1534) also went through this route. Travelling by boat to Puri he halted at the village of Atisara, near Baruipur. \\"His last stoppage in 24 Parganas was at Chhatrabhog, now a village within the jurisdiction of the Mathurapur police station. Chhatrabhog seems to have been an important river-port on the old Bhagirathi channel\\". Rama Chandra Khan, the zamindar of Chhatrabhog, helped Chaitanyadeva to continue with his journey. The area was home to the feudatory landlords (zamindars). The name Rajpur has been thus derived from the Bengali words Rajar Puri to Rajpuri and in this form to the now Rajpur. Being on the banks of the Adi Ganga, Rajpur was one of the major locations of Bengal at that time. The proximity to Kolkata's southern district and being on the banks of Adi Ganga, which is just across the river made the place to be well connected. The old zamindar's house in Rajpur Harinavi is like the Roy Choudhury's. The family stayed in Rajpur. The ancestral houses of Sarat Chandra Bose and Subhash Chandra Bose were at Kodalia, a neighbourhood in Rajpur. Both of them were members of the first 24 Parganas District Committee of the Congress Party, which was formed in 1921.

Miguel Sánchez (1594–1674) was a Novohispanic priest, writer and theologian. He is most renowned as the author of the 1648 publication Imagen de la Virgen María, a description and theological interpretation of an apparition to Juan Diego of the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Guadalupe which is the first published narrative of the event. The precise nature of the cult before that date and whether the tradition as to the apparition dates back to 1531 (as Sánchez claims), constitute a vexed historical problem. The existence of a cult of the Virgin Mary at a chapel (or ermita) at Tepeyac, focussed on a painted cult image of the Virgin and enjoying a reputation for miraculous healing, was certainly established by 1556.This is the content of the complaint made by Francisco de Bustamante in a sermon delivered in Mexico City on 8 September 1556, an investigation into which was conducted by order of Archbishop Montúfar; see, e.g., Jacques Lafaye, \\"Quetzalcóatl and Guadalupe\\" (1974) Eng. trans. University of Chicago Press, 1976, pp.238-241. Lafaye dismisses the hypothesis that it was Sánchez who invented almost the whole tradition; see ibid., p.246. Professor Brading, a scholar of Mexican history, noted of Sánchez: \\"even if he did not initiate the devotion, he determined the manner in which the image was exalted and justified.\\", p.11 Sánchez was born in New Spain (today's Mexico) and studied at the Royal and Pontifical University in Mexico City. He sought teaching positions but did not get them. On various occasions he served as chaplain of the chapel of Our Lady of Los Remedios, and in 1662 he joined an archconfraternity of secular priests which was later constituted as the first Oratory of Saint Philip Neri in Mexico.For brief biographical notes, see: Stafford Poole, C.M., \\"Our Lady of Guadalupe\\", University of Arizona Press (1995), p.101; Brading, op.cit., p.73; His work makes use of the typology of Augustine of Hippo, although applying it not to events in the New Testament but rather to events alleged to have occurred the previous century in Mexico. He was buried at the sanctuary of the Virgin at Guadalupe, having been her lifelong devotee and the first of the \\"four evangelists\\" of the Guadalupan apparition.On the \\"four evangelists of Guadalupe\\" (viz., in addition to Sánchez, Lasso de la Vega, Becerra Tanco and Francisco de la Florencia), see Brading, op.cit., p.329.

Van Deren Coke described Brett Weston as the \\"child genius of American photography.\\" He was the second of the four sons of photographer Edward Weston and Flora Chandler. Weston began taking photographs in 1925, while living in Mexico with Tina Modotti and his father. He began showing his photographs with Edward Weston in 1927, was featured at the international exhibition at Film und Foto in Germany at age 17, and mounted his first one-man museum retrospective at age 21 at the De Young Museum in San Francisco in January, 1932. Weston's earliest images from the 1920s reflect his intuitive sophisticated sense of abstraction. He often flattened the plane, engaging in layered space, an artistic style more commonly seen among the Abstract Expressionists and more modern painters like David Hockney than other photographers. He began photographing the dunes at Oceano, California, in the early 1930s. This eventually became a favorite location of his father Edward and later shared with Brett's third wife Dody Weston Thompson. Brett preferred the high gloss papers and ensuing sharp clarity of the gelatin silver photographic materials of the f64 Group rather than the platinum matte photographic papers common in the 1920s and encouraged Edward Weston to explore the new silver papers in his own work. Brett Weston was credited by photography historian Beaumont Newhall as the first photographer to make negative space the subject of a photograph. \\"Brett and I are always seeing the same kinds of things to do - we have the same kind of vision. Brett didn't like this; naturally enough, he felt that even when he had done the thing first, the public would not know and he would be blamed for imitating me.\\" Edward Weston - Daybooks - May 24, 1930. Brett Weston used to refer to Edward Weston as \\"my biggest fan\\" and there was no rivalry between the two photographic giants. Brett and his wife Dody loyally set aside their own photography to help Edward after he was unable to print his own images due to Parkinson's disease, which claimed Edward's life in 1958. Weston married and divorced four times. He had one daughter, Erica Weston. Brett Weston lived part-time on the Big Island of Hawaii and in Carmel, California for the final 14 years of his life. He maintained a home in Waikoloa that was built by his brother Neil Weston, and later moved to Hawaii Paradise Park. He died in Kona Hospital on January 22, 1993 after suffering a stroke. Brett Weston was ranked one of the top ten photographers collected by American museums by the final decade of his life. His photographs are included in the collections of countless museums, including the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Oklahoma City Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and the Museum of Photographic Arts. In November 1996, Oklahoma City collector Christian Keesee acquired from the Brett Weston Estate the remaining body of Weston’s work. Publications * Brett Weston: Photographs. Merle Armitage, E.

No champion was declared; the series was cancelled after five games had been played due to an outbreak of Spanish flu. It was the only time in the history of the Stanley Cup that it was not awarded due to a no-decision after playoffs were held. The series was a rematch of the 1917 Stanley Cup Final and the first since the armistice to end World War I. Hosting the series in Seattle was the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) champion Seattle Metropolitans playing off against the National Hockey League (NHL) champion Montreal Canadiens. Both teams had won two games, lost two, and tied one before health officials were forced to cancel the deciding game of the series. Most of the Canadiens players and their manager George Kennedy fell ill with the flu and were hospitalized, leaving only three healthy players. The flu would claim the life of Canadiens defenceman Joe Hall four days later. Kennedy was permanently weakened by his illness, and it led to his death a few years later. Paths to the Finals The Canadiens won the first half of the 1918–19 NHL regular season while the Ottawa Senators won the second half, setting up a best-of-seven series between the two clubs to determine the NHL title. Montreal ended up winning the series, four games to one. Meanwhile, the Metropolitans finished the 1919 PCHA regular season in second place with an 11–9 record, behind the 12–8 Vancouver Millionaires. The two teams then faced off in a two-game total-goals championship series. Hours before the puck dropped for Game One, Metropolitans' leading scorer Bernie Morris was arrested by United States authorities for alleged draft dodging. Without Morris, Seattle won game one 6–1 after Frank Foyston notched a hat trick, essentially ending the aggregate goals series. Vancouver recorded a 4–1 victory in game two, but lost the series to the Metropolitans by a combined score of 7–5. Morris was ultimately sentenced to two years hard labor at the U.S. Military Prison - Alcatraz though his conviction was overturned after one-year when he was granted an Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Army and sent straight to Ottawa for the 1920 Stanley Cup Final. Game summaries All of the games were held at the Seattle Ice Arena. As with previous Stanley Cup series, the differing rules for the leagues alternated each game: PCHA rules were to be used in games one, three and five; and NHL rules were to be used in games two and four. The actual game five used NHL rules, as it was considered a replay of game four. Seattle dominated Montreal under PCHA rules, scoring two in the first, three in the second and a further two in the third. Corbeau of Montreal was injured but finished the game and continued to play in the series as a substitute. The Canadiens evened the series in game two with Newsy Lalonde scoring all of Montreal's goals. Montreal took the lead and never relinquished it, although Seattle scored two in the third in 32 seconds to make it close. Joe Hall took a puck to the nose, on a deliberate play by Cully Wilson, but the rough tactics did not continue as Seattle tried to catch up. Back under PCHA rules, the Metropolitans won game three, 7–2. Seattle scored four goals in the first to take a commanding lead. No goals were scored in the second. In the third, Seattle prevented any comeback, outscoring Montreal 3–2. Game four has been considered one of the greatest hockey games ever played, ending in a 0-0 tie after 20 minutes of overtime, with both Holmes and Montreal's Georges Vezina blocking every shot. At the end of the first period, the Mets' Cully Wilson scored a goal though Hall of Fame referee Mickey Ion waved it off, deciding it was scored just after he had blown the period's final whistle. Near the close of the second overtime, Berlinguette of Montreal had an outstanding chance to win it but missed by inches. Wilson of Seattle would mix it up with Berlinguette, who had to leave the ice. As players lay collapsed across the ice, the crowd gave both teams an ovation after the game in appreciation of the teams' play. Between games four and five, discussions were made about which rules to use for game five. As game four had finished in a tie, the Canadiens wanted game five to be a replay of game four, using NHL rules, and Seattle wanted PCHA rules. The game was played under NHL rules, and it was agreed that in the future, teams would play overtime until a winning goal was scored. Montreal trailed in the game 3–0 after two periods, but Seattle had tired, and Montreal scored three to force overtime. Lalonde had the Canadiens' second and third goals. In the extra period, Montreal's substitute Jack McDonald sprinted on the ice and tallied the game-winning goal in dramatic fashion after the Mets were down a player when Frank Foyston was injured, Jack Walker broke a skate and Cully Wilson collapsed from exhaustion, leading the Canadiens to a 4–3 victory. The Metropolitans had only one substitute player, and the team was exhausted. On the last play, Cully Wilson went to the bench to be replaced by Frank Foyston. Foyston had scored nine of Seattle's 19 goals in the series, but by that point, he was unable to move and replace Wilson, leaving the team shorthanded while McDonald scored. Some players went to the hospital after the game, while others had to be carried home.Bowlsby, Craig. \\"When Seattle was Hockeytown USA\\" . seattletimes.com. March 7, 2013. Retrieved February 24, 2014.\\"Stanley Cup Playoffs\\". nhl.com. Retrieved February 24, 2014. Cancellation Announcement of Cancellation in The Globe The sixth and deciding game of the series was scheduled for April 1, but an outbreak of influenza caused several players on both teams to become seriously ill. With Lalonde, Hall, Coutu, Berlinguette, and McDonald of Montreal hospitalized or sick in bed, with fevers between 101 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit, game six was cancelled just five and a half hours before it was scheduled to start. Kennedy said he was forfeiting the Cup to Seattle, but Pete Muldoon, manager-coach of the Metropolitans, refused to accept the Cup in a forfeiture, seeing that it was catastrophic illness that had caused the Canadiens lineup to be short of players. Kennedy asked to use players from the Victoria team of the PCHA, but president Frank Patrick refused the request. Montreal player Joe Hall eventually succumbed to pneumonia. Four days later, Joe Hall died of pneumonia brought about by the flu. His funeral was held in Vancouver on April 8, with most team members attending, and he was buried in Brandon, Manitoba. Manager George Kennedy also was stricken. His condition declined, and his wife arrived from Montreal to be with him. He seemed to recover and was released from the hospital, but he never fully recovered and he died a few years later. Stanley Cup engraving No official Stanley Cup winner was declared in 1919, and thus nothing was engraved onto the trophy.

It explores the witness of the Old Testament in relation to the Divinity of Jesus.Adversus Judaeous by Arthur Lukyn Williams Discussion Two The second dialogue concerns the fall of the Jewish polity and the rise of Christianity, as well as the implications of the Cross in the Old Testament, especially in the case of the bronze serpent in the Book of Numbers.Adversus Judaeous by Arthur Lukyn Williams Discussion Three The third dialogue defends concerns the worship of images and idols, and the label of \\"Christian\\".Adversus Judaeous by Arthur Lukyn Williams Discussion Four The fourth dialogue discusses the date of Jesus' coming as specified in the Book of Daniel. Contained as well is a list of Persian, Egyptian, and Greek rulers to reinforce the chronology in the Book of Daniel.Adversus Judaeous by Arthur Lukyn Williams Transition In between the above dialogues and the Bonwetsch Dialogue is a heresiological overview from Arianism to Miaphysitism. Towards the end, the author claims that Nestorianism and the followers of Severus were the two greatest evils of the Church.

He described his time as when Christians were taken prisoner, fifty years after the beginning of an unspecified great war, and fifty so years after Mohammedans had first attacked Palestine. His theory of the redemption of Jesus is similar to that of Anselm, as revealed in the dialogues.

Historically, a subdivision of the larger Hazaribag district, Ramgarh was finally elevated to a district status on 12 September 2007 largely to ease administrative hardships. The district comprises five blocks namely Ramgarh,Patratu and Dulmi. A town with a population just short of a million, Ramgarh houses the regimental centers for two of the oldest infantry regiments of India, namely the Punjab Regiment estd. 1761 and the Sikh Regiment estd. 1846. Amongst the most decorated regiments of the erstwhile Raj, the jawans of these two regiments have showcased their valour in several battles including the Afghan wars, the battle of Tofrek, the battle of Abyssynia, the first and the second World Wars and various other post-independence battles. Ramgarh Cantonment is a Category-I (population exceeding 50,000) cantonment. The cantonment board functions as a civic administration body and is obliged to take care of mandatory duties like provision of public health, water supply, sanitation, primary education, street lighting etc. Thus the scope of the board function extends to the entire gamut of municipal administration.

Davies is perhaps best known for his so-called \\"J curve\\" theory of political revolutions, which seeks to explain the rise of revolutionary movements in terms of rising individual expectations and falling levels of perceived well-being. Davies asserts that revolutions are a subjective response to a sudden reversal in fortunes after a long period of economic growth. The theory is often applied to explain social unrest and efforts by governments to contain this unrest. This is referred to as the Davies' J-Curve, because economic development followed by a depression would be modeled as an upside down and slightly skewed J. Quote \\"Revolutions are most likely to occur when a prolonged period of objective economic and social development is followed by a short period of sharp reversal. People then subjectively fear that ground gained with great effort will be quite lost; their mood becomes revolutionary. The evidence from the Dorr Rebellion, the Russian Revolution, and the Egyptian Revolution supports this notion; tentatively, so do data on other civil disturbances. Various statistics—as on rural uprisings, industrial strikes, unemployment, and cost of living—may serve as crude indexes of popular mood. More useful, though less easy to obtain, are direct questions in cross-sectional interviews. The goal of predicting revolution is conceived but not yet born or matured.\\" (From J. C.

You may go to the bathroom and urinate. Is that what you need to do? Urinate?\\") Arriving at the lavatory, he peeks around the corner, and sees a tiger lying on the bathroom floor. He stands at the door, too afraid to enter. Eventually a child named Kenny Griffen comes to get him. Charles begins to cry and Kenny leads him in, saying that he made up the tiger. Charles escapes out of the bathroom, and when he forces himself to go back in, he sees the tiger has a torn piece of Kenny's shirt on its claw. Charles decides to relieve himself in the sink, but Miss Bird catches him. She goes around the corner to find Kenny, and Charles leaves the bathroom.

This special health board runs a telephone advice and triage service that covers the out-of-hours period (Mondays to Fridays between 6pm and 8am, public holidays and all weekend). The telephone service allows people who feel unwell or those caring for them to obtain health advice and information if it is not convenient or possible to wait until they can visit their general practitioner when the practice is next open. The advice line is not intended as a substitute for obtaining an emergency ambulance service via 999. The telehealth services provided by NHS Scotland fulfil some similar functions to NHS Direct Wales and the NHS 111 scheme in England. Using NHS 24 The service can be used in more than one way: Self-Help Guide (Internet) This enables advice to be obtained without a consultation by answering a series of questions after accessing the main http://www.nhs24.scot/ web page and selecting the NHS Self-help guide option. Users will be given one of three final results : * Self-Care, if it is safe to manage the problem at home * Call NHS 24, if it is necessary to speak to a member of NHS 24 staff for further advice * Dial 999, if the problem requires the use of an ambulance service Since 2005 the NHS 24 Internet service has included access to information from a NHS Health Encyclopaedia, giving information on illnesses, conditions, tests and treatment and to pharmacy opening times throughout Scotland. Some information that is made available via this internet service is used under licence from the UK Department of Health. All health information is from governed sources. To reflect the healthcare needs of the Scottish population NHS 24 work with individuals, groups and organisations from different areas of health and social care policy and practice in Scotland. Telephone 111 is the current, normal telephone number for most callers who are able to use a telephone without difficulty. This number is free to call from mobile phones as well as landlines, and was adopted across Scotland in April 2014 to replace the old number, 08454 24 24 24 which has been phased out. A translation service is provided for a number of languages for which leaflets are issued which instruct callers to tell the NHS 24 staff : :\\"I am [nationality described in English], I do not speak English.\\" 18001 08454 24 24 24 :This number is used for callers who have to use a Textphone. Trained call handlers triage patients according to outcomes to a set of questions. If the service is busy, lower-priority calls will be placed in a clinical queue which is monitored. Depending on the triage outcome, callers will be called back within one, two or three hours. Callers are always told to call back if their condition worsens. During particularly busy times, callers are always told in a recorded message how long they will expect to wait before their call is answered. At the end of the consultation, NHS 24 will contact the Scottish Ambulance Service if an emergency response is necessary. Instructions for use of the service by people who do not speak English are available on the website or in paper form by calling 0141 435 3901. History Following the establishment of NHS Direct in England, Susan Deacon Minister for Health and Community Care announced in December 2000 that a 24-hour helpline service would be set up for Scotland. NHS 24 was established as a Special Health Board on 6 April 2001 under the NHS 24 (Scotland) Order 2001, although the overall aims for Health Boards are defined by the NHS (Scotland) Act 1978 and subsequent legislation. Management consultancy work that took place over an eight week period drew some comment. The telephone helpline service launched in May 2002, with the first contact centre in Aberdeen providing advice to callers from the Grampian area using around 85 nurses and 40 other staff. The service was then rolled out to other areas in the North of Scotland. By August 2002 there were three contact centres operational- in Aberdeen, Clydebank and South Queensferry. By February 2004 the service had more than 800 staff, providing a service for people in the Ayrshire and Arran, Fife, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Highland boards- effectively coverage of half the population of Scotland. Within two years of being set up it had taken one million calls. At peak times, calls may be answered in any one of these centres. NHS 24 also acts as the first point of contact for primary care advice in the out-of-hours period. The 2004 Scottish GP contract contained a right for GPs to opt-out of out-of-hours working. By 2006, 80% of Scottish GP practices had exercised this right. From Autumn 2004 patients calling NHS 24 began to experience delays. The algorithms used by the NHS24 call handlers in 2004 were purchased under licence from an American company but these weren’t divulged to other clinicians working in the health service due to clauses in the commercial agreement. Having endured some chronic staffing problems, the service was having difficulty coping with demand by July 2005. By January 2009, sickness absence had reduced and there was a low waiting time for call pick-ups except for during spikes of demand, however the organisation had now appointed its fourth chief executive in just five years. In August 2010, a health information website NHS Inform was lanched, bringing together national and local health information. The first phase was officially opened by Nicola Sturgeon, Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing. The website later made use of a BrowseAloud feature - allowing users to listen to information where they preferred or need this. There were almost 1.5 million calls a year being received by 2012/2013. In January 2013 plans were announces to make the service free to use, and accessible via a three digit number, instead of the eleven digit number. In May 2014, the 111 number went live in Scotland. In September 2011, Capgemini were announced as the preferred bidder for a customer relations management system, replacing the previous supplier Clinical Solutions. A contract was signed in April 2012 , and the new call handing and IT computer system, called the Future Programme was expected in 2013, but experienced significant delays. With a current cost of £117million, the new system crashed on 28 October 2015 shortly after it was launched. It was shut down on 13 November to allow the problems to be resolved,, but by the following year it was thought that the new system might not be relaunched until 2017. Organisation A management board has responsibility for the running of the organisation.

Plot summary  Told from the viewpoint of a bandleader during Prohibition, the story centers around a small-time racketeer, Mike Scollay, who hires the narrator's jazz band to play at the wedding of his 300-pound sister, Maureen, and her 90-pound fiancé. At the gig, Scollay's enemy, the Greek, blackmails a man to come to the wedding reception and insult Maureen in front of the guests. Shortly after, Mike is shot down in a hail of gunfire from the Greek's men. The band leader is approached a short time later in a bar by Maureen, who is despondent and depressed, feeling that she caused her brother's death and is filled with self-loathing over her weight and the way she is aware other people perceiving her. After requesting a song, she leaves, and the narrator never sees her again, but he, like everyone else in the country, follows her story from that point on. Maureen Scollay takes over her brother's racket, with her husband as her lieutenant, and carves out a criminal empire that ironically far eclipses the operations of both her brother and the Greek, whom she soon hunts down and takes a gruesome revenge on. Eventually, she dies of a heart attack and her husband, who does not share her leadership abilities, is later sent to prison. The narrator sadly reflects on the cruel rumors that she had ballooned up even further in weight by that point, something he considers to just be malicious rumors.

History View of Ramtek city Ramtek has got the historic temple of Rama. It is believed that Ramtek was the place where Rama, the Hindu god, rested while he was in exile. According to Hindu history the ashram of the Hindu sage Agastya was situated close to Ramtek. While the sages performed religious rites, the demons used to disrupt their activities and slayed holy men. Rama was distressed to hear about this, and took a vow to relieve the world from the demons. The present temple was built by Raghuji Bhonsale, the Maratha ruler of Nagpur in 18th century after his victory over fort of Deogarh in Chindwara. This place is also related to the Sanskrit poet Kalidasa. It is believed that Kalidasa wrote Meghadūta in the hills of Ramtek.

With his inspiration, a big Jain temple has been constructed. Jain disciples report many miracles attributed to the ancient Jain statue and so the place is more popularly called as Atishayakshetra Ramtek ji by them.

The band was founded by and consisted only of singer- songwriter/guitarist Rebecca Gates and drummer Scott Plouf. They released three albums on the Sub Pop label before Gates retired the name in 1999 and began releasing music as a solo artist; Plouf began playing with Built to Spill in 1996 and left The Spinanes shortly thereafter to become their permanent drummer. The duo formed in Portland, Oregon, in 1991, just as worldwide interest in the music scene of the Pacific Northwest was beginning to crest. After releasing two singles on the local label IMP Records in 1992, they were signed by Sub Pop, who issued the single \\"Spitfire\\" in mid-1993, followed that October by their first full-length album, Manos. Much was made of The Spinanes' unorthodox lineup - specifically, the lack of bass guitar - but it proved invaluable in helping them forge a more singular, original sound. In a March 2010 review, nearly two decades after the album's release, eMusic praised them for having \\"a sense of negative space that's rare for a rock band\\", then went on to describe their sound as \\"Gates's dreamy murmur and resonant, open-tuned riffs up top, Plouf's inexorable attack at the bottom, and nothing but air between them.\\" Manos became the first album released by an independent label to hit No. 1 on the college radio charts; its second single, \\"Noel, Jonah and Me\\", received considerable airplay on college and alternative radio stations and video outlets such as MTV's 120 Minutes. A video was also made for a third single, \\"Sunday\\", in 1994, but the duo's appearances over the following two years were largely limited to separate guest spots on their friends' records. Gates provided backup vocals on Elliott Smith's \\"St. Ides Heaven\\" (from his self-titled album), as well as on multiple tracks on Ben Lee's first album, Grandpaw Would. Plouf did a brief stint in Team Dresch, and appeared on their first single, \\"Hand Grenade\\"; he also played on the Beck album One Foot in the Grave. The Spinanes regrouped in 1996 for the release of their second album, Strand, which was bookended by the singles \\"Madding\\" and \\"Lines and Lines\\". Elliott Smith, in turn, provides backup vocals, as does John Moen (of Dharma Bums and The Decemberists). Around the same time, Plouf began playing with Built to Spill, but due to that band's signing with Warner Bros. Records, he was unable to continue with both bands full-time, and in 1997, he made the decision to leave The Spinanes. Gates then relocated to Chicago, Illinois, reconfigured The Spinanes as a three-piece with bassist Joanna Bolme and drummer Jerry Busher, and began work on another album at Easley McCain Recording in Memphis, Tennessee. Additional tracks were recorded with John McEntire (of Tortoise and The Sea and Cake) at his Soma Electronic Music Studios, one of which features vocalist Sam Prekop (also of The Sea and Cake). The resulting album, Arches and Aisles, was released in June 1998. An album consisting of early Spinanes singles, Imp Years, came out in 2000.

He has served as the defensive skills, ruck and forwards coach at the Brisbane Lions since September 2014. He was also the ruck coach for Collingwood after being selected as a mature age rookie player in the 2012 rookie draft. Early life Hudson was born in Victoria, but moved to Queensland at 8 years oldQUEENSLANDERS IN THE NATIONAL COMPETITION 1987-2004 where he grew up in Palm Beach, a suburb of the Gold Coast.Ben Hudson He first played junior football for Palm Beach CurrumbinAFL Queensland - Ben Hudson before focusing on basketball while he attended Somerset College on the Gold Coast throughout his teenage years.LinkedIn - Ben Hudson Hudson played basketball until 2000, when he began driving to Brisbane to study Physiotherapy at the University of Queensland, living at Union College, where he played for the University of Queensland Australian Football Club at 21 years of age as a ruckman. His coach later recommended that he play for Mount Gravatt Football Club where he played under coach Danny Craven. At Mount Gravatt, he won a best and fairest in 2001, before taking part in the club's 2002 premiership side. That year he represented Queensland against Western Australia. He later returned to Victoria, where he tried out with the Werribee Football Club, where at the relatively late age of 24, Adelaide Football Club talent scouts recognized his skills and lured him to the AFL at pick number 58 in the 2003 AFL Draft. AFL career Adelaide As a mobile ruckman, Hudson enjoyed a successful debut before seriously injuring the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during a fall on the eve of the 2005 finals series. He required a full knee reconstruction, which resulted in the return of veteran ruckman Matthew Clarke back from the brink of retirement. Hudson recovered well from the injury to play in the SANFL late in 2006. He returned to the Crows in 2007 and performed well throughout the year, playing 22 games, garnering 366 hit-outs and finishing second overall in the AFL for hardball gets. During the year he was suspended for one week by the club for breaking the team curfew. He was also allegedly upset by criticism from Adelaide coach Neil Craig. On 19 September 2007 Hudson asked to be traded to the Western Bulldogs, after contract negotiations with Adelaide broke down. Western Bulldogs Hudson officially joined the Western Bulldogs on a three-year contract on 12 October 2007, after the Adelaide Football Club's hand was forced into a trade. Hudson has fitted in well at his new club and his superb performance against ladder leaders Hawthorn led coach Alastair Clarkson to name him the trade of the year. Hudson was elected into the Western Bulldogs Leadership Group by the players for the 2009 Season, joining Captain Brad Johnson, Daniel Giansiracusa, Robert Murphy, Daniel Cross, Matthew Boyd, Dale Morris and Shaun Higgins. In the Round 11 match against St. Kilda, Hudson was charged with a Level Two striking offence against Leigh Montagna during the second quarter, because the action was considered to be of intentional conduct (three points), low impact (one point) and body contact (one point). A Level Two offence draws 125 demerit points and a one-match sanction. However, because Hudson had no existing good or bad record, an early plea could reduce the penalty by 25 percent to a reprimand and 93.75 points towards his future record, which he accepted. Brisbane Lions On 24 August 2011 Ben Hudson announced that he was to retire from football at the end of the season and move to Queensland, however an offer from the Brisbane Lions talked him out of retirement, and the Bulldogs traded him to the Lions for Pick #70 in the AFL National Draft. Collingwood Hudson announced his intentions to again come out of retirement and started training with Collingwood on 27 November in hopes of them drafting him as a mature aged rookie. On 11 December, Collingwood drafted him in the 2013 Rookie Draft. Hudson played his first game for Collingwood on 14 April, against Hawthorn. Collingwood also used Hudson as the club's ruck coach during his two years. In 2014 Hudson retired from playing football. Return to Brisbane Lions After retiring from playing football and following his work as a ruck coach with Collingwood, Hudson returned to Brisbane Lions when he was announced forward, defensive skills and ruck coach for 2015 on 18 September 2014. He has maintained this coaching role in 2016.

It is clear there was a great deal of painting, and sculpture in wood and ivory, during these periods, but there are only a few survivals. The main Indian religions had all, after hesitant starts, developed the use of religious sculpture by around the start of the Common Era, and the use of stone was becoming increasingly widespread. The first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the Indus Valley civilization, and a more widespread tradition of small terracotta figures, mostly either of women or animals, which predates it.Blurton, 22 After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of larger sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) c. 1500 BCE from Daimabad.Harle, 17–20 Thus the great tradition of Indian monumental sculpture in stone appears to begin relatively late, with the reign of Asoka from 270 to 232 BCE, and the Pillars of Ashoka he erected around India, carrying his edicts and topped by famous sculptures of animals, mostly lions, of which six survive.Harle, 22–24 Large amounts of figurative sculpture, mostly in relief, survive from Early Buddhist pilgrimage stupas, above all Sanchi; these probably developed out of a tradition using wood that also embraced Hinduism.Harle, 26–38 During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern India, in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara from what is now southern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha’s life and teachings. The pink sandstone Hindu, Jain and Buddhist sculptures of Mathura from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture. The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the Gupta Empire (c. 320-550) which remains a \\"classical\\" period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier Ellora Caves,Harle, 87; his Part 2 covers the period though the Elephanta Caves are probably slightly later.Harle, 124 Later large scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and yakshi often have sensuously curving poses. Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief. The celebrated bronzes of the Chola dynasty (c. 850–1250) from south India, many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of Shiva as Nataraja,Harle, 301-310, 325-327 with the massive granite carvings of Mahabalipuram dating from the previous Pallava dynasty.Harle, 276–284 Bronze age sculpture The Pashupati seal, showing a seated figure, surrounded by animals The first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the Indus Valley civilization (3300–1700 BC). These include the famous small bronze dancing girl. However such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted.

Some very early depictions of deities seem to appear in the art of the Indus Valley Civilisation (3300 BCE - 1700 BCE), but the following millennium, coinciding with the Vedic period, is devoid of such remains. It has been suggested that the early Vedic religion focused exclusively on the worship of purely \\"elementary forces of nature by means of elaborate sacrifices\\", which did not lend themselves easily to anthropomorphological representations. Terracotta figurine, Mathura, 4th century BCE Various artefacts may belong to the Copper Hoard Culture (2nd millennium CE), some of them suggesting anthropomorphological characteristics. Interpretations vary as to the exact signification of these artifacts, or even the culture and the periodization to which they belonged. Some examples of artistic expression also appear in abstract pottery designs during the Black and red ware culture (1450-1200 BCE) or the Painted Grey Ware culture (1200-600 BCE), with finds in a wide area. Most of the early finds following this period correspond to what is called the \\"second period of urbanization\\" in the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, after a gap a about a thousand years following the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization. The anthropomorphic depiction of various deities apparently started in the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, possibly as a consequence of the influx of foreign stimuli initiated with the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley, and the rise of alternative local faiths challenging Vedism, such as Buddhism and Jainism and local popular cults. Some rudimentary terracotta artifacts may date to this period, just before the Mauryan era. Art of the Mauryan period The Lion Capital of Asoka, National Emblem of India, the most famous example of Mauryan art. The surviving art of the Mauryan Empire which ruled, at least in theory, over most of the Indian subcontinent between 322 and 185 BCE is mostly sculpture. There was an imperial court-sponsored art patronized by the emperors, especially Ashoka, and then a \\"popular\\" style produced by all others. The most significant remains of monumental Mauryan art include the remains of the royal palace and the city of Pataliputra, a monolithic rail at Sarnath, the Bodhimandala or the altar resting on four pillars at Bodhgaya, the rock-cut chaitya-halls in the Barabar Caves near Gaya, the non-edict bearing and edict bearing pillars, the animal sculptures crowning the pillars with animal and botanical reliefs decorating the abaci of the capitals and the front half of the representation of an elephant carved out in the round from a live rock at Dhauli.Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). Ancient India, New Delhi: S.Chand, New Delhi, , p.348 This period marked the appearance of Indian stone sculpture; much previous sculpture was probably in wood and has not survived. The elaborately carved animal capitals surviving on from some Pillars of Ashoka are the best known works, and among the finest, above all the Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath that is now the National Emblem of India. Coomaraswamy distinguishes between court art and a more popular art during the Mauryan period. Court art is represented by the pillars and their capitals,Thapar, Romila (2001). and the Decline of the Mauryas, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, , pp.267-70 and surviving popular art by some stone pieces, and many smaller works in terracotta. The highly polished surface of court sculpture is often called Mauryan polish. However this seems not to be entirely reliable as a diagnostic tool for a Mauryan date, as some works from considerably later periods also have it. The Didarganj Yakshi, now most often thought to be from the 2nd century CE, is an example.

The \\"mysteriousness\\" of this \\"lies in the total absence so far of any object in an even remotely similar manner within many hundreds of miles, and indeed anywhere in South India\\".Harle, 271 It is some 5 ft in height and one foot thick; the penis is relatively naturalistic, with the glans shown clearly. The stone is local, and the style described by Harle as \\"Satavahana-related\\". It is dated to the 3rd century BCE, or 2nd/1st century BCE. Though the hardness of local granites, the relatively limited penetration of Buddhism and Jainism in the deep south, and a presumed persistent preference for wood have all been proposed as factors in the late development of stone architecture and sculpture in the south, \\"the mystery remains\\".Harle, 271-272, 272 quoted The form of the Gudimallam linga, for example, would be a natural one to evolve in wood, using a straight tree trunk very efficiently, but to say that it did so is pure speculation in our present state of knowledge. Wooden sculpture, and architecture, has remained common in Kerala, where stone is hard to come by, but this means survivals are very largely limited to the last few centuries.Harle, 342-350; Blurton, 225  Kushana art  Kushan art is highlighted by the appearance of extensive Buddhist arts in the form of Mathuras, Gandharan and Amaravathi schools of art  Mathura art  Mathura art flourished in the ancient city of Mathura and predominantly red sandstone has been used in making Buddhist and Jain sculptures.

Greco-Buddhist art is the artistic manifestation of Greco-Buddhism, a cultural syncretism between the Classical Greek culture and Buddhism, which developed over a period of close to 1000 years in Central Asia, between the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE, and the Islamic conquests of the 7th century CE. Greco- Buddhist art is characterized by the strong idealistic realism of Hellenistic art and the first representations of the Buddha in human form, which have helped define the artistic (and particularly, sculptural) canon for Buddhist art throughout the Asian continent up to the present. Though dating is uncertain, it appears that strongly Hellenistic styles lingered in the East for several centuries after they had declined around the Mediterranean, as late as the 5th century CE. Some aspects of Greek art were adopted while others did not spread beyond the Greco-Buddhist area; in particular the standing figure, often with a relaxed pose and one leg flexed, and the flying cupids or victories, who became popular across Asia as apsaras. Greek foliage decoration was also influential, with Indian versions of the Corinthian capital appearing.Boardman, 370–378; Harle, 71–84 Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because Gandharan Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays Greek and Persian artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc. The origins of Greco-Buddhist art are to be found in the Hellenistic Greco- Bactrian kingdom (250 BCE – 130 BCE), located in today’s Afghanistan, from which Hellenistic culture radiated into the Indian subcontinent with the establishment of the small Indo-Greek kingdom (180 BCE-10 BCE). Under the Indo-Greeks and then the Kushans, the interaction of Greek and Buddhist culture flourished in the area of Gandhara, in today’s northern Pakistan, before spreading further into India, influencing the art of Mathura, and then the Hindu art of the Gupta empire, which was to extend to the rest of South- East Asia. The influence of Greco-Buddhist art also spread northward towards Central Asia, strongly affecting the art of the Tarim Basin and the Dunhuang Caves, and ultimately the sculpted figure in China, Korea, and Japan.Boardman, 370–378; Sickman, 85–90; Paine, 29–30 File:GandharaDonorFrieze2.JPGGandhara frieze with devotees, holding plantain leaves, in purely Hellenistic style, inside Corinthian columns, 1st–2nd century CE.

The Gupta period is generally regarded as a classic peak and golden age of North Indian art for all the major religious groups.Rowland's chapter 15 is called \\"The Golden Age: The Gupta Period; Harle, 88 Although painting was evidently widespread, the surviving works are almost all religious sculpture. The period saw the emergence of the iconic carved stone deity in Hindu art, while the production of the Buddha-figure and Jain tirthankara figures continued to expand, the latter often on a very large scale. The traditional main centre of sculpture was Mathura, which continued to flourish, with the art of Gandhara, the centre of Greco-Buddhist art just beyond the northern border of Gupta territory, continuing to exert influence. Other centres emerged during the period, especially at Sarnath. Both Mathura and Sarnath exported sculpture to other parts of northern India. It is customary to include under \\"Gupta art\\" works from areas in north and central India that were not actually under Gupta control, in particular art produced under the Vakataka dynasty who ruled the Deccan c. 250–500.Harle, 118 Their region contained very important sites such as the Ajanta Caves and Elephanta Caves, both mostly created in this period, and the Ellora Caves which were probably begun then. Also, although the empire lost its western territories by about 500, the artistic style continued to be used across most of northern India until about 550,Harle, 89 and arguably around 650.Rowland, 215 It was then followed by the \\"Post-Gupta\\" period, with (to a reducing extent over time) many similar characteristics; Harle ends this around 950.Harle, 199 Three main schools of Gupta sculpture are often recognised, based in Mathura, Varanasi/Sarnath and to a lesser extent Nalanda.Mookerji, 1, 143 The distinctively different stones used for sculptures exported from the main centres described below aids identification greatly.Harle, 89; Rowland, 216; Mookerji, 143 Elephanta Caves, triple-bust (trimurti) of Shiva, tall, c. 550. Both Buddhist and Hindu sculpture concentrate on large, often near life-size, figures of the major deities, respectively Buddha, Vishnu and Shiva. The dynasty had a partiality to Vishnu, who now features more prominently, where the Kushan imperial family generally had preferred Shiva. Minor figures such as yakshi, which had been very prominent in preceding periods, are now smaller and less frequently represented, and the crowded scenes illustrating Jataka tales of the Buddha's previous lives are rare.Harle, 87–88 When scenes include one of the major figures and other less important ones, there is a great difference in scale, with the major figures many times larger. This is also the case in representations of incidents from the Buddha's life, which earlier had showed all the figures on the same scale.Rowland, 234 The lingam was the central murti in most temples. Some new figures appear, including personifications of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, not yet worshipped, but placed on either side of entrances; these were \\"the two great rivers encompassing the Gupta heartland\\".Harle, 87–88, 88 quoted The main bodhisattva appear prominently in sculpture for the first time,Rowland, 235 as in the paintings at Ajanta. Buddhist, Hindu and Jain sculpture all show the same style,Rowland, 232 and there is a \\"growing likeness of form\\" between figures from the different religions, which continued after the Gupta period. The Indian stylistic tradition of representing the body as a series of \\"smooth, very simplified planes\\" is continued, though poses, especially in the many standing figures, are subtly tilted and varied, in contrast to the \\"columnar rigidity\\" of earlier figures.Rowland, 233 The detail of facial parts, hair, headgear, jewellery and the haloes behind figures are carved very precisely, giving a pleasing contrast with the emphasis on broad swelling masses in the body.Rowland, 230–233, 232 and 233 quoted Deities of all the religions are shown in a calm and majestic meditative style; \\"perhaps it is this all- pervading inwardness that accounts for the unequalled Gupta and post-Gupta ability to communicate higher spiritual states\\".

During this time, the style of sculpture changed from \\"Post- Gupta\\" to a distinctive style that was widely influential in other areas and later centuries. Deity figures became more rigid in posture, very often standing with straight legs close together, and figures were often heavily loaded with jewellery; they very often have multiple arms, a convention allowing them to hold many attributes and display mudras. The typical form for temple images is a slab with a main figure, rather over half life-size, in very high relief, surrounded by smaller attendant figures, who might have freer tribhanga poses. Critics have found the style tending towards over- elaboration. The quality of the carving is generally very high, with crisp, precise detail. In east India, facial features tend to become sharp.Harle, 212-216; Craven, 170, 172-176; Huntington, generally, and p. 29 on freer attendants. Though the Pala monarchs are recorded as patronizing religious establishments in a general sense, their patronage of any specific work of art cannot be documented by the surviving evidence, which is mostly inscriptions.Huntington, 31 note 27 (the situation is little different for Gupta monarchs). However, there are much larger numbers of images that are dated, as compared to other Indian regions and periods, helping greatly the reconstruction of stylistic development.Huntington, 37, and Chapter 3 generally Much larger numbers of smaller bronze groups of similar composition have survived than from previous periods. Probably the numbers produced were increasing. These were mostly made for domestic shrines of the well-off, and from monasteries. Gradually, Hindu figures come to outnumber Buddhist ones, reflecting the terminal decline of Indian Buddhism, even in east India, its last stronghold.Harle, 212; Craven, 176  Temples of Khajuraho  temples of Khajuraho. The temples of Khajuraho, a complex of Hindu and Jain temples, were constructed from the 9th to the 11th centuries by the Chandela dynasty. They are considered one of the best examples of Indian art and architecture. The temples have a rich display of intricately carved sculptures. While they are famous for their erotic sculptures, sexual themes cover less than a tenth of the temple sculpture. The sculptures depict various aspects the everyday life, mythical stories as well as symbolic display of various secular and spiritual values important in Hindu tradition.  Dynasties of South India  After the Gudimallam lingam (see above), the earliest dynasty of southern India to leave stone sculpture on a large scale was the long-lasting Pallava dynasty which ruled much of south-east India between 275 and 897, although the major sculptural projects come from the later part of the period. A number of significant Hindu temples survive, with rich sculptural decoration. Initially these tend to be rock-cut, as are most of the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram (7th and 8th centuries), perhaps the best-known examples of Pallava art and architecture Many of these exploit natural outcrops of rock, which are carved away on all sides until a building is left. Others, like the Shore Temple, are constructed in the usual way, and others cut into a rock face like most other rock-cut architecture. The Descent of the Ganges at Mahabalipuram, is \\"the largest and most elaborate sculptural composition in India\\",Harle, 272 a relief carved on a near-vertical rock face some 29 metres (86 feet) wide, featuring hundreds of figures, including a life-size elephant (late 7th century). Other Pallava temples with sculpture surviving in good condition are the Kailasanathar Temple, Vaikunta Perumal Temple and others at Kanchipuram,Michell, 434-437 and the cave temples at Mamandur. The Pallava style in stone reliefs is influenced by the hardness of the stone mostly used; the relief is less deep and detail such as jewellery minimized, compared to further north. The figures are more slender and \\"delicately built and project sweetness and unmannered delicacy and refinement\\";Harle, 277-278 much the same figure type is continued in Chola sculpture in both stone and bronze. In large narrative panels some of the subjects are distinctively Tamil, such as Korravai (Durga as goddess of victory), and Somaskanda, a seated family group of Shiva, his consort Parvati and Skanda (Murugan) as a child.Harle, 276-277 Gopuram of the Kapaleeshwarar Temple, Tamil Nadu, densely packed with rows of painted sculptures Shiva as Nataraja, Chola period. The \\"imperial\\" Chola dynasty begins about 850, controlling much of the south, with a slow decline from about 1150. Large numbers of temples were constructed, which mostly suffered far less from Muslim destruction than those further north. These were heavily decorated with stone relief sculpture, both large narrative panels and single figures, mostly in niches on the outside. The Pallava style was broadly continued. Chola bronzes, the largest mostly about half life-size, are some of the most iconic and famous sculptures of India, using a similar elegant but powerful style to the stone pieces. They were created using the lost wax technique. The sculptures were of Shiva in various avatars with his consort Parvati, and Vishnu with his consort Lakshmi, among other deities. Even large bronzes had the advantage that they were light enough to be used in processions for festivals. The most iconic among these is the bronze figure of Shiva as Nataraja, the lord of dance. In his upper right hand he holds the damaru, the drum of creation. In his upper left hand he holds the agni, the flame of destruction. His lower right hand is lifted in the gesture of the abhaya mudra. His right foot stands upon the demon Apasmara, the embodiment of ignorance. The Vijayanagara Empire was the last major Hindu empire, constructing very large temples at Hampi, the capital, of which much remains in generally good condition, despite the Mughal army spending a year destroying the city after its fall.Rowland, 317 Temples are often highly decorated, in a style that further elaborates the late Chola style, and was influential for later South Indian temples. Rows of horses rearing out from columns became a favourite and spectacular device. By the end of the period hugely expanded multi-storey gopurams had become the most prominent feature of templeas, as they have remained in the major temples of the south. The large numbers of figures on these were now mostly made from brightly-painted stucco.  Early Modern period (1206-1858)  The period was dominated by Islamic rulers, who not only did not produce figurative sculpture themselves, but whose armies, especially in the initial conquests, destroyed vast amounts of existing religious sculpture, which considerably discouraged the production of new figures. Nonetheless, religious sculpture continued, especially in the far south, where the larger temples continued to expand in a rather competitive fashion. The late medieval southern innovation of towering gopuram gateways continued, and these were covered with large sculptures, in recent centuries mainly in brightly painted stucco. Very large halls were constructed for the large numbers of visitors in temples, sometimes filled with spectacular sculpture, like the famous row of life-size rearing horses at the Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam from the 17th century.  British Colonial period (1858-1947)  Henry Hardinge, Governor-General of India During this period, European styled statues were erected in city squares, as monuments to the British Empire's power. Statues of Queen Victoria, George V, and various Governor-Generals of India were erected. Such statues were removed from public places after independence, and placed within museums. However, some still stand at their original location, such as Statue of Queen Victoria, Bangalore.  Post-Independence (1947 - present)  Modern Indian sculptors include D.P Roy Choudhury, Ramkinkar Baij, Sankho Chaudhuri and Chintamoni Kar. The National Gallery of modern Art has a large collection of modern Indian sculpture.

This group was formed at a time when Indian diplomat Sashanka Banerjee was posted at East Pakistan's capital city Dhaka, where he claims to have received a letter in December 1962 from Mujibur Rahman addressed to Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru asking for Indian assistance in bringing about East Pakistan's independence from Pakistan. Swadhin Bangal Biplobi Parishad was secretly organized in Dhaka University's Jahrul Hoque Hall by Mujibur Rahman under command of Sirajul Alam Khan (who was from the same university) along with Abdur Razzak and Kazi Aref Ahmed. Its political arm was the Bangladesh Liberation Force (BLF). From 1962, it planned and organized mass movements through the historic 6-point and 11-point programs. Training of Dhaka University students for the armed revolt against Pakistan started on the University's gymnasium field on 1 March as the University's halls were closed to students since then. Earlier, Mujibur Rahman had founded another student group in the same university's Fazlul Huq Hall on 4 January 1948 named the East Pakistan Chhatra League, renamed the Bangladesh Chhatra League upon the Bangladesh Liberation War and Bangladesh's subsequent independence. The students of this league were recruited into the Mukti Bahini (Liberation Army), Mujibur Rahman's armed guerrilla force and the military arm of his political party the Bangladesh Awami League trained by India's foreign intelligence organization the Research and Analysis Wing to wage the liberation struggle. The BLF first made the flag of Bangladesh and hoisted it on 2 March 1971, when the Awami League, led by Mujibur Rahman, made a call for a general strike to agitate for independence. That strike saw violent pogroms against ethnic non-Bengalis resident in East Pakistan. In response to those killings and mass expulsions, the Pakistani military on 25 March launched Operation Searchlight. Mujibur Rahman declared East Pakistan's independence the following day. Subsequently, under Mujibur Rahman's directive, the BLF high command was reconstituted with Serajul Alam Khan, Sheikh Fazlul Huq Moni, Abdur Razzak and Tofail Ahmed. This revamped BLF was renamed \\"Mujib Bahini\\" (Mujib's Army) in the war. The general strike, pogroms and the resulting war followed on the heels of the Agartala Conspiracy, at the time deemed a politically motivated accusation by the Pakistani state against Bengali leaders but confirmed in 2011 to be factually true by the Bangladeshi Parliament's Deputy Speaker and one of the Agartala conspirators Shawkat Ali. By the start of the war, other countries hostile to Pakistan seized upon the opportunity and gave material assistance to this student movement (that had by now morphed into an armed guerrilla revolt) to bring about Pakistan's disintegration, with a potentially friendly nation's independence being a favorable by-product. When the war ended the Indian Army destroyed all files and records of its activities regarding East Pakistan before as well as during the war, though in 2015 the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would explain India's role in the war in an address at Dhaka University. The central role of students in the armed secessionist rebellion aided by India was a main reason why the Razakars killed Bengali students and intellectuals on Dhaka University grounds on 25 March at the start of Operation Searchlight and committed another massacre of Bengali intellectuals on 14 December, two days before Pakistan's defeat and surrender and Bangladesh's resulting independence. Both massacres were committed on the grounds that Dhaka University was a hotbed of guerrilla activity and served as an arms dump and a nerve center of military operations run by the university's students and faculty. After the end of the war, Mukti Bahini perpetrated hooliganism and looting, according to AK Khandokar.http://www.thedailystar.net/ak-khandker-sued-for-mujib-bahinis- looting-claim-41063 The Mukti Bahini also resumed its persecution against ethnic non-Bengalis in the newly independent country.

Many poems of the classical Sangam literature were set to music. There are various references to this ancient musical tradition found in the ancient Sangam books such as Ettuthokai and Pattupattu. The early narrative poem Cilappatikaram, belonging to the post-Sangam period (5th or 6th century) also mentions various forms of music practiced by the Tamil people. Music was an integral part of the compositions of the Tamil Saiva saints such as Appar, Siva Prakasar, Thirugnana Sambanthar and Manikkavasagar during the Hindu revival period between the 6th and the 10th century. Sangam music The Sangam age grammatical work Tolkappiyam mentions the various music pertaining to the five landscapes (thinai) of the Sangam literature. The five landscapes are associated with a particular mood of the poem and to give colour to these moods, each had a musical mood (pann), a melodic instrument (yaazh) and a percussion instrument (parai). For example, the neithal thinai, which dealt with the incidents around the seashore and the theme of elopement, had the musical mood of sevvazhi, Vilari yaazh as the musical instrument and the navayapambai for the percussion. Tolkappiyam also mentions the musical form known as Paattu Vannam and various types of songs like Asiriapattu, Neduven pattu, Adivarai, Seer, Ahaval Osai and Vellosai, which are classified on the basis of the musical quality, metrical structure etc. Most of the Sangam age poetry used one or more of these meters in their compositions. Poems of the Ettuthohai anthology, such as the Natrinai, Paripaatal and Kaliththokai are extensively musical in nature and use various panns to create the mood. Musical instruments Poems of the Sangam literature contain numerous mentions of the various musical instruments such as the Seerkazhi , a stringed instrument of the Veena type and various percussion instruments such as murasu or muzham. Pattupattu contains a description of the yazh, a stringed instrument. There were two types of yaazh, Periyaazh or the 'large yaazh' contained 21 strings, whereas its more compact companion Siriyaazh had only seven strings. Two other types of yaazhs, Makarayaazh with 19 strings and Sakottuyaazh with seven strings are also mentioned in Pattuppattu. However we have no further information on their actual appearance, mode of playing and the kind of melody generated by these instruments. The flute was the most popular wind instrument during the Sangam period. Perumpanarruppatai, one of the Pattupattu anthologies, describes the process of making the flute. The holes in the bamboo tube were bored using red-hot embers. The flute is also mentioned in the Kurincippattu as the instrument on which the shepherds played the ambal pann. Among the other wind instruments were the Pili, a small trumpet and Kanvidutumbu a larger flute ), perhaps producing lower octaves The flute also acted as a drone providing a constant pitch for vocalists and other instruments 'as long as the trunk of an elephant'. The Murasu, or the drum was the most popular percussion instrument. During festivals, the sound of Murasu conveyed joy and gaiety. Muzhavu, another percussion instrument accompanied singers. The drum was also used as the war-drum, calling people to arms. Mathuraikkanci mentions that the murasu was one of the prized possessions captured from the defeated enemy in the battlefield. Malaipatukatam describes the method of constructing and tuning the murasu. The sides were covered with skin, which were kept in position by leather straps. Malaipatukatam also mentions other percussion instruments such as udukkai, a palm-sized drum, Muzhavu, Siruparai and Tattai. The sound tattai resembled the croaking of a frog. This was a crude folk instrument made using a bamboo stick. Numerous slits were made across the stick and sound was produced on it by striking it on a stone or any other hard surface. In the Kurincippattu peasant women use tattai to scare the birds from the paddy field. A well-known percussion instrument is the mridangam (mathangam). It's a double headed drum used to accompany the veena (Yaazh) and the flute among other instruments. List of Musical instruments used by ancient Tamil people was listed in Tirumuraihttp://www.shaivam.org/siddhanta/mis-thi-isai-karuvi.htm dated 6th to 11th century.

Thannumai Musical notations In Tamil music, the sargam \\"sa-ri-ga-ma-pa-da-ni\\" of the Indian classical music were known by their Tamil names Kural, Tuttam, Kaikilai, Uzhai, Ili, Vilari and Taram. There are notations for the notes in different octaves. For example, Kurai Tuttam and Nirai Tuttam refer to the ri (rishabha) note in the lower and upper octaves respectively. Moods Raga, which defines the mood of the Indian classical music was described by the Pann. Specific panns were sung during worship and during religious and royal ceremonies. Maduraikanchi refers to women singing Sevvazhi pann to invoke the mercy of God during childbirth. In Tolkappiyam, the five landscapes of the Sangam literature had an associated Pann, each describing the mood of the song associated with that landscape. The Sangam landscape was classified into five regions to describe the mood of the poem and to describe the intangibles of human emotions. While describing life and romance, the poets employed the background of the natural landscape and used the pann specific to that landscape to provide the mood. The neithal landscape, which is employed to convey the grief of separation of lovers had the associated sevvazhi pann expressing pathos. Post-Sangam music Evolution of panns The post-Sangam period, between the third and the fifth centuries CE, Tamil music evolved to a different level of sophistication. Cilappatikaram, written around the fifth century CE, describes music based on logical, systematic and scientific calculations in the arrangements of the dancers on the stage to represent the notes and panns. Cilappatikaram contains several chapters dedicated to music and dance, of which the most famous is the kanal vari which is a duet between the hero Kovalan and his lady-love Madavi. Cilappatikaram contains musical terminology such as, azhaku and matthirai referring to the musical pitch and the smallest fraction of an audible sound distinguishable by the human ear. From these evolved the scales. One of the first scales employed by the ancient Tamils was the mullaippann, a pentatonic scale composed of the notes sa ri ga pa da equivalent to C, D, E, G and A in the western notations. These fully harmonic scales, constitutes the raga Mohanam in the Carnatic music style. These scales can also be found in many eastern music systems such as the Chinese traditional music. Mullaippann further evolved into Sempaalai, a scale based on seven notes. The ancient Tamils also derived new panns by the process of modal shift of tonic and by the process of reallocating the pitch and beat of the notes. Cilappatikaram has an example of this in the chapter Arangetrukadai, where the Pann Mercharupalai is changed to derive a new Pann. The four original panns of maruthappann, kurinchippann, sevvazhi and sadari thus evolved into 103 panns with varying characterisations. Some of the panns and their equivalent Carnatic ragas were: * Panchamam – Ahiri * Pazham Panchuram - Sankarabharanam * Meharahkkurinchi - Neelampari * Pazhanthakka Ragam - Arabhi * Kurinchi - Malahari * Natta Ragam – Panthuvarali * Inthalam - Nathanamakriya * Thakkesi - Kambhoji * Kausikam - Bhairavi * Nattappadai – Gambheeranaattai Musical instruments Cilappatikaram makes reference to five types of instruments: Tolkaruvi (lit. 'skin instruments' = percussion), Tulaikaruvi (lit. 'holed instruments' = wind instruments), Narambukaruvi (stringed instruments), Midatrukaruvi (vocalists) and Kanchakaruvi (gongs and cymbals). The flute and the yaazh were the most popular instruments, while there were numerous kinds of percussion instruments suited for various occasions. Cilappatikaram also contains detailed instructions on the art of tuning and playing the yaazh. Devotional period Between the fifth and the sixth centuries the Tamil literature was dominated by a moralistic age during which a number of literary works of didactic nature were produced. These poets did not attach much importance to music in their compositions, being more concerned with ethics and morals of the people. However the underlying musical culture was not forgotten. For example, Tirukkural contains numerous allusions to music and the enjoyment of music. One famous example is the kural compares unfavourably the sweetness of the flute and the yaazh with the voice of children. Tevaram Tamil music revived with the advent of the Saiva and Vaishnava saints who composed thousands of hymns in popular language to spread their faith among common people. Saivite nayanmars such as Appar, Thirugnana Sambanthar and Sundarar used the ancient panns to enable people to sing them in Temples. The Saiva Tevarams and the Vaishna Naalayira Divyap Prabhandhams were instrumental in the revival and the popularisation of Tamil music. In addition to the panns for the melody, the Tevaram poems used santham (rhythm) such as thaana-thana-thaanaa-thanaa in their lyrics, providing a complete musical experience to the listener. The traditional of religious singing continued for many centuries during which singers known as Othuvars sang the Tevaram songs in temples. The musical knowledge and skills were orally passed on through generations. Thiruppugazh - Umbartharu Thiruppugazh In the fifteenth century poet Arunagirinathar composed a series of poems known as Thiruppugazh. Arunagirinathar represents a remarkable blend of Tamil literary genius, a high degree of devotion to Murugan and a musical expertise. Arunagirinathar was one of the first poet to set all his compositions to reverberating music in the style of \\"Santham\\" which means setting the verses within a certain length to conform with rhythm (thala). Arunagirinathar was the pioneer in the art of setting his poems to the sweet sounds of music. Just like the seven octaves in music, Arunagirinathar, is known as a santhakkavi – musical poet, uses certain repetitive phrases rhythmically to achieve movement and colour in his poems. By combining the Tamil hard or soft consonants and long or short vowels in different ways, Arunagirinathar produces hundreds of compound rhythmic words such as, tatta, taatta, tantha, thaantha, thaiya, thanna, thaana, thanana, etc. At the beginning of each poem in the Thiruppugazh, Arunagirinathar gives the rhythm notations.

Plot summary At a private club in Manhattan, an elderly man named George Gregson recounts a card game he played many years ago where he met an odd man named Henry Brower who refused to touch anyone, recoiling from contact in fear. After Brower wins the game, another player, Jason Davidson, leaps up and shakes his hand enthusiastically, causing Brower to scream and bolt from the room. Gregson then makes it his mission to find him and give him his winnings. It's revealed shortly thereafter that Davidson had died of a brain aneurysm. Gregson speaks with an old associate of the man, who tells him that Brower was cursed by an Indian shaman after an unfortunate incident in Bombay in which he accidentally caused the death of a boy. From that moment on, Brower has been cursed to cause the death of any living thing he touches. Gregson then attempts to track down Brower and meets an innkeeper who tells him that he discovered Brower dead in the inn, one hand firmly clasped in the other.

Rajasthan Atomic Power Station Rajasthan Atomic Power Station The Rajasthan Atomic Power Station is located at Rawatbhata. it currently has six pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) units operating with a total installed capacity of 1,180MW.{{cn)) The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), the operator of the plant, is increasing the existing capacity by constructing two more reactors known as Units 7 and 8. (2×700MW=1400MW) Heavy Water Plant Owned and operated by the Department of Atomic Energy's (DAE) Heavy Water Board (HWB), the heavy water plant is integrated with the Rajasthan atomic power station for its supply of power and steam. An oil-fired steam generation plant was also added to ensure uninterrupted supply of steam during the shutdown periods. Canada began construction on the plant but ceased cooperation on the project after India's May 1974 test of a nuclear device. The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre(BARC) then completed designing the plant, which was originally expected to start operations in 1976. Problems associated with the accumulation of toxic chemicals created during the production of hydrogen sulphide gas, however, delayed commissioning until April 1985. These problems resulted in a cost escalation from 1.94 billion rupees to at least Rs. 7.2 billion rupees. Inadequate and unreliable supplies of power and steam from the RAPS reactors also plagued the plant and contributed to its low output. The two oil-fired boilers of the steam generation plant were added to alleviate the power supply problem. The heavy water plant uses the hydrogen sulphide water exchange process to produce up to 100mt of heavy water per year. Nuclear Fuel Complex Nuclear Fuel Complex, Hyderabad is setting up a green-field project Nuclear fuel Complex at Rawatbhata, Chittorgarh District, Rajasthan.

It was released on their 1982 album Creatures of the Night. It has proven to be a staple of the band's live show, being performed on almost every tour the band has done aside from the Reunion and Psycho Circus tours. Background The track was written by bassist/vocalist Gene Simmons and guitarist Vinnie Vincent, although some versions of the album mistakenly credit Paul Stanley and Vincent. The latter had been working with songwriter Adam Mitchell when he discovered that Mitchell had connections to Kiss, and Vincent made it a point to meet Simmons through Mitchell. After meeting and exchanging phone numbers with Simmons, the two got together and wrote \\"I Love It Loud\\" in addition to another song called \\"Killer\\", which appeared on the Creatures album during the same writing session. The song fades out, only to come back even louder, and then fades out a second time. This idea was taken from the Beatles' songs \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\". Released as a single in 1982, it was only the second Kiss single to feature a picture sleeve and marked the final Kiss single released on the Casablanca label.KISS singles information As a single, the song did not fare particularly well, failing to crack the Billboard Hot 100, although it did \\"bubble under\\" at No. 102.International Chart History The song hit #45 on the RPM Singles Chart in Canada in March 1983. Music video A video was filmed which featured the band, then officially consisting of Simmons, guitarist/vocalist Paul Stanley, drummer Eric Carr and guitarist Ace Frehley, on stage performing the song while teenagers, watching them perform on television, are being hypnotized (or inspired) by their performance. As the song progresses, the father's newspaper catches fire, the telephone melts, a teacup explodes, stuff pours out of the refrigerator behind the mother (who just stares at the mess) and a large crack appears in the wall near the television. Howard Marks, KISS' business manager from 1976 to 1988, stars as the father in the video.Screenshot from \\"I Love It Loud\\" video. The video was directed by Paul Davey and produced by John Weaver for Keefco.KISS video Information It also marked the final video for which Kiss wore their famous make-up before unmasking in 1983 (see 1983 in music). Although the lead guitarist who recorded the song really was the unofficial member Vinnie Vincent, the music video feature performing Ace Frehley due to contractual reasons, being the last Kiss video to include him (excluding various television appearances Frehley did with the group in support for Creatures of the Night) before his departure later that year. \\"I Love It Loud\\" was the last Kiss single to feature Simmons on lead vocals until \\"God Gave Rock 'N' Roll to You II\\" in 1991, and the last to feature Simmons as the sole lead vocalist until \\"Unholy\\" in 1992. Alternative versions and covers This song also appears on other releases such as 1993's Alive III and on Kiss' The Box Set in 2001. The single of the live version reached number 22 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks. A remixed version of the track appears on Kiss's 1988 greatest hits album, Smashes, Thrashes & Hits, that features a notably different drum sound and is missing the fade out in the middle of the song. The Phunk Junkeez reworked the song and covered it on their 1995 Injected album, retitled \\"I Love It Loud\\" (Injected Mix). The song was later included in the soundtrack for the 1995 comedy film, Tommy Boy (starring Chris Farley and David Spade); a music video for the song was made that featured Farley and Spade (in their film character roles) come upon and take part in a concert held by the Phunk Junkeez while clips from the film were interspersed. In 1999, Snow recorded a dancehall reggae cover of the song, entitled simply Loud, on his Cooler Conditions album.See production notes in cd insert: Cooler Conditions (Tokyo: JVC Japan).

Situated at the bank of River Chenab, it is the headquarters of the Reasi district. In the eighth century, Reasi was a part of the Bhimgarh state established by Bhim Dev. The name Reasi is derived from the town's old name \\"Rasyal\\". Geography Reasi is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Reasi It has an average elevation of 466 metres (1,529 feet). Reasi area Reasi is a District, located 64 km from Jammu. Majority of the population ekes out its livelihood from small business ventures, govt jobs and agriculture. Of the 12293 hectares of agricultural land in the area, 1011 hectares is irrigated. Important crops are Maize, Wheat, Paddy and Bajra. Vegetables are also grown. Climatically, most parts of the area falls in the sub tropical zone and the rest in the temperate zone. Summers are generally warm and winters are cold with snowfall on the higher reaches. Reasi Skyline in Summer Brief history The erstwhile Bhimgarh State, now called Reasi, was established by Bhim Dev in the eighth century. Brief accounts of successive rulers are known from 1652 when Hari Dev was the king of Jammu. In 1810, during the rule of Diwan Singh, Jammu was under turmoil. Palace intrigues and mutinies shook the administration. It was at this time that Maharaja Ranjit Singh sent Gulab Singh to take control. Gulab Singh came down heavily on the rebels and established the rule of law. After defeating the rebels in the Reasi area, he handed over the administration to his trusted commander, General Zorawar Singh. In 2005, the first municipal election was held and Mr. Kuldeep Mengi elected as a first chairman of the municipal corporation of Reasi. During the devastating floods of September 2014, Saddal Village in the Reasi district faced significant devastation, with a landslide that submerged all roads leading to the town. Demographics India census, Reasi had a population of 36,355. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%.

Geology and mining Reasi has rich ores of bauxite, iron and precious stones.  Current times  Being far away from the Jammu - Udhampur highway and somewhat inaccessible due to the hilly area, economic progress in Reasi has been rather slow. However, the economic activity picked up since the 1980s with the construction of the Salal Hydroelectric Project. The militancy in the 1990s came as a setback to prosperity but induction of Army in the area has given a sense of security to the people. But what may change the face of Reasi in the not so distant a future, is the Jammu - Srinagar Railway Line which will pass through Reasi and is likely to bring development and prosperity to this area, after providing district status development of Reasi would be tremendous. almost all major banks have their presence in reasi to meet financial need of newly created district. World's First in Reasi Reasi is looking forward to have the World's tallest bridge by December 2019.

She won the Newbery Medal for her 1933 biography of Louisa May Alcott, entitled Invincible Louisa. She also wrote three Newbery Honor Books. Life Cornelia Meigs was born December 6, 1884, to civil engineer Montgomery C. Meigs, Jr. and Grace Lynde Meigs in Rock Island, Illinois, the fifth of six daughters. The family moved to Keokuk, Iowa when she was one month old. After graduating from Keokuk High School in 1901http://www.rootsweb.com/~ialee/Graduates/keo-mp.htm she attended Bryn Mawr College, receiving an A.B. degree in 1907.Chevalier, Tracy (editor), Twentieth-Century Children's Writers, St. James Press, 1989, pp. 673. Meigs began writing children's books while an English teacher at St. Katherine's School in Davenport, Iowa. Her first book, The Kingdom of the Winding Road, was published by Macmillan US in 1915. In 1922 she was one runner-up for the inaugural Newbery Medal from the professional librarians, recognizing the previous year's \\"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\". Members of the American Library Association were asked to nominate a book and The Windy Hill by Meigs was the last of six that received at least two votesPage 3 in this reprint subsequently designated runners-up. She was one of the runners-up again in 1929 (Clearing Weather) and 1933 (Swift Rivers). Runner-up works are now called Newbery Honor Books, so latter-day editions are authorized to display a silver seal on the cover. Meigs won a Little, Brown and Co. prize competition with The Trade Wind. Little, Brown published that book in 1927 and subsequently a few more of her works including the children's biographies of Louisa May Alcott and Jane Addams. Meigs is best known for the Alcott biography, Invincible Louisa: The Story of the Author of \\"Little Women\\", which won the Newbery Medal in 1934. It follows Alcott from childhood in Pennsylvania and Boston through writing the classic novel Little Women. Kirkus Reviews called Meigs \\"one of the best-loved authors of fiction for boys and girls\\", observed that Little Women is \\"virtually autobiographical\\", and recommended that the books be paired. In 1932, Meigs became a professor of English at Bryn Mawr, where she remained until her retirement in 1950. During World War II she took a year of absence for three years to work for the War Department. After leaving Bryn Mawr, Meigs taught writing at the New School of Social Research in New York City. She was the lead editor and one writer of A Critical History of Children's Literature, published by Macmillan in 1953, which has been called \\"a landmark in the field of children's literature\\". It was revised under Meigs' leadership and re- issued in 1969. In her lifetime Meigs wrote over 30 fiction books for children, as well as two plays, two biographies, and several books and articles for adults. Meigs lived at Sion Hill, Havre de Grace, Maryland; and Brandon, Vermont.Newbery Medal Books: 1922-1955, eds.

The documents, which include manuscripts, slide photographs, newspaper clippings, works of art, journals, film, sound recordings, and other ephemera, are housed in the special collections department of the UCSB Libraries at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where they are made accessible to researchers upon request. An effort is currently underway to make certain documents available online through the Online Archive of California. History CEMA was founded in 1988 by Joseph A. Boissé and Salvador Güereña, both UCSB librarians. The library already had a substantial collection of primary and secondary-sources in the Colección Tloque Nahuaque, a library of Chicano studies materials, and the need for special resources to preserve and catalogue primary resources became apparent. The primary resources, which at that time consisted primarily of silkscreen posters from the Chicano art movement, were transferred from the ethnic and gender studies library to the department of special collections. Güereña began the acquisition of other collections immediately, and today CEMA is the repository for over 100 collections from each of the four main ethnic groups in California: Latinos, Asian Americans, African American, and Native Americans, although Mexican American collections still outnumber collections from the other groups. Projects In 2001, CEMA was selected by the Online Archive of California, an internet resource, to supply digital images of Chicano art from its extensive photographic collections as part of California's contribution to the Congressionally-mandated American Memory project to preserve and increase the accessibility of documents from American history. Since that time, CEMA has provided over 7,000 digital images for the project. Collections CEMA's collections include the archives of artistic, political, and professional organizations, as well as the papers of individual artists, musicians, activists, and writers, many of whom were active in the Chicano, anti-war, and civil rights movements.

The village is famous for two of Goa’s famous structures; the Reis Magos Fort, and the Reis Magos Church – the first church in Bardez. Reis Magos is the Portuguese name for the Three Wise Men from the Bible. Reis Magos Fort Predating Fort Aguada by half a century, a second, smaller fort that crowns the headland jutting into the narrowest stretch of the Mandovi, almost facing the capital city Panjim, is the Reis Magos Fort. This Fort, surrounded by sturdy laterite walls studded with typically Portuguese turrets, was erected in 1551 to protect the narrowest point at the mouth of the Mandovi estuary. It was enlarged subsequently on different occasions and finally re-erected in 1707. The fort formerly accommodated viceroys and other dignitaries newly arrived from, or en route to, Lisbon, and in the early eighteenth century proved a linchpin in the wars against the Hindu Marathas, who were never able to take it. The bastion was used as a prison. Though far inferior in size to the fortress of Mormugao, yet standing on an eminence, it commands a splendid view all around. It is in a good state of preservation and is defended by 33 guns and accommodation for a small garrison. Towards the east, at a little distance from it, flows a spring with abundance of excellent water, while at its base rises the church of the Reis Magos, ascended by a beautiful flight of stairs. This edifice was built on the ruins of a pagoda in 1550 by the Franciscans, with the sum allotted to them by the Government, and bears a crown on its façade, and the royal arms on its sanctuary and other places. The pavement is dotted with inscriptions, the most important of which, found in the sanctuary, indicated the spot enclosing the remains of Dom Luís de Ataíde, Count of Athoughia, who twice held the position of Viceroy of Portuguese India and Goa. This Fort stands on the north bank of the Mandovi at Reis Magos, and is very much visible from the Panjim side of the Mandovi river. It was used as a residence for viceroys and later converted to a fortress. It was occupied briefly between 1798-1813 by the British Army. It was subsequently abandoned by the military and served as a prison until 1993. Reis Magos Fort Restoration The Fort, originated as an armed outpost of the Adil Shah of Bijapur in 1493. When Bardez was conquered by the Portuguese in 1541, the Fort was built along with the church. From 1900, it lost its defensive role and was used as a jail and was finally abandoned in 1993 after which it was at the mercy of the elements, and had begun to crumble. Restoration work on the fort began in 2008 with the funds being provided by the UK-based Helen Hamlyn Trust, INTACH - a non-governmental organisation dealing with restorations of monuments, and the Government of Goa. Renowned architect Gerard da Cunha was hired to restore the fort.http://www.tehelka.com/the-visionary-reformer-gerard-da-cunha/ The fort is now converted into a cultural centre, besides being used a tourist attraction.

R. S. de Souza and Fitz de Souza, is a Kenyan lawyer and ex- politician of Indian origin, who was an important figure in the campaign for independence for Kenya, a member of the Kenyan parliament in the 1960s and Deputy Speaker for several years. He helped provide a legal defence for those accused of Mau Mau activities including the Kapenguria Six, and he was one of the people involved in the Lancaster House conferences held to draw up a constitutional framework for Kenyan independence. Born to a Goan family in Mumbai, de Souza lived in Zanzibar before settling in Kenya in 1942. Fitz de Souza took a first degree in England and trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn. As a young man in 1952 he joined a team of lawyers from various Commonwealth countries, including the British barrister Denis Nowell Pritt and other lawyers educated in England but not born there, defending Kenyans accused of Mau Mau activities by the British colonial administration, in a series of trials including that of Jomo Kenyatta. Feelings in the country were running high, with some settlers of European ancestry disrupting any legal process for people they considered assassins, while other people in Kenya were convinced of bad faith amongst those involved in the all-white British prosecution. In this atmosphere, de Souza and an Asian colleague faced implied allegations of 'encouraging' defendants to criticise police witnesses, but judges at the East African Court of Appeal supported them, praising their assistance to the court. For part of the 1950s Fitz de Souza was studying for a PhD at the London School of Economics and was politically active both there and in Kenya. His doctoral thesis was on \\"Indian Political Organization in East Africa\\" (1959). He knew Kenyatta and was a major figure in the movement towards an independent Kenya. He has been described during this period both as a \\"freedom fighter\\"Press Briefing by Indian Ministry for External Affairs and as someone \\"organiz[ing] Africans and Asians against the colour bar\\". In the early 1960s he was a legal adviser at the Lancaster House conferences in London where Kenyatta and the Kenyans worked with the UK Colonial Secretary, Reginald Maudling, and his team to develop a constitution for the country. In 2001 de Souza told the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission why he felt the Lancaster House Constitution had been a good constitutional framework, and expressed his disagreement with some subsequent changes, especially the re- introduction of detention without trial. The Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs has described him as making \\"a principled exit from public life in the 70s\\". De Souza was an elected member of the Kenyan Parliament even before full independence in 1963, and Deputy Speaker of the Lower House from June 1963. He left this post in 1970, spent many years in private practice, and is now semi- retired. He is married with four grown-up children. In 2004 he was given a Pravasi Bharatiya Samman award alongside other people honoured for their \\"outstanding contribution to the understanding of the Indian civilisation and for advancing India's cause abroad\\"The Hindu online edition, 8 January 2004 at a conference opened by the Indian prime minister and organised with the aim of \\"bringing together the Indian Diaspora and leveraging the potential offered by the Global Indian Family\\".Indian Embassy, Oslo, news story 2005 brought a different kind of publicity when a Pulitzer prize-winning book written by Caroline Elkins, an associate professor at Harvard, quoted a \\"respected attorney in Nairobi\\",Elkins, page 87 de Souza, as believing that at least one hundred thousand Kikuyu disappeared at the time of Mau Mau, in \\"a form of ethnic cleansing on the part of the British government\\".Elkins, page 89 These figures have been challenged by John Darwin, a fellow of Nuffield College, and lecturer on the History of the British Commonwealth at Oxford University.The Times Higher Education Supplement, 30 September 2005 In December 2006, Commissioner for Non Resident Indian affairs (Government of Goa) Eduardo Faleiro announced that de Souza would be one of the eight persons to be honoured during the Global Goans Convention. It was held from 3–5 January 2007. The awards, for the first time, were being given to \\"eminent non- resident Goans and persons of Goan origin.\\" De Souza died in March, 2020, in London.

It is operated by the state-owned Avinor and handled 145,396 passengers in 2014, making it the third-busiest regional airport in the country. The airport has a runway aligned 05/23. Services are provided by Widerøe using the Dash 8-100. Up to eight daily flights are provided to Tromsø and public service obligation flights are flown eastwards to other airports in Finnmark. The airport is the base for offshore helicopter services operated by Bristow Norway and CHC Helikopter Service. An estimated 40,000 people from Hammerfest Airport's catchment area annually use Alta Airport for flights to Oslo. Hammerfest was served from 1935 by scheduled seaplanes at a water aerodrome at Rypefjord. Services were interrupted by World War II, but resumed in 1945, lasting until the 1963 opening of Alta Airport. Hammerfest Airport opened on 1 August 1974, along with four other regional airport in Troms og Finnmark, and was originally served with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. The de Havilland Canada Dash 7 was introduced in 1983 and a helicopter base was established in 1989. The Dash 8 was introduced in 1995 and the airport was nationalized two years later. A Dash 8 was damaged beyond repair after a hard landing in 2005. Because of the limited space for expansion and unfavorable wind conditions, there is a proposal to build a new airport at Grøtnes. History The first plans for serving Hammerfest with an airline route was launched in a government plan from 1933. It proposed that flights in Northern Norway be carried out using seaplanes, and proposed Hammerfest as one of several stops on a route from Trondheim to Vadsø. Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) received the concession to operate all routes in Norway from 1935, resulting in the coastal route from Bergen to Tromsø commencing. The following year a connecting route from Tromsø via Hammerfest to Honningsvåg was subcontracted to Widerøe. The water aerodrome in Hammerfest was located at Rypefjord and consisted of a buoy where the aircraft parked; passengers were transported to the aircraft in a boat. All flights were terminated in 1939 and remained so until the end of World War II in 1945. DNL resumed the Hammerfest route in 1946, connecting the town to Tromsø, Vadsø and Kirkenes with a Junkers Ju 52. The route later also served Alta and made part of the coastal route to Bergen. The segment north of Tromsø was taken over by Widerøe in 1954, and two years later Widerøe also started a route from Hammerfest via Alta to Bardufoss Airport, which allowed for a transfer to an Oslo-bound aircraft. Widerøe mostly used Noorduyn Norseman and de Havilland Canada Otters on the routes. Alta Airport and two other primary airports in Finnmark opened in 1963 and Widerøe decided to terminate its seaplane routes in the county. At the time a bus trip from Hammerfest to Alta took four hours. Unlike the seaplane routes, the landplane routes from Alta were able to operate during winter. Norving established an air ambulance base at Hammerfest in 1961.Melling: 31 With the opening of Alta Airport, Norving applied for permission and subsidies to operate a feeder service from Hammerfest to Alta, but the application was rejected by the government.Melling: 43 Widerøe de Havilland Canada Dash 7 in 1987 The mid-1960s saw several proposals for regional airports in Finnmark. A committee appointed by Finnmark County Council proposed, in 1966, Hammerfest as one of six suitable sites for a simple airfield to serve air ambulance and air taxi services.Melling: 54 At the same time the government was working on plans to build a national network of short take-off and landing airport. The plans eventually called for six airports in northern Troms og Finnmark, a plan passed by Parliament in 1972. Both Widerøe and Norving applied to operate the subsidized routes in Finnmark,Melling: 109 and the contract was awarded to Widerøe, which operated the subsidized routes in the rest of the country.Melling: 117 The airport opened on 1 August 1974 with Hammerfest Municipality as the owner and operator. The same day four other airports in Finnmark and Troms commenced operations. These were all originally served using Widerøe's de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft. The airline established its technical base for Finnmark at Hammerfest.Arnesen: 124–130 Widerøe introduced the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 on the route from Tromsø Airport to Hammerfest in 1983,Arnesen: 136–139 the same year as Norving started flights from Hammerfest to Hasvik Airport.Melling: 105 The Hasvik roue was taken over by Widerøe in 1990. Helikopter Service established a helicopter base at Hammerfest Airport in 1989 to serve the offshore petroleum industry which was searching for oil in the Barents Sea. Widerøe introduced the Dash 8 on the Finnmark routes in 1995. The airport was taken over by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) on 1 January 1997. The state paid Hammerfest Municipality 19.5 million Norwegian krone (NOK) in compensation. The routes eastwards were made subject to public service obligations with the Ministry of Transport and Communications from 1 April 1997. The routes to Tromsø had a sufficient patronage that they were operated without subsidies. Widerøe de Havilland Canada Dash 8 at Hammerfest Airport The helicopter operations were taken over by Norsk Helikpoter (later renamed Bristow Norway) when they opened their base on 11 November 2004. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. Hammerfest was the second airport to receive SCAT-I, a Global Positioning System-based landing system, when it was installed in 2007. SCAT-I allows aircraft with the system installed to make a safer and less fuel-consuming landings using a gliding instead of step- down approach. This was followed up with an upgrade to the runway safety area and runway lights in 2008 and 2009. Facilities The terminal has a capacity for 250 passengers per hour. It includes a separate area for helicopter traffic, but this is not in use, and helicopter passengers instead use the regular part of the terminal. There is a separate operations and fire station building, which includes the control tower. The asphalt runway measures and aligned 05–23. There are no possibilities of extending the runway, largely because of the terrain at the east end. The tarmac has room for five aircraft the size of Dash 8, in addition to helicopters. The airport is six to seven minutes' drive from the town center and has parking, taxis and car rental. Forty-five people work at the airport. Airlines and destinations The terminal building The main route at Hammerfest is Widerøe's service to Tromsø, which is operated up to eight times per day using Dash 8-100/Q200 aircraft. Widerøe also operates flights eastwards to other communities in Finnmark on public service obligations with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Two helicopter operators have bases at the airport: Bristow Norway, which operates two Eurocopter EC225 Super Pumas, and CHC Helikopter Service, which operates a Sikorsky S-92. Both companies operate flights to offshore installations. One of the Super Pumas is used for search and rescue operations for the petroleum industry and when the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Westland Sea Kings based at Station Group Banak are not available, for instance if they are on another mission or the aircraft are being maintained. Forty-two percent of the airport's traffic is generated from routes to Oslo and abroad, while twenty-nine percent is to Tromsø. The airport served 145,396 passengers, 13,822 aircraft movements and handled 16 tonnes of cargo in 2014. This included 21,216 passengers and 1,827 aircraft movements which flew offshore. Hammerfest is the third-busiest regional airport in Norway. Patronage since the 2000s has varied with the activity in the petroleum industry. Each year, an estimated 40,000 passengers from the Hammerfest area chose Alta Airport over Hammerfest Airport, as Alta provides direct flights to Oslo. Alta is located by road from Hammerfest. The catchment area of Hammerfest Airport covers the municipalities of Hammerfest and Kvalsund, although residents in Kvalsund largely use Alta Airport instead. Accidents and incidents The Widerøe Dash 8-103 aircraft LN-WIK underwent a hard landing on 1 May 2005. The aircraft, en route from Tromsø, was landing on Runway 05 when it experienced a veering wind which changed direction, resulting in an increased tail wind. The pilot attempted to counteract the increased descent rate by increasing to full throttle. This was not sufficient and the aircraft carried out a hard landing just inside the threshold, with the starboard landing gear collapsing. The aircraft slid on its belly along the runway for and was damaged beyond repair. Widerøe permitted aircraft to land in the maximum certified wind conditions, a cross-wind of 18 meters per second (36 knots) and 5 meters per second (10 knots) tail wind. Twenty-five passengers and the three crew members were all transported to hospital, although there were no serious injuries. Widerøe enforced its strictest wind restrictions of any airport at Hammerfest after the accidents. Future View of airport from a nearby hill Avinor is considering building a new airport at Grøtnes, which would be built as reclaimed land from Hammerfest. The terminal would be located on a peninsula while the runway would be built on a filling in the fjord. Avinor has studied two possible runway lengths, and . The former would cause operational problems during winter for 50-passenger aircraft, while the longer alternative would allow for operation of 70-seat turboprops, such as the Dash 8-Q400 and the ATR 72. Avinor estimated in 2012 the costs of a new airport with a short runway to NOK 1.6 billion and of a longer runway to NOK 2.2 billion. Avinor's calculations give a negative net present value for society of between NOK 1.2 and 1.4 billion. The main gain comes from that the use of slightly larger aircraft will allow for cheaper flights. A 2008 report from the Institute of Transport Economics, financed by Hammerfest and Kvalsund Municipalities, looked into two possible runway lengths of an airport at Grøtnes: and . It concluded that the former would have a negative cost for society, while the latter would break even. The report concluded that the latter could allow for three daily direct flights to Oslo, and estimated the 2013 traffic, if airport had been built, at 190,000, of which 99,000 would have been generated by the petroleum industry. A major uncertainty in the model is the unknown activity of the petroleum industry in the future. A report by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute the same year concluded that the weather at Grøtnes was well-suited for an airport. Avinor's proposal for National Transport Plan 2014–2023 discards building an airport at Grøtnes. One of Avinor's main concerns is that runway capable of Oslo flights could cannibalize the market for Alta Airport and Lakselv Airport, Banak and reduce traffic to a level that there would not be sufficient patronage at any airport to allow for two airlines to compete on the Oslo route. Instead Avinor recommends improving the road to Alta airport ( driving distance). Such a road improvement, costing 540 M kr, is partly finished, partly still planned (as of 2018).Rv. 94 Skaidi–Hammerfest (Norwegian) A part of this route (E6 at Sennalandet) is sensitive to snow storms, causing risk of missed flights.

Life Gadifer de La Salle was born about 1350 into a family of minor nobility in Poitou. His father, Ferrand de La Salle. Gadifer served first under Philip I, Duke of Burgundy, and later as a member of the household of the Duke of Berry.Le Canarien, (E. Serra Rafols and A. Cioranescu, eds.), Las Palmas, 1959 Gadifer had won renown in the French campaigns against England during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453). In 1378 the duke of Berry financed his travel to Prussia to take part in a crusading venture of the Teutonic Knights in Prussia. He served with Hospitallers in Rhodes, and was part of a delegation sent by Louis I, Duke of Anjou to the Republic of Venice. Their galleys were seized by the Republic of Ragusa, and it is likely that Louis paid Gadifer's ransom.Keen, Maurice. Nobles, Knights and Men-at-Arms in the Middle Ages, A&C; Black, 1996 In 1390 during the Barbary Crusade in North Africa he was under the command of the Duke of Bourbon at the siege of Mahdia. The expedition had been organized by the Genoese to deal with a pirate stronghold.Goodman, Jennifer Robin. Chivalry and Exploration, 1298-1630, Boydell & Brewer, 1998 While there he met Jean de Béthencourt, whom he had known previously during service under the Duke of Orleans. Bethencourt later pledged his domain to finance their expedition to the Canary Islands. Gadifer de La Salle joined Béthencourt at La Rochelle.Descendants of Jean de Bethencourt Accompanying the expedition were Brother Pierre Bontier, a Franciscan friar of Saint-Jouin-de-Marnes who later officiated at Lanzarote, and Jean le Verrier, a priest who was later installed at Fuerteventura as vicar in the chapel of Our Lady of Bethencourt. Bontier and Le Verrier served as historians of the expedition. In 1402 they conquered Lanzarote, the northernmost inhabited island, from the local guanche chieftains. Gadifer then explored the archipelago, and Béthencourt left for Cádiz, where he was given reinforcements and financial support at the Castilian court. At this time a power struggle had broken out on the island between Gadifer and Berthin, another officer. Berthin wished to abandon the conquest and return with a cargo of slaves. While Gadifer was exploring another island, Berthin departed with almost all of the ships leaving Gadifer for dead. Gadifer and his men spent about a week on the island surviving from dew gathered on their blankets. Eventually a soldier still loyal to Gadifer brought one of the remaining ships to rescue them. In 1403, after a resupply ship sent by Béthencourt arrived, Gadifer was able to complete the conquest of the islands and root out the disloyal Castilians. In early 1404 the native population converted to Christianity, later that same year Béthencourt himself returned. De la Salle and Béthencourt founded the city of Betancuria in 1404.‘Gadifer de la Salle: A late medieval knight-errant’, in C. Harper and R. Harvey, eds. The ideals and practices of Medieval Knighthood, 74-85. Béthencourt had become king of the Canaries (a title granted by Henry III of Castile in exchange for Béthencourt's respect). Gadifer, who felt insulted, left the Canaries and appealed for redress at the court of Castile. When this appeal proved to be unsuccessful, he returned to France.

It is a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). History The origin of Rishra situated on the right bank of the River Hugli dates back to the pre- colonial era. The reference of Rishra was first seen to have occurred in Bipradas Piplai's “Manasamangal Kavya”, written in the fifteenth century. At the time of giving a description of the movement of Chand Saudagar along the River Bhagirathi in a barge for the business. There has been further and marked an evolution in the said spelling down the era as Reshra, Risshra, Isharah, Ichera, Icchra, etc. In Jadavpur University, a research work was conducted in respect of the names of villages in our country. It was noticed that there are several villages in our country in a single name. But the name of Rishra has been found to be unique during such research exercise. In the book written on traveling description by a French traveler Vernia, the name of the Rishra village was noticed which was situated eight miles away from Kolkata. During the Sen Dynasty, it is told that there were hermitages of the saints (Rishi) on the bank of the river Bhagirathi. It is presumed that the name “Rishra” might have been derived from the word Saint or Rishi with whom it is believed to have been associated over a pretty long time in the past. During the Mughal period, the village Rishra and its suburbs were thickly populated. The hot and humid climate of the area was congenial to the textile industry. The land was thus famous for textile and silk weaving. The Hindu weavers here used to manufacture fine cotton pieces, while Muslim weavers monopolized in silk manufacture. In the fertile land in and around the area, paddy, jute, and betel-leaf were grown in abundance. The Kaibartas utilized the marshy land for fishing. During the last phase of the industrialization under the Danish rule, the entire civic administration was completely disrupted. After taking over the possession of the town of Serampore, the British Company began to look after its civic amenities. The earlier “village committee” was transformed into Serampore Municipality. Rishra and Konnanagar were included.http://rishramunicipality.org/history/ Manasa Mangal is the first book or proof where Rishra's name can be found.

Early life Avraham Yitchak Bloch was born in 1891 and was the second son of Rabbi Yosef Leib Bloch, the Rosh yeshiva of Telz. He represented the third generation of family leadership in Telz, as his grandfather Rabbi Eliezer Gordon was also Rosh yeshiva in Telz. Bloch was educated by both his father and grandfather. Telzer Rav and Rosh Yeshiva Upon the death of Yosef Leib Bloch in 1929, it was widely assumed that his oldest son, Rabbi Zalman Bloch would succeed his father as Rosh yeshiva of Telz, as was the custom in many communities. At the funeral Zalman announced that the position should be filled by his younger brother. At the age of 38, Avraham Yitzchak succeeded his father as Rosh Yeshiva of Telz, which was one of the largest and most prestigious yeshivas in Europe. Bloch traveled to the United States in 1928 on a successful fundraising campaign. Bloch continued to develop the educational methodology pioneered by his father. This method is known as the Telzer Derekh, a unique analytical approach to Torah study. Bloch was also a member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of the Agudath Israel and participated at the third Knessia Gedolah of the Agudath Israel at Marienbad, Austria in 1937. World War II In 1940, the town of Telz was invaded by Soviet forces. Shortly thereafter, the yeshiva was forced to surrender its main building for use as a Red Army barracks. The students remained in Telz, where they rented accommodation from local townsfolk. This also changed, when the Soviets forbade the renting out of rooms to yeshiva students. Bloch responded by dispersing the yeshiva to five surrounding towns and arranging for members of the faculty to travel from town to town to deliver classes to his students. On Tuesday July 15, 1941 (20th Tammuz), Nazi Einsatzgruppen and local Lithuanian sympathizers massacred the male population of Telz, including Bloch himself and the faculty of the yeshiva. Three of Bloch's daughters survived the Holocaust. One married Rabbi Baruch Sorotzkin who joined the Telz Yeshiva in Cleveland, Ohio and later served as the Rosh yeshiva. Another married Rabbi Aizik Ausband, a student of Telz in Lithuania who also became a Rosh yeshiva at the Telz Yeshiva in Cleveland, Ohio. The third daughter married Yosef Yehudah Leib Kleiner; they escaped Europe together during World War II and fled to Palestine's Yishuv. Published works Bloch was both a prolific writer and speaker yet many of his writings were lost during the Holocaust. Some notes of Rabbi Bloch's lectures were rescued by students who escaped the Holocaust, and published by Bloch's family: *Shiurei HaGrai Bloch on the Talmudic Tractates of Chullin and Yevamos. *Shiurei Daas - A collection of essays on a variety of topics viewed from the unique Telz method of analysis.

Its commandant was General Ji Cheong-cheon, with General Lee Beom-seok, a hero of the Battle of Cheongsanri and future prime minister of South Korea as the Chief of Staff. Effectively a part of the Chinese forces upon which it was dependent, the army was limited by available manpower and did not get much above 339 strong. The KLA became the basis of the modern day Republic of Korea Armed Forces. Early days The KLA brought together many Korean guerrilla armies that proliferated in northern Korea, Manchuria and mainland China during the 1920s. After the declaration of war by the Provisional Government against Japan and Germany on December 9, 1941, the units of the KLA participated on the allied side in the Chinese and Southeast Asian theatres. The Regulation regarding the activities of the Korean Liberation Army, imposed by the Chinese Nationalist Government upon the provisional government in 1941, placed the KLA under the supreme authority of the Commander-in-chief of the Chinese army. This regulation was repealed in 1944, after the provisional government had achieved improved financial standing and greater importance in the eyes of the Chinese government. During this period the KLA sent troops to fight alongside British soldiers in the South-East Asian theatre of World War II by request of the British Army, including the outskirts of Burma and India (especially the Battle of Imphal in the Burma Campaign). In 1943, socialist- aligned guerrilla groups joined the KLA, and their leader, General Kim Wonbong, became the deputy commandant of the KLA. Its numbers were continuously boosted by the influx of Koreans escaping from the Japanese army (into which some in mainland Korea had been impressed) and through the recruitment of Koreans living in China. From its beginnings with an officer corps of 30 men at its foundation in 1941, the KLA grew to a substantial force with 339 in active service by the end of the war. End of World War II KLA Soldier In 1945, the KLA was working in cooperation with the US Office of Strategic Services to train men for specialist military operations within Korea. The leading units were due to depart on August 20, with General Lee in command. The KLA's goal was achieved with the Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945. However, The USSR quickly attacked Japanese forces and gained the Northern part of the Korean Peninsula this decision made the USA use the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and won the early surrender of the Japanese Empire and blocked the USSR attempted strongly influence of Korean Peninsula. On August 15, 1945, the Japanese empire collapsed and the Korea finally gained the Korean Peninsula. This independence was reaffirmed in the Treaty of San Francisco. After the end of World War II, KLA disbanded on June 1946. Post-war Lee Beom-seok with Korean Liberation Army and OSS agents. The members of the KLA returned to Korea during late 1945 and 1946.

Located at a distance of about northeast of New Delhi and south of Dehradun, Rudrapur has a history of over 500 years. It was established in the 16th century by King Rudra Chand, and was the residence of the governor of Tarai region of Kumaon. The city continues to serve as the headquarters of the Udham Singh Nagar district apart from being a major industrial and educational hub today. Rudrapur is located in the fertile Terai region over an area of 27.65 km2. With a population of 140,857 according to the 2011 census of India, Rudrapur is the fifth most populous city of Uttarakhand. Since the establishment of the State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand, the city has undergone rapid development, along with literacy growth and higher employment. One interesting thing in this area is that there are some artesian water wells where the underground water comes out itself due to underground water pressure. For this a well is to be drilled and a slotted casing pipe is to be lowered to take the water out. In such artesian wells no pump is required. However, in the last two decades, this auto-flow system has drastically declined, leading Rudrapur into a groundwater crisis.  Etymology  The name \\"Rudrapur\\" comprises of two words \\"Rudra\\" and \\"Pur\\". Its is believed to be named after the King Rudra Chandra who was handed over this region by the Emperor Akbar in 1588. Pur is a placename element common to the Indian subcontinent which is derived from the Sanskrit word 'pura' which refers to a city or settlement.  History  Kashipur. Govisana is the earliest known settlement in the region, visited by the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang in the 7th century. The Terai area, where Rudrapur is located was considered an impenetrable forest for much of the ancient period. Marshy land, extreme heat, rains which lasted months, wild animals, diseases and no means of transportation prevented people from settling here. No historical settlements, except Govishana ( northwest of the city), has been recorded in the area. Mughal historians mention that the Chand ruler of Champawat, Gyan Chand, visited Delhi Sultanate and received the regions of Bhabar-Terai up to the Ganges as a grant from then Sultan; thus bringing it under the Kingdom of Kumaon. This area remained under local chieftains; it was Kirti Chand (1488–1503), who first ruled the Terai area, along with the rest of Kumaon. Rudrapur town was established in the 16th century by King Rudra Chand of Almora. It was the residence of the Adhikari (Governor) of Tarai, till the town of Kashipur was Established in 1718. The Kumaoni Army, under Shiv Deo Joshi faced severe defeat during the Battle of Rudrapur, that was fought between Chands and Rohillas in AD 1744. Later, King Deep chand built a fort at Rudrapur to keep vigil over the Rohillas. By the end of Eighteenth century, Nand Ram, the Adhikari of Kashipur, murdered the governor of Rudrapur, Manorath Joshi, and declared himself the de facto ruler of the low-lying Terai land, with his capital at Kashipur. After the fall of Almora in 1790, Rudrapur and its surrounding areas were ceded to the Nawab of Oudh, who remained its suzerain until the British occupation in 1801. Uttar Pradesh Agricultural University, which was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru on 17 November 1960, is situated at Pantnagar near Rudrapur. In 1837, Rudrapur was annexed to the collectorate of Rohilkhand. Rudrapur was brought under Kumaon Division in 1858, however it was brought back to Rohilkhand division in 1861. In 1864-65 the whole Tarai and Bhabar was put under \\"Tarai and Bhawar Government Act\\" which was governed directly by the British crown. In 1891, the Tarai district was dismantled, and Rudrapur was put in the newly created Nainital district. Post independence Rudrapur and other parts of Nainital district were merged with United Provinces, which was later renamed the state of Uttar Pradesh. Uttar Pradesh Agricultural University, the first agricultural university of India, was established near Rudrapur on 17 November 1960. The University was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru, and soon became a significant force in the development and transfer of High Yielding Variety seeds and related technology.Uttar Pradesh Agricultural University 1963:14–19 and Charanjit Ahuja \\"One University That Actually Works\\" Indian Express, 9 March 1994, p.3 After Operation Blue Star in 1984, several Sikh extremists fled Punjab and took refuge in U.P. Tarai. Subsequently, several cases of explosions and Bombings were reported in 1991. A bomb blast occurred in Rudrapur market in mid 1991, and another bomb in a state roadways bus was defused in the nick of time. On 17 October 1991, Two bombs exploded at Ramlila celebration in the town, killing 41 people and wounding more than 140. Later, two members of the Khalistan Commando force were shot dead by a joint team of the commandos of the National Security Guard and the Delhi Police. By 1994, the demand for separate statehood for Uttarakhand achieved almost unanimous acceptance among both the local populace and political parties all over the region.Kumar, P. (2000).

Rudrapur was made the headquarter of the district of Udham Singh Nagar, which was carved out from the Nainital district on 30 September 1995.

This number according to the AMRUT mission has now been increased to a 100% for the city of Rudrapur whereas the sewage network coverage in the city according to the 2011 census was 8.4% due to high ground water table and high expenses and technical challenges in laying the system. Most of this system according to the SCBP report is non-functioning and around 68.4% of the households are connected to open drains which lead to the river without any sewage treatment. This has led to over-pollution of the two rivers Kalyani and Begul present within the city.

It closed in Boston in 1971 while on a tour prior to Broadway. Production history Lolita, My Love was initiated by Lerner, the well-known lyricist of My Fair Lady and other major hits, who recruited Barry to write the score. Nabokov, who had several times refused to allow adaptations of his novel, stated that \\"Mr. Lerner is a most talented and excellent classicist. If you have to make a musical version of Lolita, he is the one to do it.\\"Mandelbaum, Ken. Not Since Carrie. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1991 Like most musicals of the time, the production was scheduled for a multi-city \\"tryout\\" tour, during which rewrites could be done as needed, before opening on Broadway. The original director was opera impresario Tito Capobianco, and choreography was provided by Jack Cole, although Cole was fired during rehearsals and replaced by Danny Daniels. Lorna Luft was cast as supporting character Mona in what would have been her Broadway debut but was fired during rehearsals without an explanation.https://www.nytimes.com/1972/10/12/archives/lorna-luft-another- kid-in-the-family-of-singers.html Upon opening in Philadelphia on February 16, 1971, the show got savage reviews and immediately closed for more work. Capobianco was fired and replaced by Noel Willman, and Daniels was replaced as choreographer by Dan Siretta. Even Annette Ferra, the actress playing Lolita, was let go. The show reopened in Boston but did lukewarm business and received mixed reviews, although critics acknowledged good performances by John Neville as Humbert and Dorothy Loudon as Lolita's vulgar mother, Charlotte, and found the music and lyrics strong. Lolita was played by actress Denise Nickerson, and Oscar nominee Leonard Frey was Clare Quilty. The production closed before its scheduled opening at the Mark Hellinger Theatre, the site of many previous Lerner triumphs; it lost $900,000. The show was revived in a Musicals in Mufti staged reading at the York Theatre Company in New York in March 2019 as adapted from several of Lerner's drafts by Erik Haagensen and with a score recovered and directed by Deniz Cordell. \\"Lolita Musical Takes the Stage at York Theatre\\" theatermania.com, February 25, 2019 Synopsis Act I Clare Quilty, a famous playwright, is having a party, celebrating a life of debauchery and sexual freedom (“Going, Going, Gone”). Humbert Humbert storms in, demanding to know where Lolita is. He accuses Quilty of stealing her “2 years, 10 months, and 4 days ago”, when she disappeared from his life. At first, Quilty protests ignorance, but cannot contain himself from laughing at Humbert. Humbert demands information from him, even threatening to shoot him, but Quilty will not budge, despite protests from his other partygoers. Finally, Humbert shoots and kills Quilty. In a monologue to the audience, he reflects that he has been a teacher for the past 18 years of his life, and seeks to answer how it is possible that he could commit murder. Upon reflection, he confesses that he has a “delirious, yet monstrous” aspect of his personality. After teaching at a girls’ school from Switzerland, and having a nervous breakdown, he decides to start a new life in America giving lectures to the Adult Education Group. He arrives to stay at the Haze household in the fictional town of Ramsdale, Vermont. There, Charlotte Haze and her daughter Dolores, aka Lolita, have a strained relationship (“The Same Old Song”). Humbert is initially disgusted by Charlotte's faux-European taste, looking for the first opportunity to leave, until he sees Lolita. He agrees to stay without even hearing the price. He offers to help tutor Lolita, who is struggling in school; she, however, is not interested in doing any work on the weekend (“Saturday”). She finds Humbert writing in his diary and tells her that Charlotte is in love with him. He shows her a picture of a young girl that looks oddly like her. Humbert explains that she is Anabell, a young girl that he was in love with years ago (“In the Broken-Promise Land of Fifteen”). Charlotte insists that Lolita not bother Humbert, which sets off another fight, and increases Humbert's distaste for Charlotte (“The Same Old Song (Reprise)”). Charlotte tries to spend time with Humbert and flatter him by talking about how much she and the Adult Education Group are looking forward to his lecture on poets. He explains that he will be lecturing on Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, and Edgar Allan Poe, all of whom had fixations on prepubescent girls. Charlotte invites the group over for a picnic the following weekend, where he explains to them the poets’ inspiration: nymphets (“Dante, Petrarch, and Poe”). At the picnic, Quilty arrives and is praised for his most recent television play. He asks about Lolita (whom he has never met), and finds Humbert strange. Later, Charlotte reflects on her love for France, how she has attempted to make her own version of it here in Ramsdale, and her dream for a better life (“Sur Les Quais”). While dancing with Humbert, Lolita returns home unexpectedly, and Humbert dotes on her. Charlotte decides to send Lolita away to summer camp: Camp Climax. Humbert is devastated when Charlotte takes Lolita to camp. However, he is even more disturbed by a letter that Charlotte leaves him, confessing her love for him and asking him to either marry her or leave (“Charlotte’s Letter”). Initially, he is disgusted, but then he thinks about the prospect of being Lolita's step-father. They are married shortly thereafter. Charlotte chastises Humbert for sending Lolita candy while she is away. He imagines not only standing up to Charlotte, but also killing her because he cannot bear the thought of being stuck with her; however, he realizes that he does not have the stomach to kill her, and that his dream of being rid of her will not be (“Farewell, Little Dream”). Charlotte admits that Lolita will not be coming home, and going right to boarding school. Humbert stands up to her, and she gives in. Charlotte finds Humbert's journal, in which he has written about how much he loves Lolita, and hates Charlotte. He attempts to play it off as a draft of a novel, but she doesn't believe him, and runs out of the house. A neighbor arrives to inform Humbert that Charlotte has been hit and killed by a car. He relishes in his newfound fortune, phoning the camp to say he will collect Lolita. Then, he calls and makes a reservation at a hotel for that night. Humbert is elated as he leaves to get Lolita (“Hello, Little Dream”). Act II Humbert and Lolita arrive at the seedy Bed-D-By Motel, where Quilty and his entourage are also staying (“At the Bed-D-By Motel”). Lolita teases Humbert about them having to share a bed. Quilty calls their room and torments Humbert. Humbert tells Lolita that she can do anything she wants and that he will give her anything she wants (“Tell Me, Tell Me”). In the middle of the night, after they have had sex, Humbert recounts that Lolita had had sex with a boy at camp, which lessened his guilt. She calls him disgusting, and threatens to call her mother and tell her what they've done. Finally, he tells her that Charlotte is dead, and she accuses him of lying to Charlotte to get to her. Ultimately, she makes him promise that he will never leave her. The two of them relocate to Beardsley School for Girls, where Humbert gets a teaching job and Lolita attends the 8th grade (Buckin’ for Beardsley/Beardsley School for Girls”). Lolita is angry with Humbert for not allowing her to star in the school play. The Headmistress meets with Humbert to express her concerns about Lolita: that she has not been properly educated about sex, and needs more social interaction with her peers. She presents Humbert with an ultimatum: either he and Lolita attend group therapy, or he allows Lolita to participate in the school play written by Quilty. Humbert agrees to the latter. During rehearsal, Quilty meets Lolita and becomes fascinated with her; he admits that his uncle, a dentist and friend of Charlotte's, told him she was at school. Quilty decides to break off his relationship with his partner after meeting Lolita (“March Out of My Life”). Meanwhile, Humbert has become increasingly paranoid about Lolita's absence from home, and confronts her (“The Same Old Song (Reprise)”). Lolita protests innocence, and her friend Phyllis corroborates her story, but Humbert doesn't believe her. Lolita accuses Humbert of keeping her locked up under the guise of loving her (“All You Can Do Is Tell Me You Love Me”). Humbert realizes that the two of them have to get away. Lolita does not want them to fight anymore, and asks for them to leave that night and take a road trip, as long as she can choose the stops along the way (“How Far Is It to the Next Town?”). During this sequence, the two of them travel across the country, but are ruthlessly pursued by a mysterious red Mercedes. At each stop, Humbert grows increasingly suspicious of Lolita's disappearance and the persistence of the red car. Finally, Lolita disappears completely, leaving Humbert distraught. He searches for her for over 2 years, but finds no trace of her; he wants nothing more than to have her back (“Lolita”). Finally, he runs into Phyllis, who tells him that Lolita ran off with Quilty. He is outraged and arrives at Quilty's house (which brings us back to the beginning of Act I) and shoots him. Then, he arrives at Lolita's house to find her married and pregnant. He begs her to come with him and she refuses. He gives her $15,000 for her and her husband to relocate to Alaska. The police arrive and arrest Humbert for killing Quilty. He reflects that, above all else, he wants her to be happy, and wonders if, only now, he loves her for the first time. The show Like the novel, Lolita, My Love focused on a European-born professor, Humbert Humbert, who lives in the U.S.; he foolishly falls in love with his landlady's teenaged daughter. While the plot is unpleasant, Humbert eventually emerges as a near-tragic figure, and there is much witty explication of the American culture that both encourages and condemns such behavior. While the show was not officially recorded, a recording from the theater sound board surfaced in 1987, and was released on the Blue Pear Records label (BP 1009). A track listing on the recording gives the following list of songs:Available at the John Barry Resource website # Overture # Going, Going, Gone - Quilty and Guests # The Same Old Song - Lolita & Charlotte # Saturday - Lolita # In the Broken Promise Land of 15 - Humbert # The Same Old Song (Reprise) - Humbert, Lolita, Charlotte # Dante, Petrarch and Poe - Humbert, Charlotte, Ensemble # Sur Les Quais - Charlotte # Charlotte's Letter - Humbert & Charlotte # Farewell, Little Dream - Humbert # At the Bed- D-By Motel - Ensemble # Tell Me, Tell Me - Humbert # Buckin' for Beardsley/Beardsley School for Girls - Ensemble # March Out of My Life - Quilty # The Same Old Song (Reprise); Lolita # All You Can Do Is Tell Me You Love Me - Lolita # How Far Is It to the Next Town - Lolita & Humbert # How Far is It to the Next Town (Reprise) - Quilty & Humbert # Lolita - Humbert # Finale \\"Going, Going, Gone\\" was recorded by Shirley Bassey, and \\"In the Broken-Promise Land of Fifteen\\" has been recorded several times, notably by Robert Goulet. Reactions In refusing many previous offers to adapt the novel, Nabokov insisted that the distasteful plot was acceptable because it existed only in his head; to make a real twelve-year-old girl play the part, on stage night after night, \\"would be sinful and immoral.\\" The skeletal plot alone, without Nabokov's authorial voice, is indeed quite salacious, and critics and audiences reacted negatively to it. Subsequent writers (notably Ken Mandelbaum and Frank RichRich, Frank. The Hot Seat. New York: Random House, 1998.) have found elements of the show worthy of praise, with Mandelbaum contending that it is unlikely anyone could produce a better musical version of what is probably fundamentally impossible material. In 1982, a non-musical adaptation of Lolita by Edward Albee opened to memorably negative reviews, and many critics specifically pointed out ways in which this version was lacking when compared to the earlier musical; Rich contended that Albee's version had a hideous set, pointing out that even the \\"flop musical version...got the scenery right.\\" See also *Edward Albee's Lolita (play) *Rodion Shchedrin's Lolita (opera) References External links * New York Public Library Blog on Lolita, My Love Category:1971 musicals Category:Musicals by John Barry (composer) Category:Musicals by Alan Jay Lerner Category:Juvenile sexuality in music ","title":"Lolita, My Love"},{"id":"5808078","text":"Rudravathi is a panchayat town in Tirupur district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

As the territory was so extensive, the population very numerous and the difficulties of visitation too great, the Bishop petitioned the Holy See to divide the diocese. This was done by a decree of Leo XIII on June 20, 1900. The northern half was erected into a new Diocese of Ibagué, suffragan of Bogotá, while the southern half formed the new Diocese of Garzon.

Background Mujib's presidency In the 1970 Pakistani general election, Sheikh Mujib's party, the Awami League (previously known as the Awami Muslim League), won the majority of the seats in the Pakistani National Assembly. They won 167 of the 169 seats in East Pakistan, which would later become Bangladesh after it seceded from West Pakistan. Despite Pakistan's military government delaying the handover of power, Mujib's house had become the de facto head of government in East Pakistan by March. At the start of the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, he was arrested in his home by Pakistani soldiers. Later that year the provisional government of the Bangladeshi rebellion, the Mujibnagar Government, formed on 10 April and made Mujib its head and also the leader of Bangladeshi armed forces. Following the defeat of Pakistani forces on 16 December 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from custody from Pakistan in London on 22 December 1971 and flew to India followed by Bangladesh. Mujib led the government as Prime Minister of Bangladesh for three years after Bangladesh gained independence. Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini controversy and outrage in Army Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini or JRB was a highly controversial political militia formed in 1972 and was loyal to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Although it was set up to recover weapons from civilians, it did serve to protect Mujib's government from being overthrown. Its 30,000 workers intimidated and tortured the Awami League opponents in various ways. In the 1965-6 budget, the Mujib government increased the allocation for the Rakshi Bahini to 13%, which was 50-60 per cent during the Pakistan period. This dissatisfaction is also considered as one of the reasons for Mujibur's assassination. Allegation of nepotism and corruption within Mujib-family Sheikh Fazlul Haque Mani was given lucrative positions in the Government formed by Sheikh Mujibur. When private trade with India was banned to slow inflation, Fazlul Haque actively engaged in it with Mujibur's blessings. This was seen as an attempt by Mujibur to form a dynasty. Near the end of 1973 Sheikh Kamal was involved in a shootout in which he was inflicted with bullet injuries. Multiple claims have been made as to how the shootout occurred. Many people claim that this shootout occurred during the attempted robbery of a bank by Sheikh Kamal and his friends. However, a retired major general of the Bangladesh Army claimed that it was actually a case of friendly fire. Near the end of 1973, Bangladeshi security forces received intelligence that the left-wing revolutionary activist Siraj Sikder and his insurgents were going to launch coordinated attacks around Dhaka. Police and other security officers were on full alert and patrolling the streets of Dhaka in plainclothes. Sheikh Kamal and his friends were armed and also patrolling the city in a microbus looking for Siraj Sikder. When the microbus was in Dhanmondi the police mistook Sheikh Kamal and his friends to be insurgents and opened fire on them, thus injuring Sheikh Kamal. However, it is also claimed that Sheikh Kamal and his friends were in Dhanmondi to test drive a new car that his friend Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku had bought recently. Since Dhaka was under heavy police patrolling, police special forces under the command of the then city SP Mahamuddin Bir Bikrom opened fire on the car thinking that the passengers were miscreants. Left-wing insurgency A left-wing insurgency from 1972 to 1975 is widely held responsible for creating the conditions that led up to the assassination. In 1972, a leftist group named the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) was founded from a split in the Bangladesh Chhatra League, the student wing of the Bangladesh Awami League. The JSD, through its armed wing Gonobahini led by Colonel Abu Taher and politician Hasanul Haq Inu, began a political massacre of government supporters, Awami League members, and police. Their campaign contributed to a breakdown of law and order in the country and paved the way for the assassination of Mujib. Hasanul Huq Inu later held the office of the Minister of Information under Sheikh Hasina's Second and Third cabinets. Dalim-Mostafa conflict In 1974, Gazi Golam Mostafa kidnapped Major Shariful Haque Dalim and his wife from the Dhaka Ladies Club after an argument. It was Dalim's cousin's wedding reception in the Dhaka Ladies Club. Dalim's only brother-in-law Bappi (his wife Nimmi's brother) was attending from Canada. Mostafa's son occupied the chair in the row behind Bappi and pulled Bappi's hair from the back. Bappi scolded the boy for his behavior and told him not to sit on the row behind him anymore. Mostafa's sons (who were close friends of Sheikh Kamal) and some associates forcefully abducted Dalim, Nimmi, the groom's mother, and two of Dalim's friends (both of whom were distinguished freedom fighters) in Microbuses owned by the Red Crescent. Mostafa was taking them to the Rakhi Bahini headquarters but later took them to the residence of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Mujib mediated a compromise between them and made Mostafa apologize to Nimmi. When news of the abduction spread, the 1st Bengal Lancers ransacked Mostafa's and took his whole family prisoner. They also set up check posts all over the city searching for Major Dalim and the abductees. Some officers lost their jobs as a result. The officers involved, including Shariful Haque Dalim, were later orchestrators of the coup on 15 August 1975 and the assassination of Sheikh Mujib. Death of Siraj Sikder In 1975, contemporary leading Bangladeshi maoist leader, Siraj Sikder was arrested at Hali Shahr in Chittagong by the intelligence force of the government. He was killed in police custody on 3 January 1975 on his way from Dhaka Airport to the Rakkhi Bahini Camp at Savar. Anthony Mascarenhas narrated in his book \\"Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood\\" that, Siraj's sister Shamim Sikder blamed Mujib for the killing of his brother. Corruption, malfunction and BAKSAL Sheikh Mujib was later elected President of Bangladesh and established a national unity government, the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League (BAKSAL), on 7 June 1975 by banning all political parties and independent press. Mujib named the reform as Second Revolution. Although the BAKSAL was intended to bring stability to Bangladesh and uphold law and order, it engendered hostility among the bureaucracy, military, and civil society. Opposition groups, as well as some of Mujib's supporters, challenged Mujib's authoritarian, one-party state. The period of the BAKSAL's one-party rule was marked by widespread censorship and abuse of the judiciary, as well as opposition from the general populace, intellectuals, and all other political groups. The country was in chaos: corruption was rampant, and food shortages and poor distribution led to a disastrous famine. Nationalization of industry failed to yield any tangible progress. Not only was the government weak and with no clear goals, but the country was also nearly bankrupt. In the Far Eastern Economic Review, journalist Lawrence Lifschultz wrote in 1974 that \\"the corruption and malpractices and plunder of national wealth\\" in Bangladesh were \\"unprecedented\\".  Party-partiality against rape-murder case  The army was already dissatisfied with Sheikh Mujib for discriminating them with JRB. However, Anthony Mascarenhas wrote in his book Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood that, he cited a specific factor behind the final outcry as influential: Mozammel, a contemporary Awami League youth leader from Tongi and the chairman of Tongi Awami League, seized a car of a newlywed housewife, killed her driver and husband, abducted her and gang-raped her and three days later, her deadbody was found in the road near a bridge of Tongi. Mozammel was arrested by a leader of a squadron of the Bengal Lancer named Major Nasser and handed over to the police, but police released him immediately. At that time, many people thought that he was released from the punishment of that crime only with the intervention of Sheikh Mujib. This incident increased the dissatisfaction against Sheikh Mujib in the Army, specially in Major Faruque and acted as one of the prominently last-minute influences behind his assassination. Conspirators Major Syed Faruque Rahman; Khandaker Abdur Rashid; Shariful Haque Dalim; Mohiuddin Ahmed; and Rashed Chowdhury, along with A.K.M. Mohiuddin Ahmed, Bazlul Huda, and S.H.M.B Noor Chowdhury (three majors in the Bangladesh Army and veterans of the Bangladesh Liberation War), planned to topple the government and establish a military government of their own. They were previously part of the opposition to BAKSAL and viewed the government as too subservient to India and a threat to Bangladesh's military. According to Anthony Mascarenhas, Faruque offered Major Ziaur Rahman indirectly to take part in the plan and tried to convince him, but Zia cleverly avoided the matter. According to Farooq, Zia's gesture meant: \\"I'm sorry, I don't want to get involved in this. If you junior officers want to do something, you should do it yourself. Don't drag me into this.\\" However, the killer Lt. Col. Khandaker Abdur Rashid's wife and accused Jobaida Rashid said in his deposition, \\"Criticism was happened among Army officers for providing more facilities by forming Rakkhi Bahini besides the army. I hear these things from Farooq. Major Farooq has been in touch with General Zia since childhood. He was Zia's former acquaintance. One night Major Farooq returned from Zia's house and told my husband that Zia wanted to be president if the government changed. Zia said, \\"It is a success to come to me. If it is a failure then do not involve me. It is not possible to change the government by keeping Sheikh Mujib alive.” Major General (retd) M Khalilur Rahman (then director of BDR) testified, \\"Some army officers became divided as General Safiullah was not made the army chief despite being a senior on the basis of General Zia's number. I have heard that General Zia will retire from the army and be sent abroad as an ambassador.\\" At one point after the swearing in of the cabinet, Major Rashid introduced me to his wife. I thought Major Rashid was a little proud and said, “She is my wife. My wife is the mastermind behind what we have done.\\" The assassins considered the possible causes of the failure, and for the upcoming after-period after Mujib's assassination, they decided to use a well-wisher from Mujib's Awami League and a person who could be removed in time if desired, in order to curb the possible Indian intervention, the Awami League's vengeful armed opposition, the possible increasing arbitrariness of the anti-Awami League and to temporarily control the situation. After some time of searching, an Awami League cabinet minister under Mujib's government, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, agreed to take over the presidency. Journalist Lawrence Lifschultz paints an alternate picture of the conspiracy, however, that implicates Mostaq and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In his book Bangladesh: The Unfinished Revolution, he wrote that the \\"CIA station chief in Dhaka, Philip Cherry, was actively involved in the killing of the Father of the Nation—Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\\"Long shadow of the August 1975 coup. Daily Sun, 14 August 2015.The past is never dead - The long shadow of the August 1975 coup. By Lawrence Lifschultz. The Daily Star, vol. 5 # 434, 15 August 2005. It is alleged that the Chief of Army Staff, Major General Kazi Mohammed Shafiullah, and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence Air Vice Marshal, Aminul Islam Khan, were aware of the conspiracy.Ziaur Rahman informed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman earlier about coup threat Major Faruque told Anthony Mascarenhas that he carried out the assassination following the direction of Andha Hafiz, a blind saint from Chittagong who was known having supernatural powers and his wife Farida helped him communicate with the saint. The saint entitled as a pir told him to carry out the killing in the interest of Islam, advised him to abandon personal interests and carry out the killing at the right time. However, Andha Hafiz later denied the claim in an interview with the weekly Bichinta. Events Assassination In the early hours of 15 August 1975, the conspirators divided into four groups. One group, consisting of members of the Bengal Lancers of the First Armoured Division and 535th Infantry Division under Major Huda, attacked Mujib's residence.: \\"According to foreign journalists, the operation started at 12.30 A.M. ... divided into four groups. The first group rolled towards Mujib's residence ... The first group was formed with selected soldiers from the Bengal Lancers of the First Armoured Division and 535 Infantry Regiment. It was put under Major Huda. \\" Correspondent for Anandabazar Patrika Sukharanjan Dasgupta, who described the Bangladesh Liberation War in Dhaka until 1974, writes in his book Midnight Massacre in Dacca that \\"the exact details of the massacre will always remain shrouded in mystery.\\" He goes on to say, however, that the army platoon protecting the president's house offered no resistance. Sheikh Kamal, son of Mujib, was shot at the reception area on the ground floor.: \\"[soldiers] quickly surrounded Mujib's residence. A couple of rounds were fired. No resistance came from the army platoon guarding the President's house ... The first round of fire had brought Sheikh Kamal hurrying down to the reception on the ground floor ... A short burst, and his body, riddled with bullets sank to the floor.\\" Meanwhile, Mujib was asked to resign and allowed time to consider his choice. He telephoned Colonel Jamil Uddin Ahmad, the new Chief of Military Intelligence. When Jamil arrived and ordered the troops back to the barracks, he was gunned down at the gate of the residence. After he refused to resign, Mujib was shot and killed.: \\"Reports reveal that they did not kill Sheikh Mujib at once. Mujib was asked to step down from power and he was given some time to decide. Mujib summoned Colonel Jamil, the new chief of the Military Intelligence over the phone. Colonel Jamil arrived fast and ordered the army to return to the barracks ... Then a rapid burst from machine guns mowed down Jamil right in front of the gate.\\" Other people killed in the attack were Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib, wife of Mujib, who was killed upstairs; Sheikh Nasser, younger brother of Mujib, who was killed in a lavatory; several servants of Mujib, who were also killed in lavatories; Sheikh Jamal, the second son of Mujib and an army officer; ten-year-old Sheikh Russel, the youngest son of Mujib; and two daughters-in-law of Mujib.: \\"The murderers rushed upstairs ... they came across Begum Lutfunnessa Mujib ... Shots rang out again. Begum Mujib lay on the floor, dead ... A group searched the ground floor. In the lavatories, they found Sheikh Nasser and a couple of servants and gunned them down. The other group charged into Mujib's bedroom. There they found the two daughters-in-law of Mujib along with Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Russel ... they, too, were not spared by these butchers.\\" In Dhanmondi, two other groups of soldiers killed Sheikh Fazlul Haque Mani, Mujib's nephew and a leader of the Awami League along with his pregnant wife, Arzu Moni, and Abdur Rab Serniabat, Mujib's brother-in-law. They also killed a minister of the government and thirteen of his family members on Mintu Road.: \\"Lieutenant Moalemuddin sped for the residence of Sheikh Mani with three trucks full of soldiers ... while Major Shahriar and Captain Huda went out with some soldiers to get rid of Minister Abdur Rab Sarniabat.\\": \\"At the same time at 13/1 Dhanmandi Sheikh Fazlul Haq and his pregnant wife, and on Mineta Road, Abdur Rab Sarniabat with the 13 members of his family, were butchered ...\\" The fourth and most powerful group was sent towards Savar to repel the expected counter-attack by the security forces stationed there. After a brief fight and the loss of eleven men, the security forces surrendered.: \\"[The] fourth group, the most powerful of the lot, proceeded towards Savar, near Dacca, to repel the anticipated counter-attack by the Security Forces. It did run against some resistance at Savar. But once the shelling took toll of eleven people, the leaderless Security Force surrendered\\" Four of the founding leaders of the Awami League, first Prime Minister of Bangladesh Tajuddin Ahmed, former Prime Minister Mansur Ali, former Vice President Syed Nazrul Islam, and former Home Minister A. H. M. Qamaruzzaman, were arrested. Three months later, on 3 November 1975, they were murdered in Dhaka Central Jail.: \\"3 November ... Khondakar also knew that the situation was bound to be grave once Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, Kamaruzzaman and Mansur Ali were released ... Khondakar had had them arrested under various pretexts shortly after Mujib's assassination, and they were still rotting in Dacca Jail. So, Khondakar ... managed to allow the associates of the \\"killers\\" [the seven Majors who assassinated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman] inside the jail to brutally kill these four leaders.\\" Aftermath of assassination On the morning of the assassination, the then Lieutenant Colonel Amin Ahmed Chowdhury entered the house of General Ziaur Rahman and found out on the radio that President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had been assassinated,He described the incident, \\"General Zia is shaving on one side but not on the other. Came running in the sleeping suit, he asked Shafaat Jamil, \\"What happened, Shafaat?\\" Shafaat replied, \\"Apparently two battalions staged a coup. We don't know yet what happened outside. We hear the announcement on the radio that the president is dead.\\" Then General Zia said, \\"So what? Let vice-president take over. We have nothing to do with politics. Get your troops ready. Uphold the constitution.\\" Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad assumed the presidency, and Major General Ziaur Rahman became the new Chief of Army Staff. The leading conspirators were all given high government ranks. They were all later toppled by yet another coup led by Brigadier General Khaled Mosharraf on 3 November 1975. Mosharraf himself was killed during a counter-revolt four days later on 7 November, which freed Major General Ziaur Rahman in power and was brought in to bring law and order. Major Syed Faruque Rahman, Rashid, and the other army officers were promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Nevertheless, they were exiled to Libya, China, Rhodesia, Canada, and other countries, although they were given several diplomatic posts in Bangladeshi missions abroad. Lieutenant Colonel (Rtd.) Syed Faruque Rahman later returned and founded the Bangladesh Freedom Party in 1985 and took part in the presidential election in 1987 against the military ruler Lieutenant General Hussain Mohammad Ershad but lost that election in a landslide. Mujib's two daughters, Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, were in West Germany at the time of his assassination. After the coup, they flew back to India, instead of Bangladesh and took refuge with the Indian government. Sheikh Hasina lived in New Delhi in a self-imposed exile before returning to Bangladesh on 17 May 1981. Trial The military decided not to court-martial the military officers who masterminded and participated in the coup. A. F. M. Mohitul Islam, personal assistant to Sheikh Mujib and a survivor of the attack on his house, attempted to file a case against the military officers, but the police slapped him in the face and refused to file the report. The assassination conspirators could not be tried in a court of law because of the Indemnity Act passed by the government under President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad. When the Awami League, led by Mujib's daughter Sheikh Hasina, won elections in 1996, the act was repealed. The Bangabandhu murder trial began with the case filing by A. F. M. Mohitul Islam. Colonel (Rtd.) Syed Faruque Rahman was arrested from his Dhaka home, and Colonel (Rtd.) Bazlul Huda was brought back from Bangkok, where he was serving a prison sentence for shoplifting as part of a criminal exchange program between Thailand and Bangladesh. Lieutenant Colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed was in active military service when he was arrested. Colonel (Rtd.) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan had been appointed to active diplomatic service by previous Prime Minister of Bangladesh Begum Khaleda Zia, but he returned to Bangladesh and was arrested when he was recalled by the foreign ministry. Colonel (Rtd.) Abdur Rashid and other accused individuals had already left Bangladesh, however. They believed that the upcoming 1996 general election would be an Awami League victory, which would result in the repealing of the Indemnity Act and their subsequent arrest. Colonel (Rtd.) Rashid now reportedly shuttles between Pakistan and Libya. All these men were also involved in Jail Killing Day on 3 November 1975, when four Awami League officials were assassinated. The first trial ended on 8 November 1998. The District and Session Judge of Dhaka, Mohammad Golam Rasul, ordered the death sentence by firing squad to fifteen out of the twenty accused of conspiring in the assassination. The sentences were not carried out immediately, because five of the convicts sought to file appeals in the high court division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. The Supreme Court, consisting of Justice Mohammad Ruhul Amin and Justice A. B. M. Khairul Haque, who was the former Chief Justice of Bangladesh, gave a divisive verdict. Senior Justice Amin acquitted five out of the original fifteen accused, whereas Junior Justice Haque upheld the lower court's verdict. A verdict from a third judge became necessary. Later, Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim condemned twelve out of original fifteen, including two acquitted in Justice Amin's verdict. One of the convicts, Major (Rtd.) Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe on 2 June 2001.6 killers still out of reach Although the five accused appealed to the appellate division of the Supreme Court, their decision remained pending from August 2001. Several judges refused to hear the case, which meant the government lacked the three judges required to hold a hearing session. On 18 June 2007, one of the conspirators who had been sentenced to death, Major (Rtd.) A. K. M. Mohiuddin Ahmed was extradited to Bangladesh from the United States following a series of failed attempts to gain asylum or permanent residency in the United States. On 7 August 2007, the murder case hearings resumed after a six-year delay. The appellate division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh gave its verdict on 19 November 2009,Major Md. Bazlul Huda (Artillery) & Ors. vs. The State, Criminal Appeal Nos. 55–59 of 2007 after a five-member special bench, headed by Justice Mahammad Tafazzal Islam, spent 29 days hearing the petition filed by the convicted. The appeal of the convicts was rejected, and the death sentence was upheld. Before the verdict, approximately 12,000 extra policemen were deployed to guard strategic buildings, including the Supreme Court building, to prevent disruption of the proceedings by the convicted men's supporters. Nevertheless, they were blamed by the government for a grenade attack on one of the prosecution lawyers in October 2009, although no one has been charged yet. Captain (Rtd.) Qismet Hashem, Captain (Rtd.) Nazmul Hossain Ansar, and Major (Rtd.) Abdul Majid were acquitted through the high court division and appellate division verdicts and now live in Canada. Taheruddin Thakur, former Information Minister and one of the suspects, was cleared during the Hasina Government, acquitted in trial, and released. He died naturally in 2009. Conspirators Major (Rtd.) Bazlul Huda, Lieutenant Colonel (Rtd.) Mohiuddin Ahmed, Major (Rtd.) A. K. M. Mohiuddin Ahmed, Colonel (Rtd.) Syed Faruque Rahman, and Colonel (Rtd.) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan was executed on 28 January 2010. On 11 April 2020 Abdul Majed was executed by hanging. He had returned to Bangladesh the previous month after being a fugitive for 23 years.

Demographics , the India census showed Sahanpur had a population of 18,349. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Sahanpur has an average literacy rate of 37%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 42%, and female literacy is 32%. In Sahanpur, 21% of the population is under 6 years of age. History The Sahanpur was a Jat state of Kakran clan of Hindu Jat which claim its descent from lord Rama. To quote the 1908 District Gazetteer's report, \\"The Sahanpur family is said to-have been founded by one Nahra Singh, a Jat of Ramraipur, near Jhind, in the Punjab. His son, Basru Singh, left the ancestral home in 1600 and settled at Bahadurgarh in the neighbourhood of Dehli. Tegh Singh or Padarath, the youngest son of Basru Singh, gained the favour of Jahangir, and obtained in 1603 the grant of 660 villages in the parganas of Jalalabad, Kiratpur and Mandawar, together with the title of Rai, which is to this day held by the family as an hereditary distinction. Proceeding to his jagir, with several members of his family, he founded Nagal in 1604, and two years later built the fort of Sahanpur. Another version of the story is that the Jats migrated hither on the overthrow of the Suris by Humayun, and that Padarath won his estate as a reward. for his services to Jahangir during a hunting expedition in the vicinity of Hardwar. Padarath died in 1631, and was succeeded by Rai Bhim Chand, the second of his five sons. This man died without issue, and the estate passed to Nathai Singh, the son of his youngest brother. He was followed by his brother, Rai Sabal Singh, who gave his name to the fortress of Sabalgarh, and left three sons; the first two predeceased their father, and the property passed to Rajaram Mahabali. The latter had two sons, of whom Tara Chand succeeded, but on his death in 1753, the estate was taken by his brother, Sabba Chand, instead of devolving on his son Jaswant Singh, who had no children, and was succeeded by Rai Ram Das, the eldest,son of Sabba Chand. He again left no issue, having been killed in the year of his accession in a fight with the Pathans while defending Sahanpur. The next incumbent was his brother, Rai Basu Chand, who held the estate for eleven years and died in 1796. His elder son, Khem Chand, was murdered two years later, and the younger, Tapraj Singh, came into possession, holding the estate when Bijnor was ceded to the British, and retaining it till his death in 1817. Once again the eldest son, Rai Jahan Singh, met with a violent death, being killed in an affray with dacoits in 1828, and the property passed to the youngest brother, Rai Himmat Singh, who continued to hold Sahanpur for 45 years, dying in 1873. The elder son of Himmat Singh was Rai Umrao Singh, who died in 1882, and then the property was taken under the Court of Wards during the incumbency of his brother, Rai Dal Chand. It was released on his death in 1897, and made over to his eldest son, Rai Partab Singh who died in 1902, leaving a minor son, Rai Datt Prasad Singh, otherwise known as Aftab Jang. The property is managed by his uncle, Kunwar Bharat Singh, the present actual head of the family. It consists of 90 villages in pargana Najibabad, 35 in Kiratpur, 18 in Akbarabad, 20 shares in Mandawar and one in Bashta, with a total revenue demand of Rs. 51,935. \\" Kunwar Bharat Singh had three sons. Kunwar Charat Singh, Kunwar Preyatam Jung Singh and Kunwar Giriraj Singh. Kunwar Charat Singh had a son, Kunwar Devendra Singh, and two daughters, Pushp Lata Kumari, who married Raja Bhalender Singh of Patiala and the second daughter Kusum Kumari who married Sardar Mohkam Singh, a civil engineer by profession and the son of Rai Bahadur Sardar Baisakha Singh, a Lutyens Delhi contractor and prominent businessman. Kunwar Giriraj Singh had two sons, Kunwar Shashi Raj Singh and Kunwar Ravi Raj Singh. Kunwar Devendra Singh had a son, Kunwar Bhartendra Singh, who was a member of parliament from Bijnor district.

Biography We know little or nothing definite of his early days. According to the most probable tradition he was enabled through the influence he had with King Yazdgerd I, to restore the Catholicate (patriarchate) of Seleucia, which had been vacant for twenty-two years. Another account says he was chosen to replace a certain Qayom, who had been deposed by his fellow-bishops for incapacity. Isaac's great work was the organizing of the Council of Seleucia, the equivalent for the Eastern Syrian Church of the First Council of Nicaea. The Persian bishops met under the express orders of the monarch at the capital of the Sassanide kingdom. Isaac presided, in concert with Maruthas of Martyropolis, whom the \\"Western Fathers\\", i.e., the bishops of the Syrian Province of Antioch, had delegated to assist in the reorganization of the Christian religion in Persia. Two Persian nobles and the Grand Vizier, who represented the king at this important assembly, promulgated a decree authorizing the Christians to practice their religion and to construct churches. They recognized Isaac, the Catholicos of Seleucia, as the sole official head of the Persian Christians, and declared that the secular arm would repress all who were insubordinate to him. Shortly after this great success, which assured the unification and the stability of the Persian Church, Isaac died in 410.

These polymeric molecules are usually copies of an entire genome linked end to end and separated by cos sites (a protein binding nucleotide sequence that occurs once in each copy of the genome). Concatemers are frequently the result of rolling circle replication, and may be seen in the late stage of bacterial infection by phages. As an example, if the genes in the phage DNA are arranged ABC, then in a concatemer the genes would be ABCABCABCABC and so on (assuming synthesis was initiated between genes C and A). They are further broken by ribozymes. During active infection, some species of viruses have been shown to replicate their genetic material via the formation of concatemers. In the case of human herpesvirus-6, its entire genome is made over and over on a single strand. These long concatemers are subsequently cleaved between the pac-1 and pac-2 regions by ribozymes when the genome is packaged into individual virions. Bacteriophage T4 replicating DNA was labeled with tritiated thymidine and examined by autoradiography. The observed DNA replication intermediates included circular and branched circular concatemeric structures that likely arose by rolling circle replication.

Village issues In recent years, Saligão, which is just outside the North Goa beach-belt, has seen significant concerns over the large-scale sale of ground-water from a number of wells in the village, particularly at Donvaddo. There has also been concern raised by villagers over the dumping of garbage from the coastal belt on the hillock atop the village, partly on village lands and partly on land belonging to the Calangute comunidade but very close (and overlooking) the village. On 12 December 2002, a writ petition was filed over this issue in the Goa bench of the High Court of Bombay. The petition challenged the selection of a garbage disposal site on the top of Saligão plateau, in the midst of a social forest plantation raised by the Goa government's Forest Department. It argued that the decision to locate the disposal site in this \\"inappropriate area\\" was made without following the procedures established by law, particularly the provision of Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2000 issued under provisions of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. \\"The location is bound to have grievous consequences for the environment, health and water supplies,\\" the petition filed by green lawyer Norma Alvares of the Goa Foundation argued. On the groundwater issue, in May 2002, a study titled \\"Saligao's water crisis and commercial groundwater extraction\\" was released. Its summary said: \\"Extraction of groundwater for commercial sale outside the village has risen sharply in the last five years, to a level of up to 435,000 litres per day. Groundwater levels are falling, and wells for household use and for irrigating farmland are running dry in some parts of Saligao, although other parts of the village are unaffected. The problem is very serious for household wells in Don Vaddo and parts of Sonarbhat, and for farmers in Mollembhat. Enough consumers are suffering serious problems to merit the SCCC (Saligao Civic and Consumers' Cell) taking up commercial groundwater extraction as a community issue.\\" It noted that more than half of 28 household wells surveyed in Don Vaddo and Sonarbhat went dry in April/May 2001, a normal monsoon year. At least 138 consumers depend on these wells. Falling water levels in this area have coincided with a very rapid increase in commercial extraction from the local well.

Roosevelt Bayley, Archbishop of Baltimore, for the protection and promotion of Catholic mission interests among Native Americans in the United States. History In 1872, the Catholic bishops of Oregon and Washington Territory sent Father Jean-Baptiste Brouillet to Washington as their representative to settle claims against the United States. However, the effort grew quickly to represent all U.S. Catholic dioceses with claims related to past mission work among Native Americans. Late in the following year, Archbishop Bayley appointed General Charles Ewing as Catholic Commissioner of Indian Missions to represent the dioceses, which was an appointment Brouillet and the Northwest bishops had requested nine years earlier. Prominent among the Catholic claims were the allotment of only seven Indian reservations under the Peace Policy of President Ulysses S. Grant. Based on the past work by Catholic missionaries among those tribes, the Catholic dioceses had expected allotments to 38 of the 73 reservations. Beginning in 1869, Grant had crafted a policy of close church-state collaboration through the Board of Indian Commissioners as a means to maintain peace with the tribes and to fight the corruption in government that was rampant within the Office of Indian Affairs. In force to 1881, the policy's implementation gave Catholic missionaries exclusive religious domain to the reservations allotted to the Catholic Church, but also denied Native American Catholics on other reservations their freedom of religion to attend local Catholic churches and schools.Francis Paul Prucha. American Indian Policy in Crisis, Christian Reformers and the Indian, 1865-1900, , 30-71. While addressing the Catholic mission concerns with the government, the new Office of Catholic Commissioner also built its support within the Catholic Church. It solicited aid from the bishops and laity through various appeals and through allied fundraising organizations, such as the Catholic Indian Missionary Association. The weak initial responses prompted James McMaster, editor of the New York Freeman's Journal and Catholic Register, to call for the Office’s closure, which in 1879, led to its reorganizing and renaming as the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions. Meanwhile, in June that year, the Sacred Congregation of the Propaganda of the Holy See approved of the Catholic Bureau, and in 1884, the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore confirmed it and added a board of directors composed of bishops. The council also created a Lenten collection for Native American and African American missions under a Commission for the Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians with responsibilities to support the missions and the Catholic Bureau.Peter J. Rahill. The Catholic Indian Missions and Grant's Peace Policy, 1870-1884 (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 1953), 42-220; The Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions, 1874 to 1895 (Washington, D.C.: The Church News Publishing Co., 1895), 16-20. While the Peace Policy remained in force, the government collaborated with Christian organizations to provide schools for Native Americans. As needed, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs approved annual contracts with religious organizations, which provided school personnel and buildings, while the government provided financial support for the tuition and boarding expenses. Under this system, the Catholic Bureau successfully expanded the number of Catholic schools for Native Americans from three with $7,000 in government contracts in 1873 to 38 with $395,000 in contracts 20 years later. This alarmed the Indian Rights Association and its supporters, who saw the Catholic native schools as part of the overall growth of U.S. Catholic schools and a threat to the culture of the United States and the principle of the separation of church and state. Consequently, they supported a national school system plan for Native American children put forth in 1889 by Thomas Jefferson Morgan, which he began to implement the following year when he took office as Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Morgan’s plan did not allow for the creation of new contracts with religiously-affiliated schools and it called for the gradual phasing out of the existing ones. Committed to saving the contract-dependent Catholic schools, Catholic Bureau director Father Joseph Stephan achieved some success in bypassing the Office of Indian Affairs and securing direct appropriations from the United States Congress. However, he encountered substantial opposition, which he believed was orchestrated by Morgan. Relations between them deteriorated, and in July 1891, Morgan severed all relations with the Catholic Bureau, which continued until Morgan left office two years later. Nonetheless, Morgan’s school plan remained and Congress phased out most contracts with religious schools from 1896 to 1900, which caused a number of the Catholic schools to close.Francis Paul Prucha. The Churches and the Indian Schools, 1888-1912, , 10-25. The Catholic Bureau led the effort to save as many of the now over 50 Catholic schools as possible. It promoted in-church appeals from bishops and missionaries; it launched a fundraising support organization called the Society for the Preservation of the Faith among Indian Children coupled with The Indian Sentinel magazine as a membership benefit; and it collaborated with other allied fundraising groups, such as the Marquette League. These efforts and those of the Lenten collection proved helpful. However, the bulk of the support that materialized came from Katharine Drexel, who saved many schools by donating over $100,000 per year and supplying school personnel through the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament. In 1896, Commissioner of Indian Affairs Daniel M. Browning reasoned that, since the government regarded native people as its wards, the Indian Office, and not the parents of Native American children, should decide which schools the children should attend. However, Catholic Bureau director Father William Ketcham notified President William McKinley that this practice violated the educational rights of parents and McKinley ordered the ruling rescinded in 1901. In 1900, and again in 1904, the Catholic Bureau applied to use trust assets from certain tribes to educate some of their children in Catholic schools. In 1900, the Indian Office rejected the applications when opponents criticized this apparent breach of the separation of church and state. However, in 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt decided that with Native American approval, trust assets could be used for private schools and the Indian Office issued contracts to the Catholic Bureau for eight schools. When Congress denied legal prohibitions, the Indian Rights Association and its supporters brought suit against Indian Affairs Commissioner Francis E. Leupp in a case known as Quick Bear v. Leupp. Following the federal appeals system, the Supreme Court ruled on it unanimously in 1908 and found that tribal trust assets were, in fact, private and not public funds that Native Americans could spend as they wished. Consequently, from trust assets, Native American parents paid Catholic schools over $100,000 in tuition over the next 50 years.Francis Paul Prucha. The Churches and the Indian Schools, 1888-1912, , 57-64, 84-134; William T. Hagan. Theodore Roosevelt and Six Friends of the Indians (Norman Okla.: University of Oklahoma Press, 1997), 81-83, 172-74, 197-206. In 1934, the Indian Reorganization Act generated extensive debate. While critics branded it as communistic and a means to de-Christianize and re-“paganize” native people, the Catholic Bureau applauded it as offering solutions to ill-conceived policies, such as allotment, and saw it as neither communistic nor hostile to Catholic missions and schools. However, the Catholic Bureau feared that its close working relationship with Collier’s Indian Office might revive the specter of anti-Catholic agitation. In a report the following year, it disclosed that 35 Catholic schools on reservations had been receiving annual government contracts. Three years earlier these schools received $188,500 in contracts, and even with the Great Depression, government support decreased just slightly the following year, which was more than offset by emergency government relief secured by the Catholic Bureau.

Because Congress had curtained domestic spending during World War II, appropriations for reservation-based Catholic schools dropped to $153,000 by 1946. However, strong post-war economic growth and active lobbying in Congress by the Catholic Bureau increased the funding for these schools to $289,000 by 1952. Kevin Abing. Directors of the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions, 1994, “Reverend John B. Tennelly, S.S., 1935-1976.” Retrieved June 21, 2010. In 1962, the Catholic Bureau counted 129,000 Native American Catholics served by 394 Catholic mission chapels and 9,200 children served by 54 Catholic schools on or near Indian reservations.The Indian Sentinel 40:3(1962): 33. By the next decade, tuition funding from tribal trust accounts ceased as the accounts became depleted. This prompted several schools to close and caused critical situations for a number of the 47 reservation schools. In response, Catholic Bureau director Monsignor Paul Lenz founded an Association of Catholic Indian Schools, which in June 1983, coordinated plans to maintain the schools through direct mail campaigns, personal appeals and wills of request. After Pope Paul VI restored the permanent deaconate in 1967, the ranks of deacons began to include Native Americans. However, some Native deaconate students had difficulties in adjusting to classroom settings and textbooks. So in 1986, the Catholic Bureau financed a redesigned textbook series titled, Builders of the New Earth: The Formation of Deacons and Lay Ministers by the staff of the Sioux Spiritual Center of the Rapid City diocese. Since then, the series has been reprinted multiple times for the training of Native American deacons in the United States and Canada. In 1977, a U.S. bishops’ statement urged the United States government to develop policies to provide greater justice for Native Americans. Later that year the Catholic Bureau followed by testifying in support of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, which Congress enacted in 1978. Also in 1977, the Catholic Bureau, in cooperation with the Commission for the Catholic Missions among the Colored People and the Indians, began to support the Tekakwitha Conference, which then reorganized from an association of Northern Plains Catholic missionaries into one representing Native American Catholics. Meanwhile, the Catholic Bureau began to promote the canonization cause of its namesake, Kateri Tekakwitha, a 17th-century Mohawk convert. In 1980, the offices of the Catholic Bureau, which have been shared with the Commission since 1935, became known as the Black and Indian Mission office. During the following year, the United States Catholic Conference Ad- Hoc Committee on National Collections attempted to incorporate the Commission’s Black and Indian Mission collection within a consolidated program of national collections administered by the Catholic Conference. This would have ended the independence of the Catholic Bureau as well as the Commission and the Catholic Negro-American Mission Board. Lenz objected and successfully opposed the consolidation as an attack on the interests of black and Native American Catholics. Thereafter he continued to build the collection, which surpassed seven million dollars in 1994. The Catholic Bureau also succeeded in identifying two high achieving priests with Native American ancestry as prospects for the Catholic Church hierarchy. In 1986, the Holy See named Donald E.

Fundraising organizations The Catholic Church used several fundraising organizations to support its mission work worldwide, a number of which, at least in part, supported missions among Native Americans in the United States and collaborated with the Catholic Bureau. Some organizations were created exclusively for this purpose with the Catholic Bureau engaged in their creation. *Catholic Indian Missionary Association (1875–1887) Catholic lay women organized the Association with chapters in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, St. Louis, and other major U.S. cities. Brouillet served as its director-treasurer and Ellen Ewing Sherman served as its principal organizer and fundraiser. Through its Catholic Indian Mission Fund, it raised $48,700 in donations and bequests for the Catholic Bureau and reservation-based Catholic missions and schools. $6,000 was the most raised in a single year and it ceased when the Catholic Bureau succeeded in acquiring government contracts for the Catholic schools.Peter J.

The game was played on Saturday, April 21, 2001 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Western Division champion Los Angeles Xtreme defeated the western runner-up San Francisco Demons 38–6. The game's original name was the \\"Big Game at the End of the Season;\\" it was changed during Week 3 of the regular season due to wordiness and concerns over potential to be genericized. The \\"Million Dollar Game\\" name derived from the pot of one million dollars that would be split among the players of the winning team (with each team having 38 players, each player would receive approximately $26,316 for winning). Background The Orlando Rage had finished the 10-game regular season with the XFL's best record, 8-2. Los Angeles was 7–3 while both San Francisco and the Chicago Enforcers each finished 5–5 (thus Orlando and L.A. were the only two teams out of eight to finish with winning records in the regular season; the Memphis Maniax were also 5-5 but San Francisco won the playoff berth on a tie- breaker). The last game of the regular season ended up serving as the western division championship; had the Demons won that game, they would have won the division on a tiebreaker with both teams at 6–4. Instead, Los Angeles won. The 2001 XFL used a crossover playoff format: each division champion would host the second-place team in the other division (the XFL, as with the National Football League, features each team playing its division rivals twice in the regular season, and thus this format avoided making teams play three times in a season, at least for the first round). The Xtreme defeated Chicago 33-16 in the first round, while the Demons upset Orlando 26–25 in their semifinal. Game synopsis The Xtreme, led by regular-season Most Valuable Player Tommy Maddox, won the Million Dollar Game 38–6. The Xtreme dominated the game and held the Demons scoreless until their third-string quarterback Oteman Sampson (pressed into service after Mike Pawlawski was pulled due to ineffectiveness and backup Pat Barnes suffered an injury) scored a scrambling touchdown in garbage time to avoid the shutout. Bulkema, Will. The only XFL championship was also the worst by SB Nation, February 7, 2019 The game's MVP was Xtreme kicker Jose Cortez. Aftermath The XFL folded shortly after the Game was played. Sparse attendance at the Coliseum was noticeable, as most of the television camera angles would only show close-ups of sections with fans and sideline interviews used distorted camera perspectives shot from near the ground to avoid the camera catching empty seats. A second XFL season would not be played until 2020. After each had been released by National Football League teams earlier in their professional careers, both Maddox and Cortez eventually found themselves back in the NFL. Maddox signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2001. He replaced Kordell Stewart in the 2002 season and led the Steelers into the playoffs. That performance earned NFL Comeback Player of the Year honors. Maddox lost his starting job to Ben Roethlisberger in 2004, and was released in 2006, however still became the first former XFL player to be a part of a Super Bowl champion after the Steelers won Super Bowl XL over the Seattle Seahawks. Cortez went on to become an NFL journeyman for the next five seasons playing two seasons each with the San Francisco 49ers (for whom he scored over 100 points in the 2001 and 2002 NFL seasons) and Minnesota Vikings; his final season in 2005 saw him play for five professional teams as a fill-in for injured kickers, four in the NFL and one in the Arena Football League.

This student organization is currently registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a non-stock, non-profit corporation in the name of \\"Ang Pamantasan 1979 - PLM's Official Student Publication Inc.\\" It was previously registered in SEC as \\"Ang Pamantasan, Inc.\\" This independent student organization was established in 1979, twelve years after the university formally opened. Nameplate The current Ang Pamantasan nameplate mainly consists of the organization's logo and the name of the publication. It can be noted that the letters \\"P\\" and \\"N\\" in the word \\"Pamantasan\\" are slightly larger than the other letters, a design typical in the previous AP nameplates. The text's main color is blue, with strokes of yellow. Also in the nameplate, below the \\"Ang Pamantasan\\" text, is the phrase \\"The Official Student Publication of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila\\". Logo The current Ang Pamantasan logo is partly patterned after the official seal of the PLM, which depicts a sunbeam, with a design consisting of a central disk with fourteen radiating spires that represent the geographical districts of Manila - Binondo, Quiapo, Sampaloc, San Miguel, San Nicolas, Santa Cruz, Santa Mesa, Tondo, Ermita, Intramuros, Malate, Paco, Pandacan, Port Area, San Andres Bukid and Santa Ana. The central disk is divided into four equal parts. The disk's upper half is colored red on the right and white on the left, while the lower half is colored blue on the right and white on the left. Placed on the two white parts are two letters from the Baybayin (an ancient native alphabet). The letter at the upper part is a letter \\"A\\" in today's modern Filipino alphabet, while the letter in the lower part is a letter \\"P\\". The two letters combined form the publication's initials, AP. Three more elements are superimposed on the central disk - a sunburst (which represents light and truth), a scroll (which represents paper) and a quill (which represents a pen). History Early years HASIK, the predecessor of AP, published articles that criticized the Ferdinand Marcos administration. In 1972, the year Martial Law was declared, HASIK and many other national and campus newspapers were closed. HASIK's then Editor-in- Chief, Liliosa Hilao, was brutally killed allegedly by military men. During Martial Law, several rules aiming to control the publications were set. In October 1978, the University Committee on School Publications (UCSP) was created. Its job was to censor every issue of the student publication. In 1979, the student publication's name was changed to its present name. But even under a new name, the publication suffered the same old problems. During the first decade of AP, its staffers fought for complete independence through fiscal autonomy and continued to battle censorship from the UCSP. In 1988, AP intensified its call for fiscal autonomy. The AP staff believed that the publisher of AP is the students and the administration should have no control over it. The 1990s On May 10, 1991, fiscal autonomy was granted to AP by Board of Regents (BOR) Resolution No. 1462. This allowed the publication to directly collect fees from the students. On August 6 of the following year, the AP staff, with George T. Amurao as Editor-in-Chief, registered the publication as Ang Pamantasan, Inc. in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). AP became a non-stock, non-profit corporation and an independent entity inside PLM. Before the second semester of 1992 began, a memorandum circular, dated October 22, was released, making the AP fee a non-prerequisite to enrollment. This became a major concern for the AP staff as it posed the possibility of having low collection turnouts. Several students, headed by AP Editor-in-Chief Ma. Cecilia Leaño and Supreme Student Council (SSC) President Mayonello Yanilla, protested by conducting a rally. On July 30, 1993, the office of the President issued Administrative Order No. 14, stating the formation of an Ad Hoc Committee, which was tasked to conduct an examination for new staffers of AP. This was made without consultation with the current staffers of AP. Because of this, several AP staffers and supporters picketed at the PLM gate. Meanwhile, as the results of the AP examinations conducted by the administration were released, Jose Gabriel Mabutas was chosen as the new Chief Editor. During that time, two APs existed – the AP Inc. and the AP that was recently formed and was led by Mabutas. The former tagged the latter as the \\"AP Bogus\\", which was able to publish only one issue. A few months later, PLM President Benjamin G. Tayabas suspended the collection of the publication fee because of internal problems. The issue was dragged into the courts by Dean Sumilong of CBA, who held the \\"bogus\\" exams. In that exam, those who have already taken the exam duly mandated by the AP by laws, took the opportunity to thwart the malicious intent of the PLM administration—to get hold of the AP's won press freedom, and blind the PLM community of the growing malady that stinks from the seat of President Benjamin Tayabas.Manila Campus Paper Padlocked. Bulatlat Volume IV, Number 21. Olea, Ronalyn V. June 27 - July 3, 2004. Dean Sumilong, filed an unjust vexation case against 9 staffers of Ang Pamantasan, which the staffers got over with after year. Aside from the case, these staffers were suspended. For 29 school days of suspension, they spent their days outside the campus picketing. On November 10, 1994, the AP Inc. was closed down. For a period of two years, AP was non-operational, and the publication office was padlocked. Those who passed the editorial board examination, conducted by the outgoing staff, headed by Orlando Ballesteros, Associate Editor, pushed with the struggle. Two issues were printed and distributed, under the editorial board headed by Rodrigo Rivera, one in each school year, from 1994–1996. During the term of Paul Salazar as supreme student council president the issue of AP re-opening was advocated. It is in the year 1996-1997 that an examination for new AP staffers was initiated although there was no support from the university administration. The student publication was only revived on the latter part of the year 1996 when Dr. Virseley dela Cruz handled the university presidency. Jennifer Arceo was the first Editor-in-Chief of the revived AP. In 1997, Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim imposed the zero collection policy for the non-paying students of PLM. AP's fund was subsidized by the city government. When Lito Atienza won the elections and became the mayor of Manila, Lim's zero collection policy was not sustained and AP was allowed to collect from the non-paying students again. Year 2000-2005 In 2000, the request for the increase in the publication fee was approved by the PLM Board of Regents. From P17 it became P30. During this time, AP then led by its Editor- in-Chief Isagani V. Abunda II established an 'open communication' with the university administration. According to Abunda, this is just a strategy designed to maximize whatever little opportunities the administration can offer to the publication and the students. Abunda called this move 'confidence-building strategy'. Despite of this, AP remained critical on several issues, particularly anomalies involving the previous administration and the plan during that time to increase the tuition fee for paying students of PLM. On February 12, 2002, the AP staff and some SSC officers showed opposition to the proposed zero collection policy of a student council presidential candidate Ryan Ponce. This mass action led to a three-day suspension of around 15 students, most members of Bukluran Student Alliance and Sanlakas Youth, who participated in the said rally. Before the enrolment for the first semester of 2003, AP was informed that the collection of its fees was placed at the last step of enrollment. Dr. Ester D. Jimenez, the then head of the Office of the University Registrar, explained that it was done because the collection of the AP and the SSC fees is not the responsibility of the university administration. Under Ma. Cecilia D. Villarosa, AP published articles criticizing the administration for its allegedly unfair policies, misuse of funds and harassment on students, among others.We Respect Press Freedom . The Manila Bulletin Online. July 30, 2004. These critical write-ups prompted some university officials to file complaints against AP before the students’ affairs office.Campus press law challenged. The Varsitarian Vol. LXXIX, No. 10. April 30, 2008. The AP staffers again held a rally, wherein all participants wore black. The said protest action, supported by Sanlakas party-list and Fr. Robert Reyes, was called \\"Black Saturday\\". A month later, AP released Issue, a magazine which contained investigative reports on several campus issues. Included in the magazine was the controversial article entitled \\"The Big Five\\", which published the personal accounts, assets and liabilities of the five top university officials. Because of this article, Dr. Virginia N. Santos, vice president for academic affairs, and Jimenez, who was also the head of the office of admissions, filed new complaints against AP. Days before graduation of the year 2004, the College of Mass Communication dean requested to delete the names of AP editors Villarosa and Celeste J. Boniquit from the list of the graduating students, saying that they failed to comply with the academic requirements for graduation. The council also revoked the degree of Associate Editor Rose Belen M. Manaog. The dismissal was ordered on June 11 and the other staff members were all suspended. Villarosa and others appealed to other student publications and to the national media. News regarding the expulsion and suspension of the AP writers was published in some newspapers and was able to get some attention from the broadcast media. The administration immediately answered and denied the validity of AP staffers’ complaints. It released its statement and was published in several newspapers. With that, the issue cooled down. On June 11, 2004, the AP office was opened without the presence of any of the staff members. According to the administration, it was opened only for safety and security purposes. The doorknob was allegedly replaced and the keys were turned over to the university security group. A few days later, AP published a special issue that answered all accusations by the administration against them. The issue, which was tabloid-sized, had a big, catchy banner on the front page. The banner reads \\"Martial Law\\", obviously implying that there is no more press freedom in PLM. On July 24, a few weeks after the remaining AP writers were suspended, the Student Publications Committee (SPC) conducted a competitive examination for aspiring AP writers. Those who passed the written exam and a panel interview constituted the new AP editorial board. Jimboie D. Cordova was named editor in chief but after several months, he resigned. The student writers who composed the new AP editorial staff were tagged as \\"administration puppets\\" by a number of students. These students, who were used to the hard-hitting style of the former AP writers, doubted the integrity and writing style of the new staff members. And while previous AP writers only had problems regarding their relationship with the university administration, the new ones had to bare with the problems brought by distrust, both on the part of the administration and of the students. The staff had difficulty in dealing with university officials and employees apparently because of the latter's bad impressions on AP considering its recent clash with the administration. On the other hand, students perceive the new staffers as pro-administration because it was the SPC who administered the examination. Recently though, AP has been getting support from the younger student population (composed of freshmen and sophomore students). Meanwhile, in January 2005, the Manila Regional Trial Court ordered that the degree in mass communication be given to expelled AP editors Villarosa, Boniquit and Manaog. After several months, Jimboie Cordova resigned. Rommel Lontayao, who was then the Managing Editor of AP, took charge of the student publication. AP continued to have problems with publishing its issues because of its funds being handled by the administration. An issue then, to be published, must be \\"endorsed\\" by the publication's head adviser Dr. Romeo Barrios, who was also the dean of CMC. It was because of this problem that the editors and staff realized that the organization must be independent in terms of handling its funds. Like in the previous cases, AP's call for fiscal autonomy was not immediately heeded. AP conducted another competitive examination on September 1, 2005, and Lontayao was again chosen as editor in chief of AP. Recent years In January 2006, the Commission on Audit in PLM, then headed by Julia Ella Moreno, issued an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) 2006-12-20 instructing the administration to release the AP trust fund to the organization. The administration, as a response to the AOM, gave AP a set of conditions before they released the publication's fund. On February of the same year, Atty. Jose M. Roy III, who was a member of the University's Board of Regents and the dean of the PLM College of Law, became acting president of PLM. Under his four-month term, AP was granted fiscal autonomy and was allowed to directly collect from the students. The payment of the AP fee was placed on Step 6 of the new enrolment procedure, which means that the students will have to pay the AP fee first before they were able to get their class cards. In May 2006, the organization was registered to SEC as Ang Pamantasan 1979 – PLM's Official Student Publication, Inc. Dr. Tayabas, who had a reputation of closing down the student publication in the past, was reappointed for the third time as PLM president in June 2006. In an issue dated July 2006, AP published an article entitled, \\"Complaint filed vs PLM prexy, BOR\\". A few months later, some of the AP staffers taking Mass Communication, including the editor in chief, experienced being pressured by a professor of the college. They were warned not to involve AP in \\"matters that has nothing to do with the students\\", such as university politics. At this point, gathering data from university offices became a problem again. Request letters sent to some offices were either \\"lost\\", ignored, or denied. From the month of August, up to September, AP conducted its search for correspondents and artists. In January 2007, AP started hearing rumors that the administration plans to replace AP with a sunshine publication. For the next couple of months, the organization remained passive about the said hearsays since those were not yet proven. Because the current editor in chief of AP was a graduating student, the organization decided to appoint officers in charge that will serve as the editorial board of AP, in the meantime. Diane Denise Daseco was designated acting editor in chief of AP. The greatest concern of the organization at this time was that AP will not be a pre-requisite to the enrolment. On May 2, AP editors went to the Student Information System of the Office of the University Registrar to confirm the rumored collection scheme for the first semester. However, Assistant University Registrar Ms. Noemi Gocuyo, stated that they were not aware of the \\"new\\" collection scheme. In the original copy of the enrolment process, only the AP was to collect for the publication. On May 15, Gocuyo informed Associate Editor Grace Nartates and News Editor Randolph Perez that there was indeed a new collection scheme after an emergency meeting. There, the rumored establishment of college publications was confirmed. On the same day, Perez, Nartates and Daseco went to confront the newly appointed SSC President Albert Werner Peneyra to tackle the issue. After the discussion, and hearing the side of AP, Peneyra admitted that he was not able to study the plan for the establishment of the college publications well. He said that he believed it was not necessary to inform AP of any of the SSC's plans. He even admitted that he was not aware of any repercussion that the creation of the college publication entailed. The student council president also admitted that he did not know anything about the cited legalities of handling the funds for the college publications. When asked if the official student publication could expect any action from the council president; Peneyra answered, \\"Iko-consult ko pa ‘to kay Dean Galang at President (I will consult Dean Galang [dean of the students' affairs office] and to President [Tayabas]).\\" Any document pertinent to the said issue was withheld from AP until the first day of the actual enrolment, May 16. All in all, the SSC only presented three documents to AP: the first one, an excerpt of the 5th Executive Committee Meeting of the Board of Regents on January 24; the second one, a \\"copy of the original and the unapproved material submitted to the President of the University\\" (Resolution No. 2007-01 and Proposed Uniform Guidelines for the College Student Publication); and the last one, the \\"revised and approved Resolution No. 2007-01\\". This project of SSC aimed to create a publication in each college inside PLM. Through revised Resolution 2007-01, the payment of the college publication and Ang Pamantasan fees was made \\"on a voluntary basis only\\". PLUMA, the literary folio of Ang Pamantasan. Other activities AP sponsors Ang Pamantasan Gintong Panitik, which is an annual literary contest. It began on October 26, 1998, during the incumbency of Rhia Diomampo as Editor-in-Chief of AP, with the theme, \\"Living, Thriving and Dying in Manila: Circa '90\\" or \\"Iba't ibang Mukha ng Maynila: Sirka '90.\\" The contest aims to breathe a life of awareness among PLM students towards a variety of issues at the same time nourish them with a sense of responsibility to participate in the Philippine society through their imaginative writings. It has different categories in both English and Filipino such as, short story/maikling kuwento, poem/tula, and essay/sanaysay. The winners are chosen by the faculty of PLM and other universities, and distinguished writers, who are mostly Carlos Palanca Awardees. Editorial board and staff Like in many other student publications, the organization's Editorial Board is the policy-making body of AP. The Board decides on critical issues regarding the publication and formulates its internal rules. The Board is composed of seven (7) members: the Editor in Chief, the Associate Editor, the Managing Editor, the News Editor, the Features Editor, the Literary Editor, and the Circulation Manager. On the other hand, the staff is composed of members of the publication who are either senior or junior staffers. Auxiliary positions such as Sports Editor, Filipino Editor, Business Manager, and Editorial Board Secretary may be given to staff members upon the decision of the majority of the Editorial Board. An aspiring writer can only join the organization if he/she passes the annual Ang Pamantasan Examination (APEX), which is composed of a written exam and a panel interview.

He had a brother Ralph of Preston in Amounderness, a sister Barbara, and nephews (apparently her sons) Robert and William (Cal. S. P., Dom. add. 1566-79, London, 1871, p. 562). He held a position of emolument under the Crown, possibly as coroner, till about 1565.

Having been advised by them that he could not in good conscience attend Protestant churches, his absence was noted and he was forced to give up his position. He was subject to repeated fines, until he had to leave his home and stay with friends, but never long in one place. For fourteen years he suffered persecution for his faith, which included imprisonment at Hull. After the death of his wife, he went abroad and arrived at Reims, 22 June 1580. On 25 September following he went on to Pont-à-Mousson, and thence to Rome, where, after obtaining a dispensation, he became a priest. The dispensation was necessary before ordination, as Lacy had been married to a widow.Challoner, Richard. Memoirs of Missionary Priests, Thomas Richardson & son, 1843, p. 128 On 10 May 1581, he was at Loreto on his way to England. He was arrested after a Mass said by Thomas Bell, afterwards an apostate, in York Castle, 22 July 1582. He suffered great hardships, being loaded with heavy irons, confined in an underground dungeon, and subjected to numerous examinations. He was arraigned on 11 August, probably under 13 Eliz. cc. 2 and 3. He was executed at York, 22 August 1582. Richard Kirkman Richard Kirkman was born at Addingham in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He arrived at Douai in 1577 and, after the transference of the English College to Reims, he was ordained subdeacon there, along with Richard Thirkeld, on 14 March 1579. Kirkman was ordained priest on the following Holy Saturday. He said his first Mass in the Abbey Church of the Benedictine nuns of St. Peter's. Scrivelsby Court He left for the English mission on 3 August 1579, with Alexander Briant and three others. On his return to England in August he seems to have found a refuge with Robert Dymoke, hereditary Champion of England (died in Lincoln gaol for his faith, 11 September 1580), at Scrivelsby, Lincolnshire. Kirkman was represented as a schoolmaster for Dymoke's sons. He laboured for four years on the English Mission. When Dymoke was arrested on the charge of recusancy, Kirkman fled north. Being questioned as a stranger in those parts, he was eventually arrested near Wakefield on 8 August 1582 by Francis Wortley of Wortley, J.P., and seems to have been arraigned a day or two after under 23 Eliz. c. 1.

History Nothing much is known about the ancient history of Sandila. According to folk sayings, it was a forested area, believed to be the worship land of legendary sage Shandilya. As per the British chronicles, the history of Sandila town started in the medieval period after Mohammad Ghori’s capture of Delhi throne. Two brothers belonging to the martial Arakh Rajpoot clan viz. Salhia singh and Malhia singh established the towns of Salhiapura (later known as Sandila) and Malhiapura (later known as Malihabad), respectively. Sandila thus became the seat of Arakh power in early 13th century and became a flourishing town under Arakhs Rajpoot. Arakhs held the region till last quarter of the 14th century, when a large army sent by Feroz Shah Tughlaq under his lieutenant Syed Makhdum Alauddin, captured the town and the adjoining areas after a fierce battle with Arakhs. The remains of Arakh rule are seen in form of ruined fortresses in the mounds of Garhi Jindor, Malhaiyya garhi (Malaiyya), Sahinjana tila, Samad Khera, Muslewan garhi, Datli, Naurang garh (Tarauna), Sandi qila, and many others. After the decline of Arakh power, Sandila came under the rule of Delhi sultanate. The folklore of Arakhs (also called Arkawanshis or अर्कवंशी) still sings about the bravery of its heroes, Salhia and Malhia. In 1952 Biswas a flight lieutenant of Indian Air Force who was working in a Communication Flight unit in Lucknow took charge of the aircraft carrying army officials who were returning to New Delhi after an official visit. After it took off, suddenly a crew member observed an engine malfunction; subsequently a fire broke out. Biswas first tried extinguish it, but it was difficult to control. He decided to attempt a forced landing, and made a belly landing near Sandila town in Uttar Pradesh and successfully saved the lives of all the passengers. Biswas was awarded the Ashoka Chakra for his extraordinary example of bravery, intelligence and rationality.[1] Sandila is also known for its delicacy that's Laddos of Sandila Geography Sandila is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Sandila It has an average elevation of 142 metres (465 feet).

It is based on \\"The Death of Superman\\" comic book storyline by DC Comics and features many characters from the comics, including Superman himself, Superboy, Steel, Cyborg Superman, the Eradicator, and Doomsday. All of the five Supermen are playable characters at some point.  Gameplay  Gameplay consists of standard beat 'em up sections The Death and Return of Superman has standard \\"beat 'em up\\" gameplay, in which the player controls a character that can move in all directions. A set number of foes will enter the screen and only after they are defeated can the character continue on the quest. Although different in appearance, each character has the same basic abilities: standard melee attacks (punches), grappling attacks (get close enough to character and attack), throws (holding the forward key and attacking), grab and throw upward (holding the “up” key and attacking), grab and throw backward (holding the “back” key and attacking), or grab and pummel (hold the “down” key and attack), a projectile attack, and an “ultimate” attack that destroys all standard enemies on the screen. Their attacks only slightly vary, mostly in range and appearance. Each Superman has the ability to fly and can thereby avoid certain characters or obstacles using this ability. There are also characters that have the ability to fly and are thereby easier to defeat if confronted in the air. There are also certain areas and levels where flying is mandatory. Also, many obstacles can be passed only by flying. However, certain screens in which the character is on an elevated platform the flying ability is almost completely negated. With the exceptions of Superman and to a point the Man of Steel, each character has two standard types of level: melee combat and flying in which only projectile moves can be used. The standard melee levels consist of the character fighting through “common” enemies and ending the level with a fight with a “boss” character. When playing the flying levels, the player can move the character anywhere in the screen while firing the character's projectile move at greatly weakened enemies. No boss characters appear in these levels. Strangely, Superman never has a flying level and instead plays through three standard melee levels. Steel has a unique flying level that plays more like a combat level as he doesn't use his projectile attacks and relies on his melee attack. Also, Steel has a “boss” character he must defeat in order for the game to progress. Choice of characters isn't allowed during the game and the player must play through the game as a pre-determined character for each level. During the start of the game enemies are usually armed with guns, bombs, or chainsaws if they are armed at all. Superman's invulnerability seems to have been removed, as these items are capable of hurting him. Later characters are armed with more powerful energy type weapons and pure melee characters are now robots. Most characters appear time and time again and more powerful enemies use the same game sprite but with a different color. Plot The game starts when Clawster and his army and Underworlders initiate a power failure in the city of Metropolis in an attempt to take over the city. Superman intervenes and defeats the horde of Underdwellers, Clawster included. Not long after the power is restored, a news report bulletin states a monster of unknown origin (Doomsday) is leading a path of destruction towards Metropolis, and the Justice League were unable to stop the creature. The titanic struggle between Superman and Doomsday reached a conclusion when the two delivered each other the killing blow. Superman succumbs to his injuries as he dies, as well as Doomsday. Three months later, four Supermen emerge in an effort to replace the original Superman, whilst the other claiming he is indeed the original Superman. The game shifts to Cyborg Superman (the \\"Man of Tomorrow\\") as he attacks a Project Cadmus base to locate a comatose Doomsday. Fearing he would be a threat once again if he wakes up, the Cyborg exiles Doomsday in deep space. Next, the player controls the Eradicator (the \\"Last Son of Krypton\\") as he patrols the streets of Metropolis. However, he is forced into battle with another Superman, Steel, as the armored hero fights to prevent the Last Son of Krypton from killing enemies. After the two Supermen fought to a standstill, the Eradicator reconsiders his brutal approach to fighting crime after Steel tells him it takes humanity and compassion to be considered a Superman. However, a bigger threat comes, as a mysterious spacecraft arrives and obliterates Coast City (the hometown of Hal Jordan). The Eradicator investigates the situation, only to run in with the mastermind, the Cyborg. The Eradicator is critically injured at the Cyborg's hands, and rushes to the Fortress of Solitude. The game shifts its focus on Superboy (the \\"Metropolis Kid\\") as he attempts to handle the current situation in Metropolis. After successfully doing so, Superboy flies off to Coast City, doing battle with the Cyborg as he arrives. The Cyborg knocks out and imprisons Superboy in the spacecraft. There, the rogue Superman reveals his plan: to destroy the world and reconstruct it in his image, starting with Coast City and Metropolis. While this is going on, a being flies among the skies above the Fortress of Solitude, albeit weakly. Back in Coast City, Superboy escapes imprisonment to go back to Metropolis, where he and Steel encounter the real Superman. Not wanting to wait, Superboy convinces the two to go with him to Coast City to stop the Cyborg once and for all. The player now controls Steel (the \\"Man of Steel\\") as he, Superman, and Superboy launch an assault on Engine City. However, the Cyborg launches a missile set to destroy Metropolis. Superboy elects to stop the missile, and, with player controlling Superboy, he successfully destroys the missile. At Engine City, the player shifts back to Steel, as he enters the Engine's core to shut it down. Meanwhile, a regenerated Eradicator bursts out of the Fortress and arrives at Engine City to help a weakened Superman, who is at the Cyborg's mercy. The Cyborg shoots Kryptonite fuel at Superman but the Eradicator arrives and shields Superman from the blast. The BMI of the Eradicator alters the deadly effects of the Kryptonite fuel and restores Superman to full strength as the Eradicator dies. Now controlling Superman, the player defeats and destroys the Cyborg Superman. The game ends with Steel and Superboy congratulating Superman for his success and accepting him as the real Superman. Reception Next Generation reviewed the Genesis version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"If you must catch a glimpse of your favorite superhero, buy the comic book, not the game.\\" References External links *The Death and Return of Superman at IGN * Category:1994 video games Category:Beat 'em ups Category:Blizzard games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sunsoft games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Superhero video games Category:Superman arcade and video games Category:Steel (John Henry Irons) Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Side- scrolling beat 'em ups ","title":"The Death and Return of Superman"},{"id":"5808525","text":"Sangamner is a city and a municipal council located in the Ahmednagar District of Maharashtra state in India.

History Following the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132-136CE), Legio VI Ferrata was stationed at Legio near Caparcotna. The approximate location of the camp of the Legio VI Ferrata was known from the persistence of its name in the form Lajjun by which a Palestinian Arab village was known. It was close to the ancient town of Rimmon, perhaps the Hadad- rimmon of , which in the 3rd century was renamed Maximianopolis (City of Maximian) by Diocletian in honor of his co-emperor Maximian. Both places were within a single episcopal see, generally called Maximianopolis, but in one list of such sees the name Legionum (genitive plural of the Latin word Legio) is used, where the Greek original has \\"Maximianopolis\\". Legio lies along Palestine’s Via Maris, an ancient trade route linking Egypt with the northern empires of Syria, Anatola and Mesopotamia in the early bronze age. Archaeological methods In 2002–2003, an archaeological survey was conducted in the Legio region by Yotam Tepper as part of his master's thesis. The survey located the legionary camp on the northern slope of El-Manach hill, the village of Ceparcotani on the adjacent hill, and the city of Maximianopolis on the site of the contemporary Kibbutz Megiddo.Tepper, Y. 2003. Survey of the Legio Area near Megiddo: Historical and Geographical Research. MA thesis, Tel Aviv University. Tel Aviv. In 2013 Tepper and the Jezreel Valley Regional Project dug test trenches measuring approximately 295 feet by 16.5 feet that revealed clear evidence of the camp.Matthew J. Adams, Jonathan David and Yotam Tepper, Legio: Excavations at the Camp of the Roman Sixth Ferrata Legion in Israel, Bible History Daily, Biblical Archaeology Society, 2013. Aerial photography, satellite images, and high-resolution lidar data hinted that the hill known as el-Manach contained traces of artificial, human produced objects and structures. After this, slight depressions in the earth revealed the borders of the military camp itself. Long, linear indents that met at 90 degree angles were found on the north, south, and west side of the hill. The following evidence led to the use of archaeological techniques to further discover the uncovered items at Legio.  Ground-penetrating radar  Ground-penetrating radar was the primary technique used to uncover the findings at Legio. The technique involves using antenna frequencies and data- acquisition parameters to analyze what lied beneath the surface of a variety of different types of soil. This technique allows the user to analyze a wide range of land in a relatively efficient amount of time.  Findings  No military headquarters of this type for this particular period had yet been excavated in the entire Eastern Empire, and the 2013 excavations uncovered defensive earthworks, a circumvolution rampart, barracks areas and artifacts including roof tiles stamped with the name of the Sixth Legion, and fragments of scale armor. Coins were found during the excavation process. The coins were found to have countermarks on them showing the length of time the coins were in circulation. Decorative fibulae were also discovered in the Jezreel Valley. In 2017, a monumental gate to the camp’s headquarters, a stone mark and a dedicatory inscription were discovered that may be a listing of camp commanders or celebrated heroes of the Sixth Legion. In the camp’s latrines, more than 200 Roman coins dating to the 2nd and 3rd centuries were found. Cremated human remains were discovered in a cooking pot. Evidence of Roman Army Camp Uncovered in Israel A study by Anastasia Shapiro was done on the Petrographic Examination of Tiles, Bricks and Mortar from Legio. In Area B, ceramic tiles, tegulae roof tiles and square floor tiles, as well as bricks were uncovered. Eight tiles and two bricks were discovered bearing Roman legion stamps. Upon further analysis of these fragments, petrographic examinations indicate that all the sampled items are part of a homogeneous petrographic group. This matrix consists of calcareous fossiliferous clay containing some tiny, opaque stains of iron oxide and a small amount of silt, which comprises basalt-derived minerals. Some of the micro fossils have ferric or silica filling. Others being completely vitrified. Non-plastic material also makes up for about 2-18% of the volume of tegulae. This includes larger and smaller forms of basalt, quartz, chalk, fossil shells, and terra rosa.  Aqueduct  The aqueduct was found on the southeast side of the hill, and drew its water from springs at Ain Kubbih. The aqueduct would then split in two directions heading towards Daher ed-Dar and flour mills in the Queni stream. The water provided by the aqueduct supplied the soldiers and legionnaires at Legio with a lasting supply of water. The structure allowed water from 124 meters above sea level to be sent to camps and cities. Without the aqueduct, the water would not be funneled to its desired locations in such an efficient time and process. Parts of the aqueduct remained exposed while a majority was covered in a layer of mud and other dumped pieces of earth.  Fibulae  A number of fibulae were discovered in the Jezreel Valley, dating back to the second century AD. During an excavation conducted by Yigael Yadin, two types of fibulae, Roman and Near Eastern, were found. Upon examination, experts found that Roman fibulae were typically made of a type of brass consisting of small percentages of zinc, lead, and various other metals. Compared to their Roman counterparts, Near Eastern fibulae contained different proportions of the metals found in brass. Both analyses provide a greater insight on metalwork and metal production in the Roman Empire during the second century.

It is situated near Holy city Pandharpur . It is located at the intersection of state highways SH-161, SH-3, and SH-71. Traditionally, in many historic records this area was part of the Mandesh region. Its name is derived from the Maan River. Sangole is known for pomegranate production as well as jowar.  Demographics  182x182pxSangola Dist-Solapur According to the 2011 Indian census, Sangole had a population of 34,321. Males constituted 51% of the population and females 48%. Sangole had an average literacy rate of 82%. Male literacy was 88%, and female literacy was 77%. Twelve percent of the population was under 6 years of age.2011 census data History Sangole was a prominent part of the Maratha dynasty under the Ingoles. It is believed that Sangole as a town was established around the 14th or 15th century by six Ingoles. Babaji Lakhmoji Ingole & his five sons (6 Ingole's)have constructed a fort and situated town Sangole. The name of Sangole is derived from these six Ingoles (Saha Ingole) - Sangole. There is a historic fort inside Sangola town and later the Ingole's were awarded Deshmukhi of Paragane Sangole by Aadilshah of Bijapur. Still in many villages the Deshmukh families are residing - mainly - Sangole city, Deshmukh Vasti- Bamani, Jawala, Sonand. Ingole-Deshmukhs are now farmers holding lands in these villages. The main Ingole-Deshmukh family is residing at Sangole city and Pune. The great grand son of BabajiRaje, Dnyaneshwar Ingole-Deshmukh is residing in Pune. Dhangar,Maratha clan systemShahaannav Kuli Marathas- Ingole Deshmukhs and Yajurvedi Brahmins are believed to have set up some of the first communities in this region. The fort at Sangole was built, reportedly by Deshmukhs under Bijapur's Aadilshah king. It is believed that later the Deshmukh's left the Aadilshah of Bijapur and joined the forces of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Aadilshah had awarded Deshmukhi of 72 villages of paragane Sangole to Ingole Deshmukh's. The town later grew up around the fort was so prosperous that it was locally called the Golden Sangola or \\"Sonyache Sangola\\" (सोन्याचे सांगोले). Soon after settlement, due to the large availability of high-quality land, which produced many crops during kharip season, farming and dairy businesses flourished around the area, although at first, Sangole experienced low population density. This proved fortunate, as it was less severely impacted by such historical events as the Durga Devi drought in the 14th century and the failure of the Yadav kingdom at the hands of Alauddin Khalji in nearby Deogiri. In the 15th century, Sambhaji visited the area and Dhangar began to arrive in the city. Significant growth of the Dhangar population occurred between 1690 and 1702.  Maratha Empire  After the death of Afzal Khan, Shivaji captured the entire region from Wai to Kolhapur. Netaji Palkar is believed to have raided Sangole on 14 November 1659, but the land fort was again recaptured by Adishahi forces in 1663. In December 1665, Shivaji and Mirza Jaisingh won the town from the Adilshah. Later Shivaji Raje again gifted the town to Ingole Deshmukh's; however in 1679, after the fall of the Bhupalgad fort, the area was transferred to the control of Dilerkhan Pathans. Seven months afterward, Hambirrao Mohite recaptured the town from the Moguls. After 1690, Sangole was under nominal control of the Moguls, because the entire area remained in the hands of Deshmukh's. Many major Maratha soldiers, such as Santaji Ghorpade, Dhanaji Jadhav, Jagdale, and Moreshwar Pingale camped in this region when they carried out attacks on the Moguls between 1692 and 1703. The Ingole Deshmukh's supported the Maratha Sardars with their small fleet of Maratha mawala's. In 1750, Balaji Bajirao was opposed by Yamaji Pant Shivdev, a partisan of Tarabai, who threw himself into the Sangole fort and called for rebellion. Sadashivrao Bhau, the cousin of Balaji Bajirao, and Ram Raja marched to Sangole to put down the rebellion. Yamaji's uprising was soon suppressed. In 1802 the town and the fort was attacked and severely looted by Holkar's Pathans.  Economy  Animals Market Sangola Weekly Market Sangole's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, with textile mills (including cotton), grape processing factories and sugar factories found in the area. One cotton mill, Sangole Taluka Sahakri Sut Girni, was awarded best spinning mill in Asia for a few years.

It originates in the Tulasi lake in Sanjay Gandhi National Park in the northern reaches of the city. The River flows roughly North-West for a total of 12 kilometres through the localities of the National Park, Sri Krishna Nagar, Daulatnagar, Leprosy Colony, Kandar Pada, Sanjay Nagar, and Dahisar Gaothan before meeting the Arabian sea via the Manori Creek. Its total Catchment area is 3488 hectares.Catchment number 203 as described in the BRIMSTOWAD report Table A7.1, page ES-14 The river was once so picturesque that Hindi films were shot here. Till the late 1960s, crocodiles were witnessed to be residing the river. The river is now highly polluted with the dumping of industrial effluents from workshops, and sewage from slums and stormwater drains into it. In recent times it had narrowed down, and became more shallow due to the presence of the accumulation of silt, debris and plastic bags. After the 2005 Maharashtra floods, where more than a 100 people lost their lives, the BMC has undertaken a desilting and widening project to clean up the river and prevent future flooding. Encroachments Unregulated urbanisation has resulted in severe environmental degradation like the narrowing of riverbanks for housing at Leprosy Colony, located between Dahisar and Borivli, and Tabelas (Cowsheds). The river has been frequently diverted due to dumping of construction debris/solid waste/industrial waste in the region from Western Railway Tracks on Dahisar West up to Dahisar Bridge and dumping of solid waste generated at Stables near Daulat Nagar and areas near S.V.Road. Encroachments on dry areas of riverbed as well as on the banks of this river had choked and pinched the watercourse and aggravated the risk of flooding. Field observations indicated that the river also suffered from dumping of debris from construction activities, industrial wastes on the banks, and dumping of municipal solid wastes coupled with inadequate annual desilting efforts. Ingress encroachments from the banks (building, industries, and slums) as well as modification of river-course and local diversion of streams have compounded the risk of flooding. Some of the glaring encroachments are: Bridge along Dahisar River between Western Express Highway and S. V. Road, Marble Shops near the Western Express Highway, Leprosy Colony, slum pockets between Bhagwati Hospital and Rustomjee Park, and Ranchhoddas Marg. 2005 Floods The river flood was caused by the eighth heaviest ever recorded 24-hour rainfall figure of 994 mm (39.1 inches) which lashed the city on 26 July 2005, and intermittently continued through the next day. During the deluge, about 10,000 houses and shops in Rawal Pada, Ghartan Pada and Sri Krishna Nagar were submerged causing heavy losses. The level of water in this region was about 2.5 metres. Thousands of families living below the poverty line became shelterless overnight, losing entire livelihoods. Various locations such as Daulat Nagar, Leprosy Colony, Mhatre Wadi and Kandar Pada were completely submerged under 3 metres of water due to high tide indicating the need for tide regulatory gates at the mouth of the river. State Bank of India Staff \\"Vaibhav\\" CHS society, because of its peculiar location, was particularly affected. Most of the bungalow type of resident homes in this locality were completely submerged. Subsequent to this event, flooding of the river, although of lesser intensity, became a regular phenomenon for this location. As of March 2016, most of the original residents of this society have either sold of their property or are staying in rented accommodation, awaiting redevelopment of the property.

Early life Pedro de Heredia was a descendant of a rich family of noble lineage. His parents were Pedro de Heredia and Inés Fernandez. The chronicler Juan de Castellanos tells that even in his early years, he showed an adventurous and quarrelsome character. In his youth, Pedro de Heredia was involved in an altercation with six men who tried to kill him in a dark alley in Madrid. The fight left him with a disfigured nose that required the intervention of a doctor from the Spanish Crown. In retaliation, Heredia hunted down three of his attackers and killed them before fleeing to the New World to evade justice, leaving behind his wife and children. First travel to the New World Heredia traveled to the West Indies with his brother Alonso de Heredia and settled in Santo Domingo, the capital of the island of Hispaniola, where they eventually inherited a sugar mill and an estate in Azua Province. Then came news of the death of the governor of Santa Marta, Rodrigo de Bastidas, and the Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo decided to send Pedro de Vadillo as interim governor of the province and Pedro de Heredia as his lieutenant. In 1528, Vadillo and Heredia landed in Santa Marta with 200 men and soon became involved in disputes with Rodrigo Alvarez Palomino, a former lieutenant of Bastidas, which were resolved when the latter was drowned in the river that bears his name. Vadillo served as interim governor of Santa Marta but returned to Santo Domingo to face a residencia (an administrative and judicial tribunal). In the meantime, Heredia continued in office until 1529, gaining extensive experience in his dealings with the Indians. He accumulated a considerable booty from exchanges of mirrors, bells and other trinkets with the natives, then returned to Santo Domingo and sailed back to Spain. First expedition to the New World Once in Madrid, Heredia initiated efforts to gain royal approval to secure the conquest and government of the Bay of Cartagena and New Andalucía, a territory that stretched from the mouth of the Magdalena River to Darién Province, which had belonged to Alonso de Ojeda. The capitulación, or agreement, granting him the title of adelantado, was signed in Medina del Campo on August 5, 1532, by queen Joanna of Castile (also known as Joanna the Mad). Heredia was granted an area covering virtually all of what is now Colombia and more than half of present-day Ecuador, stretching inland to the equator. Heredia moved to Sevilla, where he procured a galleon, a caravel and a patache and embarked from Cádiz with 150 men and 22 horses in November, 1532. Heredia first landed in Puerto Rico, where he found the survivors of an expedition led by Sebastian Cabot, who was on his way back from the Rio de La Plata after six difficult and unsuccessful years spent in the New World. Heredia augmented his army with some of Cabot's officers, including Francisco César, whom he appointed as his lieutenant. He then departed for Santo Domingo, where he visited his estates and drafted some Indians and slaves, a few Spanish women and an interpreter, India Catalina, a native woman fluent in both the Spanish and Indian tongues who had been kidnapped by Diego de Nicuesa when she was a girl. Foundation of Cartagena de Indias After spending Christmas Day in Santo Domingo, Heredia sailed across the Caribbean Sea to the mainland of South America where he cruised off the coast into Santa Marta Bay and then past the mouth of the Magdalena River. He passed several villages of the Mokaná Indians, until on January 14, 1533 he reached Calamari, the largest of them, standing on the sandy inner shore of Cartagena Bay. After fierce combat with the natives of the territory of Turbaco, Heredia founded a city, now Cartagena de Indias, naming it after Cartagena, Spain because it had a similar bay, but he called it \\"Cartagena de Poniente\\" to distinguish it from that city. The exact date of the founding of Cartagena de Indias remains a topic of controversy. Some argue that it was on January 20 or 21 in 1533, although the Colombian Academy of History has fixed the date as June 1, 1533. Inland expeditions and residencias Map of Colombian conquest De Heredia's route indicated in blue Plunder of Cartagena in 1544 by Jean- François Roberval Heredia signed friendship pacts with the Indian chiefs of the nearby islands. With the help of Catalina acting as interpreter, Heredia conquered and ruled the area around Cartagena, including Turbaco and the Magdalena River. He looted Indian graves in the Sinú river area and founded Santiago de Tolú. His spoils from these expeditions included a solid gold porcupine weighing 132 pounds - the heaviest gold object plundered during the Conquest. Heredia returned with a bounty of one and half million ducats in gold. Each soldier received six thousand ducats, far more than the amount given to the troops who helped conquer Mexico and Peru. Pedro de Heredia prepared a second expedition to the South Sea and in 1534 he reached the Sinú river, where he ransacked the indigenous peoples' tombs for gold. He and his troops then penetrated to Antioquia and returned exhausted to Cartagena. Once there, Heredia met Fray Tomas de Toro, the first bishop of Cartagena, sent by king Carlos I of Spain, and his brother Alonso, who had recently arrived from Guatemala. Heredia rescinded Francisco Cesar and appointed Alonso as lieutenant general. His brother Alonso led two expeditions to the Sinú, and in the last he arrived at the Cauca river in 1535. In 1536, Heredia mounted an expedition southward on the Atrato river with no results. Irregularities in the conduct of the Heredia brothers earned them numerous complaints. In 1536, Judge Juan de Vadillo (a relative of Pedro de Vadillo) was appointed by the Audiencia of Santo Domingo to investigate the charges against Pedro de Heredia and his brother for defaulting on due payments for land and mistreatment of the natives. Vadillo found Heredia guilty and imprisoned him, assuming for himself the interim government of Cartagena. Heredia was allowed to go to Spain to attend his trial, in which he was acquitted. He returned to Cartagena with some members of his family: a few nieces and his two sons, Antonio, who joined him on all his subsequent expeditions, and Juan, who later settled in Santa Cruz de Mompox. Shortly after his return, Heredia embarked on a quest for the treasure of Dabeiba, the precursor of the myth of El Dorado. After an unproductive long trip, Heredia returned to San Sebastián de Urabá where he accused Jorge Robledo and had him imprisoned, then sent him back to Spain for usurpation of Heredia's jurisdiction. On March 16 of 1542, Heredia departed for Antioquia to annex the territory to Cartagena. There Heredia was taken prisoner himself by Sebastián de Belalcázar and sent to Panamá to stand trial for his attempts to seize control of Antioquia. Unwilling to mediate in such a delicate affair, the Royal Audience of Panama released Heredia, who returned to Cartagena. Immediately after his arrival in Cartagena on July 25, 1544, the city was pillaged by a French Huguenot nobleman, Jean-François Roberval, known as \\"Robert Baal\\". Cartagena was not yet fortified and was an easy target for the French. Heredia was obliged to fight with his sword at his own house, as the enemy held the advantage in numbers, forcing him to flee and hide nearby with his relatives. The ransom for the city was 200,000 gold ducats, payment of which was enough to satisfy Roverbal, who then abandoned the region. Shortly after Roverbal's assault, Heredia left Antioquia to annex the territory under the jurisdiction of Cartagena. He returned to Cartagena in 1548 to appear before a residencia (court of inquiry) for abuse of his power and authority during office. The visitador (a royal inspector who reported to the Council of the Indies) Miguel Diez de Armendáriz found him guilty of all charges; Heredia, however, continued to hold his administrative position. Death In 1552, Heredia faced 289 new charges filed by the Oidor (a member judge) of the Royal Audience of Santa Fé, Juan Maldonado. The accusations included: illegal appropriation of royal funds, nepotism, obstruction of municipal chapter deliberations, severe abuses directed toward the native population such as burning alive, mutilations and torture. After being found guilty and discharged from office, Heredia returned to Spain to appeal his sentence. On January 27, 1554, (some sources say 1555) his ship La Capitana, part of Cosme Farfán's fleet, sank off the coast of Zahara de los Atunes.Gilchrist 1979, p. 54 He tried to swim ashore, but his body was never found.

The investigative judgment teaching was the focus of controversy within the denomination in 1980, when Adventist theologian Desmond Ford had his ministerial credentials withdrawn by the Church after openly criticizing the doctrine. While the Adventist mainstream believe in the doctrine and the church has reaffirmed its basic position on the doctrine since 1980, some of those within the church's more liberal progressive wing continue to be critical of the teaching. According to a 2002 worldwide survey, local church leaders estimated 86% of church members accept the doctrine, although 35% believe there may be more than one interpretation of the sanctuary belief.. Outline of the Doctrine Biblical basis Seventh- day Adventists believe that texts such as Hebrews 8:1-2 teach that the two- compartment design of the earthly sanctuary built by Moses, was in fact a model patterned after the Heavenly Sanctuary \\"which the Lord pitched not man\\" Hebrews 8:2 (NASB). They believe that statements in as well as statements found in Hebrews chapters 8 and 9, reveal that Christ entered the first phase of his Heavenly ministry (in the Holy Place of the Heavenly Sanctuary) as the High Priest of humanity after his bodily resurrection and ascension into heaven. According to this view the 2300 days (years) found in Daniel 8:13-14 point to the date when Christ's Most Holy Place ministry in Heaven would start. This is the event typified by the Day of Atonement described in Leviticus 16 and in . The Investigative Judgment doctrine states that in 1844 Christ moved from the Holy Place to the Most Holy Place in Heaven as described in Daniel 8:13-14, and that this began the judgment described in Daniel 7:9-10. The main Biblical texts quoted by Seventh-day Adventists in support of the doctrine of the Investigative Judgement being applicable to the professed people of God in all ages, are Daniel 7:9-10; 1 Peter 4:17; and Revelation 14:6, 7; 20:12. :'\\"9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. 10 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened. Daniel 7:9, 10 (KJV) :For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? 1 Peter 4:17 (KJV) :6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, 7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\\" Revelation 14:6-7 (KJV) :And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. Revelation 20:12 (KJV) Adventists also believe that the Investigative Judgment is depicted in the parable of the wedding banquet, in Matthew22:1-14 (KJV).https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt+22%3A1-14&version;=KJV Professing Christians are represented by the wedding guests, and the judgment is represented by the King's inspection of the guests (verses 10, 11). In order to pass the judgment, believers must be wearing the robe of Christ's righteousness, represented by the wedding garments (verses 11, 12). Derivation of 1844 date The derivation of the 1844 date for the commencement of the investigative judgment is explained in detail in Adventist publications such as Seventh-day Adventists believe.http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/books/27/index.htm * Seventy \\"week\\" period (Daniel 9:24-27 (KJV) https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+9%3A24-27&version;=KJV) is held to begin in 457 B.C., the seventh year of Artaxerxes I. * \\"2300 evenings and mornings\\" period (Daniel 8:13-14 (KJV)https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+8%3A13-14&version;=KJV) is held to commence in the same year. * 2300 days are held to correspond to 2300 years (see Day-year principle) * 457 B.C. add 2300 years gives 1844 AD. While no specific date is given in official belief statements, many Adventists hold October 22, 1844 as the starting date for the investigative judgment. Originally Miller set the end of the 2300 days between March 21, 1843 and March 21, 1844. In mid-1844, Miller stated \\"I confess my error, and acknowledge my disappointment: Yet I still believe that the day of the Lord is near.\\" In February, 1844, Samuel S. Snow began preaching the end of the 2300 days to be in the Fall of 1844. He soon settled on October 22. In an August camp meeting, October 22 took hold of the Adventists in New England. Miller was one of the last to accept the date.Nichol, F.D., 1944, \\"The Midnight Cry\\", Review and Herald Pub. Asso., pgs. 169, 183, 226-230 W. W. Prescott suggested that the investigative judgment occurred in the spring, and not autumn,http://www.whiteestate.org/issues/GC-Prescott.html, suggestion number 70 but his view was rejected. The judgment process According to Adventist teaching, the works of all men and women are written down in \\"books of record\\", kept in heaven. During the Investigative Judgment, these books are opened (as described in and ), and the lives of all people both living and dead are examined to establish who has responded to Christ's offer of salvation. \\"The books of record in heaven, in which the names and the deeds of men are registered, are to determine the decisions of the judgment.\\" \\"As the books of record are opened in the judgment, the lives of all who have believed on Jesus come in review before God. Beginning with those who first lived upon the earth, our Advocate presents the cases of each successive generation, and closes with the living. Every name is mentioned, every case closely investigated.\\"The Great Controversy , Ellen G. White, chapter 28. The Judgment will show those who are authentic believers in God from those who are not. \\"All who have truly repented of sin, and by faith claimed the blood of Christ as their atoning sacrifice, have had pardon entered against their names in the books of heaven; as they have become partakers of the righteousness of Christ, and their characters are found to be in harmony with the law of God, their sins will be blotted out, and they themselves will be accounted worthy of eternal life.\\" On the other hand, \\"When any have sins remaining upon the books of record, unrepented of and unforgiven, their names will be blotted out of the book of life, and the record of their good deeds will be erased from the book of God's remembrance.\\" \\"Sins that have not been repented of and forsaken will not be pardoned and blotted out of the books of record, but will stand to witness against the sinner in the day of God.\\" During the judgment, Satan will bring accusations of transgression and unbelief against believers, while Jesus acts as defense. \\"Jesus will appear as their advocate, to plead in their behalf before God.\\" \\"While Jesus is pleading for the subjects of His grace, Satan accuses them before God as transgressors.\\" Adventists claim that the good news of the judgment is that Jesus is not only the Attorney, but He is also the Judge (). With Jesus as Attorney and Judge, there is nothing to fear.Venden, M., 1984, Uncommon Ground, p. 40 For a long time, Adventists held the concept that the pre-advent judgment was only concerned with God judging mankind and deciding their eternal destiny. Increasingly the statement is being made that God already “knows who are his,” and certainly does not need years to pore over books to inform Himself.The following several paragraphs are a synthesis of Venden, Morris, 1984, \\"The Hour of God's Judgment,\\" Uncommon Ground: A look at the distinctive beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists, pps. 34-40 But, beginning in the 1950s and on through the 1970s, Edward Heppenstall began teaching that there were bigger issues involved in the pre- advent judgment than just humans. Heppenstall's protégés, Hans LaRondelle, Raoul Dederen and Morris Venden, through the 70s and 80s, taught an understanding of the purpose of the pre-advent judgment that includes humans, Satan, the entire universe, and even God Himself.Knight, George, 2000, A Search for Identity, pp. 173 Relationship to the Great Controversy The doctrine of the Investigative Judgment is closely linked to the Great Controversy theme, another uniquely Adventist teaching. As the judgment proceeds, angels and \\"heavenly intelligences\\" will watch closely. \\"The deepest interest manifested among men in the decisions of earthly tribunals but faintly represents the interest evinced in the heavenly courts when the names entered in the book of life come up in review before the Judge of all the earth.\\" The result of the judgment, in separating out true from false believers, \\"vindicates the justice of God in saving those who believe in Jesus\\" (quoted from 28 fundamental beliefs). \\"All [will] come to understand and agree that God is right; that He has no responsibility for the sin problem. His character will emerge unassailable, and His government of love will be reaffirmed.\\"Seventh-day Adventists Believe (A Biblical Exposition of 27 Fundamental Doctrines), copyright 1988. Chapter 23, page 325. Relationship to the sanctuary doctrine As has been mentioned, the doctrine of the Investigative Judgment is an integral part of the Seventh-day Adventist doctrine of the sanctuary. As true believers are found righteous in the judgment, their sins are removed or \\"blotted\\" from record by the atoning blood of Jesus Christ. This is believed to have been foreshadowed by the work of the High Priest in the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16). The investigative judgment is the final phase of Christ's atoning work, which began on the cross and continued after his ascension in the Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary. Relationship to eschatology Although the time of the commencement of the Investigative Judgment is clear (1844), no one can know when it will end. \\"The work of the investigative judgment and the blotting out of sins is to be accomplished before the second advent of the Lord.\\" However, \\"silently, unnoticed as the midnight thief, will come the decisive hour which marks the fixing of every man's destiny, the final withdrawal of mercy's offer to guilty men.\\" The end of the Investigative Judgment is termed \\"the close of probation\\" by Seventh-day Adventists. At this point in time, \\"the destiny of all will have been decided for life or death\\". There will be no further opportunity for unbelievers to repent and be saved. Revelation 22:11 is considered to describe the close of probation: \\"Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong; let him who is vile continue to be vile; let him who does right continue to do right; and let him who is holy continue to be holy.\\" Following the close of probation will be a \\"time of trouble\\",See The Great Controversy , Ellen G. White, chapter 39 which will be a period of intense conflict and persecution for God's people (Revelation 13:15-17; 7:14). Shortly afterward, Christ will return in glory (1 Thessalonians 4:15-17; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10) and raise the righteous dead (the \\"first resurrection\\", Revelation 20:4-5), whom he will take to heaven together with the righteous living to share his millennial reign (Revelation 20:6). Just who these \\"righteous\\" are will, of course, have been revealed during the course of the Investigative Judgment. During the millennium, Satan will be imprisoned on earth alone with his demons (Revelation 20:1-3). During this period God's redeemed will be in heaven, having 1000 years to examine the books of Judgment for themselves, ensuring that God has acted fairly in His dealings with humanity. Judgment is committed to those who have walked in human shoes to ensure that the lost have indeed rejected God (Revelation 20:4). At the end of the millennium, Christ will again return to earth with His redeemed to raise the wicked (the \\"second resurrection\\", Revelation 20:5). Satan will then deceive the wicked into attacking God's people (Revelation 20:7-9). At this time, Christ will sit down in final Executive Judgment and the books will be open for all (sinner and saved alike) to see and judge (Revelation 20:11-13). Once all have acknowledged the justice and love of God, the execution of the judgment proceeds. Having already thrown Satan and his demonic henchmen into the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10), God now consigns those who have rejected forgiveness to incineration and eternal death (Revelation 20:15). Those who have accepted forgiveness inherit a recreated, perfect, new earth. (Revelation 21:1-5). Adventists feel that their eschatological message is to sound the cry of Revelation 22:17: \\"The Spirit and the bride say, 'Come.' And let him who hears say, 'Come.' And let him who is thirsty, let him come. And whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.\\" Official belief statements The doctrine of the Investigative Judgment is outlined in item 24, Christ's Ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary, of the Seventh-day Adventist fundamental beliefs. In the original Fundamental Beliefs of 1980 it was item 23, but when item 11 was added by the General Conference in 2005 it was changed to item 24. Previous statements The doctrine as featured in the earlier published beliefs was often spread out across multiple statements. For example, in the beliefs published in 1872 the wording now found in belief 24, titled \\"Christ's Ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary\\", was spread out over belief statements 2, 9, 10 and 18 (as designated at that time by Roman numerals). :Fundamental Principles taught and practiced by Seventh-day Adventists, 1872. :- II - :That there is one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Eternal Father, the one by whom God created all things, and by whom they do consist; that he took on him the nature of the seed of Abraham for the redemption of our fallen race; that he dwelt among men full of grace and truth, lived our example, died our sacrifice, was raised for our justification, ascended on high to be our only mediator in the sanctuary in Heaven, where, with his own blood, he makes atonement for our sins; which atonement, so far from being made on the cross, which was but the offering of the sacrifice, is the very last portion of his work as priest, according to the example of the Levitical priesthood, which foreshadowed and prefigured the ministry of our Lord in Heaven. See Leviticus ch. 16, Hebrews 8:4, 5; 9:6, 7; &c.; :- IX - :That the mistake of Adventists in 1844 pertained to the nature of the event then to transpire, not to the time; that no prophetic period is given to reach to the second advent, but that the longest one, the two thousand and three hundred days of Daniel 8:14, terminated in that year, and brought us to an event called the cleansing of the sanctuary. :- X - :That the sanctuary of the new covenant is the tabernacle of God in Heaven, of which Paul speaks in Hebrews 8, and onward, of which our Lord, as great High Priest, is minister; that this sanctuary is the antitype of the Mosaic tabernacle, and that the priestly work of our Lord, connected therewith, is the antitype of the work of the Jewish priests of the former dispensation, Hebrews 8:1-5, &c.; that this is the sanctuary to be cleansed at the end of the 2300 days, what is termed its cleansing being in this case, as in the type, simply the entrance of the high priest into the most holy place, to finish the round of service connected therewith, by blotting out and removing from the sanctuary the sins which had been transferred to it by means of the ministration in the first apartment, Hebrews 9:22, 23; and that this work, in the antitype, commencing in 1844, occupies a brief but indefinite space, at the conclusion of which the work of mercy for the world is finished. :- XVIII - :That the time for the cleansing of the sanctuary, synchronizing with the time of the proclamation of the third message, is a time of investigative judgment, first with reference to the dead, and at the close of probation with reference to the living, to determine who of the myriads now sleeping in the dust of the earth are worthy of a part in the first resurrection, and who of its living multitudes are worthy of translation—points which must be determined before the Lord appears. In the 1931 statement of beliefs, the beliefs comprising the Investigative Judgment doctrine were placed in sequence as statements 13, 14, 15 and 16. :Item 13, Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists, 1931. :That no prophetic period is given in the Bible to reach to the Second Advent, but that the longest one, the 2300 days of Daniel 8:14, terminating in 1844, reaches to an event called the cleansing of the sanctuary (Daniel 8:14; 9:24, 25; Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). :Item 14, Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists, 1931. :That the true sanctuary, of which the tabernacle on earth was a type, is the temple of God in heaven, of which Paul speaks in Hebrews 8 and onward, and of which the Lord Jesus, as our great high priest, is minister. The priestly work of our Lord is the antitype of the work of the Jewish priests of the former dispensation. That this heavenly sanctuary is the one to be cleansed at the end of the 2300 days of Daniel 8:14, its cleansing being, as in the type, a work of judgment, beginning with the entrance of Christ as the high priest upon the judgment phase of His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary, foreshadowed in the earthly service of cleansing the sanctuary on the Day of Atonement. This work of judgment in the heavenly sanctuary began in 1844. Its completion will close human probation (Daniel 7:9, 10; 8:14; Hebrews 8:1, 2, 5; Revelation 20:12; Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). :Item 15, Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists, 1931. :That God, in the time of the judgment and in accordance with His uniform dealing with the human family in warning them of coming events vitally affecting their destiny (Amos 3:6, 7), sends forth a proclamation of the approach of the Second Advent of Christ; that this work is symbolized by the three angels of Revelation 14, and that their threefold message brings to view a work of reform to prepare a people to meet Him at His coming (Amos 3:6, 7; 2 Corinthians 5:10; Revelation 14:6-12). :Item 16, Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists, 1931. :That the time of the cleansing of the sanctuary, synchronizing with the period of the proclamation of the message of Revelation 14, is a time of investigative judgment, first, with reference to the dead, and second, with reference to the living. This investigative judgment determines who of the myriads sleeping in the dust of the earth are worthy of a part in the first resurrection, and who of its living multitudes are worthy of translation (1 Peter 4:17, 18; Daniel 7:9, 10; Revelation 14:6, 7; Luke 20:35). Every five years the Adventist World Church meets in session to review current issues, add doctrinal statements and clarify church positions. Although a significant restatement of the published beliefs took place in 1980 General Conference session, the church has chosen to leave the doctrinal statement on the Investigative judgment virtually unchanged from its formulation in the 1870s. Other statements and significant publications The constitution of the Adventist Theological Society affirms the doctrine of the Investigative Judgment. Official Adventist publications such as Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine (1957). and [Seventh-day Adventists believe] (1988). defend the church's traditional teaching. Documents publicly available on the Biblical Research Institute's website. support and defend the traditional doctrine with reference to Scripture. The 2006 third quarter Adult Bible Study Guide produced by the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference, was entitled The Gospel, 1844, and Judgment, and strongly upholds and defends the church's traditional 1844 doctrine. The preface to the study guide states that \\"From this doctrine, perhaps more than any other, our distinct identity as Seventh- day Adventists arises.\\". History The emphasis of this belief has evolved over time, but the basis is the same. The year 1844 is believed to be the time Christ commenced a new phase of ministry in the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary, symbolised by the Day of Atonement ceremony described in Leviticus 16.; as cited by Cottrell. In the years immediately after World War II, Adventism tended to view the judgment in stern tones and the teaching has increasingly been understood as God on the side of people.. Smuts van Rooyen describes a \\"string of changing interpretations we have given this prophecy from Second Coming, to Shut Door, to Investigative Judgment, to cleansing the Living Temple, to Vindication of God’s Character, to simple Pre-advent Judgment...\\"\\" of Milton Hook's biography of Desmond Ford Origins William Miller and his followers, the Millerite Adventist movement, consisted of a group of about 50,000 believers expecting Jesus Christ to return to earth on October 22, 1844. They arrived at this date from an interpretation of the Bible verse . They understood the 2300 days to represent 2300 years (according to the day-year principle of prophetic interpretation), a time period stretching from the biblical era to the nineteenth century. However, Miller had not been the first to arrive at this interpretation, as he himself emphasized. Others had earlier concluded that a prophetic period of 2300 years was to end \\"around the year 1843\\" (Miller's earlier estimate).; as cited by Cottrell. When Jesus did not return as expected (an event which Adventists call the \\"Great Disappointment\\"), several alternative interpretations of the prophecy were put forward. The majority of Millerites abandoned the 1844 date; however, about 50 members. out of the larger group of 50,000 (including Hiram Edson and O. R. L. Crosier) concluded that the event predicted by Daniel 8:14 was not the second coming, but rather Christ's entrance into the Most Holy Place of the heavenly sanctuary. In particular, Edson claimed to have had a vision as he crossed a cornfield on the morning after the Great Disappointment, a revelation which led to a series of Bible studies with other Millerites to confirm the validity of his solution. Edson's vision became the foundation for the Adventist doctrine of the sanctuary, and the people who held it became the nucleus of what would emerge from other \\"Adventist\\" groups as the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The revelation was greatly encouraging for the [Seventh-day] Adventists. As Ellen White wrote later, \\"The scripture which above all others had been both the foundation and the central pillar of the advent faith, was the declaration, 'Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed (quoting Daniel 8:14).\\"The correct understanding of the ministration in the heavenly sanctuary is the foundation of our faith.\\" White, Evangelism, p 221. As cited by Cottrell She also predicted that criticism of the belief would come.\\"Not one pin is to be removed from that which the Lord has established. The enemy will bring in false theories, such as the doctrine that there is no sanctuary. This is one of the points on which there will be a departing from the faith.\\" Ellen White, Evangelism, pp. 221, 224; as quoted by Cottrell James White, Crosier, and also Uriah Smith supported the belief. Some critics accused Ellen White of plagiarising from Uriah Smith and other authors on this subject. Those claims were refuted by James White as late as 1851.Eryl Cummings, \\"The Bible Alone\\". Spectrum 11:2 (November 1980), p64–65 The Millerites initially held that although the second coming of Christ had not occurred on October 22, the \\"close of probation\\" had occurred on that day. They based this belief on their understanding of the parable of the 10 virgins found in Matthew 25 in which the door of salvation is shut. They believed it was too late to be saved if one had not been through the Millerite experience, while they still anxiously expected that Jesus would return to Earth within their lifetimes. However they shortly began to experience that some of the people they were communicating with were accepting Christ and being converted. The interpretation of Christ's ministry of sanctuary cleansing gave them a theological framework by which to process this.. This \\"shut-door\\" belief was linked to the sanctuary doctrine.. This paper was presented publicly to groups at least twice – in 2001 Cottrell presented it to the , and 2002 Larry Christoffel, associate pastor of the Campus Hill Church of Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California delivered it to the San Diego Adventist Forum; Cottrell was present and both fielded questions. Some footnotes are missing in the link provided. Adventist Today hosts a version in 14 parts – see and for the missing footnotes The shut-door aspect was abandoned by the early 1850s. Robert W. Olson wrote in a formative 1982 document whilst White Estate director: Over time, Adventists came to believe that the \\"cleansing\\" of the heavenly sanctuary involves a work of judgment as depicted in the courtroom scene of Daniel 7:9-13 immediately prior to the second coming of Christ described in Daniel 7:14. In the 1850s, J. N. Loughborough and Uriah Smith began to teach that a judgment had begun in 1844 when Christ entered the Most Holy Place. Subsequently, in 1857, James White (husband of Ellen G. White) wrote in the Review and Herald (now the Adventist Review) that an \\"investigative judgment\\" was taking place in heaven, in which the lives of professed believers would pass in review before God. This is the first time that the phrase \\"investigative judgment\\" was used. The doctrine of the Investigative Judgment was given its most thorough exposition in chapter 28—Facing Life's Record of The Great Controversy by Ellen G. White. Perfectionist interpretation The purpose of this judgment is to vindicate the saints before the onlooking universe, to prepare them for Christ's imminent Second Coming, and to demonstrate God's righteous character in His dealings with humanity. This judgment will also separate true believers from those who falsely claim to be ones. For early Adventists, the Investigative Judgment was closely aligned to their understanding of how one is saved with its strong emphasis on free will and character development. They believed that the end of the Investigative Judgment (the \\"close of probation\\") will mark a point in time immediately before the Second Coming of Christ, when all of humanity will have made their final decision for or against God. Christians still living during this time will be sealed and their spiritual state unchanged by further events, despite Christ's departure from the sanctuary, due to the final sealing work of the Holy Spirit (Revelation 22:11-12) as evidenced by a relationship with Jesus and obedience to His commandments (Revelation 14:12). Therefore, the \\"cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary\\" by Christ during the investigative judgment was thought to involve a parallel \\"cleansing\\" of the lives of believers on earth. Many of the Adventist Church pioneers came out of the Methodist or Wesleyan/Arminian branches of Protestantism which tended to have a view of emphasis on sanctification and the possibility of moral perfection in this life.SINLESS SAINTS OR SINLESS SINNERS? by Rolf J. Poehler, page 2 Ellen White in The Great Controversy wrote the following of the perfection of those saints who stand at the end while Christ still intercedes in the Most Holy Place, and what would happen when His work was done: The urgency for attaining perfection comes from the knowledge that the remnant must live perfectly during the time of trouble at the end to prove to the universe that fallen human beings can keep the law of God. Ellen White states, \\"When He leaves the sanctuary, darkness covers the inhabitants of the earth. In that fearful time the righteous must live in the sight of a holy God without an intercessor.\\" (GC 614). And explains this is necessary because the \\"earthliness\\" of the remnant must be cleansed that the image of Christ may be perfectly reflected: The Adventist Pioneers held to the belief of overcoming sin and all who will can be overcomers,[S.D.A. Bible Commentary Vol. 7, Page 974] and \\"that the final generation would become perfected, or sinless, men.\\"http://www.presenttruthmag.com/7dayadventist/SDAPart1/1.html Ellen White wrote \\"Our Saviour does not require impossibilities of any soul. He expects nothing of His disciples that He is not willing to give them grace and strength to perform. He would not call upon them to be perfect if He had not at His command every perfection of grace to bestow on the ones upon whom He would confer so high and holy a privilege\\", and \\"Our work is to strive to attain in our sphere of action the perfection that Christ in His life on the earth attained in every phase of character. He is our example. In all things we are to strive to honor God in character. ... We are to be wholly dependent on the power that He has promised to give us.\\"Our Father Cares, Page 214. TMK 130 (MS 148,1902) In addition to the many writings of Ellen White there were many others that wrote on the Great Controversy theme and how Christ withstood temptations and conquered the same as we may conquer. One of the most well known was A. T. Jones a Seventh-day Adventist known for his impact on the theology of the church, along with his friend and associate Ellet J. Waggoner. Both of who were key participants in the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference Session a landmark event in the history of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In addition to the message of righteousness by faith, A. T. Jones held that Christ was made \\"in all things\\" like unto us, or the fallen nature of mankind after Adam and yet overcame sin as our example and the perfection of character, is the Christian goal.The Consecrated Way – A.T Jones, pg 28 and was also our example and there must be a moral and spiritual perfection of the believers before the end time. In the Consecrated Way, he wrote: Some controversy arose during the early 1900s about the interpretation of the meaning in Ellen White's book \\"The Great Controversy\\" on what she states, especially. This statement appeared to teach a works-oriented eschatological soteriology. This led to an emerging which can be broadly described as \\"sinless perfectionists\\", rather than a progressive sanctification instilling the perfect character of Christ through the Holy Spirit of the living saints at the end who are sealed. This perfectionist understanding was expounded by M. L. Andreasen, in his view of \\"last generation\\" perfection and tends to be held by historic Adventism. Adventists believe that sanctification is a progressive or continuing work,The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, p. 244. but there is a time when it ends, and this is special time for the end time believers. This occurs when Christ atoning ministry in the heavenly sanctuary finishes and the investigative judgment ends. The completion of this ministry of Christ will mark the close of probation \\"before the Second Advent\\", (Fundamental Belief no. 24). Adventist hold that there is group of those living at this period just before the second coming of Christ, which the saints live without an intercessor till Christ appears. This is the remnant alive at the close of probation, which are described as the saints that are sealed, showing the perfect character of Christ, and this is where Adventist make the connection with the 144,000 to the remnant, those \\"without fault before the throne of God\\". Critics emerge Progressive Adventist, Raymond Cottrell claims the investigative judgment has received \\"more criticism and debate, by both Adventists and non-Adventists, than all other facets of its belief system combined.\\" He points out Dudley M. Canright, who left the church, was the first major critic in 1887.. Cottrell writes he was \\"[t]he first church leader of record to question the sanctuary doctrine\\" He was followed by Albion F. Ballenger who was disfellowshipped around 1905.. See note 20; as cited by Cottrell According to one author, the doctrine evolved as a reaction against Ballenger.Lowell Tarling, The Edges of Seventh-day Adventism William Fletcher resigned in 1930 when he disagreed with the traditional understanding and later published his views.. See especially pp. 111–12, where he quotes a plaintive letter to Ellen White; as cited by Cottrell Louis R. Conradi had his ministerial credentials removed, and chose to leave the church in 1931.. Raymond Cottrell says William W. Prescott believed there were some flaws, and shared it privately with a few church leaders who became critics. According to Cottrell, he stated, c. 1930, \\"I have waited all these years for someone to make an adequate answer to Ballenger, Fletcher and others on their positions re. the sanctuary but I have not seen or heard it.\\"Prescott, as quoted by Cottrell He did stay in the church, unlike the others above. Harold E. Snide of what is now Southern Adventist University withdrew from the church around 1945. Robert A. Greive was an Australian leader who did not criticise the sanctuary, but instead promoted other beliefs which were hence viewed as incompatible with an investigative judgment. His credentials were removed in 1956, and he left the church.Desmond Ford, Daniel 8:14, the Day of Atonement, and the Investigative Judgment; Glacier View edition pp.89–95, printed edition pp.55–61; as cited by Cottrell Some critics such as Canright and Ballenger \\"embarked on vendettas against the church\\" after leaving, whereas Cottrell and Desmond Ford continued to profess support for the church. 1950-1980 In the 1950s, evangelical/fundamentalist Christians Donald Barnhouse and especially Walter Martin engaged in dialogue with Adventist leaders. (Key Adventist representatives produced the book Questions on Doctrine which gave answers to their questions about the church. Based on this theology, Martin and Barnhouse asserted that Adventists were indeed legitimate Christians. The book was not accepted by all Adventists themselves, and Martin and Barnhouse's conclusion was also controversial within their community; however the dialogues gradually led to Adventists being seen as much more mainstream or evangelical.) They believed Adventists were largely in harmony with the gospel, except for the sanctuary and Ellen White's authority. Barnhouse criticized, According to Raymond Cottrell, the editors of the Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary in 1955 found it \\"hopelessly impossible\\" to combine both solid Bible scholarship with what Adventists believed and taught about and . In 1958 when revising Bible Readings for republication, Cottrell sought the opinion of 27 North American Adventist theologians who knew Hebrew, and also heads of religion departments, concerning the interpretation of Daniel 8:14. Without exception, the scholars responded by acknowledging \\"that there is no valid linguistic or contextual basis for the traditional interpretation of Daniel 8:14.\\"Raymond Cottrell, \\"1844 Revisionists Not New: President Indicts the Church's Scholars \\". Adventist Today 3 (January–February 1995), p16\\"Report of a Poll of Adventist Bible Scholars Concerning Daniel 8:14 and Hebrews 9\\" by CottrellDr Cottrell I J After being notified, the General Conference appointed a secret \\"Committee on Problems in the Book of Daniel\\", which met from 1961 to 1966 but was unable to reach a consensus. (In 2001 Cottrell would publicly criticize the doctrine, yet remained an Adventist. He also wrote papers\\"...Asset or Liability?\\" by Cottrell was presented in 2001. Additionally, footnote 25 lists his papers on the topic. and a lengthy book on the subject – Eschatology of Daniel. It remained unpublished, and Cottrell stated, \\"the manuscript awaits a climate of openness and objectivity in the church, which is essential to a fair examination of the facts.\\")Raymond Cottrell collection , a register of Cottrell's papers held at Andrews University According to Desmond Ford, the belief had not been taught for several decades at the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary at Andrews University, but was revived in the 1960s by Robert Brinsmead, who linked it with perfectionism.Desmond Ford on the Bible Answer Man program with Walter Martin. Audio here Desmond Ford convinced Brinsmead that his perfectionism was incorrect and Brinsmead came to reject it,\\"Righteousness by Faith\\" entry in Historical Dictionary of Seventh-day Adventists by Gary Landhttp://www.presenttruthmag.com/7dayadventist/shaking/7.html and Brinsmead in the 1970s attempted to convince leading Adventist theologians Ford and Edward Heppenstall to write a refutation of it.Where is Robert Brinsmead? by Larry Pahl; Adventist Today 7:3 (May/June 1999) Brinsmead said he hesitated \\"blasting this theology because I thought someone from within Adventism should do it.\\" After Ford and Heppenstall declined, Brinsmead authored the critical work 1844 Re-Examined. He later \\"swung from one extreme to the other and had moved over to Ford's position on righteousness by faith.\\"Knight, George R., 2000, A Search for Identity, p.174 Desmond Ford Australian Desmond Ford was a theologian in the church. In 1979 he addressed an Adventist Forums meeting at Pacific Union College critiquing the doctrine.. This was viewed with concern and he was given leave to write up his views. In August 1980 the \\"Sanctuary Review Committee\\" met at Glacier View Ranch in Colorado to discuss Ford's views. Ford had written nearly 1000-pages titled Daniel 8:14, the Day of Atonement and the Investigative Judgement.. The Glacier View meeting produced two consensus statements and formulated a ten-point summary that highlighted major points of difference between Ford's positions and traditional Adventist teaching.Sanctuary Debate Documents, Spectrum volume 11, no. 2 (Nov 1980) Ultimately, the church's administration took action against Ford, revoking his ministerial credentials one month after Glacier View. Special issues of Ministry and Spectrum covered the event.... A number of ministers resigned in the wake of Glacier View because they supported Ford's theology. By one count, 182 pastors in Australia and New Zealand left between 1980 and 1988, equivalent to \\"an astonishing 40 percent of the total ministerial workforce\\" in those countries. This amounts to \\"the most rapid and massive exit of Adventist pastors in the movement’s 150-year history\\" (although he cautions that the fallout may have involved more than one factor). Cottrell believes Ford has given more scholarly study to the belief and written more on it than any other person in history. Ford subsequently formed the independent ministry Good News Unlimited and criticized many of the related church beliefs. Subsequent history Following Glacier View, the church formed an 18-member committee called the \\"Daniel and Revelation Study Committee\\" under the Biblical Research Institute, in order to study and re- evaluate the traditional Adventist understanding of the investigative judgment. This committee has produced the seven-volume Daniel and Revelation Committee Series, with main contributing authors William H. Shea and Frank B. Holbrook.Available from the General Conference's Biblical Research Institute bookshop (website) Five cover the biblical Book of Daniel, and two the Book of Revelation. Ford has claimed that a number of \\"key figures\\" privately agreed with his views about the investigative judgment, but refrained from speaking publicly on the issue for fear of losing their employment. Arthur Patrick saw Glacier View as a milestone in the theological development of the church, and that the effects of this controversy continue to be felt today. Morris Venden's portrayal of the investigative judgment emphasizes the fairness of God as a judge,Venden, Morris, Modern Parables, 1994 He emphasized the grace of God. Recent critics include Dale Ratzlaff, who left the church following the Ford crisis,Ratzlaff later published his critique of the investigative judgment in Cultic Doctrine of Seventh-day Adventists, 2001 and former lecturer Jerry Gladson.A Theologian's Journey from Seventh-day Adventism to Mainstream Christianity by Gladson, 2001 Today the doctrine of the Investigative Judgment is widely accepted within Seventh-day Adventism, among the laity as well as clergy and scholars. The non-biblical aspects of sanctuary teaching that arose in the middle of last century which became discordant with Scriptural soteriology have been dropped, and the doctrine is comfortably viewed in the context of God's continuing work to redeem humanity. Criticism of the doctrine There has been criticism by non-Adventist theologians, and some progressive Adventists disagree with the doctrine of the investigative judgment as it is traditionally taught by the church. Criticism has been leveled at the doctrine at the following points: Lack of biblical basis—Some have claimed that the doctrine has very little scriptural support for it or that it is based on the King James Version of the Bible rather than current translations, or is based almost exclusively on the writings of Ellen G. White. Miller used an English Bible concordance, and found word parallels in English when sometimes the original language was different. It has been criticized for relying on the \\"prooftext\\" method, in which disparate Bible verses are linked but sometimes out of context. Questionable origins—Critics have drawn attention to the fact that the sanctuary doctrine did not initially arise from biblical exegesis, but as a response to William Miller’s 1844 mistake. Donald Barnhouse denounced the doctrine as \\"the most colossal, psychological, face-saving phenomenon in religious history\\".Donald Barnhouse, Eternity 7:67, September 1956 Likewise, religion scholar Anthony Hoekema stated that the doctrine was \\"simply a way out of an embarrassing predicament\\" and therefore \\"a doctrine built on a mistake\\". It has been pointed out that the doctrine was rejected by Miller himself. Unusual interpretation of prophecy — The 1844 date is based on an interpretation of a biblical verse (Daniel 8:14) that is exclusive to the Millerite/Adventist movement. According to modern Preterist commentators, Daniel 8:14 refers to 2300 evening and morning sacrifices, and therefore covers a period of 1,150 days (or 3.5 years); it refers to the desecration of the temple by Antiochus Epiphanes which began in 167 B.C. and ended 3.5 years later when the Maccabees regained control of the temple and reinstituted their services. Different view of the Atonement—Protestant Christianity has traditionally taught that Jesus Christ performed his work of atonement on the Cross, and that his sacrificial death brought to fulfillment the entire Old Testament sacrificial system, including the Day of Atonement. The idea that the Day of Atonement does not meet its antitype until 18 centuries after Jesus' crucifixion is a deviation from historic Christian theology.Desmond Ford, Glacier View manuscript Lack of support from Christian tradition—No church besides the Seventh-day Adventist denomination teaches this doctrine. It is difficult to see how such a significant doctrine could be so widely overlooked. Faith vs. works—the doctrine of the Investigative Judgment seems to give works an undue place in salvation. On a strict reading of Ellen G. White, a Christian might be disqualified from salvation by failing to repent of every single sin. This seems to contradict the Reformation understanding of \\"salvation by grace through faith alone\\". Passage of time – Although the original exponents of the doctrine expected the investigative judgment to be a very brief period, about 170 years have now passed since the year 1844. The ever-increasing span of time between 1844 and the second coming casts significant doubt on the validity of the belief.Norman Young, \\"A Reluctant Participant Looks Back at Glacier View\\". Paper presented at Sydney Adventist Forum, 22 October 2005. A condensed version was later published in Adventist Today 14:6, p.7-9 The Hebrew Calendar – Rabbi Loschak affirms that, “It is impossible for Yom Kippur to occur that late in the month of October (October 22) no matter what alleged change (to the Jewish calendar) there may have been. Simply put the Torah tells us that the first month of the Jewish year is the month of Passover which must occur in the Spring, and the latest secular date it can start is about April 19. Yom Kippur is always 173 days after this date, and that would be October 9. There is no way it could work out to be October 22.\\" All Hebrew calendars universally agree that Yom Kippur (which is the 10th day of Tishrei), in the year 1844 A.D. (Hebrew year 5605) actually occurred on September 23.HebCal.com , rosettacalendar.com abdicate.net , chabad.org Lack of confidence within Adventism – Raymond F. Cottrell, claimed that the investigative judgment doctrine lacks support within Adventist academia and point to the “Committee on Problems in the book of Daniel”, convened in the 1960s, which failed to produce any conclusions despite 5 years of labour. However, see the 7 volumes produced by the Biblical Research Institute on Daniel & Revelation.Daniel and Revelation Committee Series According to Cottrell, :\\"In the years immediately following October 22, 1844 the traditional sanctuary doctrine was an important asset for stabilizing the faith of disappointed Adventists. Today it is an equally significant liability and deterrent to the faith, confidence, and salvation of biblically literate Adventists and non-Adventists alike. It was present truth following the great disappointment on October 22, 1844. It is not present truth in the year of our Lord 2002. Quod erat demonstrandum!\\" Cottrell also claimed that disciplining of ordained ministers due to theology was inconsistent – that one may believe Christ was a created being, legalism or works-oriented salvation, or the non- literalness of the Genesis creation account without losing their credentials; yet lists many who have lost their jobs regarding the investigative judgment.Cottrell Lack of pastoral relevance—Individuals such as Desmond Ford and John McLarty have said that in practice, the investigative judgment is not preached in churches. McLarty claims that the doctrine \\"is not helpful in providing spiritual care for real people in the real world\\".\\"Problems with 1844\\", Adventist Today vol. 14 issue 6, 2006 Response from other Christian churches Non-Adventist Christian churches and theologians have found that the investigative judgment is a doctrine with which they cannot agree. In a discussion between Adventist leaders and representatives from the World Evangelical Alliance in August 2007, the investigative judgment was noted as one of three points of doctrinal disagreement (the other two being the Sabbath and the authoritative role of Ellen G. White). Adventist Response to Critics Lack of biblical basis—According to apologists this criticism is no longer valid because Adventist scholars have produced an extensive treatment of the doctrine purely on the basis of Scripture alone.Sausa, Diego D. Kippur—the Final Judgment: Apocalyptic Secrets of the Hebrew Sanctuary, Fort Myers, FL: The Vision Press, 2006. . Aberrant interpretation of prophecy—Before 1844 many Protestant and Catholic theologians supported the day-year principle and, like Miller, advocated that (Daniel 8:14) indeed ends in 1844. The Adventist interpretation is consistent with Jesus own teaching in Matt. 13 and 24. In both instances where He uses the term \\"Abomination of Desolation\\", He points to it as being yet future, not 200 years prior as is required if one believes the application is to Antiochus Epiphanes. Furthermore, the term evening, morning in scripture always indicates a single day i.e.: the evening and the morning were the first day, the evening and the morning were the second day, etc. in Genesis 1. Finally, neither 2300 days, nor 1150 days fits the historical facts of Antiochus Epiphanes profanation of the temple which lasted for 3 years or for his temporal reign which lasted from 175-164BC. Atonement not complete at the cross—According to apologists this criticism is not entirely valid. The Adventist publication \\"The 27 Fundamental Beliefs\\" (pages 110-111) affirms that Christ's atoning sacrifice was completed at the cross and so also does the book Questions on Doctrine (page 375) affirm the Adventist belief that the death of Christ as our Atoning Sacrifice was completed once for all. However Adventists embrace the broad view of the Leviticus 16 \\"Day of Atonement\\" model where the scope for the term \\"Atonement\\" involves not only the sacrifice of the sin offering (Christ's completed atoning sacrifice) - but also the work of the High Priest in the Sanctuary. Many Protestant and Catholic scholars, including some early church fathers, have noted the high priestly ministry of Christ in heaven on the basis of the book of Hebrews. The Adventist link with atonement derives from their Wesleyan-Arminian roots by extending the Wesleyan-Lutheran understanding of the atonement to include the high priestly ministry. Thus, Adventist use the term \\"atonement\\" more broadly than the traditional theology. W. G. C. Murdock, former dean of the SDA theological seminary, stated, \\"Seventh-day Adventists have always believed in a complete atonement that is not completed.\\" The sacrifice of Jesus was indeed complete at the cross. But His sacrifice has not yet completed repairing broken relationships cause by sin, which will only occur after the end of the sinful world.Venden, Morris, 1982, Good News and Bad News about the Judgment, Pacific Press, p. 87 Salvation by works—Seventh-day Adventists do not believe in salvation by works. Adventist doctrine states that salvation is by faith alone,Questions on Doctrine, Review and Herald Publishing Association 1957 p.142 but they note that faith without works is dead as we find in James 2. In the Gospel of John (John 14:15), Jesus said \\"If you love me, keep my commandments.\\" Only those who have been born- again and walk in the Spirit (Romans 8:4) could ever love Jesus. Adventists point out that under the New Covenant (as listed in Hebrews chapter 8) the saints receive the Law of God written on the heart and mind, so for the saints keeping His commands is \\"not burdensome\\" (1John 5:3). Adventists insist that Christ's command to \\"keep My Commandments\\" was not given as a means of salvation, rather, keeping his commands is the fruit of a changed life. As Christ states in John 15 obedience is the result of love. In the Adventist view of sanctification, works of obedience come about as a result of love that is born of faith in the Savior. Passage of time since 1844—Adventists counter this criticism by noting that Christ's Holy Place ministry in heaven lasted for 1800 years and that during His Most Holy Place ministry in heaven the door of salvation remains open to all who seek Him. The close of probation for mankind does not come before the fulfillment of certain eschatological prophecies predicted in the Book of Revelation and still future to human history. Judgment continues in heaven as long as there are individuals that accept salvation until the close of probation. Adventists reject Calvinistic predestination. Such a decision makes judgment a necessary part of the divine plan of salvation (Wesleyan-Arminian concept). Adventists use the term \\"atonement\\" in harmony with the \\"Day of Atonement\\" service found in Leviticus 16. That service includes both the death of the sin offering, and the ministry of the high priest in the sanctuary before the full scope of atonement is completed. Many Christians today limit their concept of atonement to the point where the sin offering has been made and is completed. This difference in the way the term is defined by the various groups within Christendom has been a source of some undue criticism.

It is a magical domain of the Grail keeper, often known as the Fisher King. The castle's descriptions vary greatly in different sources, and it first appears by that name in the Lancelot-Grail cycle where it is also the birthplace of Galahad.  Grail castle  In Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail (c. 1190), one of the first works to mention the Grail, it is given no name other then being known as the castle of the Fisher King. As in the later works, the castle is given qualities of Celtic Otherworld (including its invisibility from the outside and seemingly changing locations), as the story's original Grail hero Perceval visits it only when invited and then cannot find it again despite searching for years. In Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, based on Chrétien, the Grail castle's name is Munsalväsche (rendering of Monsalvat, in medieval tradition associated with the name of the mountain Montserrat in Catalonia). There, the castle is the home of a secret society of temple knights who guard the Grail (here a precious stone) from the outside world. In the Perlesvaus continuation of Perceval, it is called the Castle of Souls but originally was called Eden. The Grail is kept with other holy relics at the castle's Grail Chapel, from which they vanish during the time when the castle is conquered by Perceval's evil uncle. Corbenic In the 13th-century Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate) prose cycle, the castle is named as Corbenic for the first time. In the highly Christian mystical Vulgate Quest for the Holy Grail, it is the home of the Grail family from the lineages of Jesus' followers Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, whose history is told in the cycle's prologue, the Vulgate Joseph. The ruler of Corbenic is King Pelles. Lancelot at Corbenic in decorative woodcuts from a 1488 printed edition of part of the Lancelot-Grail cycle As befits the castle of the Grail, Corbenic is a place of marvels, including, at various times, a maiden trapped in a magically boiling cauldron, a dragon, and a room where (depending on text) either an angelic knight or arrows assail any who try to spend the night there. As told in Le Morte d'Arthur, witnessing some of these wonders cause Bors to name it the Castle Adventurous, \\"for here be many strange adventures\\" (Morte, Caxton XI). Yet it can also appear quite ordinary: on an earlier occasion, according to the Lancelot-Grail, the same Bors visited without noticing anything unusual. (Perhaps conscious of this apparent contradiction, T.H. White in his modern The Once and Future King treats Corbenic as two separate places: Corbin is the relatively mundane dwelling-place of King Pelles, while Carbonek is the mystical castle where the climax of the Grail Quest takes place.) Corbenic has a town, and a bridge which Bromell la Pleche swears to defend against all comers for a year, for love of Pelles' daughter Elaine (Morte, Caxton XI-XII). It is on the coast, or at least is mystically moved there for the purposes of the Grail Quest: Lancelot arrives at Corbenic by sea at the climax of his personal quest. Corbenic's seaward gate is guarded by two lions, aided by either a dwarf (Morte, Caxton XVII) or a flaming hand (Lancelot-Grail). Lancelot's arrival results in his and Elaine's conception of Galahad, the new Grail hero of the prose cycles. It is unclear whether Corbenic is to be identified with the castle inadvertently levelled by Balin when he delivers the Dolorous Stroke upon King Pellam in the Post-Vulgate Merlin (Morte, Caxton II); if so, then Corbenic is in Listeneise (and is presumably rebuilt at some point). The Lancelot-Grail gives the name of its kingdom only as the Land Beyond. Cor-beneic : 'Blessed Horn' and 'Blessed Body' Helaine Newstead and Roger Sherman Loomis have presented a convincing case for the origins of the name Corbenic in a myth concerning a type of Welsh cornucopia - to wit, the horn (of plenty) of Brân the Blessed, a magical, food-providing talisman. The argument hinges on confusion resulting from two possible meanings for the Old French li cors (a nominative case form) which can mean both 'the body' (Modern French le corps) and 'the horn' (Modern French la corne), leading to the mistranslation, by Christian authors, of li cors beneit as the blessed body - the latter readily construed as a reference either to the body of Christ or to the body of a saint preserved as a holy relic. The common scribal error of misreading the letter 't' as a 'c' yielded the second element -ben(e)ic. The original name of Castle Corbenic can thus be reconstructed as Chastiaus del Cor Beneit - the Castle of the Blessed Horn (of Brân) - subsequently misunderstood to mean the Castle of the Blessed Body (of Christ). The origins of the maimed Fisher King, master of the Grail Castle of Corbenic may be found in the maimed King Brân the Blessed, whose story is told in Branwen ferch Llŷr, second of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi.Loomis, Roger Sherman, Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance first pub.

It is on the river Sankosh.It is a border town in between Dhubri and Kokrajhar Districts of Assam. The distance between Dhubri and Sapatgram is 47.6 km. Demographics Sapatgram is one of the oldest towns in Dhubri District of Assam. According to the 2011 Census, it is a Class-IV Town. The Town area is 2.95 km2 = 4,123.1 inhabitants/km2. The total population of the town as per 2011 census is 12,163. An average of (+03%) population growth has been recorded in between 2001 and 2011.

In Sapatgram, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age. The town is inhabited by Bengali and Assamese speaking people. History Sapatgram is an ancient human habitation. Originally Sapatgram belonged to the ancient Koch Hajo (1581-1616) Kingdom under Raghudev and his son Parikshit Narayan of the Koch dynasty that stretched from Sankosh river in the west to the Bhareli river in the east on the north bank of River Brahmaputra. It was created by dividing the Kamata Kingdom then under Nara Narayana in medieval Assam. The western boundary, the Sankosh river, is roughly the boundary between the present-day Assam and West Bengal. The western portion of the Kamata Kingdom came to be called Koch Bihar. The name Hajo comes from a legendary king Hajo the Koch, an ancestor of the Koch dynasty, who ruled over the Rangpur district in present-day Bangladesh and some regions of Assam. In 1602, the Nawab of Dhaka and a Mughal governor moved by Lakshmi Narayan (ruler of Koch Bihar) and others attacked Parikshit Narayan, the ruler of Koch Hajo. Parikshit was defeated at Dhubri in 1614. The Mughals then appointed Kabisekhar as the kanungo and instructed Sheikh Ibrahim Karori to set up a Mughal system of administration. The Mughals appointed Bijit Narayan, son of Parikshit Narayan, as the zamindar of the region between river Sankosh and Manas. And he became the founder of the Bijni branch of the Koch royal family which finally settled in Abhayapuri. Sapatgram on the Sonkosh became a part of two estates—Bijni and Porbatjoha. The line of demarcation ran through the middle of the present township of Sapatgram. After the independence Sapatgram came under Goalpara District which was created by the British in 1876. At present Sapatgram is a prominent town of Dhubri district which was created splitting Goalpara district in 1983. Education It possesses five renowned high schools including one English Medium Private School and a High Madrasa. Established in 1936, Sapatgram Bengali High School has earned the fame of one of the earliest sites of quality education in Assam. Sapatgram Amalgamated Academy, the other one, was established in 1939. It has earned comparatively better achievement-records mainly because of its erstwhile Headmaster, Late Panchanon Medhi, who had been acclaimed with ‘Best teacher and educationist’ award by the Central Govt. The town possesses an Arts College named ‘Sapatgram College’. It was established in 1972. The College has already earned the status of ‘a lead site of quality education under Gauhati University, Assam’. Besides, there exists a number of Bengali, Assamese and Hindi medium Primary Schools in this border town in between Dhubri and Kokrajhar district of Assam. The town has a police station (Thana) and a post office. The PIN is 783337. Transport Sapatgram came to the map of Indian Railways in the pre- independence period. The Rail station was established in July, 1928. Though presently degraded because of demographic causes, Sapatgram (SPX) was a major railway station of NF Railway connecting the North East with the rest of India having a passage through Bangladesh. At present the town has excellent road communication avenues also. The river Sankosh has nearly dried up and as such it is no longer used for communication. Occupation and Livelihood Sapatgram was once a distinguished timber-trading centre in Assam. But the main occupation of the locality was cultivation, not timber-business as highlighted in the elitist history. At present the main source of livelihood of the town is cultivation and business. Importance Sapatgram is famous for a huge Hindu Temple named ‘Lilananda Ashram’. The temple was established by Thakur Lilananda in 1946. It is located at a village named ‘Santipur’ at the outskirt of Sapatgram town. The holy shrine possesses a number of temples of various Hindu deities spread in an area of more than one hundred bighas of land. One of the unique features of the temple is its provision for round-the- clock ‘Hari Naam Sankirtan’. This has been going on since the very day of the establishment of the temple.

Lampadarios in the post-Byzantine period designates the leader of the second (left) choir of singers in the Eastern Orthodox church practice.The Harvard dictionary of music By Don Michael Randel Page 126 Lampadarius in Christianity There seems no special reason to attribute to the lampadarii any ecclesiastical character, though their functions were imitated by the acolytes and other clerics who preceded the bishop or celebrant, carrying torches in their hands, in the solemn procession to the altar and in other processions. There is very little evidence that any strictly liturgical use was made of lamps in the early centuries of Christianity. The fact that many of the services took place at night, and that after the lapse of a generation or two the meetings of the Christians for purposes of worship were held, at Rome and elsewhere, in the subterranean chambers of the Catacombs, make it clear that lamps must have been used to provide the necessary means of illumination. Of these lamps, mostly of terra cotta and of small size, many specimens survive some of them plain, some decorated with various Christian symbols. These admit of classification according to period and locality, the finer work, as in so many other branches of Christian art, being as a rule the earlier (see e.g. Leclercq, \\"Manuel d'archeologie chretienne\\" II, 557 seq.). Of the great metal chandeliers with their \\"dolphins\\" —i.e. little arms wrought in that shape and supporting a lamp— which came into vogue with the freedom of the Church in the days of Constantine, something has already been said under the heading Candlesticks. Such \\"polycandela\\" long remained a conspicuous feature of Byzantine worship. For the connection of lamps with the liturgy at an earlier age it may be sufficient to quote a few sentences from a homily of the Syrian Narsai, who died A.D. 512, descriptive of the Liturgy. \\"The priests,\\" he says, \\"are still, and the deacons stand in silence, the whole people is quiet and still, subdued and calm. The altar stands crowned with beauty and splendor, and upon it is the Gospel of life and the adorable wood [i.e. the cross]. The mysteries are set in order, the censers are smoking, the lamps are shining and the deacons are hovering and brandishing [fans] in likeness of watchers\\" (Conolly \\"Liturgical Homilies of Narsai\\", p. 12). In nearly all the earliest representations of the Last Supper, a lamp is indicated as hanging over the table. It is easy to understand that the early Christians may have attached a quasi-liturgical significance to the lighting of lamps during the Holy Sacrifice when we remember that the pilgrim who, writing in about 530 CE, wrote the so-called \\"Breviarius\\", claims to have seen at Jerusalem what purported to be the actual lamp which had hung in the chamber of the Last Supper, preserved there as a precious relic at a site he designates the Basilica of Holy Zion, although there is uncertainty about the exact site to which he refers. In the modern times interest principally centered in the lamp which burned perpetually before the Blessed Sacrament, and it has been the custom with many writers (see e.g. Corblet, \\"Hist. du sacrement de l'Eucharistie\\", II, 433 sq., and Thalhofer, \\"Liturgik\\", I, 670) to represent this as a tradition of very early date. But the testimonies upon which this opinion is based are, many of them, quite illusive (see \\"The Month\\", April, 1907, pp. 380 seq.). St. Paulinus of Nola, indeed, seems to speak of a silver lamp continually burning in the church: :Paulo Crucis ante decus de limine eodem :Continuum scyphus est argenteus aptus ad usum.'' There is no indication that this bore any reference to the Blessed Sacrament. It would seem rather to be suggested by the context that it was of the nature of a watch light and a protection against thieves. No really conclusive evidence has yet been produced that the practice of honoring the Blessed Sacrament by burning a light continually before it is older than the latter part of the twelfth century. Still, it was undoubtedly the custom for some hundreds of years before this to burn lights before relics and shrines as a mark of honor the candles burnt by King Alfred the Great before his relics, and used by him to measure the hours, are a famous example—and it may be that this custom generally extended to the place where the Blessed Sacrament was reserved. The constant association of lights with the Holy Grail in the Grail romances is suggestive of this. The great movement for providing a perpetual lamp before the altar must undoubtedly be traced to the preaching in France and England of a certain Eustace, Abbot of (?)Fleury, about A.D. 1200. \\"Eustace also laid it down\\", says Walter of Coventry, speaking of his visit to England, \\"that in London and in many other places, there should be in every church where it was practicable, a burning lamp or some other perpetual light before the Lord's Body.\\" Shortly after this we begin to find the practice enjoined by synodal decrees (e.g. at Worcester, in 1240 at Saumur, in 1276, etc.), but as a rule these earlier injunctions recognize that, owing to the cost of oil and wax, such requirements could hardly be complied with in the poorer churches. It was not until the sixteenth century that the maintenance of a light, wherever the Blessed Sacrament was reserved, was recognized as a matter of strict obligation. At present the official \\"Rituale Romanum\\" (Tit. IV, cap. 1) prescribes that \\"both by day and night two or more lamps or at least one [lampades plures vel saltem una] must burn continually before the Blessed Sacrament\\", and the responsibility of seeing that this is carried out rests with the priest in charge of the parish. It is further directed that the oil used should be vegetable oil, by preference that of the olive on account of its symbolism. Exceptionally, in consequence of poverty or some other reason, a mineral oil, like petroleum, may be employed with the bishop's permission. The language of the Caeremoniale Episcoporum (I, xii, 17) might easily suggest that at least in the larger churches more lamps than one should be lit, but always an odd number, that is to say, three at least before the high altar, and five before the altar of the Blessed Sacrament. It seems, however, that this direction of the \\"Caeremoniale\\" is to be understood as applying only to greater festivals. During all the Middle Ages the burning of lamps, or sometimes candles, before relics, shrines, statues, and other objects of devotion was a form of piety which greatly appealed to the alms of the faithful. Almost every collection of early English wills bears witness to it, and even in the smaller churches the number of such lights founded by private beneficence was often surprisingly great. It not infrequently happened that every guild and association maintained a special light of its own, and, besides these, we hear constantly of such objects of devotion as the \\"Jesus light\\", the \\"Hok-light\\" (which seems to have to do with a popular festival kept on the second Monday or Tuesday after Easter Sunday), the \\"Rood light\\", the \\"egg light\\" (probably maintained by contributions of eggs), the \\"bachelor's light\\", the \\"maiden's light\\", the \\"Soul's light\\", etc. Many of these bequests will be found conveniently illustrated and classified in Leland Duncan and Arthur Hussey's Testamenta Cantiana, London 1906. In the Greek Orthodox Church \\"Lampadarios\\" is a title (officium) of the Lower Clergy, given to the second in the rank Cantor, head of the left choir of Cantors. In the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople the Lampadarios is also responsible for teaching chanting to other clergy. The Lampadarios is usually candidate for promotion to First Cantor (Protopsaltes). He is also entitled to act as a witness at various important acts of the Church.\\"The Cantor in the liturgical life of the Church\\", official site of the Apostolic Deaconing of the Church of Greece (in Greek language) References * Category:Slavery in ancient Rome Category:Christianity in the Middle Ages Category:Byzantine music Category:Eastern Christian ecclesiastical offices Category:Byzantine ecclesiastical titles and offices ","title":"Lampadarius"},{"id":"5808650","text":"Sarai Akil is a town and a nagar panchayat in Kaushambi district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.

Early life Born Rose Maud Quong in East Melbourne, Australia to merchant Chun Quong and Annie née Moy Quong, she grew up in Melbourne, where she attended University High School and passed her matriculation exams. At one time she intended to study medicine, but from 1897 to 1919 was employed as a public servant in a variety of clerical roles. Quong showed great interest in amateur theatricals, winning competitions and performing with the Melbourne Repertory Players until in 1924, at age 44, she won a scholarship to study drama in England. She opened in several plays in 1924, receiving excellent reviews from critics. Over the next fifteen years she learnt Mandarin, studied Chinese culture, lectured, recited Chinese poetry and acted in England and France before visiting the United States for the first time in 1934 on tour. Her biographer, Angela Woollacott, notes that the Australian expatriate community in London embraced her, despite the aims of Australia's own White Australia Policy.Angela Woollacott (2001) To Try Her Fortune in London pps 173-174, Oxford University Press, In 1936 she made her only trip to China, where she lectured to elite audiences, in Mandarin. She returned to the United States on a lecture tour in January 1939 and remained permanently, settling in New York City. Life in United States She continued her acting career in the United States, and also delivered lectures on Chinese drama, art, and culture. She performed primarily in theatre, but had several film roles to her credit, including a small part in Flower Drum Song. The backbone of Quong's career in the United States was a series of one- woman shows, consisting of recitations, dramatic readings, and scenes from plays. She authored two books: Chinese Wit, Wisdom, and Written Characters, and a translation of selected stories from P'u Sung-Ling's Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio under the title Chinese Ghost and Love Stories . Her last role was in a 1971 film, Eliza's Horoscope. To supplement her income as an actress, Quong occasionally took on other jobs, working as a secretary. Interests Quong was deeply interested in Chinese philosophy, and studied it for much of her life; her presentations frequently included material from the I Ching. She also studied yoga, astrology, and Chinese history. A voracious reader, she maintained reading lists and took copious notes on her reading. She died in New York City in 1972.

She also possessed superhumanly acute senses, as well as having sufficient superhuman strength and ferocity to allow her to successfully subdue an opponent over twice her size. The Native's physiology was also accelerated to the extent that her body could conceive and gestate a fetus within a matter of hours.

It closed in the early 1960s when its role was taken over by Bishop Gilpin School, a new school on a different site in Wimbledon. The original octagonal school building in Camp Road, built in 1758, was still standing in 2012 and in use as part of a private school, The Study. History In June 1757, a group of local dignitaries met one Saturday night at the Rose and Crown pub in Wimbledon village to discuss plans for a charity school. Enough money had been raised since the idea had been raised two years earlier and now the details had to be worked out. In 1758 the manor court gave permission for the vicar and others to \\"inclose and fence in - a certain piece or parcel of land, lying on Wimbledon Common for the use of a charity school\\" and the first octagonal building was put up. It was not the first charity school in Wimbledon. The SPCK listed two charity schools in Wimbledon in its report for 1724. But many of the charity schools founded around the country at the start of the 18th century had closed down because of lack of support. Initially, progress was not smooth after the construction of the school building. The schoolmaster quarrelled with the parish officials and the school was not running properly until 1773 when the building was repaired and a minute-book was begun that continued to be used until 1839. The first trustees included the vicar, Rev. John Cooksey and William Wilberforce, uncle of the anti-slavery campaigner of the same name. The school was supported by subscription. The Lord of the Manor, the first Earl Spencer gave 10 guineas a year. The future prime minister, the Marquess of Rockingham gave five while he lived in Wimbledon. In 1773 Joseph Andrewes was appointed schoolmaster at £50 a year to teach 50 boys and 50 girls with the help of his wife and he continued in the post until his death 15 years later. The curriculum was confined to reading (the Bible was the textbook), writing, and, beginning in 1778, four rules of arithmetic. William Wilberforce, nephew of one of the original trustees, was treasurer to the school for a short time while he lived in Wimbledon. Lord Nelson, whose estate extended into Wimbledon, also gave his support to the school: the 1806 accounts include \\"credited Lord Viscount Nelson and Lady Hamilton £4 4s. 0d\\" (four guineas). Known as the National School for much of the 19th century, it was referred to as \\"Old Central\\" in a document of 1893, possibly to distinguish it from the new schools that had been set up in Wimbledon since the Education Act of 1870 had extended elementary education to all children. John William Selby was headmaster of the school in 1889 and first chairman of the Old Central football club, who later became Wimbledon F.C. and played on the Wimbledon Common during their formative years. The headmaster in 1950 was a Mr Henning References Review, The Magazine of the Parish of Wimbledon, July 1958.

The museum stands on the site of the old Fort Thüngen, on the southwestern edge of the Kirchberg- plateau, in close proximity to many of the European Union institutions based within the city. History First proposed in 1989 and championed by then- Prime Minister Jacques Santer, the location of the future museum was much disputed, until it was agreed in 1997 to use Dräi Eechelen Park and connect the museum to Fort Thüngen. The building was designed by Pritzker Prize- winning architect I. M. Pei, and cost $100m to build. The museum was inaugurated on 1 July 2006 by Grand Duke Jean, to whom the building is dedicated, and opened to the public the following day. As Luxembourg had no public modern art collection and the museum budget did not allow acquiring a modernist collection, the museum focused on contemporary art - its permanent collection includes works by 100 artists, including: Andy Warhol, Bruce Nauman, Julian Schnabel, Thomas Struth, and Daniel Buren. In its first year of public opening, the museum achieved a record attendance of more than 115,000 visitors. Collections The Museum's collections are set out on three floors and include works by many artists and designers such as Alvar Aalto, Marina Abramović, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Pierre Bismuth, Sophie Calle, Hussein Chalayan, Claude Closky, James Coleman, Tony Cragg, Richard Deacon, Mark Dean, Stan Douglas, Jan Fabre, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Roland Fischer, Günther Förg, Gilbert & George, Nan Goldin, Andreas Gursky, Thomas Hirschhorn, Fabrice Hybert, William Kentridge, Mark Lewis, Richard Long, Michel Majerus, Christian Marclay, Martin Margiela, Steve McQueen, Bruce Nauman, Shirin Neshat, Albert Oehlen, Blinky Palermo, Philippe Parreno, Grayson Perry, Fiona Rae, Pipilotti Rist, Thomas Ruff, Charles Sandison, Joe Scanlan, Thomas Scheibitz, Julian Schnabel, Cindy Sherman, Thomas Struth, Wolfgang Tillmans, Cy Twombly and Kara Walker.

The famous Han poet and statesman Jia Yi concluded his essay The Faults of Qin (:zh:过秦论) with what was to become the standard Confucian judgment of the reasons for Qin's collapse. Jia Yi's essay, admired as a masterpiece of rhetoric and reasoning, was copied into two great Han histories and has had a far-reaching influence on Chinese political thought as a classic illustration of Confucian theory. He explained the ultimate weakness of Qin as a result of its ruler's ruthless pursuit of power, the precise factor which had made it so powerful; for as Confucius had taught, the strength of a government ultimately is based on the support of the people and virtuous conduct of the ruler.

She was a Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford, and Lecturer and then Reader in the University. Early life Starkie was born in Killiney, Co. Dublin, Ireland. She was the eldest daughter of Rt. Hon. William Joseph Myles (WJM) Starkie (1860–1920) and May Caroline Walsh. The academic Walter Starkie was her brother. When she was two years of age her father accepted the post of Resident Commissioner of Education for Ireland. In Edwardian Dublin her upbringing was steeped in studies. Her father hired a French governess, Leonie Cora, to tutor his children in French and music. The children became imbued with everything French, from cooking to Le Printemps catalogues. Enid wrote, \\"My French governess never stopped talking of France, and she talked with all the nostalgia of the exile.\\"Enid Starkie, A Lady's Child, (1941) Mlle. Cora had been a pupil of the French pianist and composer Raoul Pugno, and Enid learnt to play the piano, going on to win second medal for two years in succession at Feis Ceoil, the annual music festival in Dublin. She was educated at Alexandra College in Dublin, Somerville College at the University of Oxford, and the Sorbonne in Paris.Joanna Richardson, Enid Starkie: A Biography, (1974) Oxford Starkie read Modern Languages at Oxford and obtained a First in 1920.Oxford University Calendar 1922, Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1922, p. 207., \\"Oxford–Saturday. Degrees for Women\\". Yorkshire Post, 1 November 1920. 9. She taught modern languages at Exeter and then in the Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages, University of Oxford. Her biography of Baudelaire (1933) was for many English readers their first introduction to the poet.http://fs.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/XXIV/4/439 She wrote perceptively on André Gide (1953), securing him an honorary doctorate at Oxford in 1947. She also played a major part in establishing the poetic reputation of Arthur Rimbaud (1938), receiving the first doctorate to be given in the Faculty of Modern Languages for her work Rimbaud in Abyssinia. She published two major volumes on Flaubert (1967, 1971). In 1951 she campaigned successfully to have the quinquennially elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford be a practising poet rather than a critic. She argued that \\"the Chair ought to go to someone outside the University, to someone who would not otherwise be heard in Oxford. There were enough people already engaged in talking about poetry as critics, indeed too many.\\"Dan Davin, Closing Times, (1975) p. 73 C. S. Lewis was defeated by Cecil Day-Lewis in the first subsequent election. She also campaigned successfully for W. H. Auden (1956), Robert Graves (1961), and Edmund Blunden (1966) in subsequent elections for the Chair, leading one critic to complain that, \\"This was a serious academic affair until Dr. Starkie turned it into something like the Oxford and Cambridge boat race.\\"New York Times, 6 February 1966 She also secured an honorary doctorate for Jean Cocteau in 1956. She was honoured as an officer of the Legion d'honneur in 1958, and as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1967. Many people regarded her as eccentric. An article in Time magazine portrayed her as \\"a brilliant Rimbaud scholar who pub-crawls about Oxford in bright red slacks and beret while smoking cigars.\\" Francis Steegmuller wrote, \\"One of the things I most enjoyed about her was her true eccentricity, in a world where false eccentricity has become a kind of conformity.
