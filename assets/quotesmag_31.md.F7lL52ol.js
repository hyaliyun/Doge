The Courts are a project of the Johan Cruyff Foundation of which Johan Cruijff himself was one of the founders. Cruyff Courts Cruyff Foundation, retrieved 5-10-2017 The first was the Cruyff Court Aron Winter Veld in Lelystad. Since 2003, the Dutch football Talent of the Year may choose a location for a new court. Although primarily focused on football, the Foundation considers it a plus if other sports and games take place. Furthermore, the normal Cruyff Court is expressly intended as a neighborhood facility: the application is asked for embedding in the neighborhood. This embedding also applies as much as possible to the adjusted Cruyff Courts, but they are set up in consultation with an institution for young people with a disability. Characteristics A Cruyff Court is typically placed in Dutch neighborhoods with a commitment to sport and recreation. The field is typically 42√ó28 meters and much smaller than a regular size football field. As a comparison, the penalty area of a UEFA Champions League pitch is 40√ó16,5 meters. Both in width and length a regular size pitch is 2,5 times larger and 6x the size in surface.UEFA Stadium Infrastructure Edition 2006, Article 4: Field of play Webversie van dit reglement retrieved July 7, 2008 The courts are green, except for the circle in the middle, which is dark yellow and purple and the orange CCKV logo. The goals are orange and the fences are blue.Projectbeschrijving aanleg Cruyff Court retrieved 7 July 2008 The Johan Cruyff Foundation regards the social embedding as an essential part of the courts. For this reason, benches are required along the edge of the field, and fences must occur with nearby residents. Furthermore, public support and the need for a great deal of attention are given in the checklist that aspiring municipalities must complete. Among other things, it asks about the background of the neighborhood, supervision, the proximity of schools and multicultural composition, other sports facilities and also about disadvantage characteristics of the neighborhood. The first question of the checklist: is the location in the middle of the neighborhood? Cruyff Court Quickscan.doc, downloadable from contactpage retrieved July 7, 2008 History In 2003 the first Cruyff Courts were constructed and at the end of 2007; there were 70. In 2016 there are 208 of which 35 abroad and 33 locally. Countries outside the Netherlands with a Cruyff Court include Belgium, Spain, Poland, Great Britain, Morocco, the United States and Japan. Special fields = Madurodam = Special is the 'Madurodam Field' 'in The Hague, not only because there is a miniature version of it, but also because it is combined with the Playground of the Richard Krajicek realized Richard Krajicek Foundation. It is part of a sports complex, and schools in the area take part in the activities. = Youth with a disability = Included with the 208 Cruyff Courts are 33 adapted fields for youth with a disability. These are located at rehabilitation centers and special schools and are adapted to the user group. To adapt to the special wishes of the institutions, a collaboration has started with the Rietveld Academy; From mid-2008, students can offer inventive solutions for adapted courts. =Playground Almere= The FC Omniworld Veld in Almere city, is one of the most visited spots of the Johan Cruyff Foundation. This is of course due to the fact that it is part of one big playground: \\"The Clarence Seedorf Square\\", which includes 2 basketball, 3 tennis, boules, and 2 football fields. Thanks to the continuous presence of sports and youth workers, Europe's biggest playground is one of the most successful playgrounds. =Bartim√©us= On May 22, 2007 Cruyff Court Oranje Veld Zeist was opened at Bartim√©us, a living, learning and working community for visually impaired. This was the first custom field, but it is accessible to everyone in Zeist. This court has extra lines for goalball, a throwing game played with a rumble ball. Furthermore, contrasting colors have been used: the outlet room and the fences are blue and the lines yellow. For the goal ball, goals can be placed along the long sides.Aangepast speelveld, voor heel Zeist bezocht 7 May 2008Kleuren en andere kenmerken Oranje Veld Zeist retrieved May 7, 2008  Financing and realization  = Compulsory partners = Thanks to the Hattrick Program of the UEFA the CCKV could be set up. Hattrick makes money available to the national football associations for the construction of synthetic turf pitches. Where a field is desired, the municipality assigns possible locations, a checklist of pros and cons, and declarations of intent from BVOs or football clubs. Other regular partners: * Koninklijke Ten Cate for the synthetic turf. * Netherlands Institute for Sports and Exercise (NISB) for project management. * Research and inspection company ISA Sport for the technical quality of the field. * W.J.H. Mulierinstituut for long-term research into the influence of the courts on the living environment in the neighborhood. = Other partners = After fields in Amsterdam, Eindhoven and Rotterdam, the Oranje Veld Zeist is the fourth to be donated by the Netherlands National Team. The indication Oranje refers to it, as the name Aron Winter Field refers to the sponsor of that field in residential and/or birthplace Lelystad. Dennis Bergkamp had at the end of his career a site in the London district Islington. Each Dutch Talent of the Year can designate a location for a new field. Arjen Robben, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Wesley Sneijder chose their birthplaces Bedum, Hummelo and Utrecht. In 2008 the \\"Ibrahim Afellay Field\\" \\"will be created in Al Hoceima, Morocco, where his family has always lived. Cooperation with the Stichting MaroquiStars has been sought for this. Another 22 courts are largely donated by clubs from professional football and are in their playing city. In total, at least 32 fields are financed by professional football. If in the name only a city or district is mentioned, then the municipality is usually one of the biggest donors.

It is located on the eastern bank of the Ganges river, opposite the Muni Ki Reti area of Rishikesh, in the foothills of the Himalayas. During the 1960s and 1970s, as the International Academy of Meditation, it was the training centre for students of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who devised the Transcendental Meditation technique. The ashram gained international attention between February and April 1968 when the English rock band the Beatles studied meditation there, along with celebrities such as Donovan, Mia Farrow and Mike Love. It was the setting for the band's most productive period as songwriters, where they composed most of the songs for their self-titled double album, also known as the \\"White Album\\". The site was abandoned in the 1990s and reverted to the local forestry department in 2003, after which it became a popular visiting place for fans of the Beatles. Although derelict and overrun by jungle, the site was officially opened to the public in December 2015. It has since become known as Beatles Ashram and held an exhibition in February 2018 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Beatles' arrival in Rishikesh. Background and location View of Jonk, the village on the eastern side of Lakshman Jhula footbridge Maharishi Mahesh Yogi leased the site from the state forestry department of Uttar Pradesh in 1961. It sits on a -high cliff overlooking the Ganges river, on a hill known as Manikoot, and comprises of land surrounded by jungle. The facility was built in 1963 with a $100,000 gift from American heiress Doris Duke. Referred to locally as the Chaurasi Kutia ashram, and by some meditators as Shankaracharya Nagar, it was named the \\"International Academy of Meditation\\" by the Maharishi. It was one of many ashrams in the Rishikesh area, which is a place of religious significance and known as the \\"yoga capital of the world\\". The ashram is located due east of the Muni Ki Reti area of Rishikesh, in the north of the city, and on the opposite bank of the river. In the late 1960s, access to the cliff-top facility was possible via the Lakshman Jhula footbridge, north-east of the centre of Rishikesh, at the village of Tapovan, followed by a 2-mile walk back downriver and a steep climb up the rocky path to Manikoot. Alternatively, a ferry service was available, from close to what is now the Ram Jhula suspension bridge, built in 1986. Before the opening of Ram Jhula, vehicles crossed the Ganges over the narrow bridge at Haridwar, south of Rishikesh, and then travelled 13 miles along a twisty and potholed dirt road to the ashram. Facilities Rooftop meditation dome (pictured in 2017) The training centre was designed to suit Western habits and was described variously as \\"luxurious\\" and \\"seedy\\". It was built to accommodate several dozen people and each of its stone bungalows contained five rooms. According to author Susan Shumsky, a TM devotee whose first retreat at the ashram was in 1970, the facility was \\"under constant construction\\". In addition to several stone huts, there were accommodation blocks, known as puri, each containing six self-contained rooms. The Maharishi's residence was a long, modern-style bungalow located away from the other buildings. According to journalist Raymond Zhong, who visited the site in 2015, the name Chaurasi Kutia is Hindi for \\"84 Huts\\". He also comments on the less traditional design aspects: \\"One four-story building has a stepped pyramid design and multifoil arches above the doorways, and on the roof there are massive white structures shaped like ostrich eggs ...\\" Shumsky writes that the Maharishi's bungalow was a \\"simple brick, concrete, and stone\\" building, and far from the lavish accommodation commonly depicted in the media in the aftermath to the Beatles' stay at the ashram. The compound was surrounded by a wire fence, which served as a barrier against the abundant wildlife in the interior. Beyond the fence, the forest was thick with teak, guava and sissoso trees, while inside were gardens filled with flowerbeds of red hibiscus. At the entrance to the site, there was a gatehouse, signposted as the \\"Inquiry Office\\", and a white picket fence inside the wire fence. Along the cliff edge, a path led down to the shoreline. The Maharishi addressed his students in the two-storey lecture hall. This high-ceilinged structure had long windows that, as with its roof, provided a popular habitat for birds and monkeys. The kitchen block was towards the rear of the site. Meals were taken communally in an open dining area, over which stood a wooden trellis. For the Beatles' stay in early 1968, according to one of the Maharishi's aides at the time, Ravindra Damodara, four small stone-covered buildings were constructed along the path down from the main centre to the ashram gates. These dome-shaped \\"caves\\" included a raised platform, accessed by ladder, on which each Beatle could engage in advanced meditation. During the same period, the Maharishi was negotiating with the Indian government to convert some nearby parkland into an airstrip for a Beechcraft aeroplane that he had been given. Several thousand landless peasants objected to this deal, as they had been denied the use of the land for farming. The Beatles' stay Lakshman Jhula footbridge, pictured from the village of Tapovan The Beatles' decision to study Transcendental Meditation in India brought international renown to the ashram and to Rishikesh. The band and their entourage travelled there in two separate groups. George Harrison and John Lennon, together with their respective wives, Pattie Boyd and Cynthia Lennon, and Boyd's sister Jenny, arrived in Delhi on 16 February 1968. They then travelled the to Rishikesh by taxi, a six-hour journey. Recalling their arrival, Harrison said: \\"Rishikesh is an incredible place, situated where the Ganges flows out of the Himalayas into the plains between the mountains and Delhi. There is quite a hefty flow of water coming out of the Himalayas, and we had to cross the river by a big swing suspension bridge [the Lakshman Jhula].\\" The Beatles were followed by a retinue of reporters and photographers, who were mostly kept out of the fenced and gated compound. Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan arrived soon after the Beatles, and Mia Farrow, Mike Love of the Beach Boys and jazz flautist Paul Horn were among the dozens of other meditators, all of them Europeans or Americans. One of the Beatles' friends, Alexis \\"Magic Alex\\" Mardas, an electronics engineer and inventor, was summoned to Rishikesh in the hope of providing the ashram with a high-power radio transmitter to broadcast the Maharishi's message. The bungalows allotted to the Beatles were equipped with electric heaters, running water, toilets, and English-style furniture. According to Nancy Cooke de Herrera, an American devotee who was assigned to look after the Western celebrities, the Maharishi obtained many \\"special items\\" from a nearby village so that the Beatles' rooms would have mirrors, wall-to-wall carpeting, wall coverings, foam mattresses and bedspreads. Ringo Starr later compared the ashram to \\"a kind of spiritual Butlins\\", a low-cost British holiday camp. The Beatles adopted native dress, and the ashram had a tailor on the premises to make clothes for the students. Members of their party shopped in local towns and bought saris for themselves and material to be made into shirts and jackets for the men. These towns included Dehradun and Mussoorie, where markets were held by Tibetans who had been driven out of their homeland by Chinese encroachment into Tibet. The Beatles Having ordered several Indian instruments for delivery from Delhi, Harrison commandeered one of the bungalows for a music room. He invited all the students to participate, and musical get-togethers took place on the roof of the building. The stay at the ashram turned out to be the Beatles' most creative period for songwriting. Many of their new songs were inspired by nature and reflected the simplicity of the surroundings. With Lennon and Paul McCartney especially productive during the retreat, the songs later comprised the bulk of the band's 1968 double album The Beatles, also known as the \\"White Album\\". Harrison and Lennon were the most dedicated of the Beatles to meditation, and they were the last members of the band to depart from the ashram. They left on 12 April amid an atmosphere of recrimination towards the Maharishi, based on rumours of his alleged impropriety with some of the female students, and the two band members' misgivings that he was taking advantage of the Beatles' fame. Despite their subsequent repudiation of the Maharishi, the Beatles' stay at the ashram generated wide interest in Transcendental Meditation, which encouraged the study of Eastern spirituality in Western popular culture. Asked if he forgave the Beatles for their slight on his reputation, following Harrison's personal apology in 1991, the Maharishi replied, \\"I could never be upset with angels.\\" Abandonment and development proposals Stone meditation \\"caves\\" at the former International Academy of Meditation (pictured in 2006) The Maharishi stopped using the ashram during the 1970s. With the lease having expired in 1981, the land was reclaimed by the government in the mid 1990s as part of what is now Rajaji Tiger Reserve. The former ashram then fell into disrepair, as a result of vandalism and the encroachment of the jungle. In 2003, Jerry Hall produced a television series for the BBC titled Gurus, which included interviews with TM initiates such as Cooke de Herrera, and a visit to the ashram in Rishikesh. In 2007, Canadian actress Maggie Blue O'Hara announced plans to renovate and convert the property into a home for the street children of New Delhi. The future of the site became a topic of political debate at the state and national levels. In 2011, a plan was announced by the state government of Uttarakhand to build an Ayush Gram there. Its potential as a tourist attraction was a popular campaign issue for several candidates during the 2012 Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly election. In the 2009 Indian general election, Satpal Maharaj had raised the importance of retaining \\"the rich spirituality of the area\\" and in 2013 he vowed to preserve the \\"glorious history of the Beatles\\" represented by Chaurasi Kutia. Public opening and adoption as Beatles Ashram \\"Beatles Cathedral\\" artists in the ashram's dilapidated lecture hall, in 2012 Since the 1990s, trespassers on the ashram site had taken to leaving graffiti as a tribute to the Beatles. In 2012, street artist Pan Trinity Das founded \\"The Beatles Cathedral Gallery\\" with the aim of \\"re-activating\\" Satsang Hall, the property's former lecture hall, but his and others' efforts were curtailed by officials from the forestry department. In early December 2015, the ashram was officially opened to the public, with an entrance fee of 150 rupees for Indian people and 650 rupees for other nationalities. Coinciding with this event, the director of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve stated his intention to preserve the existing buildings as \\"heritage structures\\" while Dinesh Agrawal, the foreign minister for Uttarakhand, said: \\"Our aim is to ensure that visitors don't simply come for the Beatles connection but to learn the magic of nature, meditation and yoga.\\" Aside from viewing the ashram ruins, nature walks and bird-watching tours were available to visitors. Reporting on the opening for The Wall Street Journal, Raymond Zhong described the ashram as \\"One of the most storied locations in Beatles lore\\". He said that the Cathedral Gallery was the \\"main attraction\\" and a \\"showcase for some accomplished graphic art\\". In February 2016, the Cathedral Gallery initiative was re-born as the Beatles Ashram Mural Project, when four artists, including Das, were invited to produce a series of murals for the hall. Another of the artists, Miles Toland, said he sought to pay tribute to the Maharishi in his work, which depicts spiritually themed scenes he first photographed in Rishikesh. In February 2018, the 50th anniversary of Lennon and Harrison's arrival in Rishikesh was marked by the opening of a two- year exhibition titled The Beatles in India at the Beatles Story museum in Liverpool. A similar celebration took place at Chaurasi Kutia, now known as Beatles Ashram, further to the announcement of plans for a full renovation of the site and the founding of a museum dedicated to the Beatles and the Maharishi. The exhibition in Liverpool featured memorabilia, photographs from the 1968 retreat by Paul Saltzman, a sitar courtesy of the Ravi Shankar Foundation, and video contributions from Pattie and Jenny Boyd. The 2018 International Yoga Festival, held in Rishikesh from 1 March, dedicated three days of its program to acknowledge the anniversary of the Beatles' visit.

The Bhimthadi or Deccani horse is an almost extinct breed of Indian horses. It was developed in Pune district in 17th and 18th centuries during the Maratha rule by crossing Arabian and Turkic breeds with local ponies. History Rue de Bombay en 1890, avec des charrettes √† b≈ìufs et √† poneys. The \\"Bhimthadi\\", also known as Deccani or \\"Deccan breed\\" gets its name from the vast Deccan Plateau in India. A major trade in arabian horses in the ports of Deccan began after the Bahamani Sultanate revolted against the Delhi Sultanate. Later in the period also the heavy war horses sought by the Mughals and the Sultans of the Deccan were always imported, especially from Iran.Mushirul Hasan, India partitioned: the other face of freedom, vol. 1, Lotus Collection, 1995, 120 p. (), p. 103. The Bhimthadi breed was developed in Pune district in 17th and 18th centuries during the Maratha rule by crossing Arabian and Turkic breeds with local ponies. These horses proved excellent for Shivaji's forces in fighting the Mughal army in the hilly terrains of Western Maharashtra . During their conquests in the 18th century, the Marathas were proud to claim that the Deccan horses had quenched their thirst with waters of the IndusHaig, W., 1930. The Maratha Nation. Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, 78(4049), pp.870-884. The warrior and Maharajah Maratha Yashwantrao Holkar (1776-1811) is reputed to have always battle mounted a mare named Mahua, of Bhimthadi breed. It seems that the Marathas raised a specific breed from the end of 18th century.Gommans, J., 1994. The horse trade in eighteenth-century South Asia. Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient/Journal de l'histoire economique et sociale de l'Orient, pp.228-250. According to local oral tradition from early 19th century, the breed was crossed with 500 Arabian horses and mares, obtained by the Nizam and nobles of Hyderabad directly Arabia. The breed is described as \\"Bhimthadi\\" in British sources. The breed also had some genetic contribution Persian and Turkish varieties. The best Bhimthadi horses were reputed to come from the valleys of the Bhima and Nira rivers in the present day Pune district. However, the breed was allowed to degenerate during British rule in India. The government of Gujarat took an initiative in 2010 to perform research on saving Bhimthadi and other near extinct breeds. In his description of the economy of India at the end of the 19th century, Sir George Watt was very impressed with this breed, he considers it one of the best in India. He reports that the best ponies are named \\"Dhangar\\" or \\"Khilari\\". The people see them as a separate breed, but Watt believes that this distinction comes from a difference in breeding practices, the breeders from the Dhangar community used to castrate their animals. The latter raise groups of 20 to 30 ponies. After their conquest of Maratha territories, the British encouraged inhabitants of the Bombay area to continue horse breeding in order to restore the old characteristics that are useful to them in the breed, by investing from around 1827 about ¬£100,000 in a stud farm in Alegaon Paga. The experiment was abandoned fifteen years later in 1842. Famines and various British conquests that hit the region in the 19th century wiped out the livestock of Marathas. In 1850, the so-called Deccan race of the south completely disappeared. In 1898, the British could no longer find these ponies for their regiments and therefore replaced them with mules, because the race was decimated during the second campaign of Afghanistan. In 1907, the race horse breeder, Sir Humphrey Francis De Trafford reported that the Deccani breed lives \\"bad days\\". Livestock distribution The breed originates from the valley of the Bhima River in the Pune District, hence its name, Bhimthadi.Chandra, R., 2004. Cities and towns of India. Commonwealth Publishers. Deccani has become extremely rare: in 1988, according to the count sent to FAO, they numbered less than 100. It was later added to the list of indigenous breeds of horses by FAO, around 1999, with Chummarti and Sikang, two other endangered breeds. CAB International (2002) 26 and other sources (2004) consider race to be \\"virtually extinct\\". Its threat level is still considered \\"critically endangered\\" by FAO in 2007, as well as the Uppsala University study conducted for FAO in 2010, which lists it as an Asian breed local population in critical danger of extinction.. In 2014, the encyclopaedia Delachaux and Niestl√© underlines the lack of information about this breed, presumed \\"very rare\\". In 2016, CAB International also cites it as \\"near extinct\\".

The barrow contains niches for the placement of cremation urns. It is also intended for wider celebration of life and community activity. The structure is a sequence of stone chambers under an earthen mound, and was begun in 2017, with a principal stone being laid in the spring of 2018.  Inspiration  The monument is inspired by Neolithic barrows built around 5,500 years ago, and following the constructions of the Long Barrow at All Cannings, Wiltshire and the Willow Row Barrow at St Neots, Cambridgeshire. It takes inspiration from among other monuments Bryn Celli Ddu, Barclodiad y Gawres, and Stoney Littleton Long Barrow. Developing the barrow involved collaboration with archaeologists at the University of Cambridge The gate for the barrow was designed by Giles Smith, winner, in the Assemble Collective, of the 2015 Turner Prize. The Barrow's first chamber was opened for use in summer 2018. A second phase of the barrow's development was begun and completed in the winter of 2019.  Commentary  In April, 2019, the monument was covered on an episode of BBC Countryfile, being visited by Matt Baker and Ellie Harrison. Summer Solstice sunrise The monument was included in the 2020 Architecture Foundation exhibition \\"Congregation\\", in St Mary Magdalene, Paddington. The exhibition looked at, \\"the changing nature of sacred architecture in Britain through the presentation of 23 buildings designed in the past decade\\", Edwin Heathcote of the Financial Times reviewed this exhibition and said of the project \\"Most esoteric of all, yet also strangely sympathetic, is the Soulton Long Barrow, a neo-neolithic mound of stone and earth designed to store the cremated remains of... any religion or none\\". In June 2020 the Architecture Foundation included the monument in a lecture event as part of its 2020 100 Day Studio event.  Soulton Standing Stones  There is a sequence of standing stones, signaling the route to the barrow from Soulton Road. Three megalithic limestone standing stones are located on the access route to the barrow. These were added to the approach route to the barrow in autumn 2017. The stone for these monoliths, as with the barrow itself, came from Churchfield Quarry, Oundle, near Peterborough. There is no deliberate alignment beyond way-marking for these standing stones. =C19 Stone= In 2020, a standing stone, with an alignment to the setting sun on the winter solstice, was added to the ritual landscape to acknowledged the suffering of the families impacted by the Coronavirus Pandemic.  Modern Henge Monument  In March 2020, plans were announced to build a modern henge monument close by the barrow.  The Sanctuary Theatre  In 2020, partially as a response to the crisis in live performance and theatre resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, an outdoor performance area was added in front of the barrow.

It depicts a young man playing pan-pipes on a wingless Pegasus and is also known as The Genius of Music (). The original plaster model is owned by the Carl Nielsen Museum in Odense. Description The monument with Gr√∏nningen in the background The monument is an allegorical equestrian statue. Horse and man are depicted in a dynamic pose. The naked young man with pan-pipes represents Pan, god of music in Greek mythology. His face strongly resembles that of a young Carl Nielsen. The Pegasus figure had wings in Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen's earlier models but the wings were left out in the final design. Carl-Nielsen has commented on the design that \\"What I wanted to show in my figure is the forward movement, the sense of life, the fact that nothing stands still.\\" History Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen and Pegasus ‚Äì first model of her Carl Nielsen monument in her studio in Civiletatens Materialg√•rd Carl Nielsen died on 3 October 1931. The monument was a donation from the Committee for the Creation of a Monument to the Composer Carl Nielsen and the Foundation for the Advancement of Artistic Purposes (). Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen was commissioned to design the monument. She worked on it in her studio in Civiletatens Materialg√•rd at Frederiksholms Kanal 26. She wrote: \\"I wanted to take the winged horse, eternal symbol of poetry, and place a musician on its back. He was to sit there between the rushing wings blowing a reed pipe out over Copenhagen\\". Dispute about her design and a shortfall in funding meant that the monument was delayed and that Anne Marie herself ended up subsidising it. It was finally unveiled on 17 December 1939.

Odutola grew up in an era where missionaries provided educational infrastructure, he believed that education cannot be divorced from religion and falling moral standards are results of a disregard for religion in education. Odutola was also involved in negotiations for a national church between Methodists, Anglicans and Presbyterians, but the movement never came to fruition.

This species is found worldwide, but prominently present within the summer months. This species of G. nasalis primarily targets equines, such as horses, donkeys and the plains zebra. However, it's known that it targets cattle as well, along with mild cases of companion animals. Life cycle The eggs of the nose or lip botfly are laid and almost glued onto the hairs of the lip of bovine and caprinae species. These larvae do not require stimulation, but rather hatch themselves within 2-3 days and crawl into their host's mouth. The larvae will then embed and remain within either the tongue or the mucosa of the mouth for a duration of one month. After this duration they then pass into the animal's stomach where they attach to the mucosa in the first part of the small intestine. The larvae remain in the small intestine for a duration of 8-10 months until they are passed out in the feces and pupate in the soil for another 3-5 weeks until the adults emerge. Treatment If infected with G. nasalis there are treatments available. One of which consists of macrocyclis lactones (ivermectin) which can be administered as an injectable or a drench. These methods can provide around several weeks of protection against re-infestation.

The screenplay was adapted by Dan Hageman and Kevin Hageman, from a screen story by producer Guillermo del Toro, as well as Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan. The film, an international co-production of the United States and Canada, stars Zoe Colletti, Michael Garza, Gabriel Rush, Austin Zajur, Natalie Ganzhorn, Austin Abrams, Dean Norris, Gil Bellows, and Lorraine Toussaint. In 2013, CBS Films acquired the rights to the book series from 1212 Entertainment with the intent of producing it as a feature film. By January 2016 it was announced that del Toro would develop and potentially direct the project for CBS Films. √òvredal was later to set to direct the film, with del Toro, Daniel, Brown, and Grave being among the producers. Principal photography commenced on August 27, 2018, and ended on November 1, 2018, in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark was theatrically released on August 9, 2019, by Lionsgate. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed a worldwide total of $105 million against a production budget of around $28 million. Plot On Halloween, 1968, in the small town of Mill Valley, Pennsylvania, three teen friends, Stella, Auggie, and Chuck, prank bully Tommy Milner. When Tommy and his gang chase them in retaliation, the trio flees to a drive-in movie theater, where a young drifter named Ram√≥n hides them in his car. They invite Ram√≥n to explore a local \\"haunted house\\" that once belonged to the wealthy Bellows family, who helped found Mill Valley. Inside, they find a book of horror stories written by Sarah Bellows, who allegedly committed suicide in the house. Having followed the group, Tommy locks them inside along with Ruth, Chuck's sister. They escape, and Stella takes Sarah's book. Stella discovers a new story, entitled \\"Harold\\", being written in Sarah's book. Meanwhile, in reality, an inebriated Tommy is stalked by the titular Harold, his family's scarecrow, after it comes to life. The creature stabs him with a pitchfork, causing Tommy to vomit hay and undergo a violent transformation. Tommy is later reported missing; Stella and Ram√≥n find Harold dressed in Tommy's clothes. Though Stella is convinced that Tommy has been turned into a scarecrow, the others are skeptical. That night, a new story, \\"The Big Toe\\", appears with Auggie as the main character. The pair attempt to warn him about the monster: a zombie searching for its missing toe, which is inside a stew that Auggie unwittingly eats. Auggie disappears after the zombie drags him under his bed. Realizing they are next, the remaining friends attempt to destroy the book; when this proves impossible, they research Sarah's life in hopes of finding a solution. A new story, \\"The Red Spot\\", is written. When Ruth discovers a swollen spider bite on her cheek, it explodes and releases hundreds of tiny spiders. Ruth is rescued but is traumatized and placed in a mental institution. The group's investigation takes them to a local hospital, where they discover that Sarah's brother performed electroshock therapy on her as part of a cover-up operation. The family's mill had been poisoning the town's water with mercury, and Sarah was tortured by her family for trying to reveal the truth, and blamed for the deed. At the hospital, Chuck is attacked by the Pale Lady, a phantom from his recurring nightmares, who absorbs him. Stella and Ram√≥n are arrested for trespassing by Police Chief Turner, who reveals that Ram√≥n is a Vietnam War draft dodger. Ram√≥n reveals to Stella that it was out of fear after his brother enlisted and his dead body was returned to them in pieces. Turner's dog begins to act strangely, and Ram√≥n realizes that the next creature will be the Jangly Man, a monster from a campfire story that frightened him as a child. The Jangly Man kills Turner before attempting to kill Ram√≥n. Ram√≥n and Stella escape, and he lures the creature away while Stella goes to the Bellows house to put an end to Sarah's actions. Stella is taken back in time, living out part of Sarah's experience of the torture her family put her through. She promises Sarah's ghost that she will tell the real story of Sarah's life and the truth of her innocence if she stops harming people with her stories. Sarah forces her to write down the true story in blood before she and the Jangly Man vanish. Stella writes the truth about Sarah's life in the papers to the town keeping her promise. Ram√≥n accepts his enlistment and shares an emotional goodbye with Stella before he leaves for the war. Stella drives away with her father and a recovered Ruth, and states that she will find a way to rescue Chuck and Auggie as the film ends.

The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Like the bestselling series of books that inspired it, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark opens a creepy gateway into horror for younger genre enthusiasts.\\" Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C\\" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 3 out of 5 stars and a 53% \\"definite recommend.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote that \\"the movie faithfully re-creates the peak moments of half a dozen of Schwartz' most popular stories,\\" but \\"doesn't totally embrace the Gammell vision,\\" referring to the infamy of the illustrations in the original book series. Ben Kenisberg of The New York Times called the film \\"an agreeable bit of fan service.\\" Keith Uhlich of The Hollywood Reporter conversely termed it a \\"lackluster adaptation,\\" adding that the monsters depicted in the film are \\"scary,\\" though \\"they'd be much more so if they felt less like franchisable IP and more like fervent expressions of the ills of the eras on which the film aims to comment.\\" William Bibbiani of Bloody Disgusting wrote that the film \\"often works very well for several, breathless minutes at a time. But in between those excellent scares there's a lot of filler, a lot of perfunctory plotting and a lot of mediocre character development.\\" Alan Jacques of Limerick Post gave the film two points out of five and stated \\"This movie is definitely not meant for a pre-teen audience. There are one or two genuinely creepy moments that would leave your precious nippers sleeping with the lights on until they finish college.... For a young audience coming to horror for the first time, this isn‚Äôt a bad place to start, but for anyone with a real appreciation of the genre this might feel rather dull and unoriginal.\\" In his review for The Verge, Noah Berlatsky stated \\"...Scary Stories is remarkably insightful and sober in its assessment of the way stories control people, rather than the other way around. Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was supposed to be the summer‚Äôs virtuoso meta-fiction, but its rewritten happy ending, musing on the impotence of writing, seems a lot less bleak than Scary Stories‚Äô acknowledgment that some scripts will take you far away where you'll never be seen again.\\" Tomris Laffly of RogerEbert.com gave the movie three stars out of four, stating \\"Still, Scary Stories is a strangely uplifting throwback to old-fashioned clans of investigative teens. While it doesn‚Äôt break any new ground, there is plenty of vintage fun to be had with kids who feel their way through life‚Äôs impending fears and live to tell the tale.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Simran Hans gave the film three stars out of five, noting \\"Producer and co-writer Guillermo del Toro brings Alvin Schwartz‚Äôs much-loved children‚Äôs book series to the big screen, but this uneven film can‚Äôt decide who it‚Äôs trying to scare.\\" The New Yorker 's Richard Brody mentioned \\"There‚Äôs authentic charm to the fine-grained didacticism of the plot of ‚ÄúScary Stories,‚Äù which embodies the very virtues that it promotes. In the process of displaying the redemptive power of factual knowledge, however, the movie flattens and tames the power of imagination.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire added \\"Andr√© √òvredal‚Äôs film adaptation, as clever and well-crafted as it is, can‚Äôt help but invert the formula that the source material relied upon for its success. Here is an R-rated concept that‚Äôs been watered down until it passed for a PG-13 movie; it‚Äôs plenty harrowing and full of gruesome effects, but it never feels dangerous.\\" The Atlantic 's Julie Beck noted \\"The best scary stories do that‚Äîthey get under your skin and emerge again and again. (The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out.) Scary Stories the movie just bounces right off.\\" David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the movie three stars out of five, commenting \\"It‚Äôs all a lot of chain-rattling, black-cat-screeching fun, though not such a blast that you don‚Äôt notice how generic and ramshackle the whole endeavor feels... The pity is that Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark will mostly be seen by jaded genre completists and nostalgic fortysomethings. Wrong demographic. You owe it to your kids to take them to this. It‚Äôs training-wheels horror done right.\\" Aja Romano of Vox gave the film three and half points out of five and wrote \\"...the film leans all the way into the chance to tell a story beset with cultural anxieties of the past that strongly mirror those of the present. It‚Äôs far more like a classic piece of young adult fiction than the juvenile fiction it‚Äôs adapting; its focus isn‚Äôt on kids, but on teens who are coming of age in a turbulent, complicated, and often maliciously unjust world. Their supernatural monsters, in contrast, are culled from juvenile fears and fantasies. The resulting folkloric aesthetic makes Scary Stories‚Äô brand of fantasy all the more effective as fun visual horror. But on a thematic level, it creates a discordance with the film's more adult social horrors, and the two elements never quite unify.\\" A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film B grade and wrote \\"Like scouts huddled around a campfire, each trying to send a bigger chill down the others‚Äô spines, Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark keeps coming up with new gruesome attractions, piling one on top of the next. Yet as gross and spooky and, yes, occasionally frightening as these terror tactics get, they never quite cross over into the deep end of truly grown-up horror.\\" The Times of India's Neil Soans gave the film three stars out of five, noting \\"The screenplay ends up as a jumble of unexplored ideas onscreen rather than a cohesive narrative. However, if you only enjoy horror films for creepy monsters, you‚Äôll manage to get a kick or two.\\"  Sequel  On April 23, 2020, it was announced that a sequel to the film is officially in development, with √òvredal returning to direct and Paramount Pictures (who absorbed CBS Films as part of the Viacom/CBS re-merger) distributing. Zoe Colletti, Michael Garza, Natalie Ganzhorn, and Dean Norris will reprise their roles with Dan and Kevin Hageman returning as writers and Guillermo del Toro returning as producer.

This page describes some parameters used to characterize the properties of the thermal boundary layer formed by a heated (or cooled) fluid moving along a heated (or cooled) wall. In many ways, the thermal boundary layer description parallels the velocity (momentum) boundary layer description first conceptualized by Ludwig Prandtl.L. Prandtl, ‚Äú√úber Fl√ºssigkeitsbewegung bei sehr kleiner Reibung,‚Äù Verhandlungen des Dritten Internationalen Mathematiker-Kongresses in Heidelberg 1904, A. Krazer, ed., Teubner, Leipzig, (1905) 484‚Äì491. Consider a fluid of uniform temperature T_o and velocity u_o impinging onto a stationary plate uniformly heated to a temperature T_s. Assume the flow and the plate are semi-infinite in the positive/negative direction perpendicular to the x-y plane. As the fluid flows along the wall, the fluid at the wall surface satisfies a no-slip boundary condition and has zero velocity, but as you move away from the wall, the velocity of the flow asymptotically approaches the free stream velocity u_0. The temperature at the solid wall is T_s and gradually changes to T_o as one moves toward the free stream of the fluid. It is impossible to define a sharp point at which the thermal boundary layer fluid or the velocity boundary layer fluid becomes the free stream, yet these layers have a well-defined characteristic thickness given by \\\\delta_T and \\\\delta_v. The parameters below provide a useful definition of this characteristic, measurable thickness for the thermal boundary layer. Also included in this boundary layer description are some parameters useful in describing the shape of the thermal boundary layer.  99% Thermal Boundary Layer thickness  The thermal boundary layer thickness, \\\\delta_T, is the distance across a boundary layer from the wall to a point where the flow temperature has essentially reached the 'free stream' temperature, T_0. This distance is defined normal to the wall in the y-direction. The thermal boundary layer thickness is customarily defined as the point in the boundary layer, y_{99}, where the temperature T(x,y) reaches 99% of the free stream value T_0: :\\\\delta_T = y_{99} such that T(x,y_{99}) = 0.99 T_0 at a position x along the wall. In a real fluid, this quantity can be estimated by measuring the temperature profile at a position x along the wall. The temperature profile is the temperature as a function of y at a fixed x position. For laminar flow over a flat plate at zero incidence, the thermal boundary layer thickness is given by:Schlichting, p. 307. : \\\\delta_T = \\\\delta_v \\\\mathrm{Pr}^{-1/3} : \\\\delta_T = 5.0 \\\\sqrt{ { u x}\\\\over u_0} \\\\mathrm{Pr}^{-1/3} where :\\\\mathrm{Pr} is the Prandtl Number :\\\\delta_v is the thickness of the velocity boundary layer thickness Schlichting, p.140. :u_0 is the freestream velocity :x is the distance downstream from the start of the boundary layer : u is the kinematic viscosity For turbulent flow over a flat plate, the thickness of the thermal boundary layer that is formed is not determined by thermal diffusion, but instead, it is random fluctuations in the outer region of the boundary layer of the fluid that is the driving force determining thermal boundary layer thickness. Thus the thermal boundary layer thickness for turbulent flow does not depend on the Prandtl number but instead on the Reynolds number. Hence, the turbulent thermal boundary layer thickness is given approximately by the turbulent velocity boundary layer thickness expressionSchlichting, p. 638. given by: : \\\\delta_T \\\\approx \\\\delta \\\\approx 0.37x/ {\\\\mathrm{Re}_x}^{1/5} where :{\\\\mathrm{Re}_x}= u_0 x/ u is the Reynolds number This turbulent boundary layer thickness formula assumes 1) the flow is turbulent right from the start of the boundary layer and 2) the turbulent boundary layer behaves in a geometrically similar manner (i.e. the velocity profiles are geometrically similar along the flow in the x-direction, differing only by stretching factors in y and u(x,y)Schlichting, p.152.). Neither one of these assumptions is true for the general turbulent boundary layer case so care must be exercised in applying this formula.  Thermal Displacement Thickness  The thermal displacement thickness, \\\\beta^* may be thought of in terms of the difference between a real fluid and a hypothetical fluid with thermal diffusion turned off but with velocity u_0 and temperature T_0. With no thermal diffusion, the temperature drop is abrupt. The thermal displacement thickness is the distance by which the hypothetical fluid surface would have to be moved in the y-direction to give the same integrated temperature as occurs between the wall and the reference plane at \\\\delta_T in the real fluid. It is a direct analog to the velocity displacement thickness which is often described in terms of an equivalent shift of a hypothetical inviscid fluid (see SchlichtingSchlichting, p. 140. for velocity displacement thickness). The definition of the thermal displacement thickness for incompressible flow is based on the integral of the reduced temperature: : {\\\\beta^*}= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty {\\\\theta(x,y) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}y} where the dimensionless temperature is \\\\theta(x,y) = (T(x,y)-T_0)/(T_s-T_0). In a wind tunnel, the velocity and temperature profiles are obtained by measuring the velocity and temperature at many discrete y-values at a fixed x-position. The thermal displacement thickness can then be estimated by numerically integrating the scaled temperature profile.  Moment Method  A relatively new methodWeyburne, 2006.Weyburne, 2018. for describing the thickness and shape of the thermal boundary layer utilizes the moment method commonly used to describe a random variable's probability distribution. The moment method was developed from the observation that the plot of the second derivative of the thermal profile for laminar flow over a plate looks very much like a Gaussian distribution curve.Weyburne, 2006, p. 1680. It is straightforward to cast the properly scaled thermal profile into a suitable integral kernel. The thermal profile central moments are defined as: : {\\\\xi_n} = {1\\\\over\\\\beta^*}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty { (y- m_T)^n \\\\theta(x,y) \\\\mathrm{d}y} where the mean location, m_T, is given by: : m_T = {1\\\\over\\\\beta^*}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty { y \\\\theta(x,y) \\\\mathrm{d}y} There are some advantages to also include descriptions of moments of the boundary layer profile derivatives with respect to the height above the wall. Consider the first derivative temperature profile central moments given by: : {\\\\epsilon_n} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty { (y-{\\\\beta^*})^n {d \\\\theta(x,y) \\\\over dy} \\\\mathrm{d}y} where the mean location is the thermal displacement thickness \\\\beta^*. Finally the second derivative temperature profile central moments are given by: : {\\\\phi_n} = \\\\mu_T \\\\int_0^\\\\infty { (y-{\\\\mu_T})^n {d^2 \\\\theta(x,y) \\\\over dy^2} \\\\mathrm{d}y} where the mean location, \\\\mu_T, is given by: : {1 \\\\over \\\\mu_T} = -\\\\left( \\\\frac{d\\\\theta(x,y) }{d y}\\\\right)_{y=0} With the moments and the thermal mean location defined, the boundary layer thickness and shape can be described in terms of the thermal boundary layer width (variance), thermal skewnesses, and thermal excess (excess kurtosis). For the Pohlhausen solution for laminar flow on a heated flat plate,Schlichting, p. 292. it is found that thermal boundary layer thickness defined as \\\\delta_T = m_T + 4\\\\sigma_T where \\\\sigma_T=\\\\xi_2^{1/2}, tracks the 99% thickness very well.Weyburne, 2018, p. 5. For laminar flow, the three different moment cases all give similar values for the thermal boundary layer thickness. For turbulent flow, the thermal boundary layer can be divided into a region near the wall where thermal diffusion is important and an outer region where thermal diffusion effects are mostly absent. Taking a cue from the boundary layer energy balance equation, the second derivative boundary layer moments, {\\\\phi_n} track the thickness and shape of that portion of the thermal boundary layer where thermal diffusivity {\\\\alpha } is significant. Hence the moment method makes it possible to track and quantify the region where thermal diffusivity is important using {\\\\phi_n} moments whereas the overall thermal boundary layer is tracked using {\\\\epsilon_n} and {\\\\xi_n} moments. Calculation of the derivative moments without the need to take derivatives is simplified by using integration by parts to reduce the moments to simply integrals based on the thermal displacement thickness kernel: : {k_n}= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty {y^n\\\\theta(x,y) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}y} This means that the second derivative skewness, for example, can be calculated as: :\\\\gamma_{T} = \\\\phi_3/\\\\phi_2^{3/2} = (2\\\\mu_T^3 - 6\\\\beta^*\\\\mu_T^2 + 6\\\\mu_T k_1)/(-\\\\mu_T^2 + 2\\\\mu_T\\\\beta^*)^{3/2}  Further reading  * Hermann Schlichting, Boundary-Layer Theory, 7th ed., McGraw Hill, 1979. * Frank M.

Their written documents containing statistical data linking sickness to fatality were then turned in to parish officials for use in publishing official Bills of Mortality. These mortality reports have enabled historians and researchers alike to estimate the living conditions and influence of grave diseases like the bubonic plague on the given population. Searchers existed primarily in London, where they were first appointed during the plague outbreaks around 1568. They continued work through the early modern period up until the Registration Act of 1836, which called for all births, deaths, and marriages in England to be well- documented. They served as important figures to the parish although they were often neglected in records as many people began to question their credibility later on during the 17th Century.  Plague time  At the time of the Great Plague of London, most of those who could afford to leave the city did so. In general, poor, older women who did not care for the sick in other capacities such as midwifery were assigned to the task of \\"searching\\". Searchers were sometimes coerced or bribed to mask patients' causes of death. Pressure from family members and others in the household would ask that the deaths of those affected would be attributed to alternative, less severe diseases than the plague in order to avoid the inconvenience of quarantine put on houses of those who had passed from the deadly disease.  Practice  Searchers were not trained for their jobs most times, and their duties posed serious personal health risks to those involved due to the frequent possibility of encountering forms of contagion. Their responsibilities were later divided from one of identifying plague victims into three essential purposes - searchers who determined if a sickness was associated with the plague, those who cared for the sick, and those who viewed corpses to attempt linking death to specific diseases. Searchers were required to live outside of common areas, to practice indoors, and to hold white sticks indicating their dangerous professions they were when in public spaces. While some continued working for up to a decade, most searchers died from the communicable diseases which they diagnosed in others.  Wages  Wages for searchers were typically earned per body, indicating that the women in this profession received a greater income during seasons of major epidemics than slower times. An average pay rate during the Elizabethan period was around 2d. to 4d. per body, but different parishes offered varied amounts depending on the women and their qualifications. Additionally, these women were not allowed to take on additional jobs and ultimately had to live off of what they were provided given the circumstances. However, searchers who had worked for a long time period and had gained the respect of their parish, like Goody Richardson and others, could be allotted a substantial raise for their services.  Notable women  Some examples of recognized searchers include Goodwife Pattson, who worked for St. Antholin, Budge Row, from 1590-91 to 1597-98. She worked alongside others like Mother Bamford, Goodwife Tailor, Goodwife Atkinson, and Goodwife Hubble. Widow Hubble, who was also a midwife, of St. Antholin Budge Row, was especially regarded by the parish and ultimately established a rental agreement for a house that was owned by the church. Not all searchers were as fortunate, however. Critics like John Graunt existed who were convinced that these women released unreliable and dishonest records. Despite normal criticism, searchers were instrumental in discovering symptoms associated with plague and helped to identify those affected.

Drug Enforcement Administration, often shortened to HIA v. DEA, refers to two lawsuits concerning the legality of cannabis extracts and other products from the hemp plant that have very low or nonexistent natural THC levels, including CBD oil, in the United States. The first is from 2004 and the second is from 2018.  2004 Case  In the 2004 case the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals established that the DEA had made illegal regulations intended to implement laws creating separate legal regimes for marijuana and THC. The court found the DEA's rules infringed upon legal trade in parts of the hemp plant exempted from regulation by Congress and against the will of Congress when Congress passed the marijuana and THC related legislation. Specifically, the DEA chose to ban trade parts of the hemp plant legally exempted from the definition of \\"marihuana\\" by using THC related legislation. The THC legislation was passed without repealing the marijuana legislation superficially creating two contradictory legal regimes for the same substance. When the court looked into the history of the legislation, the court found Congress was attempting to ban synthetic THC which had recently been synthesized in a lab. Because Congress chose not to repeal the marijuana legislation with the exemptions, the court concluded that the natural plant was intended to be covered by the marijuana legislation and the synthetic lab derived THC was intended to be banned by the THC legislation. The court further found that even if it regulation was legal, the DEA didn't follow the Congressionally mandated process for a federal agency to create regulations to implement laws so the regulations were struck down.  2018 Case  In 2018 Hemp Industries Association alleged the DEA for created and was enforcing a similar regulation to the one that the ninth circuit court of appeals struck down in 2004. The parties reached a settlement in which the DEA would clarify the new regulation in light of certain Congressional Acts and the Ninth Circuits previous ruling and distribute this statement to the public and its partner agencies that the plaintiff alleges were violating the 2004 ruling. The plaintiff, Hemp Industries Association (HIA) claimed that CBD is not regulated by the Controlled Substances Act; the Drug Enforcement Administration took steps in December, 2016 to index \\"marihuana extract\\" as a substance under its purview, with code number 7350. Part of the legal challenge stipulates that the DEA's action contravenes the Agricultural Act of 2014 (also called the 2014 Farm Bill) which allows hemp farming under certain conditions. After the lawsuit was begun a public statement was released. It started \\"Because [of] recent public inquiries that DEA has received following the publication of the Final Rule suggest[ing] there may be some misunderstanding about the source of cannabinoids in the cannabis plant\\", the DEA issued a clarification of the code which stated it did not apply to products derived from \\"parts of the cannabis plant excluded from the CSA definition of marijuana, such as the flowering tops, resin, and leaves\\". The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard the case in February, 2018. A number of members of the U.S. Congress filed an amicus brief supporting HIA.

He was also a trade union activist, an author, and a spy for the Soviet Union against Britain, an activity for which he was convicted and imprisoned. Glading, who was born in Wanstead and grew up in East London, left school early to find work. Starting with menial jobs such as delivering milk, he found skilled work at the Stratford marshalling yards. Later, he worked as an engineer at the Royal Arsenal, which was then the national production centre for military materiel. Glading spent World War I at the Arsenal, and after the war, he chose to involve himself in working-class politics. He joined the forerunner of the CPGB, which he later founded with his friend Harry Pollitt and others. Glading was a national organiser for the CPGB and acted as its ambassador abroad, particularly to India. He was active in other groups, such as the National Minority Movement, and when he married, his wife, Elizabeth, joined him in his political activity. He was prominent in the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU), but his political activity resulted in dismissal from the Royal Arsenal, a security-sensitive post, as the government regularly dismissed those suspected of subversive activities from its employment. MI5 opened a file on him in 1925 and considered him an extreme communist. The OGPU and its successor, the NKVD (the Soviet secret police) kept in touch with him through a series of handlers (including Arnold Deutsch, who later recruited Kim Philby). Around 1934, Soviet Intelligence recruited Glading as a spy. Although he no longer worked at the Arsenal, he had maintained contact with men of similar sympathies who still did so. The Arsenal was of interest to the Soviets, who knew that Britain was on the verge of creating the biggest naval gun yet. Glading had set up a safe house in Holland Park, West London, where he photographed various sensitive plans and blueprints. Unbeknown to him, the secret service had infiltrated the CPGB in 1931, with an agent known later as \\"Miss X\\"‚ÄîOlga Gray. Glading trusted her and involved her in his espionage activities and lodged her in the Holland Park safe house. He was eventually arrested in January 1938 in the act of exchanging sensitive material from the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. Predominantly due to the testimony of \\"Miss X\\", Glading was found guilty and sentenced to six-years of hard labour. On his release from prison near the end of World War II, he is reported to have found work in a factory and maintained close links with Pollitt and the CPGB. Glading died in Richmond on 15 April 1970 at 77. Early life Percy Glading was born in Wanstead, Essex on 29 November 1893. He later described his youth as being \\"the usual joys experienced by hundreds of poor proletarian families\\". His father worked on the railways, and Glading grew up in Henniker Road, Stratford, near the marshalling yards. According to his obituary, Glading distributed a radical paper, Justice, around the East End in his last years of school. He left school aged 12 to work as a milkman and two years later he joined the railways as a trainee engineer. He spent World War I employed as a grinder at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. This was an extensive government-run military-industrial complex supplying weapons and munitions to the Army and Royal Navy. In 1914 he was involved in a stoppage against blackleg working at the arsenal. He worked as an engineer in Belfast for Harland and Wolff in 1921 and was periodically unemployed. A 2017 biography of Olga Gray's handler, Maxwell Knight, described Glading as having \\"thick lips\\" and \\"lank hair\\". He \\"wore large round glasses that made him look like an overgrown schoolboy\\" but was \\"quick-witted and likeable\\". Early career In 1925 he moved from grinding at the Arsenal to the Naval Department as a gun examiner. By now he was known to the security services. On 10 October the same year, Glading was best man at Harry Pollitt's wedding to Marjorie Brewer in Caxton Hall. They were good friends, and had holidayed together in St Malo the previous year (where Pollitt had first met her). Glading and Pollitt's colleague in the CPGB‚Äîand later the latter's biographer‚Äîwrote of their escapades in St Malo. Pollitt, says Mahon, borrowed an expensive-looking watch from Glading to make an impression on Brewer: \\"In later years\\", wrote Mahon, \\"when [Pollitt] had come off second best in a tiff with Marjorie, who always had a mind of her own, he would say to Percy, 'It's all your fault for lending me that bloody watch'.\\" Glading and Pollitt had been among the founders of the CPGB, Pollitt was to be its General Secretary between 1929 and 1939 and from 1941 to 1956. When it was founded, there had been a proposal that a triumvirate composed of Willie Gallacher, David Proudfoot, and Percy Glading act as CPGB leadership; in the event, a single general secretary was appointed. Glading was elected to the CPGB's Central Committee in January 1927. Politically, he was on the left wing of the Committee following the 1926 general strike and the Party's subsequent period of self-reflection. Glading consistently pushed for a more independent communist line (independent, that is, from the Comintern). In January 1929, Glading and Pollitt were in the minority over the question of the progressive (or otherwise) nature of the Labour Party. Then, in July 1928, when it discussed the further question of affiliation to it, extant minutes of this meeting show the members as being split down the middle, nine for and nine against: Glading was in favour of the motion. Harry Wicks, in his autobiography, later described Glading, Pollitt and himself as being consistently \\"on the left within the party, thoroughly dissatisfied with what they saw as the right-wing actions of its CentraI Committee\\". In May 1929, he was appointed a factory member of the CPGB's Political Bureau, although his tenure was to be brief. Both Glading and his wife, Elizabeth, were high-profile communists and labour activists in the inter-war period. As well as being a party member, Glading was an active trade unionist and shop steward in the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Red International of Labour Unions. Glading printed and distributed the CPGB's paper, Soldier's Voice, and was assistant head of the CPGB's Organisation Bureau. Glading's MI5 file had been opened in 1922, and consisted of \\"notes on his official activities, intercepted correspondence and accounts of his movements\\". At this stage, though, there was nothing particularly compromising about his behaviour. It was his links to the communist agitator James Messer which drew him to the attention of MI5, as Messer was part of the Kirchenstein circle. This was an undercover courier network which relayed diplomatic, political and security secrets to Russia, and had resulted in the Arcos scandal of March 1927. Kevin Quinlan says this led to suspicions that Glading was a \\"conduit for the Comintern in the early part of his career\\". MI5 described him as \\"a red-hot communist\\", and as one of the party's \\"most influential members\\" of the period. Through his CPGB activities Glading had by now been recruited as a spy for Russia, through whom all espionage reports travelled to Moscow and to whom all funds were sent for distribution. =Indian expedition= left In 1925 Glading was the first member of the CPGB to travel to India‚Äîunder the pseudonym Robert Cochrane‚Äîpushing the CPGB policy of promoting revolution in Britain's colonies. Arriving on 30 January, he visited various cities and met individuals who were later to be central to the Meerut Conspiracy Case. This occurred in 1929 when a number of Indian men‚Äîall members of the Communist Party of India, then an illegal organisation‚Äîwere arrested and tried for organising a railway strike there in 1925. They were charged with conspiring to form a branch of the Comintern in India and overthrow the government. Robinson says Glading saw their trial as violating the men's \\"fundamental civil liberties\\"‚Äîparticularly as the group had to wait over two years to even be brought to trial‚Äîand that this made them \\"the final justification for the eventual overthrow of the ruling class\\" in India. Glading had been arrested along with M. N. Roy (who has been described by William E. Duff as a \\"paid Comintern agitator\\") and fifty-six other men, but, there being insufficient evidence to hold him, was released. The Indians were less successful and had to wait three or four years before their case even came up. It has been suggested that Roy both opposed Glading's expedition and had been irritated by it, as he believed that the CPGB had opened and read the letters they had promised to pass to Roy. Glading's original purpose in India, on behalf of the CPGB, was seeking to forge links with Roy as well as to study Indian working conditions specifically and more generally to promote the Communist Party. Nigel West says Glading was unimpressed by the efforts of the Indian Communist Party to organise the workers. Indian Political Intelligence noted that Glading had particularly focussed his attention on \\"shipyards, munitions works, dockyards and arsenals where strike committees or 'Red Cells' existed\\". Rajani Palme Dutt, in Glading's 1970 obituary, reported that Glading was eventually \\"deported under the authority of the Viceroy\\". Covert journeys to India such as these were common for the CPGB during this period. Pollitt was to persuade Olga Gray to make such a trip in 1934 to transfer funds from Glading to the Indian communist movement. She left England on 11 June 1934 and met Glading in Paris to receive the money and instructions. On her return, Glading obtained work for Gray as Pollitt's secretary. =Return from India= Based on his experiences in India, Glading wrote articles for The Labour Monthly and produced two books: India Under British Terror in 1931, and The Meerut Conspiracy Case two years later. The first he self-published; the CPGB published the second. Glading left India on 10 April 1925. He returned to Britain by way of Amsterdam, where, in July 1925, he presented the results of his studies to a communist conference that was taking place. R.W. Robson later reported how Also attending the conference were M. N. Roy and his wife, Henk Sneevliet, Gertrude Hessler, N. J. Uphadayaya, Clemens Dutt and R. W. Robson, also of the CPGB. Glading reported that \\"no Indian Communist groups existed at all\\", and that those he had met \\"were useless\\". Roy disputed this. He claimed that Glading had not encountered any Indian communists because they were unsure whether to make themselves known to him. Conversely, Glading believed he had found a communications problem between Indian communists and those aiding the movement from the outside. Later career Glading returned to Britain from the continent in 1927. He soon joined one of the most pro-Soviet English trade unions of the day, the National Minority Movement (NMM), and became a national organiser for the group. Along with another communist and fellow NMM organiser, Joe Scott, Glading launched the Members' Rights Movement at the Engineers' Rank and File Movement local conference in Yorkshire. This was a caucus within the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) which rejected a national pay settlement in 1931 and urged the formation of workers' councils in the workplace. Unfortunately for Glading, five months later, one member observed that the organisation \\"has not been heard of since\\". Further, Glading and Scott were expelled from the AEU for condemning their union's national leadership. The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, is seen in a nineteenth-century postcard. Back at Woolwich Arsenal, he again took up his post as an examiner in the naval ordnance department. Glading's career back at Woolwich was short lived. Following the Invergordon Mutiny, the government mandated that those employed in security-sensitive roles should have their political backgrounds examined. Those who were found to have subversive ideas had to renounce them or lose their jobs. Glading's politically motivated trip to India was uncovered when Guy Liddell cross-referenced the names of known communists with positions of sensitive employment. Special Branch wanted him sacked as soon as possible; Glading was thus in the latter group. In 1928, he and others were dismissed for \\"refusing to renounce their communist beliefs\\" and, at least in Glading's case, for being an agitator. He demanded of his Inspector what right the man had to impose \\"political fitness\\" on Arsenal employees. Glading appealed to his trade union for support, and the AEU brought the matter to the attention of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). They spent the next four months pursuing his case against Royal Arsenal management. Efforts included discussions with Labour MPs in parliament and barraging Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin with demands that he personally overturn the sacking. However, Baldwin did not intervene, the Labour Party did not raise it in parliament, and Glading did not get his job back. But says Jennifer Luff of the case, \\"TUC leaders had defended the civil liberties of a communist member\\" openly. The CPGB was active too, releasing a manifesto denouncing what they described as Glading's victimisation. In this, they claimed the company's actions to be merely the precursor of ridding naval and military installations of proletarian militancy. The CPGB took the opportunity to denounce \\"capitalist exploitation and prais[e] class war\\". Glading's case became a cause c√©l√®bre and made national headlines. Glading, too, roundly denounced the Arsenal for their treatment of him: Following his dismissal from Woolwich in 1928, Glading got a job with Russian Oil Products Ltd (ROP). It had been founded three years earlier by the Russian government to enable it to market its oil resources directly to the West. Although primarily a trading organisation, it also provided the opportunity to transmit back to Moscow any industrial and scientific intelligence its staff obtained. In 1929, Glading was promoted to the CPGB's London politburo and immediately left for Russia under the name James Brownlie. In Moscow he studied at the Lenin School for a year. This was the Comintern's training school, where Glading and other pupils were taught ideology and tradecraft. Glading's obituary, written later by Rajani Dutt, made no mention of the Lenin School, reporting that he spent \\"a year in the Soviet Union where he witnessed the great agrarian changeover from individual petty-bourgeoise holdings to collective farming\\". Following his graduation, Glading came under the aegis of the International Liaison Department (Comintern) (OMS); this has been described by Sakmyster as \\"the most secret department\\" of the Comintern, specialising in \\"the coordination of subversive and conspiratorial activities\\" abroad. Glading returned to Britain in 1930, where he began working for the CPGB's colonial department. Based in a top- floor office at 23 Great Ormond Street, he was the Soviet link between ROP and the CPGB. He served as a cut-out, communicating information between agents. He paid regular visits to the CPGB head office at 16 King Street, in London's Covent Garden. Historian Richard Davenport-Hines, says there was \\"nothing stealthy about his allegiance\\" to his chosen causes. In 1930 he became a full- time paid officer for the League Against Imperialism (LAI), where he first encountered Olga Gray, who joined the LAI in 1932. In June 1931, Glading was suspected of personally receiving the CPGB's intelligence reports from its various espionage groups and being the individual responsible for sending them to the USSR. Some of Glading's pro-Soviet activities were undertaken with his wife, who shared his political outlook. She too, for example, had links with the Kirchenstein circle. Another of Glading's associates was Jessie Ayriss, who was married to George Hardy, a fellow member of the Communist Party; Ayriss herself was employed as a typist at the Soviet embassy from 1937 to 1944. Espionage expert Nigel West has suggested she may have acted as a courier for Glading. =Recruitment by Moscow= Postmaster General authorising the interception of Percy Glading's mail. In the post-World War One period, an upsurge in communist activity in British industry, particularly in armaments and munitions factories led to employers in these sectors beginning to lay off workers suspected of left-wing sympathies. Although the CPGB had been of interest to the security services from its foundation, MI5's information on its activities had been confined to surveillance and technical data. When surveillance uncovered what they believed to be a \\"more sinister cadre\\" within the CPGB, MI5 infiltrated it with undercover agents. This was codenamed Operation MASK. From the late 1920s, the OGPU‚Äîand from 1934 its successor agency the NKVD‚Äîwere active in Britain. Recent scholarship has suggested that their rezidentura were the single biggest threat to British security during the interwar period. As well as Glading's ring, Nigel West says that John Herbert King was \\"haemorrhaging\\" information from the Foreign and Colonial Office. Farnborough RAF base had been penetrated by its own spy network, and Kim Philby and Donald Maclean had been recruited. London, comments West, \\"had become a veritable centre of Soviet espionage\\". Meanwhile, MI5 at full strength had a complement of only 26 agents at the beginning of 1938. MI5 believed that it was in the mid-1930s that Glading turned his attention from \\"domestic subversion to international espionage\\". The KGB's own files state that Ignaty Reif had recruited him by June 1934. He may have felt, as others did, that to be a \\"good communist\\" one should \\"carry out intelligence work which strengthened the USSR\\". Either way, the first indication that Glading was shifting his focus came in 1936 when he resigned from the CPGB. Like Glading, all his agents were either present or ex-members of the CPGB. Unlike most Soviet agents, Glading did not have a cover job; nor did he organise a cover story. John Curry, in the official history of MI5, notes that Glading‚Äîindeed, all Soviet CPGB recruits‚Äîeffectively ceased all party activity from the point that they were recruited. These were effectively \\"fake resignations\\" (and, indeed, were described as such later by Pollitt himself, who was almost certainly aware of Glading's espionage career). The Soviets gave him the codename \\"GOT\\", and named their \\"G\\" Group‚Äîbased in Copenhagen‚Äîafter him. Historian David Burke says it seems likely that the Woolwich spy ring was created by the NKVD to gain possession of a top-secret large naval gun that the Arsenal was believed to be researching. Glading had been informed of these plans‚Äîof which only five copies were ever made‚Äîat some time in 1935 by contacts in the War Office and Admiralty: Glading's mission was to report on the gun's arrival at Woolwich and obtain an example. Glading was the subject of frequent covert surveillance operations. On one such occasion in July 1936, he was observed at Cambridge Circus meeting up with Charles Moody. Much of Glading's operation at this time would have been concerned with the on-going deadlock at the Montreux Convention, at which Britain, France, Italy and the Soviet Union disputed their proposed access to the Black Sea with Turkey. At the same time, a faction within the government led by Sir Samuel Hoare was urging for swift British re-armament, and claiming, Hoare said, that Russian re-armament made the Royal Navy look a \\"mere bagatelle\\". Doubtless, says Davenport-Hines, Glading and Moody went to a pub, having much to discuss in the \\"implicit threats to Soviet security being revealed at Montreux and Southampton\\". In 1936, Glading was asked to vouchsafe for Theodore Maly and Arnold Deutsch, both \\"top class\\" Comintern recruiters. Maly was a Hungarian ex-priest and Deutsch an Austrian Communist, and they had been tasked with recruiting a Foreign Office civil servant, John Cairncross. Maly and Deutsch requested the assistance of James Klugmann‚Äîthen living in Paris‚Äîlater an important asset for Soviet Intelligence within the Special Operations Executive (SOE) who was acquainted with Cairncross. But Davenport- Hines says Klugmann refused to meet them, \\"until they had been endorsed by a CPGB member whom he trusted\\". That man was Glading, who travelled to Paris and vouched for the KGB men; Cairncross was soon recruited. Glading maintained a network of contacts from when he worked at the Arsenal, such as George Whomack (an assistant foreman of the Works), Charles Munday (an assistant chemist at the Royal Arsenal), and Albert Williams (an examiner in the Inspectorate of Armaments Department), all of whom later provided him with secret material and blueprints. Glading's group was one of two active in England in the early 1930s; little is known of the other but it is thought to have been associated‚Äîas Glading himself had been‚Äîaround the Russian Oil Products front. In January 1937, after Maly's recall, Glading was summoned to meet Maly's successor as controller of the Royal Arsenal ring. This was Mikhail Borovoy, a member of the OGPU's Technical Section, who was travelling with his wife under false Canadian passports (as Willy and Mary Brandes) and had arrived in London in October 1936. They lived in Forset Court off the Edgware Road. With Maly the Soviets' resident spy, the Brandes' were to act independently of the rezidentura and deal specifically with the Soviets' special assets: the Cambridge (and, to a lesser extent, Oxford) spy ring. To Glading they went under the names \\"Mr and Mrs Stevens\\", but they only stayed in London a few weeks before making their way to Paris. In that time, Glading met them at Forset Court. This in itself was a \\"highly unusual step\\" according to William Duff but essential in assessing the material Glading expected to collect and the resources he needed to do so. They also met Glading's agent within Royal Arsenal, George Whomack, and photographed some secret documents in the Holland Road safe house. Glading and the Stevens also received blueprints from George Whomack in Hyde Park. Mrs Stevens, who was travelling in the guise of a photographer for a furniture company, assisted with the photography during their stay. It was immediately after Glading met the Brandes that he instructed Olga Gray to find a suitable flat or apartment (for example, he specified that there should be no porter to espy their comrades' comings and goings). Glading's operation at Woolwich consisted of George Whomack smuggling out blueprints at the end of a late shift‚Äîpast military police guards‚Äîon the day the document had been released to the arsenal. Around this time Glading told Gray that he was \\"doing hardly any work for the party now, it is mostly for other people\\". =82 Holland Road= The MI5 mole, Olga Gray did not discover his spying for several years. In 1937, she assisted Glading to purchase the ground-floor flat at 82, Holland Road in West London. MI5 likely enabled the sale. The CPGB paid Glading the flat's annual ¬£100 annual rent (), and he paid Gray the monthly instalments to settle herself. Glading also provided ¬£60 to buy furniture on hire purchase, including a gateleg table for their large-scale photography work. Three sets of keys were cut, of which Glading kept two. During his later prosecution, Gray described some of the activities that went on. The team focussed on photography‚Äîwhich Glading told her was of \\"a very secret nature\\"‚Äîand began extensive testing (on local bus maps) with home-made cameras to make the end product as clear to their Russian recipients as possible. Glading saw Gray as a valuable member of his team: in May 1937, he suggested she give up her job, take a professional photography course, and work for him in the flat full-time. In return, he offered to make up her salary to five pounds a week; Gray accepted, although she was worried that she knew far too little of photography to be of much use; Glading reassured her. He also paid for her to take a holiday which she took at the end of June. Gray was expected to reside at the flat, and Glading promised her that he would only arrive by appointment. On 11 October 1937, Glading instructed Gray to replace the gateleg table with a refectory table as the former had turned out not to be strong enough to bear the weight of the equipment. In the event, Glading bought one himself from Maple & Co. four days later, and it was installed on the 17th. During their tenure in London, the Stevens' were regular visitors to the flat. Mr Stevens was often deep in discussion with Glading while Mrs Stevens assisted Gray with the photography. Gray also met other acquaintances of Glading's at the flat. For example, in April that year, she met a Mr Peters, whom Glading told her had been \\"an Austrian who had served during the War in the Russian cavalry\\". Peters was sometimes accompanied by a colleague; MI5 later identified them as Maly and Deutsch. Glading, Gray said later, found Deutsch an unpleasant individual; Glading told her that he had to tolerate Deutsch \\"for business reasons\\". Deutsch had run the Soviet spy network in England since February 1934, and Glading began introducing other people to him for recruitment (in one case, a father, swiftly followed by his son). Throughout this time the flat was under occasional observation by the secret service; Glading could spend hours in the flats and sometimes as little as twenty minutes, often bringing Gray with him and then leaving her there. John Curry's Official History of MI5 describes how Glading would receive various important blueprints which he would photograph at Holland Road, and return the same night. Gray, who was responsible for the photography, was to take and develop the photographs, but not to print the negatives. When the house was later searched, it was found to contain a camera, aircraft bomb plans, and even an anti-tank mine. Glading did not live far from Holland Road himself, having purchased a \\"salubrious\\" new development in South Harrow. =Photographic work= The right-hand door is number 82, Holland Road, W14; the ground floor flat was Glading and Gray's safe-house. In November 1937 the Brandes were recalled to Moscow, supposedly for family reasons. By now, Glading was \\"running out of money and patience\\". Glading told Gray on 17 January that he would be reduced to borrowing money to fund the operation, \\"if something did not happen within a week or so\\". Until the Brandes' replacements arrived, Glading could not send any of the material which his agents had passed to him. As for money, Brandes had left him with the best part of ¬£300 to finance operations before he left. But this had to run out at some point, especially as Glading had been instructed to purchase gifts for all his agents and contacts, presumably as a means of keeping them in touch. This further irritated Glading. This was a large number of people, many of whom he already considered as little more than mercenaries. Glading had also been instructed to take at least one of them out for lunch‚Äî\\"a fine figure of a woman\\", he told Gray, \\"who had done her best to impress him with her beauty, without success\\"‚Äîand whom he hated. Glading took such a dim view of her‚Äîand of his having to reward her‚Äîbecause, as he put it, she only did \\"about one job in five years\\". She could not be ignored, however, as she \\"knew enough to be nasty\\". Gray later said Glading was becoming anxious; work seemed to have dried up after the naval gun affair. On at least one occasion around this time, Gray said Glading arrived at the flat drunk and jittery. She also reported his detached attitude towards the recall‚Äîand presumed execution‚Äîof their controllers. \\"These blokes\\", Glading had observed to her, \\"live on a volcano the whole time they are over here, and when they do go home you do not know if they will ever come back\\". Also, she said, Glading was keen to \\"continue to practice with the photographic apparatus to perfect their technique as he did not like being dependent on the vagaries of foreigners\\". It was his lack of trust in Brandes' competence that led him to place so much reliance on Gray's newly-learned skills. Glading was probably attempting to keep the cell operating under his own aegis. Yet, aspects of Gray's report suggest that Glading was himself insufficiently trained to do such specialised work. His attempts to keep the cell made him a \\"liability\\", according to David Burke. The reason he gave Gray for wanting to take the camera from Holland Road to South Harrow was that his own camera was the wrong size for the stand, and he had had to balance it \\"on a pile of books\\". Glading's operations within the Arsenal were extremely risky, due to its high-security status and his own impatience. He no longer had the Russians supporting him which also increased his chances of capture. Robinson has described him as \\"somewhat of an over- zealous renegade who, at times, needed to be reined in by his superiors\\". In November 1937, the CPGB Secretariat wrote to him asking him to reconsider his earlier resignation and re-join the party \\"of which you were such an active member\\". Burke suggests that, far from being a solicitous invitation to reconnect with old comrades in struggle, it was \\"little more than an instruction to sever connections with the 'secret' party and to re-join the 'open' party\\". By the end of 1937, a provisional case against Glading had been established. MI5 knew of his interest in the fourteen-inch heavy naval gun that was now in production at the Royal Arsenal, and that Whomack was removing the blueprints for it and bringing them to Holland Road for copying. The copying was done by Stevens in 42 exposures on the evening of 21 October 1937, and then the blueprint was returned over night or the next day. Although the men could be searched by the Arsenal's security on entry, even the simple expedient of folding the plans between a folded-up newspaper was sufficient to avoid detection on at least one occasion. Olga Gray, says Davenport-Hines, brewed a pot of tea for the group \\"while the films were hung in the bathroom to dry\\". Gray was later able‚Äîby standing on the edge of the bath‚Äîto surreptitiously note down the serial numbers of the pieces of blueprint. In November, Glading removed the camera to his own house in South Harrow. The following January, Glading informed Gray he had a major operation coming up. This was the copying, not just of a blueprint, but a 200-page manual. For this purpose, the security services laid on extra watchers at Glading's house, where the work was to take place. It began on 15 January; it must have been completed overnight, as the following day, Glading was observed taking a package to Charing Cross station. Meeting Charles Munday in the public lavatory, they adjourned to a nearby restaurant where the handover took place. =Capture= Charing Cross where Glading and Whomack were finally arrested, as seen in 2007. After a seven-year operation, Olga Gray set Glading up for arrest. On 20 January he telephoned Gray at the safe house, asking her to meet him the next day. Glading took Gray out to lunch at the Windsor Castle bar to discuss a \\"significant\\" operation he had planned for 82 Holland Road that same night. He had brought a suitcase with him; she was to be at the safe house by 6:00 PM. William Duff quotes Glading as telling Gray that Glading had \\"got the stuff parked all over London\\"‚Äînegatives of blueprints he kept at various locations‚Äîand that he mentioned a pre-arranged meeting with someone that evening, again at Charing Cross. This was the cue the security services had been waiting for. Gray telephoned MI5 and duly reported what Glading had told her. That evening, 21 January 1938, Glading was tailed to the station yard. MI5 did not have the necessary statutory powers to perform arrests, and had briefed Special Branch to do so. This took place almost immediately. Inspector Thomas Thompson (of the Special Branch) observed Glading receive an envelope which was later discovered to contain blueprints. The suitcase in his possession was found to have a false bottom; it was thought that this was the means by which plans were smuggled out of the Arsenal. The man he received it from‚ÄîAlbert Williams‚Äîwas also arrested. The envelope was found to contain a blueprint of some pressurized machinery under development at the Arsenal. When the police searched Williams' flat, photographic equipment was found. Whomack, who lived in East London, was arrested the following week. Williams believed that their capture was mainly due to Glading's recklessness which led him to take insufficient precautions. Glading and Williams were taken to Scotland Yard, where the package they had been caught exchanging was opened in front of them: it contained four blueprints for a pressure-bar apparatus. Glading and his companions were charged under Section 1, sub-section C of the 1911 Official Secrets Act. A search of Glading's home revealed cameras, exposures of blueprints, and a photographic film of 1925's Manual of Explosives textbook. Also found was a diary. This‚Äîdescribed by McKnight as \\"cryptic, though decipherable\\"‚Äîrevealed that Glading was \\"less than thorough\\" in his tradecraft. One diary entry the secret service was unable to crack made a reference to Melita Sirnis, who later revealed British nuclear secrets to the Soviets. Glading's diary listed not only her name, but her family home in Hampstead. Another made reference to Edith Tudor-Hart. Along with the explosives manual on film, they also found blueprints for a new aircraft design. Although Glading had been careful to wear gloves whenever he used the camera at Holland Road, he had slipped up once when he changed a lightbulb: this was all that the police needed. Chief Inspector Birch of Scotland Yard found fingerprints with a microscope, as he later told the press. Imprisoned before trial, it is possible that he confessed his leading role in the organisation to a fellow inmate, although doubt has been cast on whether the Woolwich spy ring was ever big enough to warrant a strict hierarchy of its own. Olga Gray, although she was able to give her evidence at Glading's trial anonymously, had been \\"terrified\\" at the prospect. Hennessey and Thomas have argued that, at this point, \\"the reality of her role struck home: that she had effectively destroyed a man who had trusted her implicitly and of whom she had become extremely fond\\". Trial The case proved to be something of a cause c√©l√®bre in both Britain and the United States. The press described the protagonists in florid terms: Gray was‚Äîsupposedly‚Äîof aristocratic lineage, who \\"had forgotten more about courage than many soldiers ever learned on the battlefield\\". Glading meanwhile was made out to be \\"dark, distinguished, suave...a reader of poetry and a dreamer of revolt under high scarlet banners\\". Hearings began in late January and continued into March 1938, some of which were held in camera for security reasons. This excluded the press. The CPGB, through the Daily Worker, \\"remained tongue-tied\\" over it: \\"only a sanitised report, of the trial, devoid of comment appeared in the paper\\" on 13 March. What was reported, however, had the side effect of drawing the general public's attention towards the issue of Soviet espionage. On day two of Glading's trial, for example, a welder who had seen anti-fascist agitator Geoffrey Pyke in the AEU offices (and \\"in very frequent communication with Glading\\") went to the police with what he knew. This, in turn, attracted MI5's attention to Pyke, whom for a time they believed to be the \\"Mr Stevens\\" who visited Holland Road. Although politically to the left, Pyke would be a significant figure in Britain's black ops and propaganda divisions against Nazi Germany within a few years. Later that same March, an insurance broker, who had also visited Pyke at AEU headquarters, reported similar suspicions to the police. Both men had been prompted by Glading's capture and trial to make their accusations. Glading was charged on various counts of obtaining secrets for, and betraying secrets to, a foreign power. With Whomack, he was charged with possessing a naval plan; with Williams, obtaining an anti-tank mine pistol and of procuring information of use to an enemy; with Munday, Glading was charged with obtaining information on explosives. Other charges facing him were possession of an anti-tank mine pistol, obtaining plans for a submarine mine fuse, and other plans \\"calculated to be useful to an enemy\\". Ironically, in case anyone was in any doubt as to the importance placed upon the naval gun, the Attorney General, questioned by the Judge, emphasised its significance in open court. The precise nature of Britain's enemy was never made clear, being only referred to as a \\"foreign power\\". The reportage made it clear that the Soviet Union was almost certainly the culprit. Glading's Old Bailey trial took place only two months after his arrest; this, says Robinson, is testament to how \\"clear-cut\\" the case against him was. The evidence presented included \\"a mass of incriminating documents and photographic material\\". Glading pled guilty. His solicitors, instructed by the CPGB, were Denis Pritt, leading, and assisted by Dudley Collard. They‚Äîat the CPGB's request‚Äîadvised him to change his plea to Not Guilty; this Glading did. But they presented little evidence in his favour and carried out only minimal cross-examination, and the defence was unable to question Gray's credibility due to her professional behaviour on the stand. The prosecution, on the other hand, consisted of some of the most well-known advocates of the day and was led by Donald Somervell. Pritt's defence of Whomack was more energetic, and he lambasted the Official Secrets Act for making it \\"far too easy to be charged for misdemeanour merely by wandering too close to a dockyard\\" or anywhere else such secret plans were kept.The trial judge, Sir Anthony Hawke, told the accused that Glading was \\"endeavouring to do anything [he] could to help another country and injure this. This is [his] own country but I cannot quite believe that this had any effect on your mind\\". The judge wondered whether, as perhaps evinced by Glading's prosperous existence, he might have profited financially from his work with Moscow and that he was motivated by money rather than ideology. Whatever his motive, the outcome was never in doubt. On 14 March 1938, Glading received a sentence of six years' imprisonment (hard labour). Williams was sentenced to four years, Whomack to three. Munday's charges were withdrawn by the prosecution. Duff argues it is possible that this was the result of his making a deal with MI5 to turn king's evidence and reveal the tradecraft of Glading's operation at the Royal Arsenal. Even the others, comments MI5's official historian, received \\"light sentences by the later standards of espionage trials\\". This may well have been quid pro quo for pleading guilty and avoiding the need for a full prosecution. =Aftermath= The Woolwich spy ring has been used as an example of the patience of early Soviet spymasters in creating and providing for their networks. The case showed, for example, how \\"Soviet intelligence did not possess a monopoly of 'sleepers' and 'moles' permeating targets\\", and was a \\"significant, if limited\\" MI5 success. The case exposed a concrete connection between the CPGB and Soviet espionage. It had the negative consequence (for the service), however, of reinforcing the erroneous notion that the CPGB was the most dangerous security threat of the period, and that members of the party were all willing tools of the NKVD. According to Richard Thurlow, this meant that the idea that \\"Soviet moles and secret communists could be recruited into the governing class from British universities was not considered as a plausible possibility in the 1930s\\", even though it allowed the recruitment of the Cambridge Five. Thurlow has also described the Glading case as an example of how MI5 could, on the one hand, successfully penetrate a subversive organisation, and yet, on the other, still not understand the significance of the intelligence it received by doing so. And Glading's was not to be the last case of its kind. Less than five years later, the CPGB's national organiser, Dave Springhall was also found guilty of spying for the Soviets and received seven years' imprisonment. Ultimately, Richard Thurlow says little is actually known of both the Glading Case in particular, and Soviet spy rings of the period more generally, for the simple reason that \\"so few files have been released\\". By the time of his arrest, Glading had been responsible for the recruitment of at least eight other spies, probably all within Woolwich. To this day, however, they are known only by their codenames, and it is impossible to identify the roles they played within Glading's group. Although two of the three members arrested in the \\"Arsenal Spy Case\\" (as the papers dubbed it) were successfully prosecuted, Glading's handlers were never uncovered. NKVD operations in London were temporarily curtailed, while agents, who may have been compromised by contact with Glading‚Äîsuch as Melita Sirnis‚Äîwere \\"put on ice\\" until their safety could be ascertained. Conversely, MI5 bizarrely failed to follow up some of the leads they had been given. On Sirnis, for example, the file that was started on her in 1938 \\"was soon closed without any effective consequence\\". Tudor-Hart, too, even though clearly (although perhaps peripherally) involved in Glading's cell, faced no effective action from the secret service. MI5's own report into the Glading affair was itself removed, copied and transmitted to Moscow in 1941 by the Soviet spy Anthony Blunt. Soviet espionage in Britain remained a priority for the security services into the next decade, culminating with the revelations of Walter Krivitsky‚Äîa defector from Soviet Military Intelligence‚Äîin 1940. Overall, the situation has been described as a \\"basically unequal contest\\". Lord Robert Cecil compared it to \\"an imaginary soccer match between Manchester United and Corinthian Casuals\\", such was the disparity between the Soviet and British security services in resources, professionalism and influence. In the context of Cecil's analogy, MI5's success in breaking up Glading's cell has been compared to a home draw for the latter against the former. Later life Glading had been \\"deeply shocked\\" to learn that Gray was really an MI5 mole. He spent his imprisonment in Maidstone Gaol (Whomack and Williams were sent to Parkhurst). On at least one occasion Glading was visited by Jane Sissmore, MI5's chief debriefing officer. She was particularly interested in information that Glading possessed that may have helped prove or deny what she was learning from her then-ongoing debriefing of Walter Krivitsky. Guy Liddell, a colleague of Sissimore's in the secret service, later wrote in his diary entry for 13 October 1939: MI5 disagreed with the trial judge's suggestion that Glading was motivated by money. Maxwell Knight concluded that he was clearly ideologically driven, although one who \\"bafflingly\\" had an aversion to foreigners. By the time Glading was released, Pollitt had lost his post as General Secretary to the CPGB in a split within the Central Committee, in 1939, over Stalin's rapprochement with Hitler. Little is known of Glading's life or career after his release from prison. He had become estranged from his wife at some point before his trial. Nigel West wrongly concluded that Glading was \\"stripped of his CPGB membership\\" and moved to China where he later died. Glading returned to party work as an industrial organiser on his release from prison in 1944, John Mahon makes a reference to Glading's wartime activity: Pollitt's diary entry of 6 July 1944 says, that Glading \\"has roof and windows [bombed] out, I met him for a chat. Early this year his factory was bombed out, a man from the Air Ministry congratulated him on the way he got the workers to tackle the damage and then continue work on an urgent job in the open air\\". In 1951, as \\"Bro. P. E. Glading\\", he was presented with a ceremonial copy of James George Frazer's seminal work, The Golden Bough, by the North London District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. The book was signed by, among others, Jack Reid and Reg Birch. Likewise, if Glading went to China, it seems improbable that he died there, since the Labour Monthly‚Äîedited by Glading's old comrade from the 1925 Amsterdam conference‚Äîpublished an obituary to Glading in 1970. This stated that he had died on 15 April that year, at the age of 77, at his home in Surrey. It is also not certain that the CPGB renounced all contact with Glading as West claims. There was clearly some distancing, but it has been suggested that \\"once the dust had settled\\", Henry Pollitt authorised \\"discreet relations\\" from the party to Glading. Certainly, Glading was‚Äîfor the last few years of his life‚Äîon the editorial board of the Labour Monthly, which he contributed to pseudonymously. His rehabilitation within the CPGB may have been partly because there was \\"more than a sense of a honey trap in the case\\"‚Äîbut also, suggests Graham Stevenson, because Glading had, after all, \\"been Harry's best man at his wedding\\". Indeed, it is quite probable that West does not know what he was talking about; as Pollitt‚Äîwho was writing his autobiography whilst Glading was still imprisoned‚Äî went to the trouble of acknowledging Glading as his friend. This was in spite of the fact that Pollitt was well-known to be \\"extremely suspicious\\" of spies or anything that could incriminate him in their work. Glading's obituary, written by Rajani Dutt, omits all mention of his spying activities, merely stating that on his return from Russia, Glading \\"was engaged until his trial in trade union activities\\".

She is known by an exceptional number of names, including Albinia, Elvira, Maria, Albidina and Blanche.  Early life  Elvira was the eldest daughter of Tancred, Count of Lecce, and Sibylla of Acerra. Her father, an illegitimate member of the royal family, seized the throne of Sicily upon the death of his cousin William II in 1189, thus dispossessing his aunt Constance, who had been heir presumptive as William II's closest legitimate relative. A war of succession ensued between Tancred and Constance's husband, Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI. King Tancred died in 1194, leaving the crown to his son, William III. William was deposed by Henry and Constance later that year. Elvira's defeated mother was promised the County of Lecce and the Principality of Taranto as compensation, but she and her children were soon arrested on the charges of treason. Elvira's brother died blinded in 1198, while she was taken with her mother and two sisters to Germany and imprisoned in Hohenburg Abbey. They either escaped or were set free following papal intervention.  Pursuing claims  In 1199, Sibylla arrived in France with her daughters. Constance and Henry had both died shortly after conquering Sicily, leaving the kingdom to their infant son, Frederick. Sibylla intended for Elvira, her eldest surviving child, to marry a French nobleman powerful enough to press Elvira's claim on the Kingdom of Sicily against Frederick's regents. King Philip II of France convened a council in Melun, where it was decided that Elvira should marry Count Walter III of Brienne. Shortly after the marriage, Elvira, her husband and her mother all asked Pope Innocent III to help them take the kingdom. Walter petitioned him to recognize Elvira's claim to her father's throne. Innocent was Frederick's guardian, however, and refused to recognize Elvira as the heir of the entire kingdom. Instead, he recognized her right to the fiefs of Lecce and Taranto, her father's original domain, which had been promised to her mother by Henry. In exchange for this, Elvira and her family had to accept the infant Frederick as their king. Elvira accompanied Walter to the Kingdom of Sicily in 1201. Her husband achieved significant victories against Frederick's forces but was ambushed and killed in 1205. Elvira was pregnant and some time afterwards gave birth to a posthumous son, Walter IV, who inherited Brienne. Although it had become accepted in northeastern France that a widow could rule as regent for her minor child, Elvira stayed with her son in southern Italy, effectively leaving the regency to his uncle John. Elvira's quick remarriage severed her link to the House of Brienne and John made no effort to support her claims.  Later life  In order to protect her son's interests and advance her own claim to the throne, Elvira remarried soon after Walter's death. Her second husband was James, Count of Tricarico, whom she married already in 1205. She married, thirdly, Tegrimo di Modigliana, Count Palatine of Tuscia. Elvira died there in 1231.

Tissue engineering principles are used in order to create a non- degradable and biocompatible material that can replace cartilage. While creating a useful synthetic cartilage material, certain challenges need to be overcome. First, cartilage is an avascular structure in the body and therefore does not repair itself. This creates issues in regeneration of the tissue. Synthetic cartilage also needs to be stably attached to its underlying surface, bone. Lastly, in the case of creating synthetic cartilage to be used in joint spaces, high mechanical strength under compression needs to be an intrinsic property of the material.  Natural cartilage  There are three types of cartilage in the human body: fibrocartilage, hyaline cartilage and elastic cartilage. Each type of cartilage has varying concentrations of components such as proteoglycans, collagen and water which determine its functional properties and location in the body. Fibrocartilage is most often found in the intervertebral discs, elastic cartilage is found in the external ear and hyaline cartilage is found on many joint surfaces in the body. Replacement of hyaline cartilage (articular cartilage) is the most common application of synthetic cartilage. =Articular cartilage= Cartilage is an avascular, aneural and alymphatic tissue within the body. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of collagen is what gives it its high strength. The figure below shows the components of the ECM.  Components  *Extracellular matrix components of cartilage including proteoglycan aggregates, collagen, integrins and fibronectin.Water: Water makes up around 80% of cartilage. * Chondrocytes: Chondrocytes are the cells that produce and maintain the cartilaginous matrix. They are sparsely dispersed throughout cartilage and make up only about 2% of the total volume of cartilage. Chondrocytes vary in size, shape and concentration depending on their location in articular cartilage. * Collagen: Collagen is a structural protein present in the extracellular matrix of cartilage. Collagen is composed of a triple helix structure of polypeptide chains and offers shear and tensile properties to the cartilage. Type II collagen is the most common type of collagen present in cartilage though types IX, X, XI, and XIV are also present. Overall, collagen is a stabilizing protein present in the ECM. * Proteoglycans: Proteoglycans are the second most abundant macromolecule in the ECM of cartilage. Proteoglycans consist of a linker protein along with a core protein to which glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) attach. The most common GAGs are chondroitin sulfate and keratin sulfate. Proteoglycans attach to a central chain, usually hyaluronic acid, via a linker protein, to create larger proteoglycan aggregates. Proteoglycans are hydrophilic and therefore attract and restrain water molecules. This provides cartilage with its intrinsic ability to resist compression. * Glycoproteins: Many other glycoproteins are present in cartilage ECM in small amounts that help maintain structure and organization. Specifically, lubricin helps to create a lubricating surface on the cartilage for easier joint mobility. Fibronectin and integrins other glycoproteins present that help in adhesion of chondrocytes to the ECM. Structural zones in Cartilage including chondrocyte and collagen arrangement.  Structure  There are three structural zones in articular cartilage including a superficial tangential zone, a middle transitional zone and a deep zone. In the tangential zone, collagen fibers are aligned parallel to the surface and become gradually randomly aligned while moving into the deep zone. Collagen fibers in the superficial zone are aligned parallel to the surface in order to restrict shear stresses. Similarly, collagen fibers are aligned perpendicular to the surface in the deep zone in order to restrict compressive forces. Between bone and the deep zone lies calcified cartilage. Cell arrangement also varies between the zones, in deeper zones chondrocytes are stacked into columns while in the superficial zones they are arranged randomly. In the superficial regions the cells are also more elongated, while in deeper zones they are more spherical in nature.  Artificial cartilage  Synthetic cartilage can be composed of many different materials that mimic its functional properties. Tissue engineering principles include the use of cells, growth factors, and synthetic scaffolds in order to do this. = Components = * Cells: Chondrocytes are an obvious choice to use in the regeneration of cartilage due to their ability to secrete collagen and other ECM components necessary for the functional properties of cartilage. Chondrocytes can be harvested from a non-weight bearing joint space of an individual and cultured. Unfortunately, chondrocytes harvested from individuals may dedifferentiate and lose their properties. Additionally, aging chondrocytes show less metabolic activity and may not produce functional proteins or not enough functional proteins to create a desired ECM. Mesenchymal stem cells can also be used to create chondrocytes and make cartilage regeneration possible. * Growth factors: Growth factors can be used to induce differentiation of a cell or induce secretion of matrix proteins. Common growth factors for the application of synthetic cartilage include Insulin-growth factor 1 (IGF-1), Transforming Growth Factor Œ≤ (TGF- Œ≤), Bone Morphogenic Proteins (BMP) and Growth and Differentiation Factor 5 (GDF-5). = Structure = * Scaffolds are used in tissue engineering to create an environment with similar mechanical properties of the native tissue. Scaffolds must be biocompatible and have high compressive strength. Scaffolds can be created from hydrogels, polymers or other material. Hydrogels are lightly cross-linked polymer networks swollen with water. Degree of crosslinking, porosity, and polymer composition can be tuned to create a hydrogel with similar properties to native cartilage.  Function  Natural articular cartilage is an inhomogeneous, anisotropic, and viscoelastic tissue. The structure, described above 1.1.2. allows the cartilaginous tissue to have superior mechanical properties in order to perform the functions necessary. Synthetic cartilage will attempt to mimic the functional properties of natural cartilage, which can be broken down into two main aspects. * Load bearing properties: One of the main functions of articular cartilage is that it has the capability to effectively transfer repeated cyclic loading to bone. This compressive load can be multiple times the body weight due to activities such as walking and running, however cartilage achieves this function by dissipating energy. * Tribological properties: The second main function of articular cartilage is that it can have little to no wear over the course of the lifetime. It achieves this function by providing a lubricated surface with a coefficient of friction near zero. By creating a smooth surface, this lubrication prevents both cell and protein adhesion while also protecting the articular cartilage from damage. These are important functions of cartilage because of its role as a cushion in bone articulation. When damage and degradation occurs to the articular cartilage, it can no longer withstand the large loads without pain and discomfort of the individual due to the decrease in mechanical properties. After analyzing the load bearing and tribological properties of natural cartilage, these mechanical properties may be achieved depending on the structure and components of the hydrogel created, which will be discussed further in the Existing Methods section. These optimal properties can then be compared to the synthetic cartilage created. The properties of the hydrogels created can differ dramatically based on the components and the structure. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to achieve all mechanical functions of natural cartilage, which is the end goal of synthetic cartilage. When dealing with creating hydrogels, there are additional functions that must be considered. For example, the hydrogel must have the correct degradation properties in order to produce cell regeneration in the correct time frame that the hydrogel will take to degrade. Additionally, the hydrogel must not create toxic waste when degrading. These functions have been tested by comparing the stress, modulus and water content before and after implantation of different compositions of hydrogels. Existing methods There are many existing methods concerning regenerative therapies of cartilage as well as developing new artificial cartilage. First, regenerative therapies for osteoarthritis will be discussed. There have been substantial advances in recent years in the development of these regenerative therapies. These include anti-degradation, anti-inflammation, and cell and scaffold based cartilage regeneration. =Anti-degradation= Many biological agents and chemical compounds have been used in order to prevent matrix-degrading enzymes that actively work to degrade cartilage. Monoclonal antibodies, most commonly studied being 12F4.1H7, work to specifically suppress ADAMTS-5-induced aggrecan release. This in turn helps to slow down cartilage degradation and osteophyte formation. =Anti-inflammation= Inhibiting inflammatory mediators could help prevent osteoarthritis progression. Cytokines and chemokines are both crucial in stimulating cartilage catabolism and blocking these inflammatory mediators. Studies have shown that treatment with NF-Œ∫B pathway inhibitor BAY11-7082 restores IL-1b-inhibited chondrogenesis of cartilage stem cells and in turn postpones progression of OA. Similarly, ample research shows that combined blockade of TNFa and IL-17 with bispecific antibodies reveals an inhibition of both cytokines for reduced cartilage degradation and proinflammatory responses. =Cell and scaffold-based cartilage regeneration= In order to restore joint cartilage after injury due to chondrocyte loss, cell therapy and chondrocyte replenishment has been shown to work in certain studies. Lying self-assembled MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) on top of chondrocyte-laden hydrogel scaffolds has shown cell-mediated regeneration of hyaline-like cartilage. However, one drawback of this is that implantation of these scaffolds requires open-joint surgery to gather donor chondrocytes from non-weight-bearing joint cartilage areas. This makes it difficult to apply to the elderly. Along with regenerative therapies there are also several studies that show ways to develop new artificial cartilage. =3D woven fiber scaffold infiltrated with network hydrogels= One study discussed that the 3D woven fibers provide load bearing tibological properties of native cartilage where they are trying to achieve a near frictionless environment. Hydrogels are used as cell carriers because they can be readily seeded with cells. However, it is difficult to recreate both the biomechanical and chemical functions of natural tissue. Hydrogels of interpreting networks (IPN), are two different polymers mixed with one another on a molecular scale. This works to increase fracture toughness. They are ionically-crosslinked networks with a special type of IPN that is capable of scattering mechanical energy while maintaining the shape of a hydrogel after deformation. Structure of a double network hydrogel can be seen by combining the blue and red hydrogel shown. =Double network hydrogels= Similar to the previous study, double network hydrogels are used. They are composed of two kinds of hydrophilic polymers. At 6 weeks of implantation, the samples compared to those without treatment showed biodegradable properties. When using poly(2-acrylamide-2-methyl-propane sulfonic acid)/poly(N,N‚Äô-dimethyl acrylamide) or PAMPS/PDMAAm ultimate stress and tangent modulus increased. However, when using bacterial cellulose and gelatin, it showed a decrease of ultimate stress and it did not meet the requirements of artificial cartilage. Clinical applications Clinical application is extremely important to consider when looking at the efficacy of artificial cartilage. The recent clinical approaches for cartilage regeneration in Osteoarthritis treatment is described below. = MSC based therapy = In certain studies, matrix-induces mesenchymal stem cell implantation showed earlier clinical improvements when compared to simple implantation of chondrocytes. The MSCs promoted cartilage regeneration in knees that had osteoarthritis and also reduced pain and disability. = PVP/PVA hydrogels for articular cartilage replacement = Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels were used in this study. It was difficult to meet the mechanical properties of articular cartilage using this hydrogel. There was no inflammatory or degenerative changes in articular cartilage or synovial membrane surround this artificial PVA cartilage. PVP hydrogels were also studied. They exhibit high hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and complexing ability. When used as a blend of PVA/PVP hydrogel, they produced similar internal 3D structure and water content as natural articular cartilage. The best mechanical properties and friction system were blended hydrogel with 1 wt. % PVP. Due to the greater inter-chain hydrogen bonding, adding PVP to the pure PVA proved a better option. They acted exactly with a characteristic viscoelastic behavior of articular cartilage. Future work In terms of future work, there is still a lot to be done in this field. Artificial cartilage is a new research topic and much is still unknown. There is a lot of unknown factors involving ASCPs and more studies need to be conducted to make a more supported conclusion about the regenerative functions of ASCPs. Additionally, growth factors have been thoroughly evaluated, however specific combinations still need to be studied further in order to more effectively generate a tissue that can mimic the properties of natural cartilage.

During the Venetian Interdict imposed by Pope Paul V, he gained particular prominence for his anti-Roman sermons, preaching against papal regulation of religious orders in the Venetian republic. He was a colleague of the famous theologian and scholar, Father Paolo Sarpi in the defence of the Venetian Republic in her struggle with the Curia.Calendar of State Papers Relating To English Affairs in the Archives of Venice, Vol. 12, 1610-1613;July 3rd 1610, 1-15, n.1Rev. R. Gibbings Were Heretics Ever Burned Alive at Rome? p.3 Manfredi was tried by the Roman Inquisition, declared a relapsed heretic, and sentenced to be burnt. He was executed in the Campo di Fiore, in Rome. Early life Fulgentio Manfredi was probably born in Venice circa 1563, the son of Ludovico Manfredi. We know of two brothers; Giambattista, painter and engraver, and Gabriele, sensale di cambi. He joined religious life as an acolyte in 1580 and became a presbyter in 1586. He studied theology, and joined the Capuchin Franciscans, the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin. From as early as 1594 he was preaching in churches in Venice and outside, as well as in San Francesco della Vigna, where he was assigned. Known for his eloquent but biting polemic, he was banned from preaching for four years in 1594. Writings Manfredi alternated oratory activity with the production of religious and historical writings. However his authorship of certain works is quite speculative. In 1598 a compendium on the lives of the doges appeared, that consisted of twelve tablets engraved in copper with the portraits of ninety doges, with brief biographical notes. The carving was by his brother, Giambattista, and Antonio Foscarini ascribes the biographical notes to Manfredi. *The Procuratorial Dignity of St. Mark of Venetia (Venice, 1602).;R. Taucci, Intorno alle lettere di fra P. Sarpi ad Antonio Foscarini, Firenze 1939, ad ind. a small work on a \\"matter not previously treated,\\" according to Manfredi, which had a certain resonance among writers of his time. *The Lives of Saints and Blessed Venetians (never published) *Essay on the very modest lives of St Magno, contained in a sermon given in the Church of the Saints Apostles, where he preached from 1604 until 6 October 1605 *Life of St Peter of Orseolo, Doge and Prince of Venice, who became a Hermit Monk in Gascony (Venice, 1606)Vita del Glorioso Prencipe S. Pietro Orseolo Doge di Venezia Manfredi's fame however rests less in his literary productions, and more in his public oratory. Oratory During the Venetian Interdict, his participation in the anti-Roman campaign from the ranks of the so-called \\"minor theologians\\" alongside the official ones, brought him to prominence. The fact that he was not \\"a public or salaried minister\\"P. Sarpi, Lettere ai protestanti, a cura di M.D. Busnelli, I-II, Bari 1931, ad ind. pp. 43 s., 52 was popular. From the pulpits of Il Redentore and the Church of Humility, which had been confiscated from the Jesuits and entrusted to Manfredi, in front of a large audience among whom were many senators, Manfredi excoriated \\"the customs of the Roman court\\"p.101 By 1605, the Roman Congregation of the Index, had condemned a document protesting reforms imposed on his Order, attributed to him.Apologia, overo Difensione sopra la riformatione dell'Ordine suo, s.l. n√© d. At the end of 1606, he was summoned by the Congregation of the Holy Office \\"ad respondendum de fide\\" (to answer for the faith), but did not attend. In a \\"Manifesto\\" written to the Roman Inquisition which had summoned him to appear (Venice 1606) he addresses \\"All the Most Reverend Fathers in Christ, the gratitude of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, and the zeal of the Apostles,\\" and professes himself, \\"an openly veritable preacher, a staunch defender of the Evangelical doctrine and most humble follower of the Apostolic life\\"misc. of the Biblioteca Naz. Marciana di Venezia: Brochures on the interdict, Paris 1607, pp. 268 The excommunication issued on 5 January 1607 brought him growing notoriety, popularity, and accusations of heresy. The republican Paolo Sarpi, wrote to the German exponent of Protestant Union, Christoph von Dohna, maintaining that Manfredi's sermons were \\"only against the Pope\\" and they \\"criticised the ecclesiastical defects very effectively\\".p.122 Even the conservative statesman, Girolamo Cappello, denied that Manfredi had affirmed \\"heretical things\\"A. De Rubertis, Ferdinando I de' Medici e la contesa fra Paolo V e la Repubblica veneta, Venezia 1933, ad ind., pp. 266 The general tendency was to dismiss him as a mere friar who made distasteful pronouncements against Catholic customs. Berlinghiero Gessi, the papal nuncio to Venice (Sept 1607 ‚Äì July 1610) wrote to Cardinal Scipione Borghese shortly on his arrival, admitting that, although Manfredi had said many things from the pulpit, that should a case be taken against him \\"they could prove little\\" for lack of witnesses: and that \\"sadly he cannot be condemned, and he himself will only confess to having dissuaded the observance of the Interdict, and all the rest it is claimed he opposes, he denies\\".G. Benzoni, I \\"teologi\\" minori dell'interdetto, in Archivio veneto, CI (1970), pp. 31‚Äì108, p 305 Nevertheless, Manfredi's exuberance concerned all the parties to the dispute. The Republic of Venice was careful to distinguish 'firm defense of the jurisdictional princes', from 'attacks on the pontiff's own person'. On 21 April 1607 following Cardinal Fran√ßois de Joyeuse's intervention in the Interdict dispute, Manfredi was withdrawn from governance of the Church of Humility and his activities limited. Nuncio Gessi, angrily protested the provocative megalomaniac posting of a festoon on the door of the Church of the Humility showing the symbol of the Holy See in a \\"vacant\\" configuration, and a separate act of displaying a portrait, with the caption \\"Evangelicae veritatis propugnator acerrimus\\" (Ardent Defender of Gospel Truth). Departure to Rome Meanwhile, Manfredi, who was feeling increasingly isolated and betrayed by the republic he had passionately defended, became gradually more receptive to a plan to return him to obedience to the Church, devised by nuncio Gessi. Gessi rejected the Curia‚Äôs proposed use of force and instead managed to exploit Manfredi's ambitiousness and vanity to cajole him.Cicogna, 1382/L; 1629/III, c. 17; 2120: G.C. Sivos, Vite dei dogi overo Cronica veneta, III, cc. 168‚Äì173 p. 582 Aided by Zevio the Veronese, a friend of Manfredi and brother friar, and a promise of safe conduct and absolution from excommunication, Gessi persuaded Manfredi to 'take refuge' in Rome. Some attempted to dissuade and warn him about the patrician sarpiano Nicol√≤ Contarini, whom the government had tasked with preventing Manfredi from carrying out anti-Venetian activity once in Rome. On 8 August 1608, with a guarantee of safe conduct, Manfredi fled to Rimini, and from there to Ferrara and Bologna, where, \\"jubilant and happy\\", he was received with full honors ‚Äì wrote Zevio the Borghese.R. Taucci, Intorno alle lettere di fra P. Sarpi ad Antonio Foscarini, Firenze 1939, ad ind., p.79 In a letter to the Venetian Senate, Manfredi claimed that presenting himself to Pope Paul V lifted the burden from them of his defense, and he assured the senators that he had acted out of \\"love not mercy\\". Nevertheless, one fellow friar confided that he had been \\"more coddled and favored in the past few days than in all the years of valuable service to our 'Vinetians'.\\"Archbishop of State of Venice, Senate, Dispatches of the Ambassadors and Residents, Rome 59, paragraph 410 One prelate, witness to his departure, commented wryly: \\"Poor friar, with what joy and safety he goes to Rome, not knowing that he goes to the slaughterhouse.\\"Venice, Correr Museum of Correr, Correr, 1051: Relatione della morte, c. 25 The chronicler G.C. Sivos noted contemptuously: \\"Everyone ran to see him and the fool believed they competed for his virtues and beautiful deeds, not knowing himself for a wicked man...[not looking for] absolution from the excommunication, but boasting...that he was honored and cheered everywhere he passed, and feted by all the people with great competition, without seeing that many had come to witness an evildoer led to the scaffold.\\" Paolo Foscarini suggested that Manfredi had gone \\"with many doubts\\"p.30 and the Venetian ambassador in Rome, Francesco Contarini, wrote on 23 August that he had been promised 200 scudi a year, a secret abjuration and ample opportunity to preach.Venice State Archives, Senate, Dispatches of the Ambassadors and Residents, Rome, 59, No. 55 Manfredi arrived in Rome on 30 August and went to San Pietro in Montorio, the residence of his Order and two days later had an audience with the Pope, who \\"welcomed him with great promptness and with great humanness\\"60, No.1 and confirmed the promises that had been given. Manfredi, initially keen to provide detailed information on Protestant penetration in Venice, was soon uneasy. He found himself relieved from office, prevented from preaching, disappointed with his commission, opposed by the confreres and viewed with increasing suspicion by the authorities, and petitioned Venice in early 1610 for his return. This was ignored. Meanwhile, throughout 1609, the Roman Inquisition continued preparations to bring serious charges against him. Arrest and Trial \\"Yesterday morning\\" ‚Äì wrote the new Venetian ambassador, Giovanni Mocenigo, on 6 February 1610 ‚Äì \\"around twenty orders went to his Church of Aracoeli, and there took Fra Fulgentio prisoner. They wanted him to talk about the person of the Pope and others, for which they are not too well received.\\"62, 40 Mocenigo wrote, on 13 February, he had been unable to ascertain anything more except that Manfredi had \\"caused a scandal with his customs,\\"n.42 and that writings had been confiscated indicating his intention to escape to England. Manfredi, who was in the Tor di Nona prison, was dejected and humble, \\"against his custom\\". He was transferred to the prisons of the Inquisition Congregation, and tried. The charges included possession of forbidden books, contacts with heretics and autographed attacks on Catholic doctrine, the de-legitimisation of the Pope and the Council of Trent, and accusations of heresy. Manfredi denied all charges and claimed they were the result of misunderstanding. He was found guilty, declared a \\"relapso\\" (relapsed heretic), and handed over to the secular arm. Public Execution Different accounts of the execution are recorded; the official version given in ambassador Mocenigo's dispatches to the Senate of 3 & 10 July 1610, relates that: :On Sunday afternoon, in the Church of St. Peter, Fra Fulgentio abjured. There was present an infinite number of people. The Superiors of all the Orders were summoned to attend. I have learned from those who heard the minutes of the trial read out, that in documents in his own handwriting found in his cell he endeavoured to diminish and abolish Pontifical authority. :Fra Fulgentio was not aware that he was to make this abjuration till two hours before they took him into St. Peter's; he believed that he was to be absolved upon some salutary penance or something of little more importance; accordingly when, in the reading of the trial he heard himself styled \\"relapsed\\" and when the sentence of the Holy Office was published by which he was to be degraded and handed to the secular arm, he changed entirely and swooned away from the excessive fear which fell upon him. He was taken from St. Peter's to his degradation; and although it is customary to grant to those about to die for such crimes one or two days' grace, and the execution of the sentence was actually announced for Tuesday, nevertheless on Monday morning, very early, in the Campo di Fiore, he was hung by the neck from a stake, at which he was afterwards burned. At his death he showed great compunction of penitence, declaring aloud that he desired to die in the bosom of the Holy Roman Apostolic Church, repeating the word \\"Roman\\" several times, to the mighty edification of the bystanders. The tragedy that has befallen this unhappy man has given occasion to much discussion as to past events, and also because from this quarter he was enticed to leave Venice and was even assured of the protection and favour of His Holiness; and all the more so that, without that first abjuration which he was forced to make secretly on his arrival and merely as a form which would not deprive him of any rights, it would have been impossible to declare him \\"relapsed\\" and consequently they could not have put him to death. All the same those who heard the trial declare that he justly forfeited the protection of His Holiness and that it was impossible for them not to execute sentence on his person, for he affirmed positively that St. Peter was not the head of the Apostles, that the Pope was not St. Peter's successor, that he had no authority to create Bishops, that the Council of Trent was not general, that the Pope was a heretic, that friars and priests might marry, that it was not obligatory to consecrate the Sacrament in the Roman fashion; moreover he was in understanding with a heretic Prince in Germany and was minded to retire there in order to write and to live freely; that he had written letters to the King of England and had received in his cell a heretic English pilgrim, to whom he had said that he would like to go to England and by whom he was assured that the King would make much of him; and other such things.

She was not raised in a political household nor did her family believe policy was written for her people as they were working class Jewish immigrants in America. Education Having no books, education was not the biggest priority. However, Wolfe still managed to go to college, obtaining a doctoral degree. She attended college in the late fifties and early sixties, starting at age 16, graduating at age 19 from Brooklyn College. It was here her political interest was sparked, she began working on economic issues within civil rights with the Brooklyn Congress of Racial Equality (Brooklyn CORE). Wolfe continued her education in psychology by obtaining her masters and PhD, in this field of study. Wolfe is Professor Emerita in Psychology from the Graduate Center, CUNY. Personal life In the middle to late seventies Wolfe considered herself a lesbian, leaving her husband that she married at age 19. She describes that she experimented with men and when she was unsatisfied, delved deeper into the feminist movement. Wolfe created the ‚ÄúCR group‚Äù, which consisted of other women she was working with at a university as a graduate professor along with other women from her neighborhood. Naturally, due to lack of interest and publicity the group quickly failed and dissolved. Activism In the late seventies, Wolfe joined the Coalition for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse (CARASA), subsequently got involved in the national committee that pushed for the creation of the Reproductive Rights National Network. Wolfe became a part of that committee as well. She did demonstrations against Joseph Califano, the current Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1977-1979 (SITE) over reproductive rights and a plethora of other related topics. Wolfe then joined the Lesbian Action Committee, finding great difficulty in recruiting other females who had not ‚Äúcome out‚Äù yet. They began with educational information and demonstrations which immediately had been perceived as the committee trying to ‚Äúturn everyone lesbian.‚Äù As the Lesbian Action Committee evolved, they wanted to work with the Reproductive Rights National Network presenting information over lesbian focused material. Despite their intentions, the Reproductive Right National Network didn't want this type of publicity, distancing themselves from Wolfe and her committee. The Human Life Amendment was up in Congress so the group went to Washington to break up the hearings and ended up getting a large amount of publicity for it. As the Family Protection Act bill was released in 1980 the coalition named, Committee Against Racism Anti-Semitism, Sexism and Heterosexism (CRASH), was born consisting of Maxine Wolfe from the CARASA, Joan Gibbs representing Dykes Against Racism Everywhere, Laurie Morton representing Radical Women, and Naomi Brussel representing the Committee of Lesbian and Gay Men Socialists. This coalition held a conference over the Family Protection Act and began doing demonstrations about the Human Life Amendment and many other things. Since there was not a mass movement at the time, each woman's individual committee wanted to recruit into the political parties rather than become a mass movement. In spite, CRASH did a demonstration at the Neighborhood Church where 500 people showed up. This prompted each woman of CRASH to leave their individual committees, joining the new mass movement. In 1985, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) was created and Wolfe joined in an interest with the AIDS crisis. This same year, Wolfe was arrested for sitting in on the hearing for the Gay Rights Bill with a ‚ÄúLesbian Liberation, We Won‚Äôt Go Away‚Äù sign, refusing to leave after the hearing was over and they didn't vote. As well in 1985, Wolfe got involved with ACT UP and attended the 24-hour picket of Sloan Kettering as well as the March on Washington in October 1987. Because of Wolfe's political experience in the previous years, she led the way in getting ACT UP involved in policy instead of just advocacy to continue this mass movement. She also coordinated Woman and AIDS, an event at Shea Stadium where the METS played. Around 60 men and woman from ACT UP went to the game with signs to be televised across America and reach the large crowd of fans at the game. She was also involved with Stop the Church and organized the campaign to change the CDC definition of AIDS. In addition, Wolfe worked on campaigns and committees for AIDS research, pharmaceuticals, and more access to care and education. Wolfe left ACT UP in 1997. As of 2004, she lives in Brooklyn, New York.

Geography  Bihlafingen is an exclave of the municipality of Laupheim, being surrounded by the municipality of Achstetten to the west, the municipality of Burgrieden to the south, H√ºttisheim to the north, and Schn√ºrpflingen to the east. The latter two municipalities are part of the Alb-Donau-Kreis district. Most of the village's built-up area is situated on the slopes of the river Schmiehe which runs through Bihlafingen.  History  Bihlafingen is an Alamannic foundation, named after Pilolf, a leader or founder of an extended family. Bihlafingen was first mentioned in a document in 1129 as villa Pilolvingen and was mostly property of Wiblingen Abbey between 1318 and 1704. Up until then some property in Bihlafingen was owned by the Biberach Spital (a hospital foundation) which sold their remaining assets in 1704 to Wiblingen Abbey. In 1635, during the Thirty Years' War, the population of Bihlafingen fell victim to the plague. Except for one man, who then moved to neighbouring H√ºttisheim, the whole population perished and the village was abandoned until 1649 when the abbot of Wiblingen Abbey sent new settlers to repopulate the village. The village church is dedicated to St Theodolus. In 1749, tailor Mathias Eberle returned from a pilgrimage to Steingaden Abbey with a replica of the flagellated Christ. The following year Bihlafingen became a place of pilgrimage and has been ever since.Laupheim municipality website In March 1806, following the War of the Third Coalition and the defeat of the coalition, Bihlafingen, being he property of Wiblingen Abbey, became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, only to be transferred to the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg in September of the same year.

The design goal is to enhance the existing Information Security Management System (ISMS) with additional requirements in order to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS)https://www.iso.org/standard/71670.html ISO/IEC 27701:2019 [ISO/IEC 27701:2019]. The standard outlines a framework for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Controllers and PII Processors to manage privacy controls to reduce the risk to the privacy rights of individuals. ISO/IEC 27701 is intended to be a certifiable extension to ISO/IEC 27001 certifications. In other words, organizations planning to seek an ISO/IEC 27701 certification will also need to have an ISO/IEC 27001 certification.  Intended Application of the Standard  The intended application of ISO/IEC 27701 is to augment the existing ISMS with privacy-specific controls and, thus, create PIMS to enable effective privacy management within an organization. A robust PIMS has many potential benefits for PII Controllers and PII Processors, with at least three significant advantages: First, achieving compliance to privacy requirements (particularly laws and regulations, plus agreements with third parties, plus corporate privacy policies etc.) is burdensome, especially if the requirements are not organized in the most effective way for PII Controllers and PII Processors. Organizations subject to multiple privacy compliance obligations (e.g. from several jurisdictions in which they operate or data subjects live) face additional burdens to reconcile, satisfy and keep watch on all the applicable requirements. A managed approach eases the compliance burden, for example as demonstrated by Annex C of the standard, a single privacy control may satisfy multiple requirements from General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Second, achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable requirements is a governance and assurance issue. Based on the PIMS (and, potentially, its certification), Privacy or Data Protection Officers can provide the necessary evidence to assure stakeholders such as senior management, owners and the authorities that applicable privacy requirements are satisfied. Third, PIMS certification can be valuable in communicating privacy compliance to customers and partners. PII Controllers generally demand evidence from PII Processors that the PII Processors‚Äô privacy management system adheres to applicable privacy requirements. A uniform evidence framework based on international standard can greatly simplify such communication of compliance transparency, especially when the evidence is validated by an accredited third-party auditor. This necessity in communication of compliance transparency is also critical for strategic business decisions such as mergers and acquisitions and co-Controllers scenarios involving data sharing agreement. Lastly, PIMS certification can potentially serve to signal trustworthiness to the public.

Over the course of his career Young completed over sixty commissions for civic, church, synagogue and other public spaces, as well as privately collected works in oil, mosaic, ceramics and other media. His largest work is the mosaic West Apse of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., entitled \\"The Woman Clothed With The Sun.\\" Notable works in Los Angeles include the Holocaust Monument (Pan Pacific Park, Los Angeles), the mosaic bas-relief on the Richard Neutra-desigined Los Angeles County Hall of Records, mosaic panels on the exterior of the UCLA Math Sciences Building, and the Triforium (Los Angeles). in Fletcher Bowron Square on the Los Angeles Mall at the Civic Center, Los Angeles.  Biography  Joseph Louis Young was born Nov. 27, 1919, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to parents Louis and Jenny (Eger) Young. Young was an only child and grew up in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, where his parents owned the town's variety store. His father was a Ukrainian immigrant, and his mother, a Romanian immigrant. She was an artist and designer who encouraged her son in fine art as he demonstrated early talent. Young attended the college preparatory boarding school Randolph-Macon Academy in West Virginia, and hoped to attend West Point but did not gain admission due to color blindness in one eye. He studied art, literature and journalism at Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1941. He moved to New York when he got a job with United Press. In World War II, he served in the Army Air Forces during World War II as a writer. After the war ended, Young studied art in New York, as well as at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.  Career in Los Angeles  In 1952, Young and his wife moved to Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles after earning teaching fellowships from the Huntington Hartford Foundation. In 1955 Young was commissioned to create a mosaic mural, which he named \\"Theme Mural of Los Angeles\\", for the lobby of the Los Angeles Police Facilities Building (Parker Center) on Los Angeles Street. At least two dozen of Young's artworks can be seen across the city of Los Angeles. . In June 2018, \\"Theme Mural\\" was removed from Parker Center in one piece, in advance of impending demolition of the shuttered police headquarters. As of May 2019 the mosaic remains in art preservation storage, pending determination of a new permanent home for the mural. Young also created a mosaic topographical map of Los Angeles' water resources at the Richard Neutra-designed Los Angeles County Hall of Records, completed in 1962.  Personal Life and Death  Young and his wife Millicent made Los Angeles their home from 1952 until their respective deaths. They had two daughters, Leslie, and Cecily. Late in life, Young developed Alzheimer's disease and in 2007 died from hospital-acquired pneumonia secondary to the disease. He and his wife are buried at Eden Memorial Park, North Hills, California, where he also designed a mosaic arch of The Twelve Tribes of Israel.

There are just better games on the subject and in this price range.\\" References Category:Board games introduced in 1981 ","title":"Time Tunnels"},{"id":"57256338","title":"Clayton Parros"},{"id":"57256349","text":"Rita Strohl (born Aim√©e Marie Marguerite Merc√©d√®s Larousse La Villette) (8 July 1865 ‚Äì 27 March 1941) was a French composer and pianist. Musical career Born in Lorient (Morbihan), Rita Strohl was a gifted student and entered the Paris Conservatory at the age of 13, where she studied piano and solf√®ge. She studied composition and voice privately. She was also a member of the Soci√©t√© des auteurs, compositeurs et √©diteurs de musique. In 1884, she started publishing her chamber music trios, and the following year her Messe pour six voix, orchestre, et orgue r√©sonne. She is the author of several vocal, symphonic and chamber music pieces. She was endorsed by Camille Saint- Sa√´ns, Vincent d‚ÄôIndy and Gabriel Faur√©. Jane Bathori sang her Chansons de Bilitis, and Pablo Casals played her music. Notably honoured by Pierre Lou√øs and Henri Duparc, her music has gained renewed interest in recent years. Personal life Rita Strohl was the daughter of the painter √âlodie La Villette (1842‚Äì1917) and Jules La Rousse La Villette. She is also the niece of the painter Caroline Espinet (1844‚Äì1910). In 1888, she married the sub lieutenant √âmile Strohl (1863-1900) and took his name, giving birth to four children. After the death of Strohl, she married the master glassmaker Richard Burgsthal (pseudonym Ren√© Billa), a man almost 20 years her junior, in 1903. She created the short-lived La Grange Theatre in Bi√®vres, Essonne in 1912 with her second husband and with the financial support of Odilon Redon, Gustave Fayet and other subscribers. It closed at the beginning of World War I. There, she performed lyrical works filled with mysticism and symbolism. She divorced her second husband in 1930, and moved to Provence to live with her daughter and grandson.  Works  * For√™t de Broc√©liande (1887) * Titus et B√©r√©nice.

He then studied fashion design at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, Belgium after which he moved to Portugal in 1999. A year later, he founded his namesake label in the Lisbon neighborhood of Bairro Alto. After two decades of work, he is considered to be one of Serbia's, and also Portugal's, top designers.

His 2014 collection at Moda Lisboa was described as sensuous and embodying Japanese Manga heroines. In 2016, he had a runway show which was inspired by the paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe. In 2017, Protic's collection paid homage to British sculptor Barbara Hepwort, with his focus on ladylike elegance being described as \\"...refreshing and sincere, underlining his experienced hand.\\" In 2018, he presented an all-black collection, inspired by the silent screen actress Theda Bara and featured on the opening day of Moda Lisboa.

This intersection consists of the following roads: Charoen Krung, Odeon Circle, Wat Traimit, Rama IV (toward Hua Lamphong), Song Sawat (toward Wat Samphanthawong and Sampheng, via Song Wat road) and Mittraphan (toward July 22nd Circle). The boundaries of Mo Mi are considered to be where Rama IV and Mittraphan Roads originate, and where Song Sawat Road terminates. Mo Mi was known as Sam Yaek (‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°‡πÅ‡∏¢‡∏Å), which means \\"Three-Way Junction,\\" and Sam Yaek Charoen Krung (‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏°‡πÅ‡∏¢‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ç‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏á), meaning \\"Three-Way Junction of Charoen Krung.\\" The original name of Mo Mi came from the fact that during King Mongkut (Rama IV)'s reign, Mo Mi was only a three- way junction consisting of the Charoen Krung and Thanon Trong roads which later became the Rama IV road. Mo Mi serves as a divider between the two districts of Pom Prap Sattru Phai (on the west side) and Samphanthawong (on the east side). The Charoen Krung part of Mo Mi is easy to navigate on foot from the Damrong Sathit bridge (Saphan Lek). Under the past administration of Amphoe Samphanthawong, this area or tambon (‡∏ï‡∏≥‡∏ö‡∏•; sub-district) was called \\"Tambon Sam Yaek\\" in the province of Phra Nakhon (known today as Bangkok). In 1898, a fire occurred in this area, spreading rapidly across the neighborhood because of its contemporary design of wooden framing with thatched roofs combined with the high density of houses. Since then, the government in general banned the construction of wooden dwellings. The surviving Phlapphla Chai 2 Police Station site on Phlapphla Chai road was known as Sam Yaek Police Station at the time of the fire. \\"Mo Mi\\" was named after Mo Mi or Mi Kasemsuvan, a pharmacist who specialized in herbal and medical chemistry, especially Snuff.

It was heavily damaged by aerial bombing in 1940, and was relegated to an un-named service road and footway in post-war reconstruction of the area. Recent versions of the Bristol Local Plan have sought to re-instate this street and some of the surrounding historic street layout, to improve the link between the shopping area of Broadmead and the St Nicholas Market area. History Mary le Port Street originated as a pre-conquest hollow way. Archaeological excavations in 1962 to 1963 found evidence of late Saxon activity on either side of this way, and of a timber building from this period. In the 13th century or later the hollow way was filled in and paved, possibly using material derived from the digging out of cellars in the area. St Mary le Port Church was probably built in Saxon times, and was subsequently enlarged and rebuilt to reach its peak of development in the 15th century. Writing in the 1920s, Charles Wells described Maryleport St as a place where: Wells described the church as being much hidden from view by these old shops, and best viewed from its churchyard behind. The street made an impression on J. B. Priestley when he visited in 1933: Along with the surrounding ancient streets, Mary le Port Street was bombed on the night of 24 November 1940 and almost completely destroyed. Post-war reconstruction plans for a new Civic Centre ‚Äì consisting of an art gallery, museum, hotel and exhibition centre, to be built in the area between St Peter's Church and High Street ‚Äì came to nothing, and the sites on either side of Mary le Port Street were leased to the Bank of England and the Norwich Union Insurance Company, whose now-derelict buildings still occupy the sites. Today Mary le Port Street has disappeared from the map; its carriageway was taken up in October 1963. The ruins of St Mary le Port Church are a scheduled monument, whilst the tower is a listed building. In 2018, Bristol City Council sought to reinstate this street: The site was sold to international investment company Federated Hermes in 2020. Developer MEPC stated that they intended to create \\"A new memorable and distinctive place that reinstates lost streets and routes that existed before the Second World War\\". The site of Mary le Port Street is within the Old City and Queen Square Conservation Area.

Martin persuaded the Bishop of Oxford to ordain him Deacon, which put an end to his father's plans, and indeed won his approval.Chanter, 1910, p.18 His father purchased for Martin the next presentations to the livings of the parishes of fremington and King's Nympton in North Devon.

He was thrice dispossessed of the living of Barnstaple, but was re-instated after the first two events, having been summoned to appear before various Parliamentarian committees. On one occasion he was seized by a party of cavalry and taken on \\"a bitter, stormy, winter day\\" to Exeter, 35 miles to the south-east. Tradition relates that on one of these occasions he was dragged from his pulpit in St Peter's Church whilst giving a sermon.Chanter, p.97 He was finally reinstated following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, and remained in office until his death in 1673.Chanter, p.98 A letter dated 12 October 1646 was sent on behalf of Blake by Richard Ferris, Mayor of Barnstaple, and other aldermen to Sir John Bampfylde, 1st BaronetWalker, fol. 258 (c.1610-1650) of Poltimore and North Molton and Tamerton Foliot, one of Devonshire's Parliamentarian leaders during the Civil War.

In 1911, he decided to remain in Ia»ôi where he devoted himself to genealogy studies. He founded the Genealogical Archive magazine that has appeared from January 1, 1912, which would be, as Zotta said, the alien to political struggles and far from any snobbish tendency of social differentiation. Unfortunately after 1913 it was no longer printed due to the lack of funds. The editorial staff of the Genealogical Archive magazine was at the Golia Monastery in Ia»ôi.  Career  At the State Archive in Ia»ôi, whose rich deposits Zotta began to explore at his arrival in Ia»ôi, the vacancy of the head of the Archive had become vacant, because o the retirement of Gheorghe Ionescu-Gion in October 1912. Dimitrie Onciul, as General Director of the State Archives, has wished to give an impulse to the archival activity in Ia»ôi, and proposed to the higher forums Sever Zotta for this position. On October 1, 1912, he was appointed as director of the State Archives in Ia»ôi, a position he held until 1934. During this period he convinced the individuals to submit to the archives the documents they kept. In this way documents from his friend Pavel Gore (1875-1927) arrived in deposits. Also, the rich private archive, created by Nicolae Rosetti-Roznovanu, has arrived, for a certain time, to the Ia»ôi's archives. He was the successor of Ioan Tanoviceanu (law professor from Ia»ôi, specialized in the genealogy of the Pr√¢jescu family from the Stolniceni village). Since 1919, he became a correspondent member of the Romanian Academy and the honorary member of the \\"Historical Monuments Commission\\" (at the recommendation of Nicolae Iorga). In 1921, together with the historian Gheorghe GhibƒÉnescu, they established the \\"Society of History and Archeology\\" in Ia»ôi. Zotta has carried out a rich publicity activity based primarily on the country's documentary treasury, gathered at the State Archives repositories. Thus, under the aegis of the Society of History and Archeology, in October 1921, the Ioan Neculce magazine appeared in Iasi, in which were published the studies and documents elaborated by him, Gheorghe GhibƒÉnescu, Teodor Burada, Nicolai Andriescu-Bogdan and others. In all the editions of the Ioan Neculce journal that appeared between 1921‚Äì1933, Sever Zotta published studies and communications on Iasi's past, among which the interesting historical research on the Golia monastery were noted. In addition to Ioan Neculce magazine, Sever Zotta has collaborated with various historical publications: The Archive, The Historical Magazine, The Archive Magazine, The Literary Talks, The Romanian Archive, as well as in some newspapers (The event, Opinion, the Romanian People). He founded the first specialized publication \\"Genealogical Archive\\" (published in Ia»ôi in 1912-1913). In the evolution of Romanian genealogical science, the appearance of the ‚ÄúGenealogical Archive‚Äù magazine was a remarkable event. The article-program \\"What do we want\\"Sever Zotta, Ce voim, √Æn \\"Arhiva genealogicƒÉ\\", 1,1912, p.1 is a true profession of faith: \\"The purpose of the present magazine is to awaken and enlarge the broad circles of the Romanian society, in and out of its political boundaries, the interest for the history, life and future of families because of this special interest to benefit the general interest for the history, life and future of the Romanian people\\". The entire archives with the Zotta works are in the Archives of Bucharest and Iasi (genealogy section). The Sever Zotta's personal fund,R√Ænzi»ô Filofteia »ô.a.: Arhive personale »ôi familiale. Repertoriu arhivistic. Vol. 1, Arhivele Na»õionale ale Rom√¢niei, Bucure»ôti 2001, pag.169 with inventory number 948 can be found in the National Archives of Romania in Bucharest. The correspondence collection carried by Sever Zotta with the personalities of that time, such as Nicolae Cartojan, Nicolae Docan, Gheorghe Bogdan-DuicƒÉ, Constantin Giurescu, Pavel Gore, Nicolae Iorga, Dimitrie Onciul and Radu Rosetti can be found. Apart from these documents, studies and notes on the genealogy of some noble families and documents collected by Sever Zotta can be found. From the last series of documents is a fragment of the archive of Pavel Gore and of the Rosetti- Roznovanu family, letters from Costache Negri, A. Morariu. Appreciated by D. Onciul and Nicolae Iorga for his outstanding scholarship in the field of genealogical studies, Sever Zotta entered into the Romanian historiography as a genealogist par excellence. He lived in Ia»ôi by 1934, when he retired. Surprised by the events of the summer of 1940 at his home in Davydivka (Storojine»õ County - today in Ukraine), Sever Zotta preferred to stay on site to save library and the manuscript collection. On June 13, 1941, he was arrested by NKVD commissioners, who only gave him ten minutes to do his baggage, being deported by the Soviets to the Ural.

The nickname Wopo, which would become her professional name, was a mispronounced version of a name given to her by neighbors who were of Miwok descent.

Her artworks frequently embed natural imagery into the urban environment. She frequently spoke of her dedication to public art, especially in a public transit setting, telling the New York Times in 1989 that Putting art work in a subway station elevates the mundane experience of riding to work or to school. Her first major commissioned work, Triumph of Pegasus (1988), is a monumental bas-relief sculpture installed at a training center for blind and visually impaired people in New Jersey. Holup intended the sculpture to be touched, so it could provide equal engagement for people of all visual abilities. The relief sculpture depicts the mythological story of Pegasus doing battle with the Chimera. It was commissioned as a result of the State of New Jersey Public Building Arts Inclusion Act, and is constructed of black-pigmented cement polished with linseed oil. Holup's most significant work is River That Flows Two Ways (2000), a series of 37 sculptural cast-iron and bronze panels installed as part of a railing on the waterfront at Battery Park. The panels frame the view beyond them, incorporating both the landscape of the city and the river into the artwork. They depict Lower Manhattan historical sites, like Trinity Church and Fort Amsterdam, juxtaposed with representations of the river and local wildlife. The artwork was commissioned by the Conservancy for Historic Battery Park and its $300,000 cost was funded by the Hanover Square Pilot Funds, the Greenacre Foundation, the New York State Environmental Protection Fund and the Starr Foundation. The River, a 2007 work in Kansas City, also incorporates water imagery. The installation consists of a bronze and limestone inlay in the floor of the Shoal Creek police academy and patrol station, mapping the Missouri River between St. Louis and Kansas City. Holup has many artworks installed in New York City's transit infrastructure, at sites including an underpass below the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, and elevated subway stations on the 1 line (formerly the IRT) between 125th Street in Upper Manhattan and 242nd Street in the Bronx. = Drawing and painting = Holup collaborated with Ntozake Shange on illustrations for a 1981 poetry chapbook titled Some Men. Her drawing Mississippi Delta is in the collection of the Denver Art Museum. Holup's later-career artworks, shown in a posthumous exhibition at the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art, were large-scale drawings in graphite on vellum, with gold and aluminum leaf. These drawings employ the river and waterway imagery that her public artworks also drew on.

Many of those affected had been born British subjects and had arrived in the UK before 1973, particularly from Caribbean countries as members of the \\"Windrush generation\\" (so named after the Empire Windrush, the ship that brought one of the first groups of West Indian migrants to the UK in 1948). As well as those who were deported, an unknown number were detained, lost their jobs or homes, or were denied benefits or medical care to which they were entitled. A number of long-term UK residents were refused re-entry to the UK, and a larger number were threatened with immediate deportation by the Home Office. Linked by commentators to the \\"hostile environment policy\\" instituted by Theresa May during her time as Home Secretary, the scandal led to the resignation of Amber Rudd as Home Secretary in April 2018, and the appointment of Sajid Javid as her successor. The scandal also prompted a wider debate about British immigration policy and Home Office practice. The March 2020 independent Windrush Lessons Learned Review conducted by the inspector of constabulary concluded that Theresa May's Home Office showed an inexcusable \\"ignorance and thoughtlessness\\", and that what had happened had been \\"foreseeable and avoidable\\". It further found that immigration regulations were tightened \\"with complete disregard for the Windrush generation\\", and that officials had made \\"irrational\\" demands for multiple documents to establish residency rights.  Background HMT Empire Windrush after which the Windrush generation is named. The British Nationality Act 1948 gave citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies status and the right of settlement in the UK to everyone who was at that time a British subject by virtue of having been born in a British colony.National Archives. Citizenship 1906‚Äì2003. Retrieved 6 November 2006 The act and encouragement from British government campaigns in Caribbean countries led to a wave of immigration. Between 1948 and 1970, nearly half a million people moved from the Caribbean to Britain, which in 1948 faced severe labour shortages in the wake of the Second World War. The immigrants were later referred to as \\"the Windrush generation\\". Working age adults and many children travelled from the Caribbean to join parents or grandparents in the UK or travelled with their parents without their own passports. Since these people had a legal right to come to the UK, they neither needed nor were given any documents upon entry to the UK, nor following changes in immigration laws in the early 1970s. Many worked or attended schools in the UK without any official documentary record of their having done so, other than the same records as any UK-born citizen. Many of the countries from which the immigrants had come became independent of the UK after 1948, and people living there became citizens of those countries. Legislative measures in the 60s and early 70s limited the rights of citizens of these former colonies, now members of the Commonwealth, to come to or work in the UK. Anyone who had arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1973 was granted an automatic right permanently to remain, unless they left the UK for more than two years. Since the right was automatic, many people in this category were never given, or asked to provide, documentary evidence of their right to remain at the time or over the next forty years, during which, many continued to live and work in the UK, believing themselves to be British. The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 specifically protected long-standing residents of the UK from Commonwealth countries from enforced removal. This provision was not transferred to 2014 immigration legislation because Commonwealth citizens living in the UK before 1 January 1973 were \\"adequately protected from removal\\", according to a Home Office spokesperson. =Hostile environment policy= Theresa May MP who, as Home Secretary, introduced the hostile environment policy The hostile environment policy, which came into effect in October 2012, comprises administrative and legislative measures to make staying in the United Kingdom as difficult as possible for people without \\"leave to remain\\", in the hope that they may \\"voluntarily leave\\". In 2012, Home Secretary Theresa May stated: \\"The aim is to create, here in Britain, a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\\". The policy was widely seen as being part of a strategy of reducing UK immigration figures to the levels promised in the 2010 Conservative Party Election Manifesto. Measures introduced by the policy include a legal requirement for landlords, employers, the NHS, charities, community interest companies and banks to carry out ID checks and to refuse services if the individual is unable to prove legal residence in the UK. Landlords, employers and others are liable to fines of up to ¬£10,000 if they fail to comply with these measures. The policy led to a more complicated application process to get 'leave to remain' and encouraged voluntary deportation. The policy coincided with sharp increases in Home Office fees for processing \\"leave to remain\\", naturalisation and registration of citizenship applications. The BBC reported that the Home Office had made a profit of more than ¬£800m from nationality services between 2011 and 2017. The term 'hostile environment' had first been used under the Brown Government. On 25 April 2018, in answer to questions in Parliament during the Windrush scandal, then Prime Minister Theresa May said the hostile-environment policy would remain government policy. In June 2020, Britain's human rights watchdog, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) launched a legal action to review the \\"hostile environment\\" immigration policy. It is assessing whether the Home Office complied with its equality duties, and planned to develop recommendations by September 2020. Initial warnings The Home Office received warnings from 2013 onwards that many Windrush generation residents were being treated as illegal immigrants and that older Caribbean born people were being targeted. The Refugee and Migrant Centre in Wolverhampton said their caseworkers were seeing hundreds of people receiving letters from Capita, the Home Office's contractor, telling them that they had no right to be in the UK, some of whom were told to arrange to leave the UK at once. Roughly half the letters went to people who already had leave to remain or were in the process of formalising their immigration status. Caseworkers had warned the Home Office directly and also through local MPs of these cases since 2013. People considered illegal were sometimes losing their jobs or homes as a consequence of having benefits cut off and some had been refused medical care under the National Health Service (NHS), some placed in detention centres as preparation for their deportation, some deported or refused right to return to the UK from abroad. In 2013 Caribbean leaders had put the deportations on the agenda at the Commonwealth meeting in Sri Lanka and in April 2016 Caribbean governments told Philip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, that immigrants who had spent most of their lives in the UK were facing deportation and their concerns were passed on at the time to the Home Office. Shortly before the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April 2018, twelve Caribbean countries made a formal request for a meeting with the British Prime Minister to discuss the issue, which was rejected by Downing Street. =Home Affairs Select Committee report= In January 2018, the Home Affairs Select Committee issued a report which said the hostile environment policies were ‚Äúunclear‚Äù and had seen too many people threatened with deportation based on ‚Äúinaccurate and untested‚Äù information. The report warned that the errors being made, in one instance 10 per cent, threatened to undermine the \\"credibility of the system\\". A major concern voiced in the report was that the Home Office did not have means to evaluate the effectiveness of its hostile environment provisions and commented that there had been a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù to understand the effects of the policy. The report also noted that a shortage of accurate data about the scale of illegal immigration had allowed public anxiety about the issue to ‚Äúgrow unchecked‚Äù, which, the report said, showed government ‚Äúindifference‚Äù towards an issue of ‚Äúhigh public interest‚Äù. A month before the report was published, more than 60 MPs, academics and campaign groups wrote an open letter to Amber Rudd urging the Government to halt the ‚Äúinhumane‚Äù policy, citing the Home Office's ‚Äúpoor track record‚Äù of dealing with complaints and appeals in a timely manner. =Press reports= From November 2017, newspapers reported that the British government had threatened to deport people from Commonwealth territories who had arrived in the UK before 1973, if they could not prove their right to remain in the UK. Although primarily identified as the Windrush generation and mainly from the Caribbean, it was estimated in April 2018 on figures provided by the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford that up to 57,000 Commonwealth migrants could be affected, of whom 15,000 were from Jamaica. In addition to those from the Caribbean, cases of people affected who had been born in Kenya, Cyprus, Canada and Sierra Leone were identified in the press. The press coverage accused Home Office agencies of operating a \\"guilty until proven innocent\\" and \\"deport first, appeal later\\" regime; of targeting the weakest groups, particularly those from the Caribbean; of inhumanely applying regulations by cutting off access to jobs, services and bank accounts while cases were still being investigated; of losing large numbers of original documents which proved right to remain; of making unreasonable demands for documentary proof ‚Äì in some instances, elderly people had been asked for 4 documents for each year they had lived in the UK and of leaving people stranded outside the UK because of British administrative errors or intransigence and denial of medical treatment. Other cases covered in the press, involved adults born in the UK, whose parents were 'Windrush' immigrants and who had been threatened with deportation and had their rights removed, because they were unable to prove that their parents were legally in the UK at the time of their birth. The Home Office and British government were further accused of having known about the negative impacts that the 'hostile environment policy' was having on Windrush immigrants since as early as 2013 and of having done nothing to remedy them. Those highlighting the issue included journalists Amelia Gentleman and Gary Younge, Caribbean diplomats Kevin Isaac, Seth George Ramocan and Guy Hewitt, and British politicians Herman Ouseley and David Lammy MP. Amelia Gentleman of The Guardian was later awarded the 2018 Paul Foot Award for her coverage of what the judges described as: \\"the catastrophic consequences for a group of elderly Commonwealth-born citizens who were told they were illegal immigrants, despite having lived in the UK for around 50 years\\". Parliament In early March 2018, questions began to be asked in Parliament about individual cases that had been highlighted in the press. On 14 March, when Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn asked May about an individual who had been refused medical treatment under the NHS during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, May initially said she was \\"unaware of the case\\", but later agreed to \\"look into it\\". Parliament thereafter continued to be involved in what was increasingly being referred to as \\"the Windrush scandal\\". On 16 April 2018, David Lammy MP challenged Amber Rudd in the House of Commons to give numbers as to how many had lost their jobs or homes, been denied medical care, or been detained or deported wrongly. Lammy called on Rudd to apologise for the threats of deportation and called it a \\"day of national shame\\", blaming the problems on the government's \\"hostile environment policy\\". Rudd replied that she did not know of any, but would attempt to verify that. In late April, Rudd faced increasing calls for her to resign and for the Government to abandon the \\"hostile environment policy\\". There were also calls for the Home Office to reduce fees for immigration services. On 2 May 2018, the opposition Labour Party introduced a motion in the House of Commons seeking to force the government to release documents to the Home Affairs Select Committee concerning its handling of cases involving people who came to the UK from Commonwealth countries between 1948 and the 1970s. The motion was defeated by 316 votes to 221. =Targets= On 25 April, in answer to a question put to her by the Home Affairs Select Committee about deportation targets (i.e. specific numbers to meet), Rudd said she was unaware of such targets, saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how we operate‚Äù, although another witness had discussed deportation targets. The following day, Rudd admitted in Parliament that targets had existed, but characterised them as \\"local targets for internal performance management\\" only, not \\"specific removal targets\\". She also claimed that she had been unaware of them and promised that they would be scrapped. Two days later, The Guardian published a leaked memo that had been copied to Rudd's office. The memo said that the department had set \\"a target of achieving 12,800 enforced returns in 2017‚Äì18\\" and \\"we have exceeded our target of assisted returns\\". The memo added that progress had been made towards \\"the 10% increased performance on enforced returns, which we promised the Home Secretary earlier this year\\". Rudd responded by saying she had never seen the leaked memo, ‚Äúalthough it was copied to my office, as many documents are‚Äù. The New Statesman said that the leaked memo gave, \\"in specific detail the targets set by the Home Office for the number of people to be removed from the United Kingdom. It suggests that Rudd misled MPs on at least one occasion\\". Diane Abbott MP called for Rudd's resignation: \\"Amber Rudd either failed to read this memo and has no clear understanding of the policies in her own department, or she has misled Parliament and the British people.\\"Leaked memo 'suggests Rudd was told of targets' BBC Abbott also said, \\"The danger is that (the) very broad target put pressure on Home Office officials to bundle Jamaican grandmothers into detention centres\\".Kentish, Benjamin (28 April 2018), \\"Amber Rudd summoned back to Parliament for questioning as calls grow for resignation\\", The Independent. On 29 April 2018, The Guardian published a private letter from Rudd to Theresa May dated January 2017 in which Rudd wrote of an \\"ambitious but deliverable\\" target for an increase in the enforced deportation of immigrants. Later that day, Rudd resigned as Home Secretary. =Change of Home Secretary= Amber Rudd On 29 April 2018, Rudd resigned as Home Secretary, saying in her resignation letter that she had \\"inadvertently misled the Home Affairs Select Committee [...] on the issue of illegal immigration\\". Later that day, Sajid Javid was named as her successor. Shortly before, Javid, while still Communities Secretary, had said in a Sunday Telegraph interview \\"I was really concerned when I first started hearing and reading about some of the issues ... My parents came to this country ... just like the Windrush generation ... When I heard about the Windrush issue I thought, 'That could be my mum, it could be my dad, it could be my uncle... it could be me.'\\" On 30 April, Javid made his first appearance before Parliament as Home Secretary. He promised legislation to ensure the rights of those affected and said that the government would \\"do right by the Windrush generation\\". In comments seen by the press as distancing himself from Theresa May, Javid told Parliament that \\"I don‚Äôt like the phrase hostile [...] I think it is a phrase that is unhelpful and it doesn‚Äôt represent our values as a country\\". On 15 May 2018, Javid told the Home Affairs Select Committee that 63 people had thus far been identified as having been possibly wrongly deported, though stating the figure was provisional and could rise. He also said that he had been unable to establish at that point how many Windrush cases had been wrongfully detained.Windrush row: 63 people could have been wrongly removed, says Javid The Guardian By late May 2018, the government had contacted 3 out of the 63 people possibly wrongly deported,Home Office admits it has only contacted three Windrush citizens who could have been wrongfully deported The Independent and on 8 June, Seth George Ramocan, the Jamaican high commissioner in London said he had still not received either the numbers or the names of those people the Home Office believed they had wrongly deported to Jamaica, so that Jamaican records could be checked for contact details. By late June, long delays were being reported in processing \\"leave to remain\\" applications due to the large numbers of people contacting the Home Office. The Windrush hotline had recorded 19,000 calls up to that time, 6,800 of which were identified as potential Windrush cases. Sixteen hundred people had by then been issued documentation after having appointments with the Home Office. =Parliamentary committees= Human Rights committee report On 29 June 2018, the parliamentary Human Rights Select committee published a \\"damning\\" report on the exercise of powers by immigration officials. MPs and peers concluded in the report that there had been \\"systemic failures\\" and rejected the Home Office description of a \\"a series of mistakes\\" as not \\"credible or sufficient\\". The report concluded that the Home Office demonstrated a \\"wholly incorrect approach to case-handling and to depriving people of their liberty\\", and urged the Home Secretary to take action against the \\"human rights violations\\" occurring in his department. The committee had examined the cases of two people who had both twice been detained by the Home Office, whose detentions the report described as \\"simply unlawful\\" and whose treatment was described as \\"shocking\\". The committee sought to examine 60 other cases. Harriet Harman MP and chair of the committee accused immigration officials of being \\"out of control\\", and the Home Office of being a \\"law unto itself\\". Harman commented that \\"protections and safeguards have been whittled away until what we can see now ... [is] that the Home Office is all powerful and human rights have been totally extinguished.\\" Adding that \\"even when they're getting it wrong and even when all the evidence is there on their own files showing that they have no right to lock these people up, they go ahead and do it.\\" Home Affairs Select Committee report On 3 July 2018, the Home Affairs Select Committee (HASC) published a critical report which said that unless the Home Office was overhauled the scandal would \\"happen again, for another group of people‚Äù. The report found that \\"a change in culture in the Home Office over recent years\\" had led to an environment in which applicants had been \\"forced to follow processes that appear designed to set them up to fail‚Äù. The report questioned whether the hostile environment should continue in its current form, commenting that ‚Äúrebranding it as the ‚Äòcompliant‚Äô environment is a meaningless response to genuine concerns‚Äù. (Sajid Javid had previously referred to the policy as the ‚Äòcompliant' environment policy). The report recommended that the Home Office should re-assess all hostile environment policies to evaluate their \\"‚Äúefficacy, fairness, impact (both intended and unintended consequences) and value for money‚Äù, as the policy placed \\"a huge administrative burden and cost on many parts of society, without any clear evidence of its effectiveness, but with numerous examples of mistakes made and significant distress caused\\". The report made a series of recommendations designed to give the \\"Home Office a more human face‚Äù. It also called for \\"passport fees to be abolished for Windrush citizens; for a return to face-to-face immigration interviews; for immigration appeal rights and legal aid to be reinstated; and for the net migration target to be dropped\\". The report commented that they had hoped to uncover the extent of the impact on the Windrush generation, but that the government had \\"not been able to answer many of our questions ‚Ä¶ and we have not had access to internal Home Office papers‚Äù. Commenting that it was \\"unacceptable that the Home Office still cannot tell us the number of people who have been unlawfully detained, were told to report to Home Office centres, who lost their jobs, or were denied medical treatment or other services.‚Äù The report also recommended extending the government compensation scheme to recognise \\"emotional distress as well as financial harm\\" and that the scheme should be open to Windrush children and grandchildren who had been adversely affected. The report reiterated its call for an immediate hardship fund for those in acute financial difficulty. Committee chair Yvette Cooper said the decision to delay hardship payments was \\"very troubling\\" and victims \\"should not have to struggle with debts while they are waiting for the compensation scheme\\". The report also said that Home Office officials should have been aware of, and addressed, the problem much earlier. Cross-party MPs on the committee noted that the Home Office had taken no action during the months in which the issue had been highlighted in the press. The Labour party responded to the report by saying \\"many questions remained unanswered by the Home Office\\". Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said it was a ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù that the government had not yet published \\"a clear plan for compensation\\" for Windrush cases and that it had refused to institute a hardship fund, \\"even for people who have been made homeless or unemployed by their policies‚Äù. Home Office replies In response to questions from Parliamentary select committees, and questions asked in Parliament, the Home Office issued a number of replies during the scandal. On 28 June 2018, a letter to the HASC from the Home Office reported that it had \\"mistakenly detained\\" 850 people in the five years between 2012 and 2017. In the same five-year period, the Home Office had paid compensation of over ¬£21m for wrongful detention. Compensation payments varied between ¬£1 and ¬£120,000; an unknown number of these detentions were Windrush cases. The letter also acknowledged that 23% of staff working within immigration enforcement had received performance bonuses, and that some staff had been set \\"personal objectives\\" \\"linked to targets to achieve enforced removals\\" on which bonus payments were made. Figures released on 5 June by immigration minister Caroline Nokes revealed that in the 12 months prior to March 2018, 991 seats had been booked on commercial flights by the Home Office to remove people to the Caribbean who were suspected of being in the UK illegally. The 991 figure was not necessarily the number of deportations, as some removals may not have happened, and others may have involved multiple tickets for one person's flights. The figures did not say how many of the tickets booked were used for deportations. Nokes also said that in the two-year period from 2015 to 2017, the government had spent ¬£52m on all deportation flights, including ¬£17.7m on charter flights. Costs for the 12 months prior to March 2018 were not available. In November 2018, in a monthly update to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Javid said there were 83 cases in which it had already been confirmed that people had been wrongfully deported, and officials feared there might be a further 81. At least 11 deportees had subsequently died. National Audit Office report In a report published in December 2018, the UK's National Audit Office found that the Home Office \\"failed to protect [the] rights to live, work and access services\\" of the Windrush scandal victims, had ignored warnings of the impending scandal, which had been raised up to four years earlier, and had still not adequately addressed the scandal. Resumption of deportations Public outcry against the deportations caused them to be paused in 2018. However, in February 2019 it emerged that the Home Office intended to resume deportations. The news led to renewed outcries against the Home Office. On 5 February 2019, Javid claimed that all of the people due to be deported were guilty of \\"very serious crimes ... like rape and murder, firearms offences and drug-trafficking\\", but the claim was rebutted by the Home Office and was criticised by commentators as inaccurate and potentially detrimental to the futures of the deportees. On 21 February 2019, the Jamaican High Commissioner to the UK called for a halt to deportations to Jamaica until the Home Office has published its investigation into the Windrush scandal. Redress for victims Amber Rudd, while still Home Secretary, apologised for the \\"appalling\\" treatment of the Windrush generation. On 23 April 2018, Rudd announced that compensation would be given to those affected and, in future, fees and language tests for citizenship applicants would be waived for this group. Theresa May also apologised for the \\"anxiety caused\\" at a meeting with twelve Caribbean leaders, though she was unable to tell them \\"definitively\\" whether anyone had been wrongly deported. May also promised that those affected would no longer need to rely on providing formal documents to prove their history of residency in the UK, nor would they incur costs in getting necessary papers. Sajid Javid On 24 May Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, outlined a series of measures to process citizenship applications for people affected by the scandal. The measures included free citizenship applications for children who joined their parents in the UK when they were under 18 and for children born in the UK of Windrush parents, and free confirmation of right to remain for those entitled to it but currently outside the UK, subject to normal good character requirements. The measures were criticised by MPs, as they provided no right of appeal or review of decisions. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: \\"Given the history of this, how can anyone trust Home Office not to make further mistakes? If the Home Secretary is confident that senior caseworkers will be making good decisions in Windrush cases, he has nothing to fear about appeals and reviews.\\" Javid also said that a Home Office team had identified 500 potential cases thus far. In subsequent weeks, Javid also promised to provide figures on how many people had been wrongly detained and indicated that he did not believe in quantified targets for removals. On 21 May 2018, it was reported that many Windrush victims were still destitute, sleeping rough or on the sofas of friends and relatives while waiting for Home Office action. Many could not afford to travel to Home Office appointments if they got them. David Lammy MP described it as \\"yet another failure in a litany of abject failures that Windrush citizens are being left homeless and hungry on the streets.\\" In late May and early June, there were calls from MPs for a hardship fund to be set up to meet urgent needs.Grierson, Jamie (13 June 2018), \\"Windrush scandal: MPs call for urgent hardship fund for victims\\", The Guardian. By late June, it was reported that the government's two-week deadline for resolving cases has been repeatedly breached, and that many of the most serious cases still had not been addressed. Jamaican High Commissioner Seth George Ramocan said: ‚ÄúThere has been an effort to correct the situation now that it has become so very open and public.‚Äù In August 2018 a compensation plan had still not been implemented. Examples cited included, a man who was still homeless while waiting for a decision; a former NHS nurse, Sharon, who told a caseworker, ‚ÄúI am not allowed to work, I have no benefits. I have a 12-year-old child.‚Äù The caseworker replied, \\"Well I‚Äôm afraid these are the immigration rules,‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ but obviously the Home Office point of view [is] if you don‚Äôt have a legal status in the UK you‚Äôre not entitled to work or study.\\" Satbir Singh of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants stated, \\"It‚Äôs appalling that the Home Office effectively told Sharon to go and beg for food, when there are laws requiring the state to act in the best interests of children, and provide financial support to children facing destitution.\\" Also in August 2018, a caseworker for David Lammy, said: \\"We have referred 25 constituents to the Windrush taskforce in total. Only three have been granted their citizenship so far, and the others are left in a strange limbo ‚Ä¶ We still have some people who have not even got biometric residence permits and we alerted the Home Office to these people months ago.\\"Marsh, Sarah (10 August 2018), \\"Windrush citizens still waiting for cases to be resolved\\", The Guardian. =Hardship scheme= In February 2019, the Home Office admitted that, although it had set up a hardship scheme in December 2018 for victims of the scandal, only one of the applicants to the scheme had thus far received any assistance. Also the compensation scheme promised by the Home Office in April 2018 was still not in place in February 2019. In February 2020, government ministers were told that the number of people wrongly classified as illegal immigrants could be much greater than previously thought and that as many as 15,000 people could be eligible for compensation. Despite this, only 36 people's compensation claims had thus far been settled and only ¬£62,198 has been paid out from a Home Office compensation pot which was expected to distribute between ¬£200m and ¬£570m. By April 2020, the Windrush taskforce, which was set up to deal with applications from people who were wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants, still had 3,720 outstanding cases. 1,111 of these cases had yet to be considered, more than 150 of these had waited for over six months, and 35 had waited for over a year for a response. The Home Office revealed that it had thus far identified 164 people from Caribbean countries who it had wrongly detained or deported. 24 people who had been wrongly deported had died before the UK government had been able to contact them. 14 people who had been wrongly deported to the Caribbean, had thus far not been traced. Officials refused to attempt to trace people who had been wrongly deported to non-Caribbean Commonwealth countries. Up to that date 35 people had been granted ‚Äúurgent and exceptional support‚Äù payments, totalling ¬£46,795. Landing cards The only official records of the arrival of many \\"Windrush\\" immigrants in the 1950s through to the early 1970s were landing cards collected as they disembarked from ships in UK ports. In subsequent decades, these cards were routinely used by British immigration officials to verify dates of arrival for borderline immigration cases. In 2009, those landing cards were earmarked for destruction as part of a broader clean up of paper records. The decision to destroy was taken under the then- Labour government, but implemented in 2010 under the incoming coalition government. Whistleblowers and retired immigration officers claimed that they had warned managers in 2010 of the problems this would cause for some immigrants who had no other record of their arrival. During the scandal, there was discussion as to whether the destruction of the landing cards had negatively impacted Windrush immigrants. Broader immigration The scandal drew attention to other issues relating to UK migration policy and practice, including treatment of other migrants, and of asylum seekers and what the status of EU nationals living in Britain would be after Brexit. Stephen Hale of Refugee Action said, \\"All of the things those [Windrush] people have been through are also experiences that people are going through as result of asylum system\\".Lyons, Kate (17 May 2018), \\"Windrush cases just 'tip of iceberg' of immigration failings, report warns\\", The Guardian. Some skilled workers had been threatened with deportation after living and working in the UK for over a decade because of minor irregularities in their tax returns, some were allowed to stay and fight deportation but prevented from working and denied access to the NHS while doing so. Sometimes the irregularities were due to the tax authorities, not the migrant. In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr on 3 June, Sajid Javid said that key parts of the UK's immigration policy would be reviewed and that changes had already been made to the \\"hostile environment\\" approach to illegal immigration in the wake of the Windrush scandal. Leak inquiry Following complaints by ministers, the Home Office was reported in April 2018 to have set up an inquiry to investigate where the leaked documents that led to Rudd's departure came from. Caribbean reactions *Antigua and Barbuda: Prime Minister Gaston Browne told Sky News' All Out Politics that an apology from the British government over the Windrush issue \\"would be welcome\\". He said it had been a major concern, but that he was pleased the government had stepped in. \\"We have had at least one Antiguan who incidentally has a British passport, who was apparently identified for deportation on the basis that he had no original documents. He came here about 59-years ago as an infant with his parents, and would have been on his parents' passport. Many of these individuals do not have any connection with the country of their birth, would have lived in the UK their entire lives and worked very hard towards the advancement of the UK.\\" *Barbados: High Commissioner the Rev. Guy Hewitt said on 16 April the 'Windrush Kids' who went to schools in Britain and paid their taxes are \\"being treated as illegal immigrants\\" and \\"being shut out of the system\\" with some deported or sent to detention centres. Hewitt also advised people not to approach the Home Office unless they first notified their representative or lawyer, as too many people doing so had been detained. *Grenada: Prime Minister Keith Mitchell said that those affected were owed \\"serious compensation\\". *Jamaica: Prime Minister Andrew Holness said on 18 April: \\"my interest is to ensure that the Windrush generation and the children of the Windrush generation get justice. We have to call it out for what it is, but we also have to ensure that those who have been deported get access to a process that gets them back. They should get access to all the benefits that their citizenship will entitle them to. If there was an acceptance that a wrong was done, then there should be a process of restoration. I‚Äôm certain that the robust civil society and democracy that you have will come up with a process of compensation.\\" *Saint Kitts and Nevis: High Commissioner Kevin Isaac helped coordinate Caribbean high commissioners to speak in a single voice on the Windrush issue from 2014.  Windrush Lessons Learned Review  On 19 March 2020, the Home Office released the Windrush Lessons Learned Review. This study, described by the Home Secretary as \\"long-awaited\\", was an independent inquiry managed and conducted by Wendy Williams, an inspector of constabulary. The report was a scathing indictment of the Home Office's handling of Windrush individuals, and concluded that the Home Office showed an inexcusable \\"ignorance and thoughtlessness\\", and that what had happened had been \\"foreseeable and avoidable\\". It further found that immigration regulations were tightened \\"with complete disregard for the Windrush generation\\", and that officials had made irrational demands for multiple documents to establish residency rights. The study recommended a full review of the \\"hostile environment\\" immigration policy.  Sitting in Limbo  In June 2020, BBC Television screened an 85-minute, one-off drama, Sitting in Limbo, starring Patrick Robinson as Anthony Bryan, a real person who was caught up in the effects of the hostile environment policy.

It is located in the Lisbon civil parish of Estrela, within the grounds of S√£o Bento Palace, the seat of the Portuguese Parliament. History Ant√≥nio Costa receives Paolo Gentiloni, Prime Minister of Italy, in January 2017 =Construction= The house was first built by capitalist Joaquim Machado Cayres in 1877, to serve as his private residence. The plot of land he bought for it had belonged to the adjoining Benedictine Monastery since 1598. =State acquisition= In 1928, the newly-established authoritarian regime expropriated the mansion so that it would become the official residence of the President of the Council of Ministers (then the official title of the Prime Minister). After the necessary fitting-out works, Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar moved to the mansion in May 1938, even though the formal unveiling only took place eleven months later, in April 1939. During the works, a monumental staircase connecting the grounds of the mansion to the Parliament gardens was commissioned to architect Cristino da Silva. When Marcelo Caetano became Prime Minister in 1968, the mansion saw major renovations: little more than the fa√ßades were kept. These works also added a new upper floor to the building, where before there was only an old attic. =Post-1974= Pedro Passos Coelho shakes hands with Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, President of Mexico, in June 2014 After the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974, the mansion and the gardens were slightly modified, but it was only in 1986, when they saw new renovation works, that the official residence gained greater operability and a modern image. The garage was converted into a building to receive foreign visitors. The old tarmac was replaced with intricately patterned Portuguese pavement. In 2007, in order to increase the residence's energy efficiency, it was equipped with a wind turbine, with a production capacity of 3.5 MWh/year, and photovoltaic panels, capable of producing up to 6.7 MWh/year. Starting 5 June 2016, the gardens of S√£o Bento Mansion are open to the public on Sundays, bar those in which visits would collide with the Prime Minister's official schedule. These visits were a result of a protocol between the Presidency of the Council of Ministers and the Lisbon City Council. Starting on 5 October 2017, the year-long exhibition \\"Arte em S√£o Bento\\" (Art in S√£o Bento), also visitable on Sundays, saw the mostly academic art collection in the residence (on loan from several museums in the country) be replaced with works from the Serralves Contemporary Art Museum. The intention is to change the art collections there every year, on 5 October (the anniversary of the Proclamation of the Portuguese Republic). The contemporary art collections on display during a meeting between Ant√≥nio Costa and Pedro S√°nchez, Prime Minister of Spain, in July 2020 Even though it has been the official residence of the Portuguese Prime Minister since 1938, very few Prime Ministers have since opted to actually live there during their respective terms in office. Those who have were Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar (Prime Minister from 1933 to 1968; resided from 1938 to 1970), Vasco Gon√ßalves (Prime Minister from 1974 to 1975), Jos√© Pinheiro de Azevedo (Prime Minister from 1975 to 1976), Carlos Mota Pinto (Prime Minister from 1978 to 1979), An√≠bal Cavaco Silva (Prime Minister from 1985 to 1995), and Pedro Santana Lopes (Prime Minister from 2004 to 2005). In 2018, it was announced that several reports (including one from the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering) identified safety issues on S√£o Bento Mansion; from April to October of that year, the gardens were closed and the residence was renovated with new heating, ventilation and air conditioning, electrical wiring and fire protection systems. In the meantime, the Office of the Prime Minister was temporarily moved to the old premises of the Ministry of the Sea, in Commerce Square.

He served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War and was one of the Virginia Military Institute cadets who fought at the Battle of New Market. Woodbridge was the great grandson of the preacher John Edwards and a prominent citizen of Chester, Pennsylvania. He was married to Louise Deshong, the daughter of the wealthy Chester businessman John O. Deshong. Early life, education, and military career Woodbridge was born in Richmond, Virginia, to Reverend George and Rebecca (Nicolson) Woodbridge. In 1861, Woodbridge entered the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington, Virginia, following in the footsteps of his grandfather, a Brigadier general in the Virginia Militia, and his father, Reverend George Woodbridge, who graduated from West Point. In 1864, Woodbridge had risen to the rank of Sergeant major, the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer in the corps. In May 1864, Woodbridge was among the cadets who served in the Battle of New Market, commanded by General John C. Breckinridge to repel the advance of General Franz Sigel in the Shenandoah Valley. After the battle of New Market, Woodbridge was promoted to Adjutant of the Corps of cadets. In April 1865, Woodbridge was among a group of VMI cadets called to Richmond to man trenches left open by General Robert E. Lee's retreating forces. In July 1865, Woodbridge returned to VMI and graduated 10th in his class. Shipbuilding career After graduation, Woodbridge moved to Chester, Pennsylvania, where he worked in the drafting department of Reaney, Son & Archbold shipbuilding and continued in the department when it was purchased by the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding and Engine Works owned by John Roach. Woodbridge eventually became the Superintending Engineer at the Roach shipyard. In 1885, Woodbridge entered the U.S. government service and was employed at the Crane shipbuilding firm in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, building ships for the Merchant Marines and U.S. Navy. He was employed for forty years as a naval architect and mechanical engineer. Manor House The Manor House on the campus of Widener University The Manor House was designed and built by Woodbridge in 1888 at 14th and Potter Street in Chester, Pennsylvania. It was a wedding gift to his wife Louise Deshong and was originally named \\"The Louise\\". It was modeled after the late 19th-century English country manor style and is unique for its hand made brick construction. The house was given to the city of Chester as a home for young women. In 1976, Widener University purchased the home for use as a student residence. It later became home to the Phi Sigma Sigma sorority. The home is currently used by Widener University as a student dormitory.

She is the daughter of painter Zehra Say and the aunt of pianist Fazƒ±l Say. Life Emel Say was born in 1927. Her grandfather was a politician, who left the Committee of Union and Progress and opened a dance hall. Her mother Zehra Say was the first woman in modern Turkey to be married at an official wedding. Emel's mind was always on music. When she was fifteen, she received singing classes from Professor Carl Ebert, who had established the Ankara Conservatory. At first, Emel Say wanted to be an opera artist, but she changed her mind when she fell in love with a piece of land in Hatay, southern Turkey. She had to put her interest in music on hold when she married. Her husband Fuat Say, unlike the tolerance that Fuat Say had shown her mother Zehra, did not send Emel to school, nor was this really possible in Hatay at the time. Raising her three sons was the only thing she did until she divorced her husband when she was 30 years old. After her divorce, her interest in music did not come to fruition; her mother got sick, so she had to focus on getting a job and income. She started her work life as the secretary of Fuat Bezmen. She worked for him for around ten years. She worked in the United States for about five years. When her mother, the famous painter Zehra Say, went into the later stages of Alzheimers, she was no longer able to continue painting. Zehra made her daughter Emel promise to finish her painting Maui Adasƒ± (Island of Maui), which she had started to paint from a postcard Emel had brought back from a trip to Hawaii. She did not know how she could paint. At first, she cried but then she tried to paint and from that point on did not stop. She completed her mother's painting and it was displayed at an exhibition at the √ái√ßek Bar. There she was discovered by the sculptor G√ºrdal Duyar who at first asked what had happened to Maui Adasƒ±, and then when Emel told him that her mother had insisted she finish it, she tried at it. Duyar expressed to her that she was a natural talent and had been a painter within all along. If it was not for this reassuring encounter she may not have gone into painting at all in her life. She started painting after the age of 60. Together with Duyar, who became a close friend of hers and other friends and family, she would often work on paintings and listen to music together late into the night. One of these nights, Duyar made a portrait for one of Fazƒ±l's musician friends starting at midnight and finishing towards the morning as recalled by this friend of Fazƒ±l's. Art She was a student in the studio of the painter Osman √ñzal. She, together with the other (former) students, would meet on Wednesdays at the ƒ∞zmir Art and Sculpture Museum, and work in the studio there. They became known as the \\"Group Wednesday\\", and held collaborative exhibitions. She and Duyar had exhibitions at the CEP Gallery in the time period between 1977 and 1990. In 1995, her work, along with the work of G√ºrdal Duyar, was exhibited in the grand opening exhibition of the Asmalƒ±mescit Art Gallery. =Technique= She made many miniatures. One of the techniques she often used was using two different types of paint in the same painting, acrylic and gouache.

Friends and Family She is proud of how her mother, Zehra Say, even after her marriage, went to school and became an art teacher, which was quite an accomplishment at that time. She is also proud of her father Fuat Say for supporting his wife, her mother. Although she herself ended up not going into music despite her strong interest in it, her uncle's grandson, Fazƒ±l Say, did make a career of his musical talent. When talking about him, she said that he is \\"A Genuis!\\", \\"When he was just four years old, his mother had bought a small organ, like a toy... Fazƒ±l started to play the songs on the radio with this organ. How many times could a composer the likes of him come to this Earth!\\" She became friends with the poet and writer G√ºls√ºm Cengiz around after her time in the United States. He was visiting her and Zehra at their home and they continued in conversation late into the night, and they learned about the 1960 military coup towards the morning after someone was banging on the door and they turned on the radio. She was also close friends with G√ºrdal Duyar, and they had exhibitions together.

Release This film was released on 1 June 2018 in India. Critical reception The film received mixed reviews from critics; while some commentators praised the humour. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 1 stars out of 5; she wrote that For lack of a better descriptor, Phamous can be said to be about men and moustaches. The kind of men who lord over the arid hillocks of the Chambal, who shower more affection on their ‚Äòmooch‚Äô than their ‚Äòmashooka‚Äô.

The character is based on the DC Comics character of the same name, created by Alan Moore, Stephen R. Bissette, Rick Veitch and John Totleben and was adapted for television in 2014 by Daniel Cerone, and David S. Goyer. Constantine has been continually portrayed by Matt Ryan. Constantine was originally separate from the Arrowverse franchise; however following the show's cancellation, Constantine appeared on the fourth season of The CW's Arrow, retroactively establishing Constantine as part of the Arrowverse. Constantine would later appear as a recurring character during the third season of Legends of Tomorrow, before being upgraded to a main cast member in its fourth.  Fictional character biography  = Constantine = Constantine journeys across America alongside his friend Chas Chandler and a young woman named Zed Martin who is being hunted down by a demon. Along the way, he solves supernatural mysteries, vanquishes demons, and clashes with officious angels sent to watch over him while protecting the world from the \\"Rising Darkness\\". He is also haunted by the memory of Astra Logue, a young girl he condemned to hell with a botched exorcism. = Arrow = Constantine first appears on the Arrowverse on Arrow in the show's fourth season. In flashbacks, Oliver Queen meets Constantine during his fourth year away from Star City when he assists Constantine in retrieving a magical artifact from Lian Yu. In the present, Constantine assists Oliver in performing a 'reverse exorcism' to restore the soul of the recently-resurrected Sara Lance. Later, Oliver mentions that Constantine has gone to Hell; after returning, John puts Oliver in touch with Esrin Fortuna. = Legends of Tomorrow = Constantine returns in the third season of Legends of Tomorrow, when he offers the team advice on dealing with the supernatural as they hunt the demon Mallus, whose other-dimensional prison has been weakened after the Legends were forced to interfere in their own history to stop the Legion of Doom. After the Legends defeat Mallus by deliberately breaking his prison open so that they can confront him directly, Constantine reveals that their actions have unleashed a wave of exorcised demons and other supernatural monsters. In the fourth season, he joins the team as their magical expert as they hunt the new monsters across history, but it is revealed that he is on the run from a supernatural creature hunting him as a consequence of his past actions. During a visit to 1970s London, Constantine visits his parents' pub and attempts to prevent his own birth to save his mother's life, but the timeline automatically prevents him doing so. Constantine attempts to use time travel to change history to save the life of Desmond, a former lover who sacrificed himself to save Constantine from the demon Neron, but when this creates increasingly twisted timelines, Constantine accepts the need to restore the original timeline and comes clean to the rest of the team about his issue with Neron. Constantine eventually manages to save Desmond by luring Neron out of his body. However, when Neron takes control of his Legends teammate Ray Palmer, Constantine enters hell in order to save him. In hell, Constantine meets Astra, who has grown up and refuses to be saved by him. After recovering Ray's soul, Constantine tricks Neron into breaking his own word (Neron had promised that he would not hurt Ray's friend Nate Heywood and Nate fought Neron while in disguise), forcing the demon out of Ray's body, before finally killing him. = Crossovers = During the crossover event \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", Constantine assists Sara, Barry Allen, and Mia Smoak resurrect a deceased Oliver using a Lazarus Pit on Earth-18 in North Dakota during the time of the Old West. It is revealed that he has multiversal knowledge. However, the presence of the antimatter wave causes the pillars of sorcery to tumble, weakening him and preventing him from restoring Oliver's soul, as he did with Sara's. As a last resort, he takes Mia and John Diggle to Earth-666 where Lucifer Morningstar helps them get into Purgatory to save Oliver's soul. There, Constantine encounters the Earth-666 doppelganger of Jim Corrigan, who transfers the powers of the Spectre to Oliver for him to use to save the Multiverse. As a result, the trio return to Earth-1 in failure and Constantine and the other heroes are killed by a wave of antimatter while the Paragons are sent to the Vanishing Point to regroup and prepare for their battle against the Anti-Monitor.  Creation and development  = Constantine = A TV adaptation starring John Constantine was first announced on September 26, 2013. The series would be developed by Daniel Cerone and David S. Goyer, and air on NBC. Welsh actor Matt Ryan was cast as Constantine on February 21, 2014. According to Goyer, Constantine's portrayal on the show would stick closer to the source material than the 2005 feature film did, which included portraying the character as blonde and British. According to pilot episode director Neil Marshall, Constantine would not be allowed to smoke on the show due to network restrictions, though the character was shown to smoke on the show itself. A decision not to explore Constantine's bisexuality in the show caused some consternation with fans, although the character continued to be portrayed as bisexual in the comics. Despite a positive reaction from fans, poor ratings led to the show being cancelled after thirteen episodes. = Arrowverse = In August 2015, it was announced that Ryan would appear as Constantine on Arrow in the fourth season episode \\"Haunted\\", per a \\"one-time-only\\" deal.\\" Season four co-showrunner Wendy Mericle confirmed that this version of Constantine would be the same character that had appeared in the NBC series. Ryan's involvement on Legends of Tomorrow was first announced on October 9, 2017, to appear in a two-part arc during the show's third season; specifically, episodes 9 and 10. According to executive producer Phil Klemmer, having Ryan reprise his \\"iconic [and] legendary role\\" is something that he and Marc Guggenheim had been working toward since the show's first season. Regarding Constantine's inclusion on the show, Klemmer stated that \\"an alienated, chain-smoking, bisexual, world-weary demonologist would feel right at home among our Legends\\". Ryan was promoted to series regular for the fourth season of Legends of Tomorrow. Ryan spoke to the relationship between the character seen in the NBC series and the one seen on Legends of Tomorrow and in the Arrowverse. He said the two were the same character with \\"the same DNA\\", and likened each appearance to that of different comic book writers and artists working with the character: \\"He has the same outline, but he looks different. The hair is slightly different. He has a slightly different cadence sometimes. Different artists and different writers write him in different ways.\\" Ryan also noted that while the fourth season of Legends of Tomorrow mentions the Astra storyline from the NBC series, it would not explore the Brujeria storyline, though Constantine \\"still carries that baggage around with him\\".

Modes of operation include machine learning, data reconciliation, real-time optimization, dynamic simulation, and nonlinear model predictive control. In addition, the package solves Linear programming (LP), Quadratic programming (QP), Quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), Nonlinear programming (NLP), Mixed integer programming (MIP), and Mixed integer linear programming (MILP). GEKKO is available in Python and installed with pip from PyPI of the Python Software Foundation. pip install gekko GEKKO works on all platforms and with Python 2.7 and 3+. By default, the problem is sent to a public server where the solution is computed and returned to Python. There are Windows, MacOS, Linux, and ARM (Raspberry Pi) processor options to solve without an Internet connection. GEKKO is an extension of the APMonitor Optimization Suite but has integrated the modeling and solution visualization directly within Python. A mathematical model is expressed in terms of variables and equations such as the Hock & Schittkowski Benchmark Problem #71W. Hock and K. Schittkowski, Test Examples for Nonlinear Programming Codes, Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems, Vol. 187, Springer 1981. used to test the performance of nonlinear programming solvers. This particular optimization problem has an objective function \\\\min_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R}\\\\; x_1 x_4 (x_1+x_2+x_3)+x_3 and subject to the inequality constraint x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 \\\\ge 25 and equality constraint {x_1}^2 + {x_2}^2 + {x_3}^2 + {x_4}^2=40. The four variables must be between a lower bound of 1 and an upper bound of 5. The initial guess values are x_1 = 1, x_2=5, x_3=5, x_4=1. This optimization problem is solved with GEKKO as shown below. from gekko import GEKKO m = GEKKO() # Initialize gekko # Initialize variables x1 = m.Var(value=1, lb=1, ub=5) x2 = m.Var(value=5, lb=1, ub=5) x3 = m.Var(value=5, lb=1, ub=5) x4 = m.Var(value=1, lb=1, ub=5) # Equations m.Equation(x1 * x2 * x3 * x4 >= 25) m.Equation(x1  2 + x2  2 + x3  2 + x4  2  40) m.Obj(x1 * x4 * (x1 + x2 + x3) + x3) # Objective m.solve(disp=False) # Solve print(\\"x1: \\" + str(x1.value)) print(\\"x2: \\" + str(x2.value)) print(\\"x3: \\" + str(x3.value)) print(\\"x4: \\" + str(x4.value)) print(\\"Objective: \\" + str(m.options.objfcnval)) Applications of GEKKO Applications include cogeneration (power and heat), drilling automation, severe slugging control, solar thermal energy production, solid oxide fuel cells, flow assurance , Enhanced oil recovery , Essential oil extraction, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). There are many other references to APMonitor and GEKKO as a sample of the types of applications that can be solved. GEKKO is developed from the National Science Foundation (NSF) research grant #1547110 and is detailed in a Special Issue collection on combined scheduling and control. Other notable mentions of GEKKO are the listing in the Decision Tree for Optimization Software, added support for APOPT and BPOPT solvers, projects reports of the online Dynamic Optimization course from international participants. GEKKO is a topic in online forums where users are solving optimization and optimal control problems. GEKKO is used for advanced control in the Temperature Control Lab (TCLab) for process control education at 20 universities. = Machine Learning = Artificial Neural Network One application of machine learning is to perform regression from training data to build a correlation. In this example, deep learning generates a model from training data that is generated with the function 1-\\\\cos(x). An artificial neural network with three layers is used for this example. The first layer is linear, the second layer has a hyperbolic tangent activation function, and the third layer is linear. The program produces parameter weights that minimize the sum of squared errors between the measured data points and the neural network predictions at those points. GEKKO uses gradient-based optimizers to determine the optimal weight values instead of standard methods such as backpropagation. The gradients are determined by automatic differentiation, similar to other popular packages. The problem is solved as a constrained optimization problem and is converged when the solver satisfies Karush‚ÄìKuhn‚ÄìTucker conditions. Using a gradient- based optimizer allows additional constraints that may be imposed with domain knowledge of the data or system. from gekko import brain import numpy as np b = brain.Brain() b.input_layer(1) b.layer(linear=3) b.layer(tanh=3) b.layer(linear=3) b.output_layer(1) x = np.linspace(-np.pi, 3 * np.pi, 20) y = 1 - np.cos(x) b.learn(x, y) The neural network model is tested across the range of training data as well as for extrapolation to demonstrate poor predictions outside of the training data. Predictions outside the training data set are improved with hybrid machine learning that uses fundamental principles (if available) to impose a structure that is valid over a wider range of conditions. In the example above, the hyperbolic tangent activation function (hidden layer 2) could be replaced with a sine or cosine function to improve extrapolation. The final part of the script displays the neural network model, the original function, and the sampled data points used for fitting. xp = np.linspace(-2 * np.pi, 4 * np.pi, 100) yp = b.think(xp) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.figure() plt.plot(x, y, \\"bo\\") plt.plot(xp, yp[0], \\"r-\\") plt.show() = Optimal Control = Optimal control problem benchmark (Luus) with an integral objective, inequality, and differential constraint. Optimal control is the use of mathematical optimization to obtain a policy that is constrained by differential \\\\left(\\\\frac{d\\\\,x_1}{d\\\\,t}=u\\\\right), equality \\\\left(x_1(0) = 1\\\\right), or inequality \\\\left(-1 \\\\le u(t) \\\\le 1\\\\right) equations and minimizes an objective/reward function \\\\left(\\\\min_u \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int_0^2 x_1^2(t) \\\\, dt\\\\right). The basic optimal control is solved with GEKKO by integrating the objective and transcribing the differential equation into algebraic form with orthogonal collocation on finite elements. from gekko import GEKKO import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt m = GEKKO() # initialize gekko nt = 101 m.time = np.linspace(0, 2, nt) # Variables x1 = m.Var(value=1) x2 = m.Var(value=0) u = m.Var(value=0, lb=-1, ub=1) p = np.zeros(nt) # mark final time point p[-1] = 1.0 final = m.Param(value=p) # Equations m.Equation(x1.dt()  u) m.Equation(x2.dt()  0.5 * x1  2) m.Obj(x2 * final) # Objective function m.options.IMODE = 6 # optimal control mode m.solve() # solve plt.figure(1) # plot results plt.plot(m.time, x1.value, \\"k-\\", label=r\\"$x_1$\\") plt.plot(m.time, x2.value, \\"b-\\", label=r\\"$x_2$\\") plt.plot(m.time, u.value, \\"r\\", label=r\\"$u$\\") plt.legend(loc=\\"best\\") plt.xlabel(\\"Time\\") plt.ylabel(\\"Value\\") plt.show()  See also  * APMonitor and Python.

She was the first woman to be appointed Assistant Keeper in the Department of Coins and Medals and is regarded as a pioneer in what had previously been a male-dominated field. Her 70th birthday was celebrated with the publication of a book of essays authored by 30 of her colleagues, collaborators and former students for whom Marion's name was \\"synonymous ... with the study of Anglo-Saxon coins at the British Museum\\". Biography Marion Archibald was born in 1935. She started her numismatic career at the Birmingham City Museum in 1958. She joined the Department of Coins and Medals at the British Museum in 1963, and was appointed Assistant Keeper in 1965; she retired from her post in 1997. Beyond the immediate study of Anglo-Saxon coins and monetary systems, her interests extended to dies, coin weights, trial pieces and lead strikings, and coin jewellery. She worked to advance the scientific analysis of coins, and as a member of the Royal Numismatic Society's scientific committee organised a conference on, and co-wrote a text, on the application of metallurgy in numismatics. Her responsibilities at the museum extended to fielding treasure trove finds, whether coin hoards, excavation coins or single-finds; these gave her ample subject-matter for a prodigious output of articles, notes and reports. She was a pioneer in the systematic recording of finds, as well as the application of an understanding of coin circulation histories on the dating of excavations; more generally, she worked to integrate numismatic and monetary system studies with archaeology and historical research, to the benefit of all these disciplines. She was reputed a superb lecturer. Throughout her career Archibald worked as an officer and council member of the Royal Numismatic Society and the British Numismatic Society, both electing her Honorary Fellow, the former in 1996. She was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1974. She held the post of president of the British Association of Numismatic Societies from 1986 to 1991; each year it sponsors a Marion Archibald Memorial Lecture at its annual conference. Her work was widely recognised, and she was awarded the Sanford Saltus Gold Medal of the British Numismatic Society in 1980, the Jeton de Vermeil of the French Numismatic Society in 1988, and the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 2011. She continued to write after retiring from the British Museum. Archibald was the secretary of the Royal Numismatic Society Scientific Research Committee from its inception in 1976 until 1997. During this time three volumes of Metallurgy in Numismatics were published by the Society (MIN 1 in 1980, MIN 2 in 1988, MIN 3 in 1993), Archibald co-editing the third volume with MR Cowell. The fourth volume (MIN 4 1998) included a dedication to Archibald highlighting her work as secretary, her editorship of MIN 3, and her work in organising the symposia which formed the basis for the MIN series. Archibald's 70th birthday year was celebrated with the publication of a book of essays, Coinage and History in the North Sea World, c. AD 500-1250 integrating an understanding of numismatics, monetary studies, archaeology and history, with papers from 30 of her colleagues, collaborators and former students. She died ten years later on 23 April 2016. Publications and exhibitions Marion Archibald, with co-authors, published three books; some 21 long articles and book chapters, and very many short articles, notes, and archaeological reports. She also contributed to the organisation and production of catalogues for five exhibitions. =Books=  * =Exhibitions= *The Vikings (1980) *English Romanesque Art 1066-1200 (1984) *The Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Art 966-1066 (1984) *The Making of England (1991) *Heirs of Rome: the shaping of Britain AD 400-900 (1997) References Category:1935 births Category:2016 deaths Category:British curators Category:British numismatists Category:Employees of the British Museum Category:Women curators Category:Women numismatists ","title":"Marion Archibald"},{"id":"57257089","text":"1992 London bombing may refer to: *Baltic Exchange bombing *1992 London Bridge bombing *Sussex Arms bombing *1992 Staples Corner bombing *December 1992 Wood Green bombing *December 1992 West End bombs ","title":"1992 London bombing"},{"id":"57257091","text":"The Baltic Exchange bombing was an attack by the Provisional IRA on the City of London, Britain's financial centre, on 10 April 1992, the day after the General Election which re-elected John Major from the Conservative Party as Prime Minister. The one-ton bomb ‚Äì concealed in a large white truck and consisting of a fertilizer device wrapped with a detonation cord made from 100 lb of semtex ‚Äì was the biggest bomb detonated on mainland Britain since World War II. The bombing killed three people, injured 91 others, and severely damaged the Baltic Exchange building and its surroundings. Background Since the Provisional Irish Republican Army's campaign in the early 1970s, many commercial targets were attacked on the mainland which would cause economic damage and severe disruption. Since 1988, Gerry Adams of Sinn F√©in and John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party had been engaged in private dialogue to create a broad Irish nationalist coalition. British Prime Minister John Major had refused to openly enter into talks with Sinn F√©in until the IRA declared a ceasefire. The risk of an IRA attack on the City of London had increased due to the lack of progress with political talks, resulting in a warning being circulated to all police forces in Britain highlighting intelligence reports of a possible attack, as it was felt the IRA had enough personnel, equipment and funds to launch a sustained campaign in England. Major won the General Election on 9 April 1992. The next day, the bombing occurred. Bombing Stained glass windows from the old Baltic Exchange building, damaged in the bombing ‚Äì now in the National Maritime Museum On 10 April 1992 at 9:20 pm, a huge bomb was detonated in front of the Baltic Exchange building at 24‚Äì28 St Mary Axe. The fa√ßade of the offices was partially destroyed, and the rest of the building was extensively damaged. The bomb also caused heavy damage to surrounding buildings. It caused ¬£800 million worth of damage (the equivalent of ¬£ million in ), ¬£200 million more than the total damage caused by the 10,000 explosions that had occurred during the Troubles in Northern Ireland up to that point. The IRA gave a telephone warning twenty minutes before the explosion, saying there was a bomb inside a van outside the Stock Exchange. This is half a mile away from the actual location by the Baltic Exchange. The homemade explosive was inside a white Ford Transit van parked in St Mary Axe. The components were developed in South Armagh, shipped from Ireland, and assembled in England. The attack was planned for months and marked an advance to the British of the IRA's explosives manufacture. The bomb was described as the most powerful to hit London since the Luftwaffe raids of World War II. A few hours later another similarly large bomb went off in Staples Corner in north London, also causing major damage. =Victims= The bomb attack killed three people: Paul Butt, aged 29, who was passing in the street; Thomas Casey, 49, a Baltic Exchange attendant; and 15-year-old Danielle Carter, who was waiting in a car in St Mary Axe. Another 91 people were injured. Aftermath The next day, the IRA claimed responsibility in a statement from Dublin. It is believed the IRA were trying to send a message to the Conservative Party who won the election, which also saw Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams lose his unused seat in the Westminster Parliament. On 14 July 1992 anti-terrorist detectives believed they might have identified the bombers. Many of the damaged buildings were once again badly damaged by the Bishopsgate bombing the following year ‚Äì both incidents contributed to the formation of the 'Ring of Steel' in the City to protect it from further terrorism. The Exchange sold its badly damaged historic building to be redeveloped under the auspices of English Heritage as a Grade II* site. However, the City and English Heritage later allowed it to be demolished, seeking instead a new landmark tall building. The site, together with that of the Chamber of Shipping at 30‚Äì32 St Mary Axe, is now home to the skyscraper commissioned by Swiss Re commonly referred to as The Gherkin. The stained glass of the Baltic Exchange war memorial, which had suffered damage in the bomb blast, has been restored and is housed in the National Maritime Museum.

What they have called as Jazz Fusion Criollo (chilean creole jazz fusion). It started in the year 1992 from the definitive extinction of Cometa, a jazz band that had as members three of the current members of this band; Andr√©s Pollak, Pablo Lecaros and Pedro Greene. They were joined by guitarists Jorge D√≠az and Mauricio Rodr√≠guez. Its existence has been one of the most valuable proposals in the history of chilean jazz, since it proposes the encounter between jazz improvisation and the concept of music with folkloric roots.  History  While they remained in Cometa, Pablo Lecaros and Pedro Greene had worked with the singer Isabel Parra on one of their first national tours, once their ban on entering the country had been lifted. This event was decisive, since it connected both jazz players with the Chilean root song. From then on, both soloists were immersed in a research work of these two musical branches that showed no greater kinship. La Marraqueta was started as a music workshop in 1992 and in 1994 it entered the programs of the Jazz Club with its portfolio of original creations framed within what was called \\"Creole fusion\\". Pedro Greene had come to work with the guitarist Edgardo Riquelme in an electric intervention of the song Gracias a la vida by Violeta Parra, while Pablo Lecaros had directed the Macondo group, with which recorded his Tonada para la pachamama. This melody was soon to become one of the maximum pieces of the new fusion ensemble. La Marraqueta recorded her debut album (La Marraqueta, 1995) as a trio, using the same structure as a basic jazz rhythm section (piano- contrabass-drums), although this time electrified (keyboards-bass-percussions ). This marked his staging and the sound profile that would characterize it for years. Consequently, La Marraqueta was strongly framed in the music developed by the plugged jazz models of Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and especially by the ensemble Weather Report. From that point of view, the step the band took to record their second album was key. In 1997 he joined Mauricio Rodr√≠guez (leader of Almendra Tr√≠o , band that also featured Pablo Lecaros on bass), who recorded the guitar parts of the new plaque. Soon he was replaced by Jorge D√≠az, his most stable man in the six strings. The Marraqueta began thereafter a series of extensive presentations at festivals in Mexico, Argentina, Peru and Venezuela, and simultaneously edited Sayhueque 2000. It was a work that generated an intense musical search and consolidated that definitive sound miscegenation that is so typical of the group. Elements rescued from root music, rhythms and ancestral sounds of the Mapuche people, peasant tunes and Huaynos from the Andes were incorporated. The third album, La Marraqueta III 2005, which had an enormous composition work led by Pollak, changed guitarists again, Diaz came out and Rodr√≠guez re-entered. He also had the participation of the emerging voice of Paz Court and also recovered an old piece from Cometa, precisely the one that gave the project its name when it was still an experimental workshop, El Cometa. The Marraqueta inscribed its name in the newest pages of the history of national jazz. Currently, they enjoy wide recognition from the national public and a growing participation in festivals and international concerts. The quartet is defined from an original and unpublished base, expressed in a Creole fusion that emphasizes musical elements investigated and rescued by the same members of the band from the roots of national folklore. From there they search for a universal sound that, however, is also influenced by ethnic melodies, Afro-Latin music, rock, jazz and European contemporary music. In 2010 they toured to the United States to the San Jose Jazz Festival, where they played with musicians such as George Clinton, Maceo Parker and Tower of Power. In January 2017 they participate in the International Providence Jazz Festival in Santiago, alongside with Matt Wilson Quintet and Dave Liebman, where they also announce the beginning of the production of the more than once postponed fourth album.

It has two or three dull bluish green leaves near its base and up to twelve pale green, insect-like flowers with shiny yellowish glands on its labellum. Description Arthrochilus corinnae is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber which produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. Non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves, which in flowering plants are on a short side stem. There are two or three dull bluish green leaves, each leaf long and wide. Between three and twelve insect-like flowers long are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is linear to egg- shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, about wide and folded lengthwise near the tip. The lateral sepals are oblong, curved, long and about wide. The petals are linear and curved, long and about wide. The petals and lateral sepals turn backwards against the ovary. The labellum is about long and about with a dark purple base. The callus is insect-like, about long with its central part crowded with many shiny, yellowish red hair-like glands and the tip is about wide with shiny black glands. Flowering occurs from November to February. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus corinnae was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones from a specimen collected on Cape York. The description was published in The Orchadian. Distribution and habitat The swamp elbow orchid grows in low-lying swampy areas with Melaleuca and Pandanus species on the Cape York Peninsula. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. corinnae is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

She was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 8 April 1942 for killing herself to avoid being captured and interrogated by the Germans after running out of ammunition.  Early life  Petrova was born on 14 March 1915 in Streshevo, Petrograd to a Russian peasant family. After finishing trade school she worked as a seamstress and later at a hostel. Until the Soviet Union in mid 1941 she worked at the Komsomol as an accountant. She was known to her colleagues as a serious person who recorded the minutes of the meetings and rarely said much. World War II Immediately after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June she entered nursing courses. After completing the courses she requested to be assigned to a battalion as a nurse. The battalion she was assigned to often carried out sabotage of roads and attacked Axis army formations from the rear, well within enemy controlled territory. On her first mission they were assigned to pinpoint the location of enemy forces approaching Luga and then attack. After begging her commander to let her participate in the ambush, where they hid in bushes near a road while waiting for a car with German soldiers to approach. When the car approached, several members of the regiment attacked, and Petrova threw a grenade in front of the car so the riflemen could fire on the occupants. After returning from that mission in August she was reassigned to the 2nd Partisan Detachment under the command of Ivan and Stanislav Poleyko, who were brothers; the unit consisted of just twenty-seven people. In a group with seven other partisan detachments they planted landmines in a field and severed telephone and telegraph lines. From August to the beginning of October the detachment laid down mines on the Tolmachevo - Osmino and Luga - Lyady roads, damaged the Tolmachevo-Mshinskaya railroad tracks, and shot down four aircraft. Later in October they destroyed six bridges, including one on the vital Leningrad- Vitebsk railroad. Petrova participated in nearly all of the detachment's military operations and went on several reconnaissance missions. On one mission after learning of the arrival of an anti-partisan squadron she informed the rest of her detachment to be prepared, resulting in the survival of all members of the detachment that day. In late October the detachment was deployed to Mshinskaya station but the Axis found out about their deployment. On 4 November eleven of the partisans that were stationed at their camp were approached by a large detachment of Axis troops. Heavily outnumbered, most of the partisans were killed while fleeing the area, but Petrova picked up a machine gun and began firing on the enemy combatants until she was low on ammunition. After she ran out of ammunition several Axis soldiers rushed at her, but she shot herself to avoid capture. For doing so she was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 8 April 1942 by decree of the Supreme Soviet. A memorial was constructed where the partisans were killed. Petrova was honored with various memorials as well as a street, young pioneer squad, and secondary school renamed in her honor.

The flats were built in 1967 to a height of , and has 21 floors in total. The building consists of 130 flats and has stood empty since 2005, with plans announced in 2018 for its refurbishment. History Construction of the building began in 1966 and were completed a year later following slum clearance in the area. Like many residential high rise buildings during the 1960s, Burrows Court was seen as 'the future of housing' and was seen as a modern and efficient building in comparison to the slums during the United Kingdom's industrial age. 27 years after the residential building was built, the tower went under a major refurbishment from 1994 to 1995. The exterior of the building was painted white, as well as window replacements and concrete repairments, and is now the current appearance of the building exterior. Despite the refurbishment, nearly half of the flats in the building were vacant, and Nottingham City Council facing a bill of ¬£4 million from refurbishments to the building. Crime, drug dealing and anti-social behaviour was being reported in the tower and the surrounding area. The residential building was sold in 2005 to a private developer, and the remaining tenants of the block of flats were re-housed by the Nottingham City Council. Since 2005, the building has stood empty and is commonly seen as a notorious eyesore known for its broken windows and crime rate. Crime Crime has become a major issue in the tower and the surrounding area, before and after the building was sold and left vacant. Before the building was sold, the council was reporting offenses including drug dealing and anti-social behaviour, which was attributed to its isolated location. After the building was left empty, it has been a hotspot for vandals, squatters and drug dealers. In 2013 the building was the scene of the murder of Kevin Kennedy, whose decapitated and armless body was found buried in a shallow grave adjacent to the building. Recent years During the 2010s there have been several plans to refurbish the residential building; in 2010 there have been plans to refurbish the tower block as well as building low rise housing in the surrounding areas. Planning permission was given in 2010 but refurbishment never occurred. In 2013 a developer attempted to refurbish the tower block into social and student housing, with plans to upgrade the flats with new windows and insulation, however this plan was rejected in 2014. More recently in 2018, developer Stace LLP has planned to refurbish the residential building, as well as transforming the surrounding area with two 2-bedroom homes, a new block of flats consisting of 41 1-2 bedroom properties and new parking facilities.

Operational history The 5th Luftwaffe Field Division was one of several Luftwaffe divisions formed in 1942 from surplus ground crew and intended to serve as conventional infantry divisions. The 5th was raised in October 1942, under the command of Generalmajor Hans- Joachim von Armin. The division comprised four battalions of infantry, a battalion of field artillery, a company of assault guns and engineer, signal and supply units. It was sent to the southern sector of the Eastern Front, where it served in the Caucasus. It soon withdrew in the face of the Soviet advance and was engaged in the fighting around the Kuban bridgehead from February to April 1943. It was evacuated to the Crimea the following month. In September 1943, the division was shifted north to Melitopol, on the Panther‚ÄìWotan line. During the Soviet Battle of the Dnieper, it suffered many casualties. Responsibility for the remnants of the division was transferred to the Heer (Army) on 1 November 1943 and it was renamed 5th Field Division (L). It was transferred to Romania for restructuring and refitting. Its infantry strength was reduced to two battalions and it also received the staff of the 9th and 10th Jager Regiments (L). It was returned to the Eastern Front and attached to the Third Romanian Army. It fought in the Odessa Offensive until May 1944, when the division was disbanded. Its personnel were distributed among the 76th, 320th and 335th infantry divisions.

Polar bear jail (also known as Polar Bear Holding Facility) is a special building in Churchill, Manitoba where polar bears that are considered troublesome or dangerous are isolated before they can be relocated.  History  Before establishing the facility, polar bears which were considered dangerous used to be shot. The holding facility was first established in 1982 (according to other sources, in 1983, after a person was mauled by a bear on the street) in the building officially named \\"House D-20\\", a former military morgue. The facility is the subject of the poem \\"Churchill Bear Jail\\" by Salish Chief Victor A. Charlo.  Keeping the animals  Initially, the facility had 20 cells, which could hold 16 single bears and four family groups. The bears could be held from two to 30 days ‚Äì if a bear has been captured repeatedly, the term may be extended. The premise is that extended captivity would create a sense of danger for the bears so that they will be reluctant to approach the town. The bears are not fed during the captivity. Since bears' natural cycle involves long periods of fasting, their bodies are adapted to going without food for an extended time. Dangerous bears are tranquilized when captured and are marked with a bright paint on the neck. Closer to the winter, when the ice in the Hudson bay has set, the bears are released. They are tranquilized again and transported by helicopter far from the town. In 2014, the jail was extended to 28 cells. The inhabitants of Churchill still have to be careful outside, as the outskirts of the city are said to be visited by about a thousand polar bears in the summer. With the ice gone, they are unable to hunt their primary prey ‚Äì seals ‚Äì and, suffering from the hunger, they approach the town and threaten the inhabitants. There are signs cautioning \\"Polar Bear Alert\\" on the Hudson bay shore and Churchill river, and a person noticing a polar bear can call the designated number, upon which the workers of the Department of Natural Resources will come out and catch the bear.

It is run as a module inside the Linux kernel, and aims for better performance and more power saving than the IPsec and OpenVPN tunneling protocols. It was written by Jason A. Donenfeld and is published under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2. The Linux version of the software has reached a stable production release and was incorporated into the Linux kernel release in late March 2020. Features WireGuard aims to provide a VPN that is both simple and highly effective. A 2018 review by Ars Technica observed that popular VPN technologies such as OpenVPN and IPsec are often complex to set up, disconnect easily (in the absence of further configuration), take substantial time to negotiate reconnections, may use outdated ciphers, and have relatively massive code bases (over 400,000 and 600,000 lines of code, respectively, according to Ars Technica) which makes it harder to find bugs. WireGuard's design seeks to reduce these issues, aiming to make the tunnel more secure and easier to manage by default. By using versioning of cryptography packages, it focuses on ciphers believed to be among the most secure current encryption methods, and at the time of the Ars Technica review had a codebase of around 4000 lines of pure kernel code, about 1% of either OpenVPN or IPsec, making security audits easier, and praised by the Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds compared to OpenVPN and IPsec as a \\"work of art\\". Ars Technica reported that in testing, stable tunnels were easy to create with WireGuard, compared to alternatives, and commented that it would be \\"hard to go back\\" to long reconnection delays, compared to WireGuard's \\"no nonsense\\" instant reconnections. Protocol WireGuard utilizes the following: * Curve25519 for key exchange * ChaCha20 for encryption * Poly1305 for data authentication * SipHash for hashtable keys * BLAKE2s for hashing * UDP-based only. In May 2019, researchers from INRIA published a machine- checked proof of WireGuard, produced using the CryptoVerif proof assistant. = Encryption = WireGuard only supports ChaCha20.  Optional Pre-shared Symmetric Key Mode  WireGuard supports Pre-shared Symmetric, which is included to mitigate any future advances in quantum computing. In the shorter term, if the pre-shared symmetric key is compromised, the Curve25519 keys still provide more than sufficient protection. =Networking= WireGuard only works over UDP. WireGuard fully supports IPv6, both inside and outside of tunnel. It supports only layer 3 for both IPv4 and IPv6 and can encapsulate v4-in-v6 and vice versa. WireGuard supports multiple topologies: * Point-to- point * Star (Server/client)  A client endpoint does not have to be defined before the client start sending data  Client endpoints can be statically predefined. * Mesh Since Point-to-point is supported, other topologies can be made, but not on the same tunnel. =Extensibility= WireGuard is designed to be extended by third-party programmes and scripts. This has been used to augment WireGuard with various features including more user-friendly management interfaces (including easier setting up of keys), logging, dynamic firewall updates, and LDAP integration. Excluding such complex features from the minimal core codebase improves its stability and security.  History  Earliest snapshots of the code base exist from June 30, 2016. Four early adopters of WireGuard were the VPN service providers Mullvad, AzireVPN, IVPN and cryptostorm. WireGuard has received donations from Mullvad, Private Internet Access, IVPN, the NLnet Foundation and now also from OVPN. the developers of WireGuard advise treating the code and protocol as experimental, and caution that they have not yet achieved a stable release compatible with CVE tracking of any security vulnerabilities that may be discovered. On 9 December 2019, David Miller - primary maintainer of the Linux networking stack - accepted the WireGuard patches into the \\"net-next\\" maintainer tree, for inclusion in an upcoming kernel. On 28 January 2020, Linus Torvalds merged David Miller's net-next tree, and WireGuard entered the mainline Linux kernel tree. On 20 March 2020, Debian developers enabled the module build options for WireGuard in their kernel config for the Debian 11 version (testing). On 29 March 2020 WireGuard was incorporated into the Linux 5.6 release tree. The Windows version of the software remains at beta. On 30 March 2020, Android developers added native kernel support for WireGuard in their Generic Kernel Image. On 22 April 2020, NetworkManager developer Beniamino Galvani merged GUI support for WireGuard. On 12 May 2020, Matt Dunwoodie proposed patches for native kernel support of WireGuard in OpenBSD. On 22 June 2020, After the work of Matt Dunwoodie and Jason A. Donenfeld, WireGuard support has been imported into OpenBSD.  Reception  Oregon senator Ron Wyden has recommended to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that they evaluate WireGuard as a replacement for existing technologies like IPsec and OpenVPN.  Implementations  Implementations of the WireGuard protocol include: * Donenfeld's initial implementation, written in C and Go. * Cloudflare's BoringTun, a user space implementation written in Rust. * Matt Dunwoodie's implementation for OpenBSD, written in C.  User space programs supporting WireGuard  User space programs supporting WireGuard include: * NetworkManager since version 1.16 * systemd since version 237 * Intel's ConnMan since version 1.38 * Mozilla VPN * NordVPN via Nordlynx * PiVPN since 17 October 2019 * pfSense package. * NOIA Network * Private Internet Access VPN since 10 April 2020 * Mistborn (software) VPN since March 2020  See also  * Comparison of virtual private network services * Secure Shell (SSH), a cryptographic network protocol used to secure services over an unsecured network.

Increasing soil's carbon content can aid plant growth, increase soil organic matter (improving agricultural yield), improve soil water retention capacity and reduce fertilizer use (and the accompanying emissions of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (). As of 2016, variants of carbon farming reached hundreds of millions of hectares globally, of the nearly of world farmland. Soils can contain up to five per cent carbon by weight, including decomposing plant and animal matter and biochar. Potential sequestration alternatives to carbon farming include scrubbing CO2 from the air with machines (direct air capture); fertilizing the oceans to prompt algal blooms that after death carry carbon to the sea bottom;storing the carbon dioxide emitted by electricity generation; and crushing and spreading types of rock such as basalt that absorb atmospheric carbon. Land management techniques that can be combined with farming include planting/restoring forests, burying biochar produced by anaerobically converted biomass and restoring wetlands. (Coal beds are the remains of marshes and peatlands.)  History  In 2011 Australia started a cap-and-trade program. Farmers who sequester carbon can sell carbon credits to companies in need of carbon offsets. The country's Direct Action Plan states \\"The single largest opportunity for emissions reduction in Australia is through bio-sequestration in general, and in particular, the replenishment of our soil carbons.\\" In studies of test plots over 20 years showed increased microbial activity when farmers incorporated organic matter or reduced tillage. Soil carbon levels from 1990‚Äì2006 declined by 30% on average under continuous cropping. Incorporating organic matter alone was not enough to build soil carbon. Nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur had to be added as well to do so. By 2014 more than 75% of Canadian Prairies' cropland had adopted \\"conservation tillage\\" and more than 50% had adopted no till. Twenty-five countries pledged to adopt the practice at the December 2015 Paris climate talks. In California multiple Resource Conservation Districts (RCDs) support local partnerships to develop and implement carbon farming, In 2015 the agency that administers California's carbon-credit exchange began granting credits to farmers who compost grazing lands. In 2016 Chevrolet partnered with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to purchase 40,000 carbon credits from ranchers on 11,000 no-till acres. The transaction equates to removing 5,000 cars from the road and was the largest to date in the US. In 2017 multiple US states passed legislation in support of carbon farming and soil health. * California appropriated $7.5 million as part of its Healthy Soils Program. The objective is to demonstrate that \\"specific management practices sequester carbon, improve soil health and reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases.\\" The program includes mulching, cover crops, composting, hedgerows and buffer strips. Nearly half of California counties have farmers who are working on carbon-farming. * Maryland's Healthy Soils Program supports research, education and technical assistance. * Massachusetts funds education and training to support agriculture that regenerates soil health. * Hawaii created the Carbon Farming Task Force to develop incentives to increase soil carbon content. A 250-acre demonstration project attempted to produce biofuels from the pongamia tree. Pongamia adds nitrogen to the soil. Similarly, one ranch husbands 2,000 head of cattle on 4,000 acres, using rotational grazing to build soil, store carbon, restore hydrologic function and reduce runoff. Other states are considering similar programs. = Four per 1,000 = The largest international effort to promote carbon farming is ‚Äúfour per 1,000‚Äù, led by France. Its goal is to increase soil carbon by 0.4 percent per year through agricultural and forestry changes.  Techniques  =Soil carbon= Traditionally, soil carbon was thought to accumulate when decaying organic matter was physically mixed with soil. More recently, the role of living plants has been emphasized. Small roots die and decay while the plant is alive, depositing carbon below the surface. Further, as plants grow, their roots inject carbon into the soil, feeding mycorrhiza. An estimated 12,000 miles of their hyphae live in every square meter of healthy soil. = Bamboo = Although a bamboo forest stores less total carbon than a mature forest of trees, a bamboo plantation sequesters carbon at a much faster rate than a mature forest or a tree plantation. Therefore the farming of bamboo timber may have significant carbon sequestration potential. = Seaweed farming = Large-scale seaweed farming (called \\"ocean afforestation\\") could sequester huge amounts of carbon. Afforesting just 9% of the ocean could sequester 53 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually. The IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate recommends \\"further research attention\\" as a mitigation tactic. = Wetland restoration = An example of a healthy wetland ecosystem. Wetlands are created when water overflows into heavily vegetated soil causing plants to adapt to a flooded ecosystem. Wetlands can occur in three different regions. Marine wetlands are found in shallow coastal areas, tidal wetlands are also coastal but are found farther inland, and non- tidal wetlands are found inland and have no affects from tides. Wetland soil is an important carbon sink; 14.5% of the world's soil carbon is found in wetlands, while only 5.5% of the world's land is composed of wetlands. Not only are wetlands a great carbon sink, they have many other benefits like collecting floodwater, filtering air and water pollutants, and creating a home for numerous birds, fish, insects, and plants. Climate change could alter soil carbon storage changing it from a sink to a source. With rising temperatures comes an increase in greenhouse gasses from wetlands especially locations with permafrost. When this permafrost melts in increases the available oxygen and water in the soil. Because of this, bacteria in the soil would create large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane to be released into the atmosphere. Peatlands hold approximately 30 percent of the carbon in our ecosystem. When wetlands are drained for agriculture and urbanization, because peatlands are so vast, large quantities of carbon decompose and emit CO2 into the atmosphere. The loss of one peatland could potentially produce more carbon than 175‚Äì500 years of methane emissions. While the link between climate change and wetlands is still not fully known, it will be soon determined through future removal of wetlands. It is also not clear how restored wetlands manage carbon while still being a contributing source of methane. However, preserving these areas would help prevent further release of carbon into the atmosphere. = Agriculture = Compared to natural vegetation, cropland soils are depleted in soil organic carbon (SOC). When a soil is converted from natural land or semi natural land, such as forests, woodlands, grasslands, steppes and savannas, the SOC content in the soil reduces by about 30‚Äì40%. This loss is due to the removal of plant material containing carbon, via harvesting. When land use changes, soil carbon either increases or decreases. This change continues until the soil reaches a new equilibrium. Deviations from this equilibrium can also be affected by varying climate. The decrease can be counteracted by increasing carbon input. This can be done via several strategies, e.g. leaving harvest residues on the field, using manure or rotating perennial crops. Perennial crops have a larger below ground biomass fraction, which increases the SOC content. Globally, soils are estimated to contain >8,580 gigatons of organic carbon, about ten times the amount in the atmosphere and much more than in vegetation. Modification of agricultural practices is a recognized method of carbon sequestration as soil can act as an effective carbon sink offsetting as much as 20% of 2010 carbon dioxide emissions annually. Organic farming and earthworms may be able to more than offset the annual carbon excess of 4 Gt/year. Carbon emission reduction methods in agriculture can be grouped into two categories: reducing and/or displacing emissions and enhancing carbon sequestration. Reductions include increasing the efficiency of farm operations (e.g. more fuel-efficient equipment) and interrupting the natural carbon cycle. Effective techniques (such as the elimination of stubble burning) can negatively impact other environmental concerns (increased herbicide use to control weeds not destroyed by burning). = Deep soil = About half of soil carbon is found within deep soils. About 90% of this is stabilized by mineral-organic associations. At least thirty-two Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) practices improve soil health and sequester carbon, along with important co-benefits: increased water retention, hydrological function, biodiversity and resilience. Approved practices may make farmers eligible for federal funds. Not all carbon farming techniques have been recommended. Carbon farming may consider related issues such as groundwater and surface water degradation. = Biochar/terra preta = Mixing anaerobically burned biochar into soil sequesters approximately 50% of the carbon in the biomass. Globally up to 12% of the anthropogenic carbon emissions from land use change (0.21 gigatonnes) can be off-set annually in soil, if slash-and-burn is replaced by slash-and-char. Agriculture and forestry wastes could add some 0.16 gigatonnes/year. Biofuel production using modern biomass can produce a bio-char by-product through pyrolysis sequestering 30.6 kg for each gigajoule of energy produced. Soil- sequestered carbon is easily and verifiably measured. = Tilling = Carbon farming minimizes disruption to soils over the planting/growing/harvest cycle. Tillage is avoided using seed drills or similar techniques. Livestock can trample and/or eat the remains of a harvested field. = Livestock grazing = Livestock sequester carbon when the animal eats the grass, causing its roots to release carbon into the soil. However, these animals typically produce significant methane, potentially offsetting the carbon impact. By regularly rotating the herd through multiple paddocks (as often as daily) the paddocks can rest/recover between grazing periods. This pattern produces stable grasslands with significant fodder. Annual grasses have shallower roots and die once they‚Äôre grazed. Rotational grazing leads to the replacement of annuals by perennials with deeper roots, which can recover after grazing. By contrast, allowing animals to range over a large area for an extended period can destroy the grassland. = Silvopasture = Silvopasture involves grazing livestock under tree cover, with trees separated enough to allow adequate sunlight to nourish the grass. For example, a farm in Mexico planted native trees on a paddock spanning . This evolved into a successful organic dairy. The operation became a subsistence farm, earning income from consulting/training others rather than from crop production. = Organic mulch = Mulching covers the soil around plants with a mulch of wood chips or straw. Alternatively, crop residue can be left in place to enter the soil as it decomposes. = Compost = Compost sequesters carbon in a stable (not easily accessed) form. Carbon farmers spread it over the soil surface without tilling. A 2013 study found that a single compost application significantly and durably increased grassland carbon storage by 25‚Äì70%. The continuation sequestration likely came from increased water-holding and ‚Äúfertilization‚Äù by compost decomposition. Both factors support increased productivity. Both tested sites showed large increases in grassland productivity: a forage increase of 78% in a drier valley site, while a wetter coastal site averaged an increase of 42%. and and emissions did not increase significantly. Methane fluxes were negligible. Soil emissions from temperate grasslands amended with chemical fertilizers and manures were orders of magnitude higher. Another study found that grasslands treated with .5\\" of commercial compost began absorbing carbon at an annual rate of nearly 1.5 tons/acre and continued to do so in subsequent years. As of 2018, this study had not been replicated. = Cover crops = With row crops such as corn and wheat, fast-growing ground cover can be grown between the stalks (e.g., clover or vetch). They protect the soil from carbon loss through the winter and may be planted together with cash crops to compensate for carbon lost when those crops are harvested. Forage crops such as grasses, clovers and alfalfa develop extensive root systems that can become soil organic matter. Crops with limited root systems (corn, soybeans) do not increase organic matter in the soil. = Hybrids = Perennial crops offer potential to sequester carbon when grown in multilayered systems. One system uses perennial staple crops that grow on trees that are analogs to maize and beans, or vines, palms and herbaceous perennials. = Conventional agriculture = Plowing splits soil aggregates and allows microorganisms to consume their organic compounds. The increased microbial activity releases nutrients, initially boosting yield. Thereafter the loss of structure reduces soil‚Äôs ability to hold water and resist erosion, thereby reducing yield.  Criticisms  Critics say that the related regenerative agriculture cannot be adopted enough to matter or that it could lower commodity prices. The impact of increased soil carbon on yield has yet to be settled. Another criticism says that no-till practices may increase herbicide use, diminishing or eliminating carbon benefits. Composting is not an NRCS- approved technique and its impacts on native species and greenhouse emissions during production have not been fully resolved. Further, commercial compost supplies are too limited to cover large amounts of land.  Resources  USDA offers a tool called COMET-Farm that estimates a farm's carbon footprint. Farmers can evaluate various land management scenarios to learn which is the best fit.

Akbulut is a member of the GEW Baden- W√ºrttemberg, the Rosa-Luxemburg Stiftung and Attac. Moreover she is committed to the work with and for refugees and serves as a member on the board of the refugees project \\"Mannheim sagt JA Fl√ºchtlingshilfe\\" (Mannheim says yes), the network of Kurdish Academics and Cevi, the Kurdish Women's network. She was elected to the German Parliament (German:Bundestag) in 2017.  Member of Parliament  Akbulut ran for the first time in the 2017 federal elections on behalf of her local district association (Landesverband Mannheim) and was elected to the third place of the Landesverband Baden-W√ºrttemberg's candidate list. At the German Parliament she represents her local electoral district Mannheim and is one out of six members of parliament from the federal state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg for the The Left Party. Akbulut is the spokeswoman for migration and integration on behalf of the Left faction. She is a full member of the Committee for Legal Affairs and Consumer Protection and a deputy member of the Committee for Internal Affairs. Akbulut is also a full member of the European Law Subcommittee. She represents the Left faction in the German- Turkish as well as in the German-Greek Parliamentary Group of the German Parliament. Due to years of active work in Kurdish associations and her support for the Kurdish Movement, Akbulut is well connected all over Europe. In 2017 the press reported that Akbulut was under observation of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution because of her pro-Kurdish activism. She was accused of having been in contact with Kurdish organizations, who are allegedly associated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Akbulut is pressing charges against this observation, which supposedly started in 2007. She receives support for her legal resistance against this observation from her party The Left.  Political Views  During debates on the possible ratification of the Global Compact for Migration of Germany Akbulut was the leading voice in the support of the Compact's ratification by Germany, opposing the position of faction chairwoman Sahra Wagenknecht. Akbulut expressed criticism against Wagneknecht's controversial statements on the topics of migration and her engagement for her private campaign aufstehen. She is critical towards to current political order in Germany and would like to see broader democratic possibilities. She'd prefer the economy would have to adapt more to the democracy instead that the democracy adapts to according to the economy. She is an opponent of the Turkish Government of Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan.

She was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 8 May 1965 twenty years after the end of the war.  Early life  Ratushnaya was born on 9 January 1921 to a Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Tyvriv, located within present-day Ukraine. She became a member of the Komosmol in 1937 shortly before graduating from secondary school in 1938. In 1939 she entered Moscow State University but had to postpone her studies after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. World War II After leaving her studies at Moscow State University she entered nursing courses so she could enlist in the local militia after completing training. As a medical orderly in the 8th Krasnopresnenskaya Division she participated in the Battle of Moscow. In October 1941 she was captured and taken prisoner by enemy forces in Naro-Fominsk but later managed to escape to Vinnytsia. In January 1942 she joined the partisan unit Vinnytsia underground under the command of Ivan Bevz. Ratushnaya was noted for her talent to forge German documents and seals, saving many peoples lives by providing identifications for former POWs as well as forms exempting people from deportation to Germany, further enabling the partisan unit's activities. Due to her fluency in German she managed to infiltrate a POW camp and help several prisoners escape. Ratushnaya was again arrested by the Gestapo on July 1942 while she was working at a candle factory and sent her to the concentration camp in Hnivan, which she escaped from in April 1943. After her second escape she returned to partisan activities, working in a makeshift printing outlet printing anti-Axis pamphlets and delivered various supplies including weapons, ammunition, and medicine to other partisan detachments. On 18 March 1944 she was killed by an Axis infiltrator of her unit who had knocked on her door and asked to speak to her before shooting her twice. She was buried with full military honors in the Park of Glory in Vinnytsia where there is now an eternal flame memorial.

Marion Sims to treat a combination of vesicovaginal fistula and rectovaginal fistula, without her consent or the use of anesthesia.  Background  Little is known about Westcott and what is known comes from records kept by the plantation slave owner, medical journals written about Sims' work, and primary documents written by Sims himself. At the time of her pregnancy Westcott was a seventeen-year-old girl living in Alabama. She had a severe form of rickets caused by a lack of vitamin D and malnutrition, which had disfigured her pelvis, making it impossible for her to give birth. She went into labor during June 1845 and after trying to give birth for three days, Sims showed up to assist her in her labor.  Surgery on her fistula  After the stillbirth, Westcott was brought back to Sims because she had several unhealed tears in her vagina and rectum ‚Äì a vesicovaginal fistula and rectovaginal fistula. These tears caused her to have excruciating pain, which was from her uncontrollable bowel movements flowing through her open wounds. Being unable to control her bowel movements led to infections, inflamed tissue, and odor. This made Westcott a prime candidate for Sims to perform experimental surgeries on, as fistulas were fairly common among the enslaved due to malnutrition and their younger age, as they were likely to have children three years earlier than white women. Sims performed 30 experimental operations on Westcott before successfully closing the fistula and tears. During the procedures, Westcott was given no anesthesia, which had recently become available. Following the procedures, Sims administered opium, which was then an accepted therapeutic practice. The experimental procedures that Sims performed on Westcott and other slaves revolutionized gynecological surgery; the technique Sims developed became the first ever treatment for vesicovaginal fistulae.  Remembrance  In 2015, author J.C. Hallman became obsessed with finding Westcott. He published articles about Sims and Anarcha in Harper‚Äôs Magazine, The Montgomery Advertiser, and The Baffler, and his work to discover Westcott‚Äôs final resting place is featured in Josh Carples' documentary film Remembering Anarcha. Hallman is working on a book entitled The Anarcha Quest, based on the first archival evidence of Westcott‚Äôs life that did not come from Sims‚Äôs own untrustworthy work. Sims controversially performed experimental surgery on black women without anesthesia. A small statue of Anarcha Westcott was erected by protestors near the statue of Sims on the grounds of the Alabama State Capitol. It was quickly stolen.

North Vietnam‚Äôs Public Security Bureau captured and manipulated Chuyen to turn double agent shortly after his deployment in the North. Chuyen was active from 1961-1970, his double agent activities led to many deaths of CIA and U.S. military personnel, whom he led into traps by requesting new supplies. He later received 12 medals including the Medal of Homeland Security in 1997 from the Ministry of Public Security for his accomplishments in the resistance war against American rescue..  Early life  Pham Chuyen was born in 1922 in North Vietnam during the French Colonial Era. Chuyen trained in radio broadcasting and participated in the August Revolution against France. He worked for the Quang Yen Security Bureau, however the French arrested Chuyen in October 1947. After being freed, Chuyen worked for the secretary of the council in Hong Gai Town. Chuyen returned home in May 1948 and was admitted to the party. Later in 1948, Chuyen took charge of three communes in the Yen Hung District. He specialized working in the emulation board in 1949 . In 1950, Chuyen moved to the Quang Yen Provincial Party Committee. In 1953, the party committee sent him to the Party School to specialize in corruption. In 1957, Chuyen took a mistress and was outcast from the party. Chuyen left his designated agency in 1957 due to professional discontent. Chuyen then decided to specialize in folk singing; however, that all changed in 1959 .  Unrest in North Vietnam  On 25 June 1959, the People‚Äôs Court of Yen Hung called Pham Chuyen to question him on anti-government activities. Chuyen fled South. First, he fled to Hanoi where he bought a ticket to Vinh. From Vinh, Chuyen followed Route 8 to the border of Laos where he stayed for nine months. In Laos, Savanakhet questioned Chuyen. In May 1960, Chuyen left Laos to the reception center in Saigon, South Vietnam. Chuyen hoped for the South to assign him work. The Department of Political Studies assigned him to talk in localities to present content about cooperatives in the North and the agricultural tax . A few months into his new job, a man by the name of Phan talked to Chuyen. Phan was an employee of the Political Bureau of the Presidential Office. In mid-September 1960, Phan took Chuyen to Majestic Hotel, where he met an American operative. The operative asked Chuyen what he thought of the South and ended the conversation. A week later, Phan and Chuyen met the American in a mansion where he asked Chuyen psychological questions. When the meeting finished the American wished Chuyen success and told him government officials will meet him .  CIA recruitment  In 1961, needing potential agents, the CIA and ARVN recruited and trained Pham Chuyen for a five-year infiltration plan in Northern Vietnam. Lieutenant Do Van Tien, code- named FRANCOIS, was responsible for the training and dispatching single spies to infiltrate North Vietnam. At first, Chuyen refused but Lieutenant Colonel Le Quang Tung monitored and enticed Chuyen for half a year. After six months of the CIA following him, Chuyen accepted. The CIA sent him to Nha Trang to do psychological tests where he received excellent grades. Then, Chuyen had to pass two more tests, one in Saigon and another in Nha Trang. Then, the CIA trained Chuyen in communication skills. Pham Chuyen, code-named ARES, was to return to North Vietnam to spy on his homeland . April 1961, the CIA dispatched Pham Chuyen to North Vietnam via boat 35 miles from Hanoi, near Quang Yen, on a beach near Ha Long Bay . According to a World Security report, villagers noticed the unfamiliar boat. Villagers reported seeing a stranger in the hilly woods of La Khe Hamlet who looked like Chuyen. Informants in the village reported Chuyen left the area to see his mother.  Double agent  When Pham Chuyen engaged in conversation with a local spy, he failed in his mission from the CIA. Chuyen told the spy he had come to conduct operations in the North. Days later, Northern security forces took Chuyen and his supplies, including his radio. In was then that the North‚Äôs \\"Public Security Bureau\\", a powerful intelligence agency modelled after Russia‚Äôs KGB, convinced him to turn double agent . Pham Chuyen‚Äôs turn to a double agent caused the capture and death of many U.S. military and CIA controlled spies for a decade. Walter McIntosh, former chief of Vietnam operations in the CIA, stated he knew Chuyen was a double agent. McIntosh wrote a 12-page document providing evidence that Chuyen was in fact a double agent and that the North compromised his mission. However, Chuyen was under the control of MACV-SOG and they did not heed McIntosh‚Äôs warning. 12 men died while trying to resupply Chuyen . Pham Chuyen‚Äôs handlers in Hanoi created over 300 fake intelligence reports for him to hand over to Saigon. These fake intelligence reports included misleading maps with coordinates to missile sites, trains, rail lines, bridges, factories, and other target areas of U.S. warplanes. Chuyen‚Äôs handler had fake reports transmitted by radio, to move suspicion away Chuyen. Chuyen often reported the North stealing his equipment which prompted MACV-SOG to send him more supplies resulting in the death of the resuppliers. Pham Chuyen‚Äôs handler in Hanoi was Nguyen Tai who was a top spy in Saigon from 1966 to 1970. Tai hid his spies‚Äô names and created cover stories for his operatives .  End of career  In December 1969, the Ministry of Public Security sent its two BK63 agents, Pham Chuyen and along with another spy, agent EAGLE, to the South. In 1970, Chuyen‚Äôs handlers in the North allowed him to live a normal life. Chuyen moved his wife and two children, a daughter and son, to his parents‚Äô home in Yen Hung district. Chuyen spent the rest of his days as a farmer. In 2003, Chuyen wrote an autobiography, which he gave to his old friend from the North Major General Le Mai, that there are few things authors get about his story. ‚ÄúThe things Tourison writes about me are often \\"a little bit of the pot\\", which is not, of course, not to be argued, not to blame (...). However, there are two things which Tourison said: I have many names. During resistance against the French, I was Nguyen Thiet. In peace, in the newspaper Vietnam Independence, I was Pham Van. In Saigon, in 1959 I was named Nguyen Bao Thuy. In the anti-American war, in the spy mission, people gave me the alias Ha Long, code-named Ares, which the US Intelligence Agency also used. My \\"rice name\\" (given name) is Pham Chuyen. Second, this is also the more important thing, Tourison did not dare assert who I worked for. For the Saigon intelligence agency or the Ministry of Public Security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam?‚Äù. Pham Chuyen died after months of an unknown illness at 93 in 2014.

Oestridae, and is found worldwide. The adults, which have a bumblebee-like appearance, are prominently active in the summer. G. intestinalis is primarily a parasite of horses, mules and donkeys. Identification The eggs of G. intestinalis are pale yellow in color, and long. The larvae are yellow or tan. Adults, which are long, look superficially like hairy bumblebees, with a noticeable ovipositor at the end of the abdomen. Life cycle The female fly cements individual eggs onto hairs of the forelimbs and shoulders of horses, mules and donkeys. Each female lays up to 1000 eggs. In order the hatch, the eggs must be licked by the host animal. If taken into the host's mouth during grooming, the egg will hatch in the mouth. If not, the first instar larva will migrate to the mouth. The larvae develop in the tissue the tongue, in tunnels within of the surface. Second instar larvae are swallowed and pass into the host's stomach, and attach to the non- glandular region of the stomach. The larvae remain in the stomach for 8‚Äì10 months, before maturing into third instar larvae. In the spring, the third stage larvae pass out of the host in the feces. Pupation takes place in the soil for a duration of 3‚Äì5 weeks, until the adults emerge. Adults are active for only a few weeks in the summer, and, lacking functional mouthparts, live only for a short time. Effects on the host Clinical signs are uncommon in host animals. Large numbers of larvae in the stomach can cause pain in the stomach, and, rarely, extremely large infestations may cause an obstruction at the outflow from the stomach to the duodenum. The larvae are usually found incidentally when the host's stomach is examined by endoscope. Often the only sign of infestation is the finding of larvae in the feces. The main impact on the host is the nuisance of the adults as they repeatedly land on the legs when attempting to lay eggs. Treatment and control Parasiticides which are effective against the larvae include macrolytic lactones, such as ivermectin and moxidectin, and organophosphates, such as metrifonate (also known as trichlorphon) and dichlorvos. The best time to deworm horses against Gasterophilus intestinalis is after the first hard frost. This hard frost will kill the females so no new eggs can be laid on the horse that can be ingested. Meaning that the dewormer is acting on the larva attached to the stomach and will also decrease the amount of larva shed in the feces in the spring.  Prevention  Although deworming is the best treatment and prevention of bot flies, horse owners can take other steps to prevent bot fly egg ingestion. This can be done by manually removing the eggs from the horse's leg using specialized tools, such as bot knives. However, it is important to wash your hands after physically removing the eggs because there is a possibility of the larvae burrowing into the human skin. In addition to removing the eggs manually, there are a few management changes that can be made to decrease the amount of bot flies. Since part of the life-cycle is spent developing in the manure, manure should be removed from horse's pens regularly and composted before place on pasture land. If possible, rotational grazing with different species is beneficial. Lastly, making sure feed and water are free from contamination with manure.

It has one or two dark green leaves at its base and up to twenty five greenish, insect-like flowers with red glands on its labellum. This species is known by some authorities as Phoringopsis dockrillii. There is a single record of this species from Papua New Guinea. Description Arthrochilus dockrillii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber which produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It one or two dark green, linear to lance-shaped leaves, usually one larger than the other, each leaf long and wide. Between five and twenty five greenish, insect-like flowers long are well spaced along a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is oblong to spatula- shaped, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are linear, long and about wide. The petals are narrow linear, long and about wide and slightly curved. The petals and lateral sepals turn backwards against the ovary and are inconspicuous. The labellum is about long and wide and held above the flower. The callus is about long, covered with a few spiky, bristly hair-like glands and the tip is about long. Flowering occurs from January to August. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus dockrillii was first formally described in 1975 by Bill Lavarack from a specimen collected near Innisfail and the description was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland. In 2002 David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name of this orchid to Phoringopsis dockrillii, but the name has not been adopted by some authorities. Distribution and habitat The green truffle orchid grows in coastal and near-coastal forests and scrub between Hopevale and Bramston Beach with a disjunct population near Kuranda. There is a single collection from Papua New Guinea. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. dockrillii is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

The river is long, and it has a drainage basin of . Its natural average discharge is , but this is considerably less today because of hydroelectric infrastructure along the watercourse. The Bjoreio has its origin on the northwest side of Sildabunutane, a mountain in Hardangervidda National Park. The river, which is called the Eitro here, then runs southeast through Sildabudalen, a wide valley, and into Langavatnet, a lake at an elevation of . Under the name Snero the river continues the short distance to Tinnh√∏len, a lake at . When it flows out of Tinnh√∏len the river is now named Bjoreio, and it runs to the northwest out of the national park and down through the Bjorei Valley (Bjoreidalen). At the Nybu tourist lodge it is joined by the Svinto from the east. Here the river runs through the Bjorei Valley Nature Reserve (Bjoreidalen naturreservat). In the nature reserve there is a ban on walking outside specially marked trails from May 20 to July 20 to protect nesting birds. Further downstream, at Storlia, is the high Sysen Dam, a large stone embankment that creates Lake Sysen on the Leiro River just before it empties into the Bjoreio. The rivers continues westward through the Sysen Valley, where its tributaries include the Isd√∏lo from the north and the Drolst√∏lbekken from the south. At Fossli the river creates high V√∏ring Falls, where it hurtles down into the narrow and deep M√•b√∏ Valley. The river empties into Lake Eidfjord in √òvre Eidfjord, only from the nearby Veig River. At the opposite end of Lake Eidfjord, the short Eio River empties into the Hardanger Fjord. Together with the nearby Sima River to the north, the Bjoreio River has been developed for power production at the Sima Hydroelectric Power Station. Lake Sysen is used as the main reservoir. The river's flow has been diverted through a tunnel to the lake and, together with the upper course of the Isd√∏lo, the water is then directed to the power station below Kje√•sen on the north side of the Simadal Fjord. The river bed below the Sysen Dam is dry for most of the year, but during the summer season it is required to release water so that the flow at V√∏ring Falls is at least .

It is located near the centre of King William's Town, at the southern corner of the intersection of Buffalo Road and Cathcart Street, about 250 metres east of the Buffalo River. The ground's first recorded cricket match took place in February 1889, when the touring English team played two matches there against the team of the Cape Mounted Riflemen. It served as an occasional first-class cricket ground for Border for seven matches between 1903 and 1958, and later staged six List A cricket matches for Border and the Impalas between 1988 and 1991. Border won three, lost one, and drew three of the first-class matches. There were three centuries, all by Border's opponents, the highest of them 144 by Tony Harris of Transvaal when Transvaal won in 1947‚Äì48. The best bowling figures were 7 for 48 by Jimmy Sinclair of Transvaal, who bowled unchanged throughout the Border first innings in 1906‚Äì07. Border's highest individual scores at the ground were made by the openers in the match against the touring English team in 1913-14: Sidney Fuller made 72 and Ronnie Randell made 71, and they put on 114 for the first wicket. Border's best bowling figures were 6 for 16 (22‚Äì16‚Äì16‚Äì6) by Dudley Phillips in the victory over Rhodesia in 1929‚Äì30.

The plant generated electricity from 1926 until its closure in 2015. It was operated by American Electric Power (AEP). History Picway began operations with two units in September 1926. The plant was operated by the Columbus Railway Power and Light Company, a forerunner of AEP. The two units had a combined capacity of 60 MW. The facility originally used low-profile electric locomotives capable of both third rail and overhead power to move ash cars under the boilers, and move coal around the property; one of these locomotives still exists in operating condition at the Ohio Railway Museum. Construction of Unit 3 was temporarily halted in 1942 by the War Production Board (WPB) as the building of new non- essential electricity production was suspended for the war effort. Unit 3 officially came online in 1943 with capacity of 30 MW. Unit 4 began commercial operations in 1949 after more than two years of construction at a cost of $5 million. The unit generated 30 MW. The final unit, Unit 5, began commercial operations in 1955 after two years of construction at a cost of $15 million. The unit generated 100 MW and gave Picway a maximum nameplate capacity of 220 MW. Rail service to supply coal for Picway was provided by the Scioto Valley Railway and Power Company which was later renamed the Ohio-Midland Light and Power Company in 1932. The trackage to the plant was initially powered using third rail, but became dieselized in 1955. It was the last railroad in Ohio to be powered by third rail. The conversion to diesel allowed coal to be interchanged by rail at Lockbourne, instead of Obetz or Groveport previously. Coal deliveries for Picway were switched from rail to truck beginning in 1972, but rail service resumed temporarily during the Blizzard of 1978 when truck deliveries could not get through the snow. Environmental mitigation Electrostatic precipitators, which are used to prevent fly ash from being released into the atmosphere, were installed at Picway in 1974. A LO-NOx burner was added to Picway in 1995 in order to reduce nitrogen oxide () emissions. Picway began generating electricity with biomass and later biodiesel in 2010 as a way to lower operating costs and produce renewable energy. Retirement and closure Units 1 and 2 were retired in 1972. Units 3 and 4 ceased operations in October 1980 in order for Columbus & Southern Ohio Electric to attain pollution reductions from the Ohio's State Implementation Plan (SIP). The Ohio Environmental Council had argued for an expedited shut down before October 1980, but this was rejected by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. By 2010, Picway generated electricity only during the peak summer months as a cost-cutting measure. With changes in federal clean air rules by the Environmental Protect Agency (EPA) on the horizon, AEP announced in 2011 they would retire Picway. AEP cited the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for the retirement of Picway. The power plant closed in May 2015. The facility and land were sold to a real estate company specializing in brownfield redevelopment in 2016.

Since capital punishment in Belgium had not been applied since 1863, her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.  Biography  Marie Petitjean was born in the rural village of Wamont near Landen, in a peasant environment. She rarely attended school to help her parents in the fields, but the nevertheless asked the village priest to teach her writing, reading and arithmetic. At the age of sixteen, she left her family to live with an aunt who ran a rope shop on Saint-Pholien Street in Li√©ge; she often used peket to retain the male clientele. At the age of 17, on August 15, 1896, she met her first lover, a man named Yann, at the Marian feasts in the Outremeuse district. This was the first of a very long series of marriages that did not stop. In 1900, when she was 21 years old, she began work for a sewing shop. Marie was very passionate about her job and excelled at it. She was considered to be a pretty, lively and joyful woman who pleased the men. Marie Becker in 1905 (26 years old) Birth certificate of Marie Alexandrine Petitjean - July 14, 1879 In 1905, at the Universal Exhibition in Li√®ge, she met the man who would become her husband - Charles Becker, Sr. At that time, she was climbing the social ladder, going from the status of saleswoman to now managing the fittings in a large fashion store on Pot d'Or Street in Li√®ge. She now had her own home and frequented the wealthy bourgeoisie areas to give her own fashion advice. She married Charles Becker Sr. in 1906, and the couple soon moved into the house adjoined to the family sawmill, where Mr. Becker and his two sons, Charles Jr. and Gustave, worked. Marie, however, did not get on well with the family, and frequently argued with L√©ontine, Gustave's wife. Angered, the father threatened Charles Jr. to dismiss his daughter-in-law. who was a charcuterie in Bressoux. Unbeknownst to the family, the trade was rapidly collapsing. Marie then started to cheat on her husband more often, explaining in her trial that \\"it is not given to all women to resist the advances of men.\\" In 1912, Charles Sr. died, which let Charles Jr. to resume his duties in the family business. Marie then opened a sewing workshop in one the rooms of the house, bringing in a growing number of customers. She was heavily inspired by the models of Paul Poiret, even copying some of them. During the First World War, she courted for the Germans; the sawmill was badly hit but its trade continued to flourish. In 1920, she achieved her long-standing goal of opening a fashion business in Li√®ge on Saint-L√©onard Street. Success continued, and she then employed four workers. In 1928, she met a lover to whom Marie became extremely and passionately devoted, Maximilien Houdy, who was twenty years younger. However, the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the dissoluting morals of Becker put an end to her business, whose bankruptcy was pronounced in 1934. In October 1932, Charles Becker Jr. died as a result of a cancer. Marie then used some of the acquired money to pay off debts and maintain Houdy. In 1933, she relaunched a seamstress day business for wealthy clients. A friend then suggested to her that she broadened her talents and began to take care of court ladies. She thus began to frequent near rich ladies-in-waiting, from whom she borrowed money when she did not reprive them of their titles or jewels. It is this that lead to her life of big spendings.  The Becker Affair  Marie was arrested on October 16, 1936 as she was preparing her 17th poison of digitalis for a woman named Mrs. Lamy. The subsequent investigation shed light on the murders. She was judged on July 7, 1938, and the following day found guilty of eleven murders, five attempted murders, theft and forgery. She was sentenced to death and, as has been the practice since 1863, her sentence was commutted to life imprisonment.

History Ice hockey never gained popularity in independent post-Soviet Turkmenistan until the president Saparmurat Niyazov ordered the construction of an Ice Palace in the desert foothills of the Kopet Dag. In 2006, the company Bouygues completed construction of the first Ice Palace. In 2011, the country had opened the second Ice Palace worth ‚Ç¨134.4 million. The total area of the new sports palace is 107,000 square meters, and in its center is the ice arena measuring 60 by 30 meters. Turkmenistan became a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) on 15 May 2015. It has been a full member of the IIHF and was the third former Soviet republic from Central Asia after Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to join the IIHF. The first national team was formed in 2011, comprising players from Ashgabat-based teams: Oguzkhan, Alp Arslan, Shir and Burgut. In 2013, the under-20 national team played its first game against Minsk City, which was won by 7‚Äì2. In 2016, Turkmenistan played its first game against Ashgabat, which was won by 12‚Äì2. In 2017, Turkmenistan made its international debut at the 2017 Asian Winter Games in Sapporo, Japan. Turkmenistan played in Division II and their first official game against Malaysia, winning by 9‚Äì2, and later went on to win the division by defeating Kyrgyzstan, 7‚Äì3 in the final. Their third game against Iran, winning by 12‚Äì2, but their opposition was disqualified due to the number of Iranian players were deemed ineligible. Iran still played their scheduled game against Turkmenistan on 23 February 2017. However, the game was considered as an exhibition game and its results has no bearing in the standings of the tournament. In 2018, the under-20 national team was supposed to make their debut at the 2018 IIHF World Junior Championship Division III Qualification tournament, but they withdrew prior to the tournament starting. The (senior) national team made its debut at the 2018 IIHF World Championship Division III qualification tournament in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. They won all of their games and earning a promotion to Division III for 2019. The national team finished third place in the 2019 IIHF World Championship Division III tournament in Sofia, Bulgaria.

The variety W is therefore homotopy-equivalent to X, but it has the technically advantageous property of being affine. Jouanolou's original statement of the theorem required that X be quasi-projective over an affine scheme, but this has since been considerably weakened.  Jouanolou's construction  Jouanolou's original statement was: :If X is a scheme quasi- projective over an affine scheme, then there exists a vector bundle E over X and an affine E-torsor W. By the definition of a torsor, W comes with a surjective map to X and is Zariski-locally on X an affine space bundle. Jouanolou's proof used an explicit construction. Let S be an affine scheme and X = \\\\mathbf{P}^r_S. Interpret the affine space \\\\mathbf{A}^{(r+1)^2}_S as the space of (r + 1) √ó (r + 1) matrices over S. Within this affine space, there is a subvariety W consisting of idempotent matrices of rank one. The image of such a matrix is therefore a point in X, and the map W \\\\to X that sends a matrix to the point corresponding to its image is the map claimed in the statement of the theorem. To show that this map has the desired properties, Jouanolou notes that there is a short exact sequence of vector bundles: :0 \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_X(-1) \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_X^{\\\\oplus r + 1} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\to 0, where the first map is defined by multiplication by a basis of sections of \\\\mathcal{O}_X(1) and the second map is the cokernel. Jouanolou then asserts that W is a torsor for \\\\mathcal{E} = \\\\operatorname{Hom}(\\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mathcal{O}_X(-1)). Jouanolou deduces the theorem in general by reducing to the above case. If X is projective over an affine scheme S, then it admits a closed immersion into some projective space \\\\mathbf{P}^r_S. Pulling back the variety W constructed above for \\\\mathbf{P}^r_S along this immersion yields the desired variety W for X. Finally, if X is quasi-projective, then it may be realized as an open subscheme of a projective S-scheme. Blow up the complement of X to get \\\\bar X, and let i \\\\colon X \\\\to \\\\bar X denote the inclusion morphism. The complement of X in \\\\bar X is a Cartier divisor, and therefore i is an affine morphism. Now perform the previous construction for \\\\bar X and pull back along i.  Thomason's construction  Robert Thomason observed that, by making a less explicit construction, it was possible to obtain the same conclusion under significantly weaker hypotheses. Thomason's construction first appeared in a paper of Weibel. Thomason's theorem asserts: :Let X be a quasicompact and quasiseparated scheme with an ample family of line bundles. Then an affine vector bundle torsor over X exists. Having an ample family of line bundles was first defined in SGA 6 Expos√© II D√©finition 2.2.4. Any quasi- projective scheme over an affine scheme has an ample family of line bundles, as does any separated locally factorial Noetherian scheme. Thomason's proof abstracts the key features of Jouanolou's. By hypothesis, X admits a set of line bundles L0, ..., LN and sections s0, ..., sN whose non-vanishing loci are affine and cover X. Define Xi to be the non-vanishing locus of si, and define \\\\mathcal{E} to be the direct sum of L0, ..., LN. The sections define a morphism of vector bundles s = (s_0, \\\\ldots, s_N) \\\\colon \\\\mathcal{O}_X \\\\to \\\\mathcal{E}. Define \\\\mathcal{F} to be the cokernel of s. On Xi, s is a split monomorphism since it is inverted by the inverse of si. Therefore \\\\mathcal{F} is a vector bundle over Xi, and because these open sets cover X, \\\\mathcal{F} is a vector bundle. Define \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathcal{E}) = \\\\operatorname{Proj} \\\\operatorname{Sym}^* \\\\mathcal{E} and similarly for \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathcal{F}). Let W be the complement of \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathcal{F}) in \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathcal{E}). There is an equivalent description of W as \\\\operatorname{Spec}(\\\\operatorname{Sym}^* \\\\mathcal{E} / (s - 1)), and from this description, it is easy to check that it is a torsor for \\\\mathcal{F}. Therefore the projection \\\\pi \\\\colon W \\\\to X is affine. To see that W is itself affine, apply a criterion of Serre (EGA II 5.2.1(b), EGA IV1 1.7.17). Each si determines a global section fi of W. The non-vanishing locus Wi of fi is contained in \\\\pi^{-1}(X_i), which is affine, and hence Wi is affine. The sum of the sections f0, ..., fN is 1, so the ideal they generate is the ring of global sections. Serre's criterion now implies that W is affine.

It aired in the United States on Fox on April 29, 2018. The title is a play on \\"forgive and forget\\". The episode deals with the relationship between Homer and Grampa hitting rock bottom once again, the result of a secret that the latter held from his son. As of this episode, The Simpsons surpassed Gunsmoke to become the longest-running scripted American primetime television series by number of episodes. This event was marked in the opening sequence by a gunfight between Maggie and Marshal Matt Dillon. Plot While trying to leave Moe's Tavern, Homer accidentally knocks over a streetlight. A man appears, asking Homer to sell his car for $500 to repair the damages to the streetlamp, which he accepts because his car will be used in a demolition derby. While at the derby, Grampa has a heart attack, and Homer is faced with the solution to either watch the rest of the derby and see his car win, or escort his father to the hospital, Homer agrees to help him. On his deathbed, Grampa makes a startling confession to Homer, whom he forgives. However, Grampa ends up surviving, and Homer becomes uncomfortable over Grampa's statement, to the point of deteriorating their relationship even further. The family, surprised by Homer's \\"silent treatment\\", decides to make them bond once again, only leading to an altercation between both of them at Moe's and an unsuccessful session at an entertainment center (formerly a mall). Eventually, Homer revealed what Grampa told him. In Homer's youth, he and his mother Mona bonded over baking pies. After she left home, Grampa, in an attempt to forget about Mona, threw her recipe box off a cliff. The family turns against Grampa, and decides to condemn him for his actions at the Retirement Castle, only to find that Grampa, who now feels guilty of what he did many years ago, is going to the cliff to find the box. Homer plans to stop him because the recipe box is still resting on a cliffside, and Grampa could lose his life getting them. Homer helps him to safety and to get the recipe box, and for a minute Grampa looks like he is sacrificing himself so that Homer can reach it, but when Homer gets to it, Grampa lands on a bed he got rid of many years earlier. However, the box is empty. While stopping at a nearby restaurant, Homer recognizes the taste of the pie he is eating as the same one he and his mother used to bake. The waitress tells him that she found the recipes falling down the cliff when Grampa tossed them out and gives them to Homer, wrapped in a bow, and Homer and Grampa make up and reconcile once again. The tag features Homer buying his old car again, finding that Snowball II had been there the whole time. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode a B‚Äì, stating, \\"To the show‚Äôs credit, the episode itself makes only passing mention of the at-least numerically impressive feat, with the cold open seeing a once-again pistol-packing Maggie gunning down Gunsmoke‚Äôs Marshall Matt Dillon. Credited to Simpsons writing stalwart Bill Odenkirk, ‚ÄòForgive and Regret‚Äô, instead, dedicates itself to telling a single story, once more revisiting the justifiably fraught (on both sides) father-son relationship between Abe and Homer Simpson.\\" \\"Forgive and Regret\\" scored a 1.0 rating with a 4 share and was watched by 2.47 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.

It aired in the United States on Fox on May 6, 2018. Plot During the Simpsons' dinner, a solar eclipse occurs. Marge, Lisa, Bart, Maggie and Grampa go outside to watch the solar eclipse, but Homer stays inside and continues to eat because it is \\"pork chop night\\". Marge is irritated by Homer's apathy, so he takes her out for a romantic date night the next day. As Homer and Marge return from their date, Ned Flanders comes to them looking for advice, now unemployed after being forced to close his store the Leftorium. Homer gets Ned a human resources job at the power plant, while Rod and Todd stay with the Simpsons, with Todd getting on Lisa's nerves. At the plant, Ned's heavy-handed methods irritate the other employees, especially Homer. That night, Homer prays for Ned to be fired, which occurs the next day after he suggests Mr. Burns give money to charity. Ned takes on several more jobs, including a harbor cruise dance instructor, a photographer for Rolling Stone Magazine, and a roadside bible salesman, but fails each time and becomes depressed. Marge suggests Ned follow Jesus's example and become a teacher, leading him to become a substitute teacher at Springfield Elementary. He is quickly overwhelmed by all of the disobedient students in Bart's class, and resigns after Bart is peer-pressured by Nelson into spitballing his mustache. Feeling bad about ruining Ned's life, Homer and Bart go to his house to apologize and convince him to return to teaching. Ned is hesitant, but Bart convinces him by reminding him of Bart's former teacher, Ned's deceased wife Edna Krabappel (Marcia Wallace, who died in 2013 makes a posthumous appearance via an archive recording). Bart and Ned then organize a plan to get the students to be obedient. Using a series of tricks by Bart, he and Ned are able to pacify the students by creating supposed acts of God that frighten them. Ned is instilled with a newfound confidence, and thanks Bart for his help. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode a D+, stating, \\"‚ÄôLeft Behind‚Äô is about everything and nothing. To be more accurate, this record-setting episode begins being about more than a half-dozen things, and then never pays off a single one.

It is found in a range from the United States to Panama, West Indies, Galapagos Islands, and has been introduced into Hawaii.  Geographic Location  The spider is native to the continental United States, and Mexico, but has been introduced and found in places across Hawaii, the Caribbean, Middle and South America, the Galapagos Islands, and even Oceania. Its large geographic range is likely due to its ability to travel through the wind using its silk to catch the current. Five species of Cyclosa occur in the continental United States.  Etymology  The name comes from the Latin roots for spinning top, related to the spider‚Äôs top-shaped body and its wheel-shaped webs.  Description  Cyclosa turbinata is a relatively small species with sizes about 4- 7 mm in length. Their color is a mix of browns, blacks, and whites, and their abdomen tapers to a rounded point, hence their given name. Females are typically within 3.3 and 5.2 mm in body length, while males are on average 2.5 mm long. Males are most active from March to September, while females are more active from March to October. Females of Cyclosa turbinata can be differentiated from females of Cyclosa conica, a very similar species, by their smaller size and the presence of two anterior dorsal humps. Mangora gibberosa, otherwise known as the lined orbweaver, is also commonly misidentified as C. turbinate due to its similar appearance and orb-style webs.  Protective Behaviors  Experimental results have shown that when Cyclosa turbinata is confronted with a predator stimulus, the species shows thanatosis behavior, better known as playing dead, more frequently and for longer durations during the day. Some experts believe that increased thanatosis behavior during the daytime may correspond to an increased Ô¨Åtness cost associated with Ô¨Çeeing the web hub during the nighttime when prey is most abundant. It is believed that C. turbinata does not sacriÔ¨Åce predator vigilance for increased foraging efforts because the period of highest foraging aggression coincides with the period during which C. turbinata is most likely to leave the foraging area because of predators.  Bites  C. turbinata spiders are known to be both biting and venomous, but their bites are thought to be unable to seriously injure healthy humans and other large animals, such as dogs.  Predators  Hymenopterans, specifically wasps, are a primary source of predation and parasitism in C. turbinata. The diet of sphecid wasps contains up to 75% orb-weaving spiders, and these two populations live in close proximity across much of North America. Experts agree that female C. turbinata generally start foraging at lower levels of energy reserves during the middle of the day when predators are most abundant. Because their visually oriented predators are mostly diurnal, female C. turbinata are expected to mostly ignore potential prey in the day time and instead complete their foraging at night to avoid revealing their presence to predators.  Habitat  Cyclosa turbinata are found across North America, Mexico, and the northern regions of South America. They are extremely common along forest edges and fencing. Cyclosa turbinata have been found on cotton and peanut crops, grassland pastures, on sand dunes, shrubs, pecan orchards, and various plants such as bluebonnets, croton, prickly pear, Baccharis, and Monarda citriodora. In woodland habitats, they favor live oak, Quercus buckleyi, Quercus virginiana, and Ulmus crassifolia trees, building their webs in hollow sycamore trees or in shrubs. One reason these spiders are thought to be so widely distributed is that their young can efficiently travel through the air via wind currents. The spiderling first climbs onto a perch and extends a line of silk into the air. The wind catches the silk, and when the silk is long enough and the tug powerful enough, the spiderling releases its grip on the perch and flies through the air. This allows the species to colonize vast areas of land. Five species of Cyclosa occur in North America north of Mexico, and these species differ in how their webs are positioned within vegetation, and for that reason, species diversity is highest in habitats that have high architectural and botanic diversity.  Web  Cyclosa turbinata is known for creating orb-shaped webs which are composed of both sticky and non-sticky threads placed in a regular fashion. These webs are rebuilt daily and web building is accomplished entirely in darkness. The cyclosa turbinta is unique in that it creates a so-called ‚Äòtrashline‚Äô across its spiral wheel-shaped web which is made up of prey carcasses which have been consumed as much as physically possible, detritus, and sometimes egg cases. The trashline appears to hinder the ability of visual predators to locate the spider within its web as the spider can camouflage in the trashline exceptionally well. Although the trashline attracts attacking wasps, they are unable to locate the spider within the web since the debris of the web‚Äôs decoration are of similar color, size and shape as the spider itself. Female spiders occupy the web hub, the center, almost continuously to conduct their sit-and-wait foraging behavior, and only leave to replace the web prior to sunrise. This allows the spiders to ensnare prey at nearly any time of day. However, prey that gets stuck to the web may be able to release itself, warranting the spider to leave the security of the web hub to ensure the prey is fully captured. Due to this, pursuing an increase in energy reserves comes at the direct cost of increased exposure to visual predators such as wasps, and females must balance these two to maximize their fitness and reproductive success. The size of prey that is captured in C. turbinata webs strongly correlates with the body size of the spider but not the spider‚Äôs life stage. When C. turbinata spiders‚Äô are under poor nutritional conditions, they strategically assess their silk resources before initiating web construction and alter their behavior to produce a highly regular web in spite of their diminished silk reserves. Because of the variability in the amount of silk reserves the spider has, webs of different diameters may be created. However, larger web diameters do not impact the insect-trapping efficiency of stabilimenta-adorned webs, and instead the efficiency is dependent solely on the presence of stabilimenta. C. turbinata spiders are known to readily construct webs within wooden frames both in the field and in the laboratory. When disturbed or threatened, C. turbinata spiders shake their webs back and forth, possibly to warn other larger animals of the webs existence in order to drive it away. Researchers generally agree that prey discrimination through interpretation of web-borne vibrations is probably not possible in Cyclosa turbinata spiders. Juvenile C. turbinata build their webs higher above the ground than spiders of other Cyclosa species and both juvenile and adult C. turbinata have the widest mesh compared to the rest of the genus. Adult and juvenile C. turbinata differ most dramatically from other species in their choice of plants for attaching webs. Other cyclosa species prefer using goldenrod, but C. turbinata is known for also using species of Ambrosia (ragweed), Asclepias (milkweed), and Cirsium (thistle).  Prey  In one study conducted in East Texas, researchers studied webs built in mid-August with an average diameter of 9.13 inches. In these webs, 42% of the prey that had been caught had been so strongly crushed and macerated by the spider's chelicerae that they could not be identified. Among the remaining 58% of prey, aphids were most prominent, followed by small dipterans, small hymenopterans, leafhoppers, thrips, small coleopterans, and lastly red fire ants.  Foraging  Cyclosa turbinata appears to forage both during daytime and nighttime; however, an experimental assay of prey capture behaviour suggested that the species shows primarily nocturnal patterns of foraging aggression because C. turbinata is more likely to attack at night than during the day. This indicates that C. turbinata forages across the diel cycle, but modulates its foraging aggression in a regular fashion.  Reproduction  Reports have stated that Cyclosa turbinata spiders are bivoltine, meaning that they reproduce once in the late spring and once again in the fall. According to a study conducted in 1984, C. turbinata has two generations per year. The first generation matures and reproduces in late spring and dies in early summer, and the second generation matures and reproduces during the summer and dies during the fall and winter. C. turbinata spiders reach full maturation in the spring, but when males become mature, they do not spin webs, but instead travel away from their home in search of potential mates. Females do spin webs and when they mate, they can create up to five egg sacs which will be hidden by the female in the surrounding foliage.  Behavior  Cyclosa Turbinata is unique in that its locomotor and web-building activity cause it to have an exceptionally short-period circadian clock, about 19 hours. Current research is being conducted to understand how web-building behavior may be regulated by this endogenous circadian control in this species. In an experiment where C. turbinata spiders were placed into chambers with periods of 19, 24 , or 29 hours of evenly split light and dark, none of the spiders exhibited decreased longevity in their own circadian clock. These findings contradicted all previous research into circadian resonance and suggest that C. turbinata do not suffer the same costs of extreme desynchronization as do other species of animals. C.Turbinata are also unique in their collection of prey carcasses along a so-called ‚Äòtrashline‚Äô on their web. This advanced protective behavior allows the spider to stay on its web but remain inconspicuous to its predators.

It was first observed on 21 May 2015 by astronomers with the Outer Solar System Origins Survey at the Mauna Kea Observatories on the island of Hawaii, United States. It came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in October 2017 at a distance of . Its existence was first released in February 2018, and the observations and orbit were announced on 27 April 2018. It belongs to the most distant resonant objects known to exist.  Description  Orbital diagram of is one of two known resonant trans-Neptunian objects that stay in a distant 1:9 resonance with the ice giant Neptune. The other object is which was announced on 20 February 2018.Orbit Fit and Astrometric record for 07TC434 They are currently the most distant resonant objects known with a secure resonant classification, and their detection allowed to estimate a 1:9-resonant population of 11 thousand objects with similar orbits and similar size. It is thought that both objects originated from the scattered disc before they became locked into a mean-motion resonance with Neptune. Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, the object measures 100 kilometers in diameter, for an absolute magnitude of 8.2, and an assumed albedo of 0.09, which is a typical figure seen among the diverse populations of distant objects. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 44.1‚Äì222 AU once every 1536 years (semi-major axis of 133.1 AU). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.67 and an inclination of 38¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. As of 2018, this minor planet has not been numbered.

Life  Ramiro Artieda's first victim was his brother, Luis. He killed him in the early 1920s when he became the sole heir of his family's fortune and property, and was able to offer his fiance√© a higher standard of living.Amanda Howard, Martin Smith: River of Blood: Serial Killers and Their Victims. Universal Publishers, 2004, , S. 27\\\\. Although he was suspected to be responsible, it could not be proven at first. His fiance√© left him because of that. Then Artieda emigrated to the United States and became an actor. At the end of the decade he returned to Bolivia and killed seven young women in Cochabamba, Oruro and La Paz until the end of 1938. All victims were 18 years old at the time of their death and were similar to his former fiance√©. He lured, ambushed and strangled them. He changed jobs often, once working as a college professor or a sales representative, and even a monk. After a young woman escaped on May 9, 1939, Artieda was arrested at his home in Cochabamba, which he had rented under the name Alberto Gonz√°lez. He made a full eight-page confession, was found guilty in all cases, sentenced to death, and executed on July 3, 1939, in the courtyard of the Cochabamba prison by a firing squad.

It is found in the United States., and is one of two species of Ctenidae occurring in Florida. Little is known about the biology of this species. Description The body length (excluding legs) of a male is , and for females . The leg span may be as long as . The abdomen is a yellow-gray except for a pale median band consisting of a series of connected triangles edged by brown. The dorsal surface of the legs are dark like the carapace, but the underside of the legs and sternum are much paler, almost yellow. They prefer mesic habitats, and are most commonly seen in the springtime, presumably as they are searching for mates as the weather warms. Generally, C. Captiosus can be found in both oak and pine trees, leaf litter, and caves. Ctenus captiosus has also appeared in large numbers in summer in pond pine and sand pine scrub, and in the fall in flatwoods. Toxicology A study conducted by researchers at Lewis & Clark College on a single female C. Captiosus found that it carried a total venom protein of 604.25. It has been reported that a bite from this species is described as a needle-like puncture with subsequent swelling about the site, nausea, dizziness, and flulike symptoms that persist for several days. Another case implicated a cause of a necrotic bite, although evidence was circumstantial and an assay of the venom did not find Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase D. While there have been reports of bites being harmful to humans, there is no substantial research or evidence that supports this.

It lies near the foot of a long valley drained by the Opuatia Stream.  Geology  The lake is a peat lake, probably formed after Taupo pumice blocked the drainage of the valley about 1,800 years ago, when it swept down the Waikato.  History  The lake was in an area occupied by NgƒÅti Karewa and NgƒÅti Tipa. Despite their loyalty to the Crown during the Invasion of the Waikato, their land was also confiscated in 1863. were later returned to some members of NgƒÅti Tipa, though disputes about ownership continued until 1921. As part of a policy of opening up land for settlement under the deferred payment scheme, the Government built a bridleway from Churchill, a settlement which then stood on the west bank of the river about west of Rangiriri. By 1881, of the route to the south of the lake had been opened as far as Glen Murray. By 1883 a through track from the Waikato River to the West Coast was in existence. In 1894 a wide road was recommended. Flax was a local industry for a while. After survey pegs had been pulled up, when the Counties Act 1886 was invoked to build Opuatia Rd on MƒÅori land, the police, with armed support, arrested 10 men and 8 women in 1894, two of whom were sentenced to two months hard labour. The government bought in 1895. Roads in the valley were being metalled in the 1920s. = Schools = Schools used to exist at Churchill, just to the east of the lake, at Orton, to the north, and on Otuiti Rd at Opuatia. Opuatia school was open from 1917 (starting with 20 pupils) to 1973 and is now a community centre. A telephone was connected in 1919. There was also a church in the 1850s.  Wildlife  = Aquatic vegetation = The lake has not been surveyed since 1993, when four species of submerged plants were identified, including fennel leaved pondweed. Potamogeton crispus and P.pectinatus, with occasional charophytes Nitella hookeri and Chara corallina. = Fish = Longfin eels have been recorded at the lake. = Riparian vegetation = The lake is in of wetland, of which is peat bog, and the remainder swamp and fen dominated by willow and manuka, with areas of rare restiad bog The understorey has indigenous sedges, Nertera scapanioides, Microtis unifolia, and ferns (matua-rarauhe and kiokio), with raupo at the edges. Weeds include gorse, reed sweet grass and reed canary grass, swamp alder, yellow flag iris, beggarticks and royal fern. Possum and red deer are among the animal pests. Threatened species include orchids and carnivorous bladderworts. = Birds = Canada goose, fernbirds, yellowhammer, chaffinch, riroriro, swallow, pheasant, pukeko, mallard, harrier and shag have all been recorded in the area. The lake has been a venue for duck shooters since at least 1921. = Restoration = In 2000 Regional Council agreed to mitigate the effect of flood protection works near Mercer by restoring Opuatia Wetland and flooding more frequently. Gorse and willow were sprayed with herbicide and cabbage trees, karamu, manuka, mingimingi, poataniwha, Coprosma rhamnoides, pokaka, flax, Astelia grandis, gahnia, Coprosma tenuicaulis, kahikatea and matai were planted from 2006. A further 10,000 plants have since gone in to reduce nutrients flowing from farmland to wetland.  Opuatia Stream  Glen Murray landing in 1905 There is no surface link between the lake and the stream, which flows nearby, and the lake and bog are generally fed by rainwater, except during unusually high floods, when water backs up from the Waikato. The stream rises near Ponganui Road, about up from the lake. A water quality monitoring site, about from the headwaters, has water classified as in the worst 25% for like sites in respect of bacteria, clarity and nitrogen. Planting, fencing and goat control have been done in the upper catchment to improve the water quality. The stream was navigable for about to Glen Murray landing, built about 1895, where Opuatia had a post office in 1911.

He is Professor Emeritus of Plant Sciences at the University of Sydney and Adjunct Professor at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). Much of Larkum's research has been on marine algae, seagrasses and coral reef. He has done considerable research on photoinhibition, UV inhibition, photosynthesis and light harvesting. Since 1997, a great part of his research has been devoted to understanding the process of mass coral bleaching, more specifically the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. Some of his research has also studied novel cyanobacteria, such as Acaryochloris. He has discovered a number of new taxa in the seagrass genus Halophila. One of these is the species of Halophila from One Tree Island on the Great Barrier Reef. He has written eight books and over 250 articles.  Biography and work  After completing a BSc (Special) degree from Imperial College in 1961, he conducted biochemical research with Henrik Lundeg√•rdh at the University of Upsala, Sweden for 1 year. Then he continued his postgraduate research at Oxford University where he received his D.Phil in 1966 for a thesis concerned with the processes of ion uptake in plant roots. During his post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Cambridge, he was in the laboratory of Enid MacRobbie and studied the ionic status of chloroplasts. He investigated the role of compatible solutes in energy transduction in chloroplasts and wrote the paper Ionic Relations of Chloroplasts in Vivo published in Nature, showing that chloroplasts have much higher salt concentrations than the surrounding cytoplasm and that this difference is involved in energy transduction. At this time, he was also involved in developing early applications of underwater (SCUBA) techniques to plant physiology, particularly the ways in which algae harvest energy in situ. In 1968, he joined the University of Pennsylvania for a postdoctoral fellowship on energy transduction in chloroplasts. In 1969, he moved to Sydney and joined University of Sydney as a lecturer in Plant Physiology, becoming Associate Professor of Biology in 1982 and Professor in 1994. Under the aegis of Australian Academy of Science, he organized the first Fenner Environment Conference on Ultraviolent B Radiation Impacts in Canberra. The conference also set up a working party for which he was the chair to set guidelines for a proposal to International Geophysical Biological Program for work on UV-B impacts. At the same time he was appointed to the Biology Committee of the Australian Research Council; later becoming the chairman. From 1996 until 2000, he was the Deputy of School of School of Biological Sciences and also served as the Director of Sydney University Biological Informatics and Technology Centre (SUBIT) from 2000 to 2004. In 2001, he became professorial fellow and later, in 2003, Professor Emeritus at the University. In 2009, he joined University of Technology as an adjunct professor, where he now works in the C3 Global Change Cluster. Larkum is a member of Australian Marine Sciences Association, Australian Society of Phycology and Aquatic Botany, International Photosynthesis Society and International Coral Reef Society. He has served on the editorial boards of Aquatic Botany, Marine Biology and Oceanography, Phycologia and Trends in Plant Science. Currently he serves on the Boards of Frontiers in Marine Biology and the Royal Society Interface. He holds the Australian marathon record for 50 and over of 2 h 32m 36s in Sydney.  Molecular and cellular work  = Photophysiology= In 1965, Larkum developed an interest in studying algae and seagrasses. He went on to write several papers in this area, including a paper about the ecophysiology of algae and their pigmentation. He also conducted research on the photoinhibition and UV inhibition of algae. In the early 1990s, he studied the role of UV-B radiation in inhibiting growth in algae by inhibiting photosynthesis. This inhibition was shown to affect mainly the photosystem 2 apparatus of photosynthesis. In the mid 1990s, Larkum turned his focus towards photoinhibition and UV inhibition of algae on coral reefs. In collaboration with colleagues from the Research School of Biological Sciences at the Australian National University, he initiated a study, which for the first time detailed the problem and outlined the various types of photoinhibition and protective measures available to the more common algae of coral reefs. Since 1997, Larkum's photophyioslogical work has been applied to understanding the phenomenon of mass coral bleaching. = Light-harvesting = In 1967, Larkum developed the first modern interpretation of the distribution of algae in relation to their pigmentation. His early work was concerned with the giant- celled red alga, Griffithsia, resulting in several significant papers. Later work has broadened to include a range of phytoplankton algae, of various groups, and to Prochloron. In addition to the major discoveries involving Prochloron, Larkum discovered four other cyanobacterial symbionts in certain deep-water sponges. In this area, Larkum wrote the 1983 book, Light Harvesting Systems in Algae, published as a second edition update in 1996. = Marine physiology and ecophysiology = Larkum's early work in this area was concerned with pioneering the use of SCUBA techniques to the field of algal ecology and physiology, in particularly to the theory of chromatic adaptation in algae. Later work considered the growth and productivity of kelps, sublittoral algal and seagrass communities on New South Wales coast, photosynthesis, productivity and nutrient relations of coral reef algae, and calcification in Halimeda, including the formulation of a new mechanism for calcification.  Ecological and environmental work  = Seagrasses = Larkum started work on seagrasses in 1972, when the research in this area was still in its infancy. He pioneered many new approaches including measurement of photosynthesis in a plant with a lacunal gas system, photorespiration, quantifying primary productivity from leaf growth, use of aerial photography in estimating seagrass cover, and the effects of pollutants on seagrass growth. He also did considerable work in studying the historical changes in Botany Bay. Larkum contributed four chapters to the 1989 book The Biology of Seagrasses and became the first editor of Seagrasses, Biology, Ecology and Conservation published in 2003. = Coral reef studies = Larkum's early work on the productivity and nutrient relations of reef pioneered studies on turf algae and showed that turf algae are the primary source of food for herbivorous fish of coral reefs. This work has had a profound effect on how scientists, and especially trophodynamicists, view the ecology of coral reefs. Later this work was extended to consider the sources of nitrogen for coral reefs, including nitrogen fixation. This work in the 80s was the spring-board for a significant project: ENCORE (Elevated Nutrients on a Coral Reef) which was instigated by Larkum and officers of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) in 1991. ENCORE arose out of a grant proposal by him to ARC in 1991, and subsequent discussions with GBRMPA. It has fertilising small patches of the reef at One Tree Reef with low levels of nitrogen (as ammonium) and phosphorus (as phosphate) using robots controlled by telemetry. Fertilisation started in Sept 1993 and continued until the end of 1995. Together with colleagues he published his most quoted paper, on the trigger for coral bleaching in 1998. = Taxonomic studies= Larkum has also carried out taxonomic work which resulted in 'A check list for the algae of Lizard Island', the discovery of several new deepwater species of algae on the Great Barrier Reef and 'A Key to the Green and Brown Algae of New South Wales' by Borowitzka, King and Larkum which was published by the Coastal Council of NSW in 1983. He discovered a new species and named it Halophila capricorni; type specimens came from One Tree Island on the Great Barrier Reef, but it is also found in New Guinea and New Caledonia waters.  Evolutionary and bioinformatics studies  Larkum and his colleagues have intensively investigated Prochloron, in areas of gene sequencing and molecular phylogeny. In the 1990s, he and team of scientists cloned the genes of Prochloron to understand the affinities of this alga to chloroplasts of green algae and higher plants. He conducted considerable research in the evolution of Prochloron and cyanobacteria and was also involved in phylogenetic studies of cab genes in a variety of eukaryotic algae, Pavlova lutheri, diatoms and Amphidinium.  Research on Charles Darwin  Along with his interest in Plant Sciences, Larkum was a keen student of Charles Darwin and his writings on natural selection. In 1986, while he was an associate professor at University of Sydney, he took a six month service leave to go to Cambridge and carry out research on the correspondence between Darwin and his cousin William Darwin Fox. During this research, he followed up leads to the whereabouts of the descendants of Fox and discovered his diaries and letters. For the next 25 year, he continued doing research in this area and published his work in the 2009 book, A Natural Calling: The Life Letters and Diaries of Charles Darwin and William Darwin Fox. He is now engaged on a second book on the interaction of Charles Lyell with Charles Darwin.  Bibliography  = Selected papers = *Calcification in the green alga Halimeda: III.

Avi≈æonis served as an army doctor with the Imperial Russian Army in the Russo-Japanese War and World War I. He became interested in ophthalmology and completed his PhD in 1914. He particularly focused on treating and preventing trachoma. In independent Lithuania, he taught ophthalmology from 1920 to his death, organized ophthalmology section at the University of Lithuania, opened and headed a modern eye clinic, organized professional societies for doctors. Avi≈æonis contributed to numerous Lithuanian periodicals, published separate brochures on medical and societal topics, and authored over one hundred academic articles. He attended international conferences and was elected to the board of the International Organization Against Trachoma in 1938. His main work, the 844-page guide to eye diseases, was unsurpassed for over fifty years. Biography =Early life and education= Avi≈æonis was born on in Pasvalys. His family owned about of land and had eight children (three sons and five daughters). His parents, active book smugglers who helped Jurgis Bielinis hide the books, wanted him to become a priest and sent him to a private four-year German school in Mitau (present- day Jelgava) in 1884. After the graduation, he refused to attend a priest seminary and instead continued his education at the Mitau Gymnasium which was attended by many other Lithuanian students, later prominent figures in Lithuanian politics and culture. These students organized an illegal student organization, which Avi≈æonis reorganized into the Infant Society in 1890. The society promoted the Lithuanian national consciousness and helped distribute banned Lithuanian books. Upon graduation in 1894, Avi≈æonis worked as a tutor for a year to save up money for university studies. He also received financial aid from ≈Ωiburƒólis society. He chose biology at the Saint Petersburg University. Due to strict Russification policies, as a Lithuanian and non- Eastern Orthodox, Avi≈æonis could only work in Lithuania if he became a priest, a doctor, or an attorney. Therefore, he transferred to the Dorpat University to study medicine in 1897 and graduated in 1900. In Saint Petersburg, he became active among Lithuanian students, began contributing to Lithuanian periodicals Varpas and ≈™kininkas, and helped Povilas Vi≈°inskis edit the first works of writer Julija ≈Ωymantienƒó (≈Ωemaitƒó). In 1898, he published his first booklet, a popular explanation of some basic topics in earth science. In June 1898, Avi≈æonis, Vi≈°inkis, Gabrielƒó Petkeviƒçaitƒó-Bitƒó, and her sister Marija visited Vincas Kudirka, the publisher of Varpas living in Naumiestis in Suvalkija. They also visited Tadeusz Dowgird, archaeologist and artist, Petras Kriauƒçi≈´nas, teacher and book smuggler, and Kazimieras Jaunius, priest and linguist. In August 1899, Avi≈æonis helped organizing the first Lithuanian- language theater performance, comedy America in the Bathhouse (Amerika pirtyje), in Palanga. After the performance, Liudas Vaineikis took Vi≈°inskis and Avi≈æonis to Tilsit in East Prussia, the major publishing center of the illegal Lithuanian press. On their way back, they visited Juozas Tumas- Vai≈ægantas in Kuliai and Sofija P≈°ibiliauskienƒó near Try≈°kiai. He continued to correspond with linguist Jonas Jablonskis, former teacher at Mitau, and with his encouragement wrote a small Lithuanian grammar based on the German- language writings of and on works by Kazimieras Jaunius. It was the first work that used the Lithuanian alphabet as it is used today. When the book could not be printed, Antanas Smetona and made about 100 copies using a mimeograph in 1898. This grammar was insufficient for Lithuanian needs and in summer 1900 Jablonskis and Avi≈æonis wrote a more substantial grammar, which became highly influential in creating the standard Lithuanian language. It was published in 1901 under the pen name Petras Kriau≈°aitis (Petras is Avi≈æonis' first name and Kriau≈°aitis is Jablonskis' pen name). =In Russian Empire= Upon graduation, he worked as a doctor in Ariogala. At the time, he did not specialize and treated all kinds of ailments. In 1901, he married Sofija Gruzdytƒó, who studied midwifery and massage in Dorpat, contributed to Lithuanian press, and published a translation of Tolstoy's The Restoration of Hell in 1908. She was sister-in-law of . In October 1902, he participated in a meeting of Varpas publishers and contributors in Dabikinƒó Manor. The meeting was organized by Povilas Vi≈°inskis and attended by Jonas Bili≈´nas, Kazys Grinius, Jurgis ≈†aulys, Jonas Vilei≈°is, Antanas Smetona, and others. They discussed political ideas and established the Lithuanian Democratic Party. In 1903, the couple moved to ≈Ωagarƒó where he organized a cooperative, a charitable society, and a shelter for the poor. In 1904, Avi≈æonis assisted Jonas Jablonskis in preparing for publication the second volume of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian dictionary, compiled by Antanas Ju≈°ka. During the Russo-Japanese War, he was drafted to serve as doctor in the Imperial Russian Army and was taken captive by the Japanese. In 1910, he moved to ≈†iauliai. Avi≈æonis became interested in ophthalmology after taking part in an expedition of Russian ophthalmologists to Zarasai. He continued his medical education specializing in ophthalmology by attending courses on anthropometry by Fedir Vovk, taking classes at the , and practicing at the eye clinics of professors and . He defended his PhD thesis on eye ailments in Gruzd≈æiai and Lygumai area at the Dorpat University in 1914. His thesis concluded that blindness in some 60% of cases resulted from trachoma and dedicated his efforts in eradicating the infectious disease. At the same time, Avi≈æonis continued to be active in Lithuanian cultural life. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, his political views shifted towards social democracy. Using more than 50 pen names, he contributed numerous articles, often on medical topics, to Lithuanian press, including democratic Vilniaus ≈æinios (1905‚Äì1909), Lietuvos ≈´kininkas (1905‚Äì1909), Lietuvos ≈æinios, and social democratic Darbinink≈≥ balsas (1902), Naujoji Gadynƒó (1906), Skardas (1907), and others. He also published several booklets: Socialists and Masons (1906), Alcoholism Our Curse (1907), Workers and Society (1908), Earth and Human (1910). Some of the medical articles, published in Sveikata supplement of Lietuvos ≈´kininkas, were republished as separate brochures. He was a member of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and contributed to its journal Lietuvi≈≥ tauta. He participated in the cultural Varpas Society in ≈†iauliai. The society organized music and theater performances, lectures, Lithuanian evenings, etc. At the outbreak of World War I, Avi≈æonis was again drafted to serve as doctor in the Imperial Russian Army. From December 1914 to June 1916, he worked as a senior doctor in a Red Cross sanitary train and a medical platoon. He then became director of the ophthalmology section of the Central Prison Hospital attached to the Butyrka prison and doctor at the Red Cross Hospital in Moscow. After the February Revolution in 1917, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). He attended the Lithuanian Petrograd Seimas in June 1917. =In independent Lithuania= In June 1918, Avi≈æonis returned to Lithuania taking up residence in ≈†iauliai. As a member of the Lithuanian Communist Party, he was invited by Vincas Mickeviƒçius-Kapsukas to become Commissar of Health in the short-lived Lithuanian‚ÄìByelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1919. Kapsukas also delegated Avi≈æonis to purchase textbooks for the planned university in Vilnius. This episode almost led to his arrest in 1920 when he was accused of being a Bolshevik collaborator. In independent Lithuania, Avi≈æonis focused his efforts on medicine and departed from politics. He moved to Kaunas and organized the Medical Society of Kaunas in May 1919. This and other local medical societies organized the Union of Lithuanian Doctors in 1923. Its statute was drafted by Avi≈æonis. From 1920, Avi≈æonis lectured at the Higher Courses, the predecessor of the University of Lithuania established in 1922. At the new university, he was the dean of the Faculty of Medicine (1923‚Äì1924), university prorector (1924‚Äì1925), and rector (1925‚Äì1926). He continued to teach ophthalmology and history of medicine until his death in 1939. In 1930, he established an eye clinic and organized the construction of a modern building. It was a 50-bed hospital that in 1930‚Äì1938 treated almost 5,000 inpatients and 217,000 outpatients. The clinic was merged with the Red Cross Hospital in September 1939, just a month prior to his death. Avi≈æonis was a member of the German (from 1923) and French (from 1930) Societies of Ophthalmology. He attended international conferences and was elected to the board of the International Organization Against Trachoma in 1938. In 1932, he founded the Society of Lithuanian Eye Doctors and chaired it until 1939. He published 134 academic articles on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of various eye diseases in Lithuanian (95 articles in Medicina), Latvian, German, French, contributed articles to the Lithuanian Encyclopedia, edited medical journals Medicina (Lithuanian), Archiv Oftalmologii (Russian), Ophthalmologica (German). His main work ‚Äì the 844-page guide to eye diseases ‚Äì was published posthumously in 1940. It remained the only comprehensive Lithuanian-language guide to eye diseases for over half a century. When writing in Lithuanian, Avi≈æonis had to translate or create numerous medical terms ‚Äì about 250 in total, including some fundamental terms like tinklainƒó (retina), akiduobƒó (orbit), lƒô≈°iukas (lens). He was interested in linguistics and assisted Kazimieras B≈´ga and Juozas Balƒçikonis in their efforts of compiling the Academic Dictionary of Lithuanian. Avi≈æonis died on 17 October 1939. His funeral was a large public event, attended by many dignitaries. His body was cremated and his ashes stored in a copper urn made by Petras Rim≈°a. Due to World War II, the urn remained unburied until November 1984. The ashes were buried with a public ceremony in the Petra≈°i≈´nai Cemetery.

Youth and early career Sfar's father was originally from Mahdia, where he served as ca√Ød. He was also a high-ranking officer in the army of the Bey of Tunis, and later worked in the Tunisian War Ministry. B√©chir Sfar himself was born in Tunis. He was in the first graduating class of the Coll√®ge Sadiki and then went to Paris to continue his studies at the lyc√©e Saint-Louis. In 1881, when France established a protectorate over Tunis, he interrupted his studies and returned home, and took up a government post in June of that year. In 1882 he became head of the accounting division in the office of the Grand vizier, a post he held until 1891. During these years he became involved in a number of cultural institutions, and founded the Khaldounia association. For a number of years he headed the Habous Council which was responsible for land donated by benefactors and held in trust for public benefit.Arnold H. Green, The Tunisian Ulama 1873-1915: Social Structure and Response to Ideological Currents, Brill Archive, 1978 p.111 However a series of colonial laws began allowing the French to acquire growing amounts of habous land. and in some instances Tunisians occupying or working the land were displaced. In 1898 Sfar resigned from his position on the Habous Council in protest at these enforced sales to French colonists.  Reform activities  Sfar's career in politics as an active nationalist reformer began on 2 August 1888 when he founded the newspaper El Hadhira (The Capital), managed by another member of the Khaldounia association, Ali Bouchoucha. In his articles, he called on his fellow Tunisians, some of whom were fascinated by France, to ‚Äúprevent themselves from falling into a condition of excess, where they would deny their Muslim Arab culture and lose their identity.‚Äù He believed that Tunisian national renewal could only be achieved through education, exposing young people to Islamic culture alongside the sciences, economics, history, geography and modern languages. In 1907, Sfar co-founded the Young Tunisian movement with Ali Bach Hamba and his brother Mohamed. Later in 1907 he visited Egypt, where his experiences left a strong impression on him. Like Tunisia, Egypt was a protectorate at the time (of Britain), but the differences with Tunisia were marked: the effects of modern education were everywhere to be seen in public life, while industry, agriculture and infrastructure were in the hands of Egyptians, as were most official posts. The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 in the Ottoman Empire left Sfar and his colleagues in this group increasingly isolated from the more traditional religious authorities in Tunisia who had previously welcomed his reform ideas; the orientation of the Young Tunisians was towards the Young Turks, while the ulama supported Abdul Hamid II.  Confrontation with the colonists  In his speech before the Resident General in 1906, Sfar declared: \\"The Muslim population appreciates, to the proper extent, the useful improvements and reforms accomplished by the Protectorate government. It is aware, too, of the measures the government is taking to advance charitable works and public assistance. But it‚Äôs recognition if these things would be all the stronger if, in relieving poverty, our government would seriously study the means of preventing it. Professional, commercial and agricultural education, made widely available to the native population; effective training and protection for Tunisian labour; revival of local industries by customs controls and other measures; and finally the preservation of native land rights; these, Mr. Resident General, in our humble opinion, are the many proper measures which will reduce or end the economic crisis which is bearing down on Muslim society today.‚ÄùTaoufik Ayadi, Mouvement r√©formiste et mouvements populaires √† Tunis (1906-1912), Ed. Publications de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Tunis, Tunis, 1986, This speech irked the French colonists who replied in virulent terms in their newspapers, Le Colon fran√ßais and La Tunisie fran√ßaise. However, in France, liberals supported Sfar in Le Temps, and said it was necessary to take account of the demands raised by the Young Tunisians, who were imbued with the principles of the French Revolution. Despite this support, Sfar was given the post of ca√Ød of Sousse to get him out of Tunis.Taoufik Ayadi, op. cit., On his death, the position of caid was taken by Abdeljelil Zaouche.  Family  Sfar had a son, Mustapha (born 1892) and a daughter, Fatma. Fatma's husband was Hassen Guellaty, one of the founders of the Destour party, and their granddaughter Sophia ben Romdhane married Slaheddine Caid Essebsi, brother of Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi.

Battle at Omugulugwombashe In 1966 the UN General Assembly revoked South Africa mandate to govern South West African territory and placed it under direct UN administration. South Africa refused to recognize this resolution. The group under Nankudhu had just started to build defensive structures and planned to train about 90 soldiers at Omugulugwombashe. On 26 August 1966, eight helicopters of the South African Defence Force attacked the PLAN guerrilla fighters, only 17 of which were in the camp at the time of attack. It was the first armed battle in the Namibian War of Independence. In commemoration of the day, 26 August is a public holiday in Namibia.
