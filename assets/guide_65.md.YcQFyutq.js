While pursuing a degree in commerce, Akkineni worked part-time on modelling assignments. She soon received offers for film roles, and made her acting debut in Gautham Menon's critically acclaimed Telugu romance film, Ye Maaya Chesave (2010), which fetched her the Filmfare Award for Best Debut Actress and a Nandi Award. Samantha then became the second actress ever to win both the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actress and the Filmfare Award for Best Telugu Actress in the same year, for her performances in the films Neethaane En Ponvasantham (2012) and Eega (2012). Since then, she has primarily opted to appear in the leading female role in hero-centric Telugu and Tamil films, earning box office success with films including Dookudu (2011), the family dramas Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2012) and Attarintiki Daredi (2013) and AR Murugadoss's Tamil action film, Kaththi (2014). Her work in the film A Aa (2016) also won positive reviews and won Samantha her fourth Filmfare Award, while her next films Theri (2016), 24 (2016), Mersal (2017), and Rangasthalam (2018) also were commercially successful. Alongside her acting career, Akkineni is a prominent celebrity endorser for brands and products, while she also started her own NGO, Pratyusha Support, to provide medical support for women and children in 2012. She donates her earnings from endorsements, product launches and inauguration events to support the foundation. Early life and family Samantha was born on 28 April 1987 to a Telugu father, Prabhu and a Malayali mother, Ninette from Alappuzha, Kerala. She was brought up in Pallavaram in Chennai, Tamil Nadu as the youngest child of the family to Prabhu and Ninette and two elder brothers Jonathan and David, whilst becoming fluent in the Tamil language. Despite her mixed regional background, she has cited herself as a Tamilian. As a part of her education, Samantha was schooled at Holy Angels Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School and then completed a degree in commerce at Stella Maris College, Chennai. Towards the end of her undergraduate degree she became involved in modelling, notably working with Naidu Hall, through which she was first spotted by filmmaker Ravi Varman. Samantha & Naga Chaitanya with Akkineni Nagarjuna and Venkatesh Daggubati. Career 2010: Debut and breakthrough Samantha began her professional film career with Gautham Menon's Telugu film, Ye Maaya Chesave (2010). The film, simultaneously made in Tamil as Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa (2010), created much anticipation prior to release, due primarily to the first-time-collaboration between Gautham Menon and composer A. R. Rahman. The actress successfully auditioned and was signed up for the project in mid August 2009 and worked on the film in India and the United States, while the film was released on 26 February 2010. Post-release, she revealed that Menon played a \\"crucial part in moulding her as an actress\\", teaching her how to remain natural and comfortable in front of the screen, even if she had no dialogues in a scene. In the film, Samantha played the lead character Jessie, a Malayali Saint Thomas Christian girl living in Hyderabad, with whom the male protagonist, played by Naga Chaitanya, falls in love. Upon release of the film, Samantha received very positive reviews for her portrayal, with the film itself garnering much critical acclaim. Critics at Sify praised Samantha as a \\"scene-stealer\\" and her beauty as \\"alluring\\", adding, \\"she was the girl to watch out for.\\" Jeevi from Idlebrain.com, wrote that \\"Samantha's debut is one of the best heroine debuts in Telugu cinema\\" and noted that the \\"minute expressions she gave spoke volumes about her\\", whilst labelling the film as a \\"classic\\". Ye Maaya Chesave fetched her the Filmfare Award for Best Debut Actress and a Nandi Award. Samantha appeared in a cameo role in the Tamil version of the film, portraying an assistant director who becomes an actress. Both the Telugu and the Tamil versions of the films proved to be grand successes, propelling Samantha to sign on for bigger projects. She followed up her collaborations with Gautham Menon and A. R. Rahman by appearing in the music video for the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010 promotional song, Semmozhiyaana Tamizh Mozhiyaam, which Menon directed and Rahman composed. Samantha's next release was the romantic drama, Baana Kaathadi (2010), opposite Adharvaa. The film was actually the third Tamil project signed by the actress, but its release preceded the first two that she was contracted for due to delays in their completion. Samantha portrayed a student of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), the first such role in Tamil cinema. Her next release was Ravi Varman's Moscowin Kavery (2010), originally the first film she began work on. The shooting for the film began in August 2007, with Samantha, then briefly credited with the screen name Yasodha, joining the team later in the year. In an interview held in 2008, Ravi Varman mentioned that he had decided that Samantha would be the lead actress for his film within three minutes after viewing one of her commercial assignments. He went on to describe her as an actress with \\"intelligence\\" and \\"potential\\", whilst drawing comparisons with the noted actress, Revathi. However, due to Ravi Varman's prior commitments as cinematographer in other projects, the film languished in development hell, eventually releasing in August 2010. The film earned poor reviews from critics, though Samantha's performance was credited as one of the sole highlights that the film offered. In August 2008, while still completing her last three projects, Samantha also signed up to play the lead role of a modern girl in the Narain starrer, Pookada Ravi, which was later shelved. Samantha then went on to feature in Vamsi Paidipally's Telugu film Brindaavanam (2010) in which she had a supporting role alongside NTR Jr and Kajal Aggarwal. Her performance as Indu was well received despite the role having a shorter screen time than the ones she had played in her previous films, and the film became her second successful venture in Telugu. 2011‚Äì2012: Critical acclaim 220px Samantha featured in the big budget Telugu film, Dookudu (2012) alongside Mahesh Babu, which became one of the most successful Telugu films of all time. The film won positive reviews, while a critic from The Times of India said \\"Samantha looks beautiful and has done a great job, though her role as Prashanthi isn't too lengthy.\\" She also subsequently made guest appearances in two of Gautham Menon's films, first in the psychological thriller film, Nadunisi Naaygal (2011) as a mental asylum inmate and then repeated her role from Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa in the Hindi version of the film, Ekk Deewana Tha (2012). Her popularity in Telugu films meant that Nadunisi Naaygal was dubbed and released in Telugu as Eera Gulabeelu, with Samantha featured prominently on the film's posters, despite only having a guest appearance. During the period, Samantha had also been signed on two feature in two big budget projects in Tamil, Mani Ratnam's Kadal (2013) and Shankar's I (2015) but was forced to opt out from both films, since she was suffering from a skin disease and could not work for two months during mid 2012. Samantha next featured in S. S. Rajamouli's live action Telugu-Tamil bilingual project Eega (2012), portraying a micro artist who runs a NGO and takes revenge for the murder of her lover. As the film featured a CGI-created housefly as the main character, Samantha noted that she had to use her imagination and act accordingly. She also revealed that many heavy lights were used for the shoot of the film and she subsequently suffered skin burns, calling the process \\"very stressful\\" but \\"satisfying\\". Titled Naan Ee (2012) in Tamil, the film opened to highly positive reviews and Samantha also won acclaim for her performance. A critic from The Hindu noted \\"Samantha blooms in the role given to her,\\" while Jeevi of Idlebrain.com wrote her \\"run of success continues as she did extremely well as a bereaved lover\\". Sify.com also praised her performance in the film, citing her \\"subtle expressions of love, fear and anxiety work well for the film\\" and that she \\"looks beautiful and has done her role with consummate ease\\". The film went on to become a large commercial success, grossing more than 1.25 billion, and went on to be dubbed in several foreign and Indian languages. Samantha then worked on Gautham Menon's trilingual romantic drama film, and played the leading female role of Nithya in the Tamil, Telugu and Hindi versions of the film, shooting scenes simultaneously back-to-back with three different actors. The Tamil version, Neethane En Ponvasantham (2012) featured her alongside Jiiva, while Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu (2012) paired her opposite Nani. A further Hindi version titled Assi Nabbe Poorey Sau with Aditya Roy Kapoor was simultaneously shot with the other two films and was \\"sixty percent\\" completed, before Menon shelved the venture after his other Hindi film, Ekk Deewana Tha, had failed at the box office. The film spanned three periods in the life of a couple, focusing on their romantic relationship at school, college and in their late twenties. Samantha revealed that she knew Gautham would want to work with her again and immediately accepted the opportunity to portray the roles when she was offered the film. She felt that she \\"could relate to the attributes and the circumstances the character goes through\\" and described Nithya's character as \\"close to her\\". To make her performance as authentic as possible, Samantha chose to dub for herself in the Tamil version of the film. The Tamil and Telugu versions of the film opened in December 2012, earning differing reactions. Neethane En Ponvasantham earned mixed reviews and performed averagely at the box office, though Samantha received highly positive acclaim for her portrayal. The critic from The Hindu noted she \\"comes up with possibly the best performance by a female lead in Tamil cinema this year\\" and \\"her transformation from a gawky teenager to an adult, unable to overcome her ego, is outstanding\\". Meanwhile, IBN stated \\"Samantha's transformation from a school kid to an adult is a treat to watch,\\" while Rediff.com noted she is \\"pretty, graceful, and does an excellent job of conveying the emotions of a girl in love, especially during the school sequence, while concluding she carries the film on her slender shoulders.\\" The Telugu version, Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu, won positive reviews and did well commercially, while Samantha's performance was equally well appreciated. The Hindu wrote she \\"goes a step further from her famous portrayal of Jessy (Ye Maaya Chesaave) and brings out the intricacy of her character well\\", while the Times of India wrote \\"Samantha has the author backed role and she creams it.\\" At the Filmfare Awards ceremony celebrating South Indian films of 2012, the actress subsequently won the Best Actress awards for both the Tamil and Telugu film industries for her performances in Neethane En Ponvasantham and Eega. Samantha became the second ever actress to achieve the feat after Revathi had secured both awards in 1992. 2012 became her most prolific award-winning year and she secured further recognition for Best Actress at the Vijay Awards, Santosham Film Awards and the CineMAA Awards. 2013‚Äì2015: Roles in big-budget films Although Samantha often portrayed strong character roles in her early films, post-2012, she has appeared increasingly in big-budget, hero-oriented films, which have comparatively smaller scope for actresses. Samantha next appeared in the Telugu multi-starrer film, Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu (2013) alongside Venkatesh and Mahesh Babu, which won positive reviews and was commercially successful. Though her role was comparatively minuscule to her co-stars, IBN Live noted it was \\"good to see Samantha shed her glamorous side and welcome performance-oriented roles, which she only handles with deftness and ease\\". The romantic comedy Jabardasth (2013), in which she portrayed a wedding planner, became a commercial failure, though critics noted Samantha is \\"getting better by the day and it's a delight to watch her on screen\\". Samantha then starred alongside Pawan Kalyan in the family drama, Attarintiki Daredi (2013), which emerged as the highest-grossing Telugu film upon release. A critic from Rediff.com noted Samantha \\"exudes confidence even though she has limited screen time and nothing much to do\\", and her performance saw her win Best Actress recognition at the SIIMA Awards and the Santosham Film Awards. Her final release of 2013 was in the unsuccessful Telugu masala film Ramayya Vasthavayya, where she had a small role, with a critic noting \\"we have seen Samantha in better roles and better films.\\" The year of 2014 saw Samantha appear in six films and make a return to the Tamil film industry. Her first release saw Samantha portray a dual role in the family drama film Manam (2014), where she featured alongside several members of the Akkineni film family. Featuring as a young mother and a college student in two different time eras, Samantha received positive reviews for her work, with the critic from Sify saying \\"she excels\\" and The Hindus reviewer noting that she \\"emotes well and easily shifts between the roles\\". Her performance fetched Samantha a nomination for Best Actress from the Filmfare Awards, while she won Critics' Best Actress at the SIIMA Awards. Samantha subsequently featured alongside Naga Chaitanya again in the long-delayed Autonagar Surya (2014), before playing further minuscule roles in the Telugu action masala films Alludu Seenu (2014) and Rabhasa (2014). Critics lamented that she \\"signed to be a glam doll\\" for the ventures and has \\"previously shown us she is capable of doing much more, but of late, seems to be stuck with doing similar roles that require her to be an attractive prop\\". Samantha later revealed that she solely worked on Alludu Seenu as a favour to producer Bellamkonda Suresh, who had helped her delay the making of Jabardasth during her health problems. Samantha worked simultaneously on two big budget Tamil films during early 2014, working with industry-leading actors and directors. Linguswamy's gangster masala film Anjaan (2014) opposite Suriya, received negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office. Portraying a small role, critics panned her character in the film, stating Samantha \\"gamely performs the requisite crazy girl duties\\". Her other release, AR Murugadoss's action drama Kaththi (2014) opposite Vijay won predominantly positive reviews and became the most profitable Tamil film of 2014. Again, reviewers criticised her character stating \\"all she had to do in the film is smile and look pretty,\\" while The Hindu remarked she played \\"an emoticon\\" and \\"that covers her contribution to the proceedings\\". She subsequently featured in the Telugu film S/O Satyamurthy with Allu Arjun, as a part of another hero-orientated film, though critics noted she \\"enacts her part with grace\\" and that she \\"plays her role well\\". 220px She then featured in her second dual role as a part of Vijay Milton's road film, 10 Endrathukulla (2015), where she appeared alongside Vikram. Like Anjaan and Kaththi, critics lamented her role as a clumsy girl, with Sify.com stating \\"beyond a point Samantha's character is plainly annoying\\". She sported a different rural look for a particular role and her performance won mixed reviews, with a critic noting \\"Samantha doesn't make much of an impact in the film except towards the end.\\" Samantha subsequently won positive reviews for her role and performance in Velraj's Thanga Magan, where she featured opposite Dhanush. Portraying a homely role of a wife for the first time in Tamil films, the actress noted it would be the first of many such performance-orientated roles, as she looked to move away from being typecast in glamorous characters. A critic from Sify.com labelled her performance as \\"impressive\\", while DNA.com stated Samantha \\"has given a very subdued and mature performance sans drama\\". Likewise, a reviewer from Silverscreen, suggested that she \\"delivers a performance that stands head and shoulders above her work in previous films\\". 2016‚Äìpresent: Commercial success Samantha's first release of 2016 was in the Tamil romantic drama film Bangalore Naatkal, where she made a guest appearance and reprised Nithya Menen's small role from the film's Malayalam original. She then portrayed the lead female role in Atlee's Theri, and featured alongside Vijay for the second time in her career. Her performance received positive reviews, with a critic from DNA India stating \\"Samantha looks pretty as always\\" and that \\"she has done an incredible job in dubbing with a range of emotions in her numerous shades ‚Äì doctor, lover, mother ‚Äì and she shines\\". Likewise, Behindwoods.com stated that Theri \\"could be one of Samantha‚Äôs best roles; she plays a doctor and has given out a soulful performance\\". The film went on to become of the most profitable Tamil films of all time, upon release, and ended a barren spell for the actress in Tamil cinema, by becoming her first commercially successful film in Tamil cinema since Kaththi (2014). Samantha then worked for a second time with director Vikram Kumar and Suriya in the critically acclaimed, fantasy film 24. Featuring as the love interest of the film's lead character, Samantha won praise from critics for her small role in the film, with Sify.com stating that the actress \\"does well in the comedy scenes\\". The film also performed well at the box office, with The Hindu stating she was \\"at the top of the film industry\\", following her back-to-back commercial successes. Samantha also featured in three high-profile Telugu films during 2016; while Srikanth Addala's family drama Brahmotsavam opposite Mahesh Babu was a box office failure, her role in Trivikram Srinivas's romantic comedy, A Aa alongside Nithiin, won her critical and commercial acclaim. Portraying Anasuya Ramalingam, a naive girl trying to escape from the controlling behaviour of her mother, Samantha received positive reviews for her portrayal of the character. A critic from The New Indian Express noted \\"A Aa undoubtedly is Samantha‚Äôs film\\" and that \\"right from her first frame till the last, she delivers a stellar performance and shows what she can do if given ample screen time\\", adding that she was \\"a joy to watch\\". Likewise, a reviewer from The Hindu noted \\"Samantha, after a long time, gets enough screen time and scope to shine\\", stating \\"she‚Äôs vulnerable as a 23-year-old reeling in her mother‚Äôs shadow and can also play the high maintenance, stubborn girl with ease\\", while concluding \\"this is a role she can be proud of\\". Similarly Bollywoodlife.com noted her \\"earnest performance was the life and soul of the romantic comedy\\", while DNA India's critic cited that \\"Samantha and Nithiin's performances in this movie will be what people would rave about for days to come\\". The film also performed well at the box office, doing exceptionally good business for a Telugu film released in the United States. Her performance subsequently fetched her the Best Telugu Actress Award at the Filmfare Awards, her fourth such recognition. She then featured in the commercially successful action film Janatha Garage directed by Koratala Siva, with a critic noting despite \\"a limited role, she gives a nice performance\\". She then portrayed the lead female role in Atlee's Mersal, and featured alongside Vijay for the third time in her career and her performance received positive reviews and the movie became one of the highest grossing Tamil films of 2017 and was a blockbuster. Mersal went on to join the 200 crore club. In 2018, she had a successful venture with Rangasthalam which went on to be the all-time Telugu Blockbuster only behind Baahubali 2: The Conclusion and Baahubali: The Beginning. The Tamil film Irumbu Thirai in which she starred opposite Vishal and the Telugu film Mahanati were successful at the box-office and each had a run of 100 days at the box office. Her performances in Rangasthalam and Mahanati were highly praised. Mridula R from The News Minute noted her critically acclaimed film U Turn as a curiosity generating script that provides her the ultimate screen presence since the story begins with her and she finds it ends, rather that not being shaking a leg in Anjaan, Brindavanam, Kaththi, Attarintiki Daredi or being glam doll or having out of scope performances overshadowed in Dookudu, S/O Satyamurthy, Brahmotsavam, Theri and Mersal. Personal life and off- screen work Samantha suffered from an extended period of illness in 2012, which saw her having to opt out of big film projects and take a two-month break from acting. She suffered from an immunity disorder and then had a further setback after her body did not respond well to antibiotics. She began dating actor Naga Chaitanya in 2010 and the pair were engaged in a ceremony in Hyderabad during January 2017. She got married in Goa as per traditional Hindu customs on 6 October 2017 and then by Christian customs on 7 October 2017. Philanthropy Samantha has actively been involved in philanthropic activities and donates her earnings from endorsements, product launches and inauguration events to her charitable trust, Pratyusha Support, which was registered in 2012. She chose to begin the non-governmental organisation after being bed-ridden for 15 days during her documented illness in 2012, and wanted to give back to society. Samantha subsequently started the Pratyusha Support foundation to provide medical support for women and children with the help of three doctor friends, and provided the entire financial support for the programme. She held a fund raiser in August 2013 to raise awareness of her foundation, auctioning several of her personal items and memorabilia from films. A further initiative in 2014 saw the launch of a programme to fulfil the wishes of children with life-threatening diseases, with Samantha financing trips for children to fly on an aeroplane and travel to the Taj Mahal, while also organising opportunities for children to meet their favourite film actors. Samantha has also been involved in spreading awareness of haemophilia, regularly taking part in events creating awareness of the disease. Through her charitable trust, Samantha entered into an agreement in January 2015 to pay a third of the hospital bills of one infant per week who required intensive care support at Andhra Hospitals. Under the arrangement, Samantha agreed to contribute towards a third of the bills, while Andhra Hospitals would also pay a third of the bill and the remaining third would be paid by the parents. In November 2015, Samantha entered into a further agreement with Andhra Hospitals to sponsor vaccination of all infants below six months for rotaviral infections free of cost. Later in the month, the actress took part in an organ donation pledge at Madhapur. During the 2015 Chennai floods, Samantha was situated in Hyderabad for the shoot of a film, and helped mobilise the Mana Madras Kosam initiative organised by the Telugu film industry. Through the initiative, she participated in gathering relief materials at Ramanaidu Studios and appealed to the Telugu-speaking public to help gather resources to send to Chennai. She later donated 30 lakh rupees for flood relief activities to take place in Pallavaram, the suburb in which the actress grew up. Samantha stood up for the cause of Handloom people of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states by wearing them and making photoshoots for handloom made sarees and other items. Samantha to be brand Ambassador for Telangana Handlooms Samantha to start a store named Tweave along with handloom persons and a company named SVSpartnersLLP a company into handlooms. Media image and artistry Samantha Ruth Prabhu at 61st South Filmfare Awards in 2014 The success of Ye Maaya Chesave (2010) and subsequent back-to-back successes prompted Rediff.com to label her \\"the most sought after actress in the Telugu film industry\\" during 2014. Her initial choice of films depicted her as an actress who actively selects to feature in strong female roles, with Times of India noting that \\"scripts are written around the characters she portrays\\" and that she held a place in the \\"wishlist of every top actor, director and producer\\". Her inclusion in Telugu film projects were also initially considered a \\"lucky charm\\" by producers, though Samantha acknowledged that though \\"destiny\\" played a role in her career, and that there were \\"many women out there who are more beautiful and more talented\\" than she was and that she hoped her name would instead be \\"synonymous with hard work\\". Samantha also stated that she was willing to forgo her salary demands to appear in good films, revealing that she worked on Gautham Menon's films for lower rates and that she had rejected more lucrative offers to feature in S. S. Rajamouli's Eega (2012). After portraying strong characters in her first few films, Samantha chose to feature in increasingly hero-centric films in the mid 2010s. When questioned on her decision not to take up more heroine-orientated roles, Samantha lamented the lack of chances that the South Indian film industry presents for established female characters and described it as \\"simply male-dominated\\". She added that the market meant she was not going to \\"get roles similar to her characters in Ye Maaya Chesave or Eega every time\\" and accepted stories if it had \\"the potential to engage viewers\\". Talking about her glamorous role in her comeback Tamil film, Anjaan (2014), Samantha stated that she made a \\"thoughtful call\\" as \\"it was important to do these kind of films to get exposure into the market,\\" and that regrettably \\"mass films\\" were \\"where the main audience\\" was in South Indian cinema. She also added that she did not want to be \\"typecast as the girl-next-door\\" and was keen to prove critics wrong, who said that she could not fit into glamorous roles. In an interview in 2015, Samantha suggested that she was unhappy with her work during the previous year and would no longer do any more films where she would be \\"required to do five songs and the scenes leading up to the songs\\" and made a promise to herself that \\"if she was not going to get good roles\\", she would quit acting. Being able to speak both Tamil and Telugu, Samantha has often been cast in bilingual films and has juggled her commitments between the Tamil and Telugu film industries. Even though she had a brief foray into Hindi cinema with the shelved Assi Nabbe Poorey Sau, Samantha has distanced herself from working on Hindi language films stating that she has no incentive to move to Bollywood unlike actresses of North Indian origin and that audiences from South India would relate to her appearance more. Her popularity has led to the actress representing several brands on a pan-Indian scale. She has often been cast opposite the same actors more than once, featuring in two or more films with Vijay, Suriya, Dhanush, Naga Chaitanya, Jr NTR and Mahesh Babu, a feat Samantha revealed she takes \\"pride in\\". The actress has also regularly appreciated work by her contemporaries, and has in particular praised performances by Anushka Shetty and Nithya Menen. Samantha has also been involved in a few controversies, primarily as a result of voicing her opinions through Twitter. Following the release of a promotional poster for the Telugu film, 1: Nenokkadine (2014) in December 2013, Samantha criticised the depiction of actress Kriti Sanon crawling behind actor Mahesh Babu on the beach, who looks back at Kriti disapprovingly. Samantha tweeted that the poster was \\"deeply regressive\\" and stated that it was offensive by the makers to depict women like animals. The tweet received an adversely storming response from Mahesh Babu's fans, who launched a scathing attack on her online and targeted abuse at the actress. Her opinions were later backed by actor Siddharth and directors Sekhar Kammula and Nandini Reddy, who also resultantly faced similar abuse, before Mahesh Babu apologised. Through her tweets, she was also criticised for revealing actor Akhil's presence in Manam (2014) and retweeting a pirated image from her film 10 Endrathukulla (2015). Her family home in Chennai was raided in late September 2015 by income tax officials, in a planned operation targeting film actors, though the actress and her father denied making any wrongful payments. In 2017, she was appointed as the ambassador for Telangana Handlooms by the government of Telangana and currently works to promote handloom textiles in the state of Telangana.

Originally, it sat south of the city of Bergen and south of the municipality of Bergen Landdistrikt. √Örstad and the city of Bergen worked closely together from the start since both made up one large urban area. In fact, most of √Örstad had been part of the Bergen Police District since 1808.

It was founded in 1898 by several African- American businessmen. The beach was one of the most popular resort and vacation destinations in the Mid-Atlantic region for African-Americans. In addition to standard beach activities, hotels, and restaurants, Bay Shore also had an amusement park. The beach was in its prime of popularity from 1898 until 1933 when a Hurricane devastated the coast. Both \\"sides\\" of the beach, (Bay Shore & Buckroe) were respectively rebuilt, however, Bay Shore may not have been built back to its former heights, although it continued to remain popular. The beginnings of desegregation can be correlated to the decline in Bay Shore's popularity. This parallel is evident with other historically \\"black\\", \\"negro\\", or \\"colored\\" beaches around the nation such as American Beach of Florida, and Bruce Beach of Los Angeles (Manhattan Beach). Bay Shore beach ceased to exist by the early 1970s. Buckroe Beach, its white counterpart, continues to exist although its golden era ended with the upstart of Virginia Beach located in the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia. Currently, the property that was once Bay Shore Beach has been privately developed to various degrees by developers. References Citations Bibliography *\\"Black American Series: Hampton, Virginia\\".

In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The Wallenpaupack Area School District received a $1,630,663 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Gifted education The District Administration reported that 73 or 1.73% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget In 2009, the district reported employing 763 teachers and administrators with a salary range of $42,562 to $164,000. The average salary was $62.029. Teachers work 187 days per year with 180 pupil days. The teacher's work day is limited to 7 hours per day, including a 30-minute, duty-free lunch period and a daily preparation period. Teachers appointed as grade level coordinator or department chairman are paid an additional $7,032 per year in 2012. Additionally, the teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, life insurance, professional development reimbursement, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, and other benefits. The teachers union is granted 12 days per year to conduct union business without loss of pay. The base starting salary will be $45,013 in 2013. Nationwide, the average wage for high school teachers was $55,990, for middle school teachers, $54,880, and for elementary school teachers, $54,330.US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and Wages for Teachers in Pennsylvania, May 2010 In 2007, the district employed 303 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $55,884 for 180 days worked. As of 2007, Pennsylvania ranked in the top 10 states in average teacher salaries. When adjusted for cost of living Pennsylvania ranked fourth in the nation for teacher compensation.PA Delaware County Times, Teachers need to know enough is enough, April 20, 2010. Wallenpaupack Area School District administrative costs per pupil in 2008 was $675.57 per pupil. This ranked 353rd in Pennsylvania. The lowest administrative cost per pupil in Pennsylvania was $398 per pupil. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association keeps statistics on salaries of public school district employees in Pennsylvania. According to the association's report, the average salary for a superintendent, for the 2007-08 school year, was $122,165. Superintendents and administrators receive a benefit package commensurate with that offered to the district's teachers' union. In 2008, the district administration reported that per pupil spending was $13,783 which ranked 118th among Pennsylvania's 501 school districts. In 2010, Wallenpaupack's per pupil spending increased to $15,362.09 which ranked 93rd in Pennsylvania. Among the states, Pennsylvania's total per pupil revenue (including all sources) ranked 11th at $15,023 per student, in 2008-09. In 2007, the Pennsylvania per pupil total expenditures was $12,759. Reserves In 2008, the district reported a balance of $4,932,092 in an unreserved-designated fund. The unreserved-undesignated fund balance was reported as $5,145,945. In 2010, Wallenpaupack Area Administration reported $4,165,422 in the district's unreserved-undesignated fund and the unreserved- designated fund balance was $5,991,641. Pennsylvania school district reserve funds are divided into two categories ‚Äì designated and undesignated. The undesignated funds are not committed to any planned project. Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In February 2008, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the district. The findings were reported to the school board and administration. The report noted serious Ethics Act and hiring violations of a former school board member. The district is funded by a combination of: a local income tax, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. State basic education funding In 2011-12, the district received a $4,519,675, allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the School District received $117,244 in Accountability Block Grant funding. The enacted Pennsylvania state Education budget included $5,354,629,000 for the 2011-2012 Basic Education Funding appropriation. This amount is a $233,290,000 increase (4.6%) over the enacted State appropriation for 2010-2011. The highest increase in state basic education funding was awarded to Duquesne City School District, which got a 49% increase in state funding for 2011-12. In 2010, the district reported that 1,914 students received federal free or reduced-price lunches, due to the family meeting the federal poverty level.Pennsylvania Department of Education, District Allocations Report 2009, 2009-10 In the 2010-2011 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 6.94% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $4,605,932.59. Among the districts in Pike County, the highest increase went to Delaware Valley School District which got a 7.03% increase. One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where a district received at least the same amount as the year before, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district receives was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of the Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 4.16% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $4,329,535. Among the districts in Wayne County, Wallenpaupack Area School District received the highest increase. The state Basic Education Funding to the district in 2008-09 was $4,156,507.35. Ninety Pennsylvania school districts received a 2% increase. Muhlenberg School District in Berks County received a 22.31% increase in state basic education funding in 2009. The amount of increase each school district receives was set by Governor Edward Rendell and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, 1,560 district students received free or reduced-price lunches due to low family income in the 2007‚Äì2008 school year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Funding Report by LEA, 2009 Accountability Block Grants Beginning in 2004-2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010-11, the district applied for and received $318,229 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district uses the funding to provide full-day kindergarten. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Wallenpaupack Area School District applied to participate in 2006, but was denied funding by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. In 2007-08, the district received $384,360. The district received $69,568 in 2008-09, for a total funding of $453,928. In County the highest award was given to area School District. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County - $9,409,073. In 2010, Classrooms for the Future funding was curtailed statewide due to a massive state financial crisis. Federal Stimulus grant The district received an extra $1.5 million in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant Wallenpaupack Area School District officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. Common Cents state initiative Wallenpaupack Area School Board did not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education's Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. Real estate taxes Property tax rates in 2011-12 were set by the school board at 12.7792 mills in Wayne County and 63.4774 mills in Pike County. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. The school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts. *2010-11 - 12.5860 mills in Wayne County and 61.6353 mills in Pike County. *2009-10 - 12.1084 mills in Wayne County and 60.2856 mills in Pike County. *2008-09 - 12.1058 mills in Wayne County and 60.6793 mills in Pike County. *2007-08 - 10.7558 mills in Wayne County and 61.2847 mills in Pike County. Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the Wallenpaupack Area School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 3.9%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 3.4%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 4.4%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 4.1%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 2.9%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.4%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 1.7%, Base 1.7%Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2011 For the 2012-13 budget year, Wallenpaupack Area School Board applied for two exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: special education costs and pension costs. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, Wallenpaupack Area School Board applied for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index due to pension costs. Each year, Wallenpaupack Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Annual Report on Act 1 Exceptions, April 2011 Extracurriculars The district offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and PIAA eligibility requirements.Wallenpaupack Area School Board of Education, Academic Eligibility, 2011Wallenpaupack Area School Administration Parent/Student Handbook: Extracurricular Eligibility and Athletic Regulations, 2011 By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. Gun controversy In early 2018, Hyung Jin Moon, co- founder of the World Peace and Unification Sanctuary Church and Southern Poverty Law Center-labeled \\"Anti-LGBT cult leader\\", announced an upcoming church event with guns. The event, a marriage vows renewal ceremony that asked participants to bring their AR-15 rifles, was to be held on February 28 in Newfoundland, Pennsylvania. Neighbors of the church came out to protest the insensitivity of having the AR-15 rifles at the event so soon after the Parkland, Florida shooting that killed 17 people. Due to the increased gun threat caused by Moon's ceremony, the students of Wallenpaupack Area South Elementary were relocated on February 28.

Sprague de Camp, part of his Viagens Interplanetarias series. It was first published in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction in the issue for November, 1949. It first appeared in book form in the collection The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens, published in hardcover by Twayne Publishers in 1953 and in paperback by Signet Books in November, 1971. Plot summary An interplanetary conference between Viagens officials of the Tau Ceti system being held in Novorecife on the planet Krishna is interrupted by an unusual situation in customs; a Terran visitor to Krishna is attempting to take a native mummy to Earth. Abreu, the local security chief, excuses himself to investigate. The mummy, that of the first and (for complicated legal reasons) only king of the island nation of Sotasp√©, appears to be a legitimate purchase, and so is allowed through customs. Subsequently, Ferrian bad- Arjanaq, the reigning prince regent of Sotasp√©, shows up claiming the mummy was stolen and the sale fraudulent. To avoid a diplomatic incident, Abreu allows Ferrian to take the next interstellar vessel to Earth to recover the mummy. Since the relatively primitive Krishna is under an embargo to prevent its tumultuous cultures and political systems from being disrupted by advanced Terran technology, he sends along assistant security officer Herculeu Castanhoso to prevent Ferrian from enquiring into matters he shouldn't. Many years elapse on Krishna before the travelers return with the mummy, though for them, due to the relativistic speeds at which interstellar voyages take place, much less time has passed. Ferrian is sent on his way to his island. Then Abreu learns that a most peculiar ship has rendezvoused with the prince to convey him to Sotasp√©‚Äîa steamship! Realizing that somehow Sotasp√© has been acquiring forbidden technology, Abreu and Castanhoso set out in pursuit, hiring a swift smuggling ship to overtake Ferrian's craft. Catching it off the island of Darya, their crew overwhelms the prince's in a pitched sea battle, and the prince himself is seemingly lost overboard. The steamship is scuttled, and the mummy, discovered to contain smuggled scientific texts, is also destroyed. The two return to Novorecife smugly convinced that the most egregious attempt ever to break the blockade is \\"finished.\\" Meanwhile, Ferrian, who has survived, returns to his kingdom and reassumes its governance. Having been allowed to study Terran law on his trip to Earth to distract him from technological espionage, he is full of ideas for reforming Sotasp√©. He institutes a patent law to foster Krishnan invention, and is soon awarding his first patent to the inventor of a native aircraft. At the ceremony, he announces that the Terran plot to keep Krishna backward and in the dark is \\"finished.\\" Abreu, Castanhoso and Ferrian all appear as secondary characters in a number of later \\"Krishna\\" stories. Background This story was written for the \\"time travel\\" or \\"prophecy\\" issue of Astounding Science Fiction. The issue was prompted by a letter from a reader (Richard A Hoen of the University Club in Buffalo, New York) commenting on the stories in an issue, referring to the stories by author and title, and offering his respective praise and derision for those works. The magazine frequently received letters of this kind; however, in this case, the reader described an issue whose cover date was more than a year away, November, 1949. Editor John W. Campbell printed the letter in the November, 1948 issue, then set about making the predictions come true by arranging with the authors mentioned to write and submit stories with the given titles. The planet Krishna is de Camp's premier creation in the Sword and Planet genre, representing both a tribute to the Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs and an attempt to \\"get it right\\", reconstructing the concept logically, without what he regarded as Burroughs' biological and technological absurdities. As dated in The Continent Makers and Other Tales of the Viagens, the 1959 version of de Camp's essay \\"The Krishna Stories,\\" and James Cambias's GURPS Planet Krishna (a 1997 gaming guide to the Viagens series authorized by de Camp), the two segments of the action of \\"Finished\\" take place in the years 2114 and 2140 AD, respectively,De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"The Krishna Stories\\" (Essay, in New Frontiers, v. 1, no. 1, Dec. 1959, pages 3‚Äì6.) making it both the first and fifth stories set on Krishna in terms of chronology. \\"Perpetual Motion,\\" The Queen of Zamba and \\"Calories\\" take place between the two segments, and The Hand of Zei follows the second. Earlier events on Krishna are told in the form of back story in \\"The Colorful Character,\\" the main action of which, according to de Camp's essay, takes place on Earth in the year 2117 AD. The Krishnan events related in the story take place about ten years earlier, or around 2107 AD.

The text is based on a series of \\"dictations\\" which Valtorta attributed to her guardian angel, Azariah. In the book Valtorta does not provide a specific biblical reference to Azariah himself, but simply refers to him as her guardian angel. The name Azariah, from Hebrew, means the Lord's help. The book consists of a set of \\"lessons\\", provided by Azariah on Sundays, whose starting points are the 58 Masses of the Roman Missal of the Catholic Church prior to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in 1965.

We, spirits who see men > from the height of the Heavens and follow them with divine light as our > guide, view the wonderful prodigies provoked by this competition in > generosity between the soul giving itself to Him who has given Himself to it > and God, who gives Himself even more to reward the generous one giving > himself to Him. And we can truly say, in response to the questions of many > about the humanly inexplicable ascents and descents of souls, that the rise > or fall is linked to and follows from the degree of generosity with which a > soul adheres to the Lord. The first lesson in the Book of Azariah was written on February 24, 1946, and the last on March 16, 1947. The book was thus written in parallel to Valtorta's best known work The Poem of the Man God, where the first episode was written on December 18, 1943, and major writing ended on April 28, 1947, although a few sections near the end were written later, concluding on December 8, 1951. However, unlike the Poem of the Man God, where she wrote a good number of the last episodes first, the order of the lessons in the Book of Azariah is sequential with respect to the date on which they were written.

A student of the ROH Wrestling Academy, Titus has been competing for Ring of Honor (ROH), as well as various independent promotions, since 2006. While performing for ROH, he has won the World Tag Team Championship once with partner Kenny King as The All Night Express, as well as winning the now- defunct Top of the Class Trophy once. Professional wrestling career  Training  Titus began training at the ROH Wrestling Academy with Austin Aries at the age of 17, and was later trained by Bryan Danielson at the Academy. He was one of only two people in his class, the other being Mitch Franklin. Titus later said that he \\"hated training with Bryan\\" at the time, but was grateful for it later as it made him \\"a more dedicated wrestler\\". Full Impact Pro (2006‚Äì2010) Titus debuted for Full Impact Pro (FIP) in November 2006. In his first match on November 10 at All or Nothing, Titus and Alex Payne lost a tag team match to the YRR (Steve Madison and Chasyn Rance). His second match, the following day at Evening the Odds 2006, saw him and Payne win a tag team match against The Heartbreak Express by disqualification. In his next appearances, in late 2008, Titus began a feud with Grizzly Redwood, which culminated in a six-man tag team match between the team of Redwood and the Loggers, and Titus and The Heartbreak Assassins at Unstoppable 2008. Titus won the FIP Florida Heritage Championship on March 28, 2009 by defeating Chris Jones. He successfully defended the championship against Jones on May 2, and Brad Attitude on August 1 at Heatstroke '09. He lost the championship to Attitude on October 3 at Fallout 2009, after holding the championship for just over six months.

Ring of Honor   Debut and storyline with Delirious (2006‚Äì2008)  Titus debuted for Ring of Honor (ROH) in 2006, and competed in dark matches for the company for several months, wrestling against people including Chad Collyer, Ernie Osiris, and Bobby Dempsey. His first match on the main card for ROH was at Glory By Honor V Night 1 on September 15, when he teamed with Pelle Primeau in a loss to The Ring Crew Express. Most of Titus' matches in ROH up until 2008 were dark matches, with the only exception being at Caged Rage on August 24, 2007 when he lost to Jimmy Jacobs. Titus went on to win the ROH Top of the Class Trophy from Ernie Osiris in a dark match at the Respect is Earned II pay-per-view on June 7, 2008. Titus was the last holder of the Trophy, as ROH stopped recognizing it as an official championship in October 2008. In mid-2008, Titus began a feud with Delirious over female wrestler Daizee Haze. Both men attempted to get a date with Haze, and Titus began training with Delirious and Haze. Shortly afterwards, Titus claimed to have had sex with Haze and to have recorded it on his mobile phone. This led to a series of matches with Delirious, with Delirious coming out as the winner. He later had Haze's face airbrushed onto his wrestling tights. At Age of Insanity on August 15, Delirious joined The Age of the Fall faction, and defeated Titus after the referee stopped the match. His feud with Delirious came to an end at the Rising Above pay-per-view, when Delirious defeated him in a grudge match. Titus later said that this feud was the favorite of his career. His storyline with Haze came to an end at Southern Hostility on December 6, when Haze confronted Titus about his claims, and she and the Necro Butcher forced Titus to admit that he had been lying, and that he was, in storyline, a virgin.  The All-Night Express and S.C.U.M. (2009‚Äì2013) In early 2009, Titus began teaming with Kenny King as the All-Night Express. In March 2009, Titus and King formed an alliance with Austin Aries, interfering in his matches and attacking wrestlers on his behalf. On December 18 at Final Battle 2010 the All Night Express defeated Adam Cole and Kyle O'Reilly, announcing their intention of becoming ROH World Tag Team Champions in 2011. On February 26, 2011, at 9th Anniversary Show, Titus and King failed in their first attempt to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship, when they were defeated by The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli). The All-Night Express: Kenny King (left) and Titus (right) in 2011. During the program with the Kings of Wrestling, Titus and King showed signs of a face turn and finalized their turn on March 19 at Manhattan Mayhem IV, after defeating the Briscoe Brothers (Jay and Mark). On April 6, Ring of Honor announced that Titus had signed a new contract with the promotion. On September 17 at Death Before Dishonor IX, the All Night Express defeated the Briscoe Brothers in a ladder match to become the number one contenders to the ROH World Tag Team Championship. On June 24 at Best in the World 2012: Hostage Crisis, Titus and King defeated Wrestling's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship for the first time. On July 10, 2012, Titus was officially stripped of the ROH World Tag Team Championship from The All Night Express due to the departure of Kenny King, ending their reign at 16 days. Titus then attempted to regain the title by entering a tournament with rival Charlie Haas. The team made it all the way to the finals, before losing to S.C.U.M. (Jimmy Jacobs and Steve Corino) on September 15 at Death Before Dishonor X: State of Emergency. On September 22, Titus unsuccessfully challenged Kevin Steen for the ROH World Championship. On March 2, 2013, at the 11th Anniversary Show, Titus, Cliff Compton, Jimmy Rave and Matt Hardy, revealed themselves as the newest members of S.C.U.M. by attacking numerous members of the ROH roster following the main event, joining Kevin Steen, Jimmy Jacobs, Rhino and Steve Corino as members of the group. On June 23, S.C.U.M. was forced to disband, after being defeated by Team ROH in a Steel Cage Warfare match.  The Romantic Touch and The Cabinet/The Rebellion (2013‚Äì2017)  Titus as The Romantic Touch in January 2014 Titus returned to ROH on October 26, 2013, working under a mask and the ring name \\"The Romantic Touch\\", defeating Will Ferarra in a dark match prior to Glory By Honor XII. On September 18, 2015, Titus dropped the Romantic Touch persona, reuniting with the returning Kenny King as The All Night Express to defeat the Briscoe Brothers in a tag team match at All Star Extravaganza VII. Titus teamed with Caprice Coleman and Kenny King to form the Cabinet. The Cabinet defeated Jason Kincaid, Leon St. Giovanni and Shaheem Ali in the first round of the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. The Cabinet was defeated by ACH, Jay White and Kushida. The Cabinet was originally portrayed as something not be taken seriously, but in late 2016, the trio turned serious and renamed themselves \\"The Rebellion\\", eventually also adding Shane Taylor as a member. The Rebellion remained together until June 2017, when they were defeated by Search and Destroy in a match, where the losing team had to disband.  The Dawgs and gimmick change (2017‚Äìpresent)  Following the dissolution of the Rebellion, Titus formed a new tag team named \\"The Dawgs\\" with Will Ferrara in late 2017. By early 2019, Titus and Ferrara quietly split up their team. Titus then started a new gimmick reminiscent of Rick Rude and Lex Luger, showing off his body by constantly flexing.https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes- celebrities/news/10-best-pro-wrestlers-not-signed-wwe He also Makes Appearances on GTS Wrestling on the YouTube channel sillysuperpop and is currently the YouTube Wrestling Figures Champion.

A rugby pitch at the school is now named after him.DHS 140th anniversary rugby festival During World War II, Van Heerden served in North Africa, where he was taken prisoner along with another well known Natal University College alumnus, Durban High School schoolmaster and rugby coach, Bill Payn. He returned to teaching after the War. Coaching Natal He would frequently turn up to training sessions with Natal straight from school, donning the glasses, tweed jacket, or conservative dark suit that he wore at school. This was one of his many foibles, which endeared some people to him, and alienated others. He was a big, burly man, with a humorous, witty manner, a sharp temper, and a repertoire of ripe language which he used freely in both the classroom and on the rugby field. He looked every bit the rugby player. Amongst the South African players who passed through his hands were Tommy Bedford, Keith Oxlee, Trix Truter and Snowy Suter. But Van Heerden's success with Natal was only a foretaste of what was to come. Van Heerden and Argentina If Van Heerden was an unsung genius in his homeland, it was Argentina that gave him the chance to flourish, and show exactly what he was capable of. He was invited to Buenos Aires to help the Pumas prepare for their first visit to South Africa in 1965. Despite Argentina faring badly in this tour, it was the start of a long and happy relationship between Van Heerden and the Pumas. Izak van Heerden gave up his teaching post in Durban, relocated to Argentina, learnt Spanish fluently, and would revolutionise Argentine play in the late 1960s, laying the way open for great players such as Hugo Porta. Van Heerden virtually invented the \\"tight loose\\" form of play, an area in which the Argentines would come to excel, and which would become a hallmark of their playing style. The Pumas repaid the initial debt, by beating the Junior Springboks at Ellis Park, and emerged as one of the better modern rugby nations, thanks largely to the talents of this Durban schoolmaster. Van Heerden's fame grew elsewhere as a result, particularly in the British Isles, where reports filtered through about the rugby \\"guru\\" with the golden touch. Somehow his growing reputation worked against him in South Africa, and other than one series against the British and Irish Lions in 1962, in which the Lions were comprehensively outplayed (losing 3‚Äì0), Van Heerden's massive input was not required. After his coaching career, he went back to teach at Durban High School, where he was eventually promoted to vice-principal. He died suddenly in his office at the school in 1973. Legacy Kitch Christie, who coached the Springboks for the 1995 Rugby World Cup, was quoted as saying Izak van Heerden \\"was truly light years ahead of the rest.\\" Christie openly acknowledged Izak van Heerden's influence on him, and to using his thinking as a blueprint for his own team, saying \\"Most of what you hear the modern coaches saying, and the phrases they use, were first coined by Izak.\\" Van Heerden's masterpiece, Thinking Rugby, has become a coaching Bible around the world. Several of the strategies he devised during his rise to prominence, when he masterminded Natal's victory over Australia in 1953, have become parts of the modern high-speed, high-intensity game. Richard Bath describes him as \\"the thinking man's coach.\\" He also wrote Tactical and Attacking Rugby (1967). Van Heerden's greatest legacy, perhaps, was to turn the Pumas into a truly respected national side. Despite the ups-and-downs of the Argentine side, Van Heerden's team are considered a benchmark of what the Pumas are capable of achieving. Argentina was already the rugby power in South America when Izak van Heerden came along, but he propelled them into a completely different orbit from their neighbours in Chile, Uruguay and elsewhere.

The origins of the poem can be traced to Southey's schoolboy days when he suffered from insomnia, along with his memories of a dark and mysterious schoolmate that later formed the basis for one of the poem's villains. The poem was started in 1802 following the publication of Southey's epic Thalaba the Destroyer. After giving up on the poem for a few years, he returned to it after prompting by the poet Walter Savage Landor encouraged him to complete his work. When it was finally published, it sold more copies than his previous works. The poem is divided into twelve \\"books\\". Its first half describes how the evil priest Kehama is able to gain significant amounts of demonic power in a quest to become a god. This is interrupted when his son Arvalan is killed after attempting to have his way with Kailyal, a peasant girl. After the death of his son, Kehama begins to wage war upon Yamen, the god of death, and curses Ladurlad, his son's killer. However, the curse allows Ladurlad the ability to become a hero of significant strength, and he uses that power to work with the Hindu gods in a quest to defeat Kehama and ensure the safety of Kailyal. Eventually, Ladurlad is able to defeat Kehama and is freed from his curse. Although the poem describes Hindu myth it is heavily influenced by Zoroastrian theology, and the ideal of a dualistic moral system. Part of Southey's focus on India stems from the recent British colonial expansion into India and the increasing interest by British citizens in Indian culture. Critics gave the work mixed reviews; many praised the quality of the poem's language, but others felt that the plot or choice of subject matter was lacking. Background The basis for Southey wishing to write an epic poem came from his private reading of literature while attending Westminster School as a boy.Spech 2006 p. 17 It is possible that Southey, during this time, had problems sleeping and that an inability to sleep served as inspiration for the topic of Kehama. Additionally, a boy Southey met while at school, who looked like a fiend according to Southey's account, served as a prototype for the dark and mysterious character Arvalan.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 16 By 1802, Southey spent his time writing the poem along with other projects following the publication of Thalaba the Destroyer. This continued into 1806, when the epic was worked on alongside other works, such as a translation of El Cid and a history of Portugal.Spech 2006 p. 96, 116 It was not until 1808 that Southey attempted to finish Kehama, which came after him almost abandoning poetry because of the reception of Thalaba and Madoc. In particular, fellow poet Landor encouraged Southey to complete the epic along with writing the work Roderick the Last of the Goths. This effort continued through 1808, and he was able to complete 3,000 lines of the poem. However, he was interrupted in his work at the end of the year by an illness that plagued his family and kept him away from writing for two months. In March 1809, Walter Scott requested Southey to send him some excerpts from the work. Southey complied and the lines were sent for Scott's collection, English Minstrelsy. The poem was finished by 1810 and,Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 95 by 1811, Kehama was selling more copies than Thalaba sold.Spech 2006 pp. 126, 130‚Äì131, 143 Poem The poem is twelve books with the first six dealing with various episodes along with introducing Hindu theology. The story describes Kehama, a Brahmin priest, as he makes sacrifices to Shiva to gain power. His scheme is to conquer death and attain Amreeta to become a god himself. Arvalan, Kehama's son, attempts to take Kailyal, a peasant girl. He is stopped by Ladurlad, another peasant, and killed. Kehama decides to war against Yamen, the god of death, while also seeking to torture Ladurlad in revenge. Ladurlad is cursed to be separated from nature and unable to live a human life, which included not being able to sleep. His separation from nature gives him the ability to do what others cannot however.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 99‚Äì100 After this event, Arvalan turns into a demon. Kailyal, while trying to escape from Kehama's wrath, is pushed into a river and was about to drown before Ladurlad comes and saves her. Although he is a hero, Ladurlad cannot bear to be near her, which allows for Arvalan to pursue after Kailyal as she escapes to the temple of Pollear. When she gets there, she is almost poisoned by a poisonous manchineel tree. Before this happens, a gandharvas, or good spirit, named Ereenia takes Kailyal to Casyapa, Father of the Hindu gods. With the help of the Tree of Life at Casyapa's mountain, she is able to be healed. However, Kailyal is sent back because Casyapa is worried about Kehama's power. Kailyal is sent to the land of Indra for safety. While there, she is united with her father and Ladurlad, and they are told of how Vishnu saved humanity by assuming a human form. During this time, Kailyal grows close to Ereenia and they fall in love with each other.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 100‚Äì101 Arvalan turns to Lorrinite, a witch, who is able to find out the location of Ladurlad and Kailyal. After being armed with the witches magic weapons, Arvalan travels to Kailyal's location. He is prevented from reaching the place. However, Kehama completes a ritual at the same time that grants him power and the ability to invade the Hindu first heaven, and Ladurlad and Kailyal flee. They start a new life until a group of individuals kidnap Kailyal to marry her off to the god Juggernaut. During a ritual involving the sacrifice of worshippers, Arvalan possesses various priests who attempt have their way with Kailyal. Ereenia tries to save her, but he is stopped by Lorrinite and taken away. Left with no options, Kailyal attempts suicide by burning herself in a fire. She is rescued by Ladurlad who, because of the curse, is immune to fire.Bernhardt- Kabisch 1977 pp. 101‚Äì102 Ladurlad and Kailyal travel in search of Ereenia and end up in the underwater city of Mahabalipur. Ladurlad goes down into the city and enters into the palace of Baly, the ruler of the city who was a demon that attempted to do the same thing that Kehama is trying to do: overthrow the gods. Ladurlad comes to the Chamber of the Kings of old where he finds Ereenia. After battling against a naga, he is able to rescue Ereenia. By the time they return to Kailyal, they are attacked by Arvalan's servants. Baly appears, as he is allowed to do so once a year, and uses his powers to condemn Arvalan's army to damnation. Kehama, wanting Kailyal for himself, tries to bargain with her and offer to remove Ladurlad's curse. After refusing, Kailyal is given leprosy.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 102‚Äì103 Ereenia sets out to wake up Shiva at Mount Calasay. When he gets there, he rings the Silver Bell and the mountain turns into light followed by a message telling Ereenia to talk to Yamen. Ereenia returns to Kailyal and Ladurlad, and the three travel to the world of the dead, Padalon. They are brought to the city Yamenpur and are able to meet Yamen. After talking to Yamen, they are told to wait, but Kehama attacks Padalon. Kehama defeats Yamen and tries to convince Kailyal to join him. After being rejected again, Kehama attains the Amreeta and becomes immortal. However, the Amreeta gives Kehama an immortality of torment, which reflects Kehama's soul. Shiva comes down and restores Yamen to power. Shiva allows Kailyal to drink the Amreeta, which allows her to become a divine being that can be with Ereenia. Ladurlad is given the ability to die and the poem ends with him entering the paradise Yedillian to be with the other dead.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 103‚Äì104 Themes Southey was intrigued by the Zend Avesta and in Zoroastrianism. In particular, the aspects of a dualistic moral system along with a focus on death appealed to the poet. He wanted to create a poem based in the ideas and dealing with a Persian prince, but he was unable to write the poem. Instead, he incorporated aspects of it, including how evil allows for the shaping of good, to enter into Kehama. Other theological aspects involved the Hindu pantheon to have an epic with gods that both behind the scenes and directly within the story of the epic. The evil discussed in the poem had a contemporary and political model. It paralleled Southey's belief that Napoleon was becoming an Antichrist figure who would set up a reverse millennium.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 83, 98‚Äì99 The poem's focus on Hinduism became an important topic to Southey because of the British colonial interest in India. He was advised by William Taylor that focusing on India would allow for the work to become popular as the Empire became greater. The poem also marks the shift in view of the \\"exotic\\" from China to India and the appeal the religion started to hold. This transition was furthered by the translations of William Jones of Sanskrit along with possible connections between Hinduism and other theological traditions including Christianity. Southey knew of various translations and read Shakuntala (from the Mahabharata) and the Bhagavad Gita, which helped to form a basis for his knowledge of India. His rationalism kept Southey from accepting many of the beliefs he considered superstitious. Instead he wished to hide what he thought were deformities, to promote his own view.Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 97‚Äì98 Critical reception In a poem on Southey, Landor praised his friend, \\"In Thalaba, Kehama and Roderick the most inventive Poet/ In lighter compositions the most diversified.\\"Spech 2006 qtd. p. 256 An anonymous review in the February 1811 Monthly Mirror claimed \\"The plot is ... powerfully spirit- stirring, but not interesting ... because it is utterly impossible for the feelings to travel with the persons of a drama so constituted as the present ... It seems Mr. Southey labours under a great disadvantage, through the choice of his machinery.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. pp. 132‚Äì133 It continued, \\"Having given this opinion, we are now free to confess that the poet's art is, in the terrific, prodigiously displayed throughout, and we have no doubt that if Mr. Southey's love of eccentricity had not overcome his better taste, he would have chosen such a machinery, and so conducted his story, as not only to have agitated the nerves, but to have come home to heart, and rested there. Being what it is, however, we pronounce it a splendid specimen of a daring poetical imagination, fed and supported by vast sources of knowledge and observation.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 133 This was followed by an anonymous review in the March 1811 The Critical Review that argued: \\"The Curse of Kehama is a performance of precisely this violent and imposing description. Like the shield of Atlante, it strikes dead everything that is opposed to it; one might as well hold a farthering candle to the sun, as to think of placing Homer, or Shakspeare, or Milton or Dante, by the side of it. But it is the false blaze of enchantment, not the steady radiance of truth and nature; and if you gain courage to look at it a second or third time, the magic has lost its power, and you only wonder what it was that dazzled you.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 135 The review continued, \\"we think there is quite enough to discover to us how great a poet Mr. Southey might be, were the single gift of judgment to be added to the qualities which he undoubtedly possesses. Till then, we fear that we shall never be able to subscribe to the belief in a Trinity of living poets, of whom Mr. S. is represented as entitled to the foremost honours.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. p. 137 John Foster wrote a review for the April 1811 Eclectic Review which said, \\"We must repeat then, in the first place, our censure of the adoption or creation of so absurd a fable\\" and \\"The next chief point of censure would be, that this absurdity is also paganism; but this has been noticed so pointedly and repeatedly in our analysis, that a very few words here will suffice.\\"Madden 1972 qtd. pp. 138, 142 In an analysis of other aspects, Foster argued, \\"The general diction of the work is admirably strong, and various, and free; and, in going through it, we have repeatedly exulted in the capabilities of the English language. The author seems to have in a great measure grown out of that affected simplicity of expression, of which he has generally been accused. The versification, as to measure and rhyme, is a complete defiance of all rule, and all example ... This is objectionable, chiefly, as it allows the poet to riot away in a wild wantonness of amplification\\".Madden 1972 qtd. p. 145 An anonymous review in the June 1811 Literary Panorama stated, \\"If we were desired to name a poet whose command of language enables him to express in the most suitable and energetic terms the images which agitate his mind, we should name Mr. Southey; if we were requested to point out a poem which to freedom of manner in the construction of its stanzas, united a condensation of phrase, with a happy collocation of words, thereby producing force, we should recommend Kehama\\".Madden 1972 qtd. p. 146 Ernest Bernhardt-Kabish, in 1977, claimed that \\"The Curse of Kehama is a striking poem\\" and that the poem was \\"better constructed than the preceding ones\\".Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 pp. 98, 100 However, he argued that the poem's ending was \\"too crass in its situation and too facile in its resolution to succeed fully even as a moral allegory.\\"Bernhardt-Kabisch 1977 p. 104 Sir Granville Bantock, who made a symphonic poem out of Southey's Thalaba, planned to do a symphonic poem based on The Curse of Kehama, but only completed two orchestral scenes.Processional: Orchestral Scene No. 1 from \\"The Curse of Kehama\\" (1894) Notes References * Bernhardt-Kabisch, Ernest.

It is a remake of the original 1989 version. Adaptation Loosely adapted from Alan Clarke's 1989 classic TV film for Screen Two, Nick Love's film is set earlier in the 1980s; around 1984. It retells a similar story to the original, but it is told from a different character's point of view. The protagonist of this adaptation is Dom, who was a minor character in the original. Dom is a young wannabe football casual who gets drawn into the charismatic but dangerous world of the firm's top boy, Bex Bissell. A 'firm' being the name used by groups of smartly dressed hooligans, under the pretense of being supporters of a particular team, who arrange organised violence on match days with rival 'firms'. Plot Bex is the leader of the West Ham United football firm, that travels up and down the country to fight other firms. Dom is a normal young lad who hangs around with his mates, and one night they go to a nightclub, where his friend Tel walks into Bex. After the two share words, Bex headbutts Tel in the face. The morning after, Tel tells Dom that Bex is after them. The two then go to the local pub, the Lord Nelson, where the firm hangs out. There, Dom apologises for the two of them. Bex compliments Dom's courage, saying that he has a lot of guts to walk in and face him. Dom later finds out where Bex works and goes to visit him. They become acquaintances, visiting a sports shop where Bex purchases a pair of Adidas Munchen trainers. He then asks Dom if he wants to play in his football team. Dom accepts. Dom asks his Dad for money to buy the same pair of trainers. Dom arrives late at the football game and is put in goal. After he saves a vital penalty, the rest of the boys begin to take a liking to him, especially Jay, who asks if he is coming to Portsmouth at the weekend. Dom agrees. Trigger, the firm's second-in-command, visits Bex at work, where he tells him that Millwall's firm and Portsmouth's firm are meeting to discuss the up-and-coming matches between the three teams. Bex walks in on the meeting to pitch his idea of the three firms coming together to form a national firm for the UEFA European Football Championship. The pitch fails, with Millwall and Portsmouth's top boys refusing to stand behind Bex in the national firm unless he and his firm can beat theirs in the upcoming meets. Saturday comes and the firm are at the station getting a train to Portsmouth. When they get there they meet the Portsmouth firm at the pub. Police arrive and try to break up the two teams. During the brawl, Dom is punched in the face but stays on his feet and punches back. Bex visits Dom at work and tells him to not make any plans for the weekend. Dom sees Tel who criticises his tracksuit, but Dom tells him that he is part of the West Ham firm now. Dom later meets Jay, and the two go to the sports shop and steal a load of gear. Some of the firm go to Bex's house to talk about the possible national firm. Bex asks Dom if he would like to go to Europe, and Dom agrees. Bex says he has to get blooded first, which means he has to get the firm's symbol engraved on his forearm. Bex pulls out a Stanley knife and starts to engrave on Dom's arm. When the rest of the firm lick their hands and rub off the symbol that is on their arms he realises that it is a joke. Dom goes to the Lord Nelson to meet up with the boys. Soon after arriving, he is harshly ridiculed in front of everyone by a drunken Trigger for wearing the same tracksuit as Bex. Feeling forlorn, Dom leaves the pub and doesn't go the game. Bex then visits him at work the next day and tells him to stand up for himself, and invites him to a night club. Dom also gets invited to Crystal Palace on the weekend, but the firm end up going to Millwall to launch a surprise attack on the Millwall firm instead. Millwall fights back with weapons and largely outnumbers them. As a result, the surprise attack fails and they suffer a humiliating defeat. Bex, along with Dom and some other members of the West Ham firm, go back later and ambush a Millwall fan as he leaves the pub, beating him half to death with lead pipes. They return home only to find that their cars have been smashed up. A calling card has been placed on Bex's car saying \\"Congratulations, you have just met the Yeti\\" (the Yeti is a nickname for the Millwall firm leader). Some of the firm express that they are not happy with Bex's reckless leadership in refusing to back down over the feud with the Yeti, and are ultimately forced by Bex to leave the firm. When Bex brings a bag full of blunt weapons to the Lord Nelson in preparation for a revenge attack on the Yeti and his firm, Dom expresses his concerns as well. Bex reacts angrily, bullying and threatening Dom and telling him that he has no choice but to stay with the firm. They go from the Lord Nelson to London Bridge station and ambush the rival firm. Dom looks on as Bex overpowers the Yeti and kicks him savagely in the head and body repeatedly as he lies on the floor. As Bex walks away, the Yeti pulls a flick knife out of his sock and stabs Bex in the stomach. Off-screen, Bex eventually succumbs to the wound. That night, the police are seen arriving at Bex's house. His wife answers the door angrily with the baby in her arms. From the police's silence, she knows Bex has been killed and tearfully goes into denial. In the epilogue, Dom puts on the red tracksuit that Bex told him to never wear again, and heads to the Lord Nelson one last time.

The organization works to increase the power of British Columbians over government decision-making. They were instrumental in the fight against Enbridge's Northern Gateway pipeline, introducing a tanker moratorium on B.C.'s north coast and the province's campaign finance reform. The organization currently works to stop Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain tanker and pipeline expansion in B.C., ban U.S. thermal coal exports through B.C. ports and restore accountability and transparency to the province's democracy by calling for a Corruption Inquiry. History Conceived in autumn 1998 at a meeting of First Nations, environmentalists, community advocates, and labour leaders, Dogwood Initiative began operating in 1999.https://dogwoodinitiative.org/about/history/ At first campaigns focused on logging. Dogwood campaigners worked to stop the privatization of nearly 300,000 acres of public land on Vancouver Island.https://thetyee.ca/News/2008/01/14/TreeFarmDeal/ They convinced the government to redistribute 10 per cent of MacMillan Bloedel‚Äôs logging tenures to First Nations and local communities.http://www.wcel.org/sites/default/files/publications/The%20MacMillan%20Bloedel%20Settlement%20Agreement%20-%20Submissions%20to%20Mr.%20David%20Perry%2010%20June%201999.pdf They helped limit raw log exports, launched the British Columbia Community Forest Associationhttps://bccfa.ca/ and used the Softwood Lumber dispute to reallocate 20 per cent of logging tenures across B.C.http://www.fnforestrycouncil.ca/downloads/first_nations_forest_tenures.pdf As oil and gas began to replace logging as the government‚Äôs top priority, Dogwood began to adapt. Beginning in 2001, the Liberal government in Victoria began to fast-track fossil fuels, starting with coalbed methane.https://thetyee.ca/News/2006/11/14/CBM/ By blowing apart coal seams, companies like Royal Dutch Shell planned to release vast reserves of methane gas held in place by groundwater. Dogwood worked with activists and First Nations in Telkwa, Cache Creek, Smithers, Princeton, Fernie, Iskut, Dease Lake, and throughout the Peace Region, and were able to shut down commercial coalbed methane everywhere in B.C. Dogwood‚Äôs early support for Tahltan opposition to Shell‚Äôs massive coalbed methane plan in the Sacred Headwaters led to a high-profile victory when Shell pulled out for good in 2012.https://huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/18/shell-british- columbia_n_2323919.html To date Dogwood is best known for their No Tankers campaign, aimed at stopping the expansion of oil tankers off British Columbia‚Äôs coast. What began as a small, focused campaign against Enbridge's Northern Gateway with northern First Nations grew into a political juggernaut that arguably contributed to the Harper government‚Äôs 2015 defeat, after the pro-tanker Conservative party lost more votes in B.C. than in the rest of the country combined. New Prime Minister Justin Trudeau cancelled the Northern Gateway pipeline and Liberal MP Joyce Murray introduced legislation for a tanker ban in the north coast of B.C. However, Prime Minister Trudeau broke his promise to British Columbians and approved Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Dogwood continues to work against the Texas-based pipeline company. Dogwood also runs 'get out the vote' campaigns for elections in the province of B.C. In 2017, Dogwood volunteers worked across B.C. to raise awareness about their issues and increase voter turnout.  Current campaigns  No Tankers Dogwood is actively working against Texas-based Kinder Morgan's pipeline and tanker expansion project. The project is expected to increase the tanker traffic on the B.C.'s coast seven-fold and actively violates the rights of First Nations and the will of local communities. Beyond Coal Dogwood is working to ban U.S. thermal coal exports in B.C. ports. Dogwood is calling for adequate health and environmental assessments and a levy on coal exports akin to the carbon tax Canadian companies must pay. In 2017, Premier Christy Clark joined the call for the levy on U.S. thermal coal coming through B.C. ports. Ban Big Money Dogwood was instrumental in the campaign for campaign finance reform in B.C. politics. The organization researched and released breaking stories, including how much Kinder Morgan donated to the governing BC Liberal party in advance of their approval of the company's project, tracking the donations from government contractors and donations from an American trophy hunter Super PAC. In November 2017, the provincial government passed laws to reform campaign finance, banning corporation, union and out-of-province donations and limiting individual contributions to $1,200. Criticism Researchers and pundits affiliated with the fossil fuel industry have criticized Dogwood http://www.ethicaloil.org/news/dogwood-doesnt-care-about- the-national-interest-just-its-own/ for accepting donations from US-based funders and charities, such as the Tides Foundation.http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/vivian-krause-new-u-s- funding-for-the-war-on-canadian-oil In an interview with journalist Markham Hislop, political scientist Keith Brownsey at Mount Royal University said such claims are \\"bordering on conspiracy theory\\".http://theamericanenergynews.com/markham-on-energy/krause-aom  References   External links  * Category:Environmental organizations based in Canada Category:Organizations based in Victoria, British Columbia Category:Non-profit organizations based in British Columbia ","title":"Dogwood Initiative"},{"id":"24461333","text":"Universal Core (or UCore) was a U.S. government project to facilitate sharing of intelligence and related digital content across U.S. government systems. In a memorandum signed on 28 March 2013, the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) announced that DoD will adopt the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) as the basis for its data exchange strategy in coordination with the NIEM Program Management Office (PMO). This DoD transition to NIEM will incorporate the ongoing efforts of DoD Universal Core (UCore) and Command and Control (C2) Core, effectively ending new development on these DoD data exchange models. The information in this article is provided for reference and background information only. History Universal Core is an XML-based information exchange specification and implementation profile which provides a framework for sharing the most commonly used data concepts of Who, What, When, and Where. The purpose of UCore is to improve information sharing by defining and exchanging a small number of important, universally understandable concepts between data-sharing communities, without requiring complex mediations. The specification is modeled with an extensible XML schema, a taxonomy of high- level entities and events to categorize the concept of What, and supporting documentation and extension strategies. The final released version is v3.0. A key objective in creating UCore was to keep it simple, easy to explain, and easy to implement. UCore supports the National Information Sharing Strategy,United States Intelligence Community Information Sharing Strategy, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 22 February 2008. Retrieved 24 September 2009. a post-9/11 initiative. UCore is designed to permit \\"definable levels of interoperability\\" across user communities. To facilitate adoption, UCore looks to Communities of Interest, or knowledge domains, to encourage adoption of common vocabularies. UCore is not expected to replace complex data sharing within highly developed domains. UCore traces its roots to several predecessor initiatives: * Department of Defense Directive 8320.1, which proposed a very large data model for all DoD systems.DoD Directive 8320.1 \\"DoD Data Administration,\\" 26 September 1991, Retrieved 24 September 2009. * Department of Defense Directive 8320.02 proposed to implement interoperability around communities of interest, and found success within those communities.DoD Directive 8320.02 \\"Data Sharing in a Net-Centric Department of Defense,\\" 2 December 2004.

The Defense Information Systems Agency was the Technical Agent for UCore, working on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO) to create and support UCore 3.0.  UCore 3.0  UCore Version 3.0 was released on 14 April 2012 and contains modifications approved by the UCore Council and enacted by the UCore Technical Working Group. In this release, UCore is a set of reusable data components (RDCs) for the four interrogatives, an entity-to-entity relationship model, and supporting metadata types. These RDCs can be the foundational building blocks of a custom Community of Interest (COI) vocabulary or information exchange specification. Developers who reuse the designated UCore types are expected to gain a minimum level of understandability and interoperability. UCore 3.0 also defines a message format for Situational Awareness (SA) messages, which report upon the time and location of entities and events, often with a focus on mapping or recording location history. An instance of this SA message format will contain components which reuse the RDCs; however, a COI can still construct message payloads with the RDCs without making use of the SA message format. In October 2012, the Department of Defense elected to move towards adopting National Information Exchange Model (NIEM).\\"DoD adopts NIEM, will no longer support UCore development\\", October 27, 2012 This decision was formalized in a signed memorandum on 28 March 2013. The released versions of UCore are expected to remain in place for as long as programs continue to use them, and may also support platforms that are somehow incompatible with NIEM. Standards Used In addition to XML, UCore incorporated the following specifications and standards: * Department of Defense Discovery Metadata Specification (DDMS). Existing DDMS global components are used to model some concepts in UCore. * Intelligence Community Information Security Markings (IC ISM). These are used to identify the security level for data elements in documents and web services. * Geographical Markup Language (GML) is an Open Geospatial Consortium XML grammar used to represent geospatial information. GML was adopted as ISO standard 19136:2007. * Universal Lexical Exchange (ULEX) ULEX is a message framework originated by the Department of Justice which defines the message structure of a UCore message, including such concepts as a Digest, StructuredPayload, and RenderingInstructions. It was employed in UCore 2.0 but removed in UCore 3.0. * W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL) Web ontology language is a widely used ontology standard endorsed by the World Wide Web Consortium. It is used to model the taxonomy of entities and events. * United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Recommendation 20. Recommendation 20 is a standard for describing units of measure.

It is located 10 miles from Narasaraopet city and 30 miles south west of Guntur City.  History  Celebrated with great devotion and fervor every year with a large number of devotees thronging the place, Kotappakonda has an interesting history and some incredible facts associated with it. # Trikuta Hills: Kotappa Konda hill appears with 3 peaks in any direction so it's also called as Trikutadri, Trikuta Parvatham. The three hills are Brahma hill, Vishnu hill and Rudra hill. These 3 hills can be distinctly seen from a distance from any direction. # Brahma Shikharam: The main temple Trikoteswara Swamy Temple is located here. # Rudra Shikharam: Old Kotayya temple is located here. This is the first place where Trikoteswara Swamy existed, seeing the great devotion of Devotee Gollabhama, Trikoteswara Swamy came to Brahma Shikharam. Hence it is called Paatha (old) Kotayya Temple. # Vishnu Shikharam: Lord Paapanaseswara Temple is here. It is believed that Lord Vishnu did penance for Lord Shiva. There is also a holy pond \\"Paapanasa Teertha\\" here. Sundudu, a cattleman, with his wife Kundiri used to live towards the south of the Trikuta hills. They became rich soon after the birth of their first child, a beautiful daughter, Anandavalli(Gollabhama). Slowly she became a great devotee of Lord Shiva and started spending most of her time offering prayers to Lord Shiva at the Old Koteswara Temple located on Rudra hill. Eventually, she lost all interest in her materialistic life and started penance for Sri Koteswara Swamy. She used to visit Rudra hill every day, even during the scorching summer, to offer prayers to the Lord. Pleased with her penance, Jangama Devara appeared before her. Sympathized by her penance, Jangama Devara blessed her to be a pregnant, though she was a spinster. Unmindful of her pregnancy she carried her daily prayers as usual. Stupefied at her deep devotion, he again appeared and told her that she need not take so many troubles to perform pujas and offer prayers, and promised her that he himself would come to her house where she could do her penance and commanded her to proceed towards her home, and that he would follow her, but advised her not to look back even once on her way to home, in spite of whatever happens. From Rudra hill, Anandavalli proceeded towards her home and after reaching Brahma hill, she lost her patience and turned back. The moment she turned back, breaking the promise she made, Lord Jangama Devara immediately stopped where he was, at Brahma hills and entered into a cave on that hill and turned himself into a Lingam. This sacred placed is famous by the name New Koteswara Temple. She then realized that her pregnancy was the creation of him, to test her devotion towards him. She felt happy as she got through all the critical trails and became one in the God.  Culture  Vedas are recognized as the oral heritage by the UNESCO and are taught at Veda Patasala in the village, established by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams.

The village of Monzie; (pronounced Mon ee) is a couple of miles to the east-northeast. Name Castle Cluggy on the Dry Isle within the Loch The place was originally named Muithauard c.1200, Moneward 1203. Two different etymologies are given for the name. In the first it is asserted that the name is derived from the Gaelic magh + bard; \\"Plain of the bards\\". (Locals pronounce it as Mon ee vaird). Under this view, the name of the nearby village of Monzie is unrelated except to render the pronunciation of the first syllable \\"Monz\\" as \\"Mon\\" in linguistic sympathy. In the second etymology, Monzievaird comes from magh \\"plain\\" plus edha' the genitive case of edh (iodh) \\"corn\\" plus the Saxon vaird or \\"ward\\" meaning \\"enclosure\\", rendering the total as \\"place where corn is stored\\". Under this view the village name of Monzie has the same origin as does the name of the nearby castle, Monzie Castle., United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Regardless of origin it gave its name to the nearby Loch Monzievaird. Administration Traditionally, Monzievaird was within the Stewardship of Strathearn and it had its own parish church. It was under the control of the Murrays of Tullibardine from the 13th century. Following the Act of Union, it was placed in the county of Perthshire. In 1890 it was placed within the civil parish of Monzievaird and Strowan.Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 In 1930 the civil parish system was replaced and Monzievaird was put in the Highland District of Perthshire. From 1975 to 1996 it was part of the Perthshire Kinross District in the Tayside region. In 1996 it came under the new county of Perth and Kinross. Architecture Loch Monzievaird overlooked by Ochtertyre House Ochtertyre House, the Murray family seat in Perthshire between 1784 and 1790 is located here, overlooking the Loch from an elevated position. Its grounds are a designed landscape. The house is a Georgian Category A listed building. It is now a private house, but in its time it has operated as a school (Seymour Lodge 1939-1965), a theatre, and a restaurant. The mausoleum of the Murrays, built in 1809, now stands where the parish church used to be. Economy The local Glenturret Distillery is the source of The Famous Grouse Whisky History Carn Chainichin. King Kenneth's Cairn The Battle of Monzievaird On 25 March 1005 Malcolm II of Scotland fought and killed the father-and-son rulers of Scotland, Kenneth III of Scotland and his son Giric II of Scotland, a Mormaer. The site of the battle is on the north side of the loch. King Kenneth's Cairn was built in memory of the son of King Duff, who was killed in the battle of Monzievaird that year and buried on Iona. It stands in a prominent position on the edge of the steep escarpment of Corrie Barvick. The Massacre of Monzievaird Immediately following the Battle of Knock Mary on 21 October 1490, the Drummonds and Campbells set fire to the old church of Monzievaird; some twenty Murrays were killed.When the foundations of the present mausoleum were being dug a quantity of charred wood was found, and very many calcined bones James IV of Scotland, on news of the massacre, gave orders for the arrest of the main perpetrators, David Drummond and Duncan Campbell of Dunstaffnage. They were executed at Stirling shortly thereafter. The nation was horrified and this event was considered at the time to have been sacrilegious. New York state The town of Cornwall in the state of New York originated from a colony of twenty-five Scottish families who settled around the mouth of the Moodna Creek, led by the soldier Major Patrick McGregor and his brother-in-law, David Toiseach, the laird of Monzievaird, in 1685.Skeel, Adelaide, and Barclay, David, (1900), Major Patrick MacGregorie.Ruttenber, Edw.

Since 1965 he has worked in the field of public broadcasting as a producer, host, station manager, engineer, teacher, writer and consultant. His first show at listener-supported radio station WBAI in New York was influential in developing the free-form radio style of the 1960s and 1970s. Early life Josephson grew up in Los Angeles, attended Alexander Hamilton High School. He once claimed his high school major was \\"existential calisthenics.\\" He attended the University of California at Berkeley where he received a BA in Linguistics with a minor in Mathematics, which took him 6 years over 16. He was a systems analyst and programmer with IBM from 1962 to 1964; designed OS/360 Job Control Language. WBAI Unhappy with his lonely life as an engineer in a cubicle at IBM, he volunteered at WBAI ‚Äì a listener-supported radio station in New York City. By 1966 he was the host of In the Beginning, the \\"grumpy\\" morning program. His unique mix of phone calls, politics, alternative culture, cranky humor, interviews, personal confessions and music while he sipped coffee and ate bagels led him to become one of the station's most popular personalities. His morning shows, like those of late night's Bob Fass and Steve Post, became the archetypes of the station's free-form style, which became the precursor to much of the alternative FM radio programming which started in the 1960s and 1970s. Audience members would wake up to whatever caught Josephson's fancy each day. For example, after the release of The Beatles' \\"Lady Madonna\\" in March 1968, Josephson liked the song so much that he played it over and over for two hours. He also once played a marathon session of every recording of \\"Celeste Aida\\" ever made, taking up two days. Josephson became the Assistant Manager of WBAI, and oversaw the design and construction of the station when it moved to a new location in 1971. He was the General Manager of the station from 1974 until 1976. In the beginning continued until 1972. Another of Josephson's shows Bourgeois Liberation ran on WBAI from 1979 to 1984. Bob & Ray Josephson worked to revive the careers of Bob & Ray. He developed and produced 26 half-hour public radio shows called Classic Bob & Ray which surveyed their entire career. He also developed and produced The Bob and Ray Public Radio Show from 1981 until 1986. This show was broadcast on 250 stations and received several awards including a Peabody award. The show, was later nominated for three Grammy Awards after it was released on cassettes. In 1984 Josephson produced Bob & Ray: A Night of Two Stars at Carnegie Hall in New York City. Both performances were sold out, and an audio cassette produced from the performance was nominated for a Grammy. Teaching, seminars, consulting and writing Josephson taught radio production at NYU and The New School. With funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts, he co-produced the Airlie Seminars on the Art of Radio four times between 1977 and 1983. He is also the editor of Telling the Story, NPR's Guide to Journalism. published in 1981. He has also served as a consultant to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Public Radio, the Carnegie Commission on the Future of Public Broadcasting, NTIA and individual public radio stations.

After surviving World War I, he would become a pioneering airline captain, flying 500,000 miles between 1928 and 1935. He would return to the Italian Air Force as a major in 1935, rising to tenente- colonnello by 1939. His participation in World War II is unknown. Early life and service Alessandro Resch was born in Avezzano, Kingdom of Italy on 19 November 1892.Franks et al 1997, p. 156. He was the son of a businessman. He was interested in cycling as a youth. When he was conscripted, he went into a cyclist battalion of Bersaglieri. He was promoted to caporale and became a truck driver carrying messages to the front. After a promotion to sergente, Resch requested and received pilot's training as an officer cadet. On 9 June 1916, Resch evacuated a wounded officer in his truck during the fighting for Monfalcone.Varialle 2009, pp. 85-86. He received his first and second pilot's licenses on Voisins, on 16 June and 1 July 1916. Aerial service On 8 July 1916, he joined 26a Squadriglia. On 15 August, he was on a bombing mission to Reifenberg Railway Station when his Voisin came under attack over Komen. Resch's observer, Sottotenente Lioy, emptied two magazines of machine gun fire at one of two enemy Fokker E.IIIs as they closed in on a stern assault. Resch dove on the second Fokker while Lioy emptied two more magazines. One Fokker's wing came off. The other one retreated. The Italian crew returned to base with 30 bullet holes in their Voisin. Unknown to them, both Fokkers had crashed; the Austro-Hungarians believed they had been lost in a midair collision. The Italians, in a rare bit of under-claiming, filed for a single victory. On 22 August, Resch was nicked by a shell splinter. Shortly afterwards, he received a Silver award of the Medal for Military Valor. In May 1917, he reported for training as a fighter pilot. He qualified as a Nieuport pilot, then further qualified to fly the Savoia-Pomilio SP.2 in September. He was commissioned and assigned to 70a Squadriglia in October, though he did not report for duty until 12 December 1917. When German airplanes attacked Istrana, Resch tried to launch to counter them, but his airplane was hit while he taxied on the runway and he had to abort the attempt. On 17 April 1918, he used a Hanriot HD.1 to share in a triple night victory over Valdobbiadene. Just five days later, the fuel tank in Hanriot HD.I No. 6252 ruptured while Resch was flying it. Drenched in fuel, the Italian pilot could only shut down the engine and try for the nearest airfield. His dead stick landing of his winged Molotov cocktail was foiled by unfavorable wind, and he capsized upon setting down short of the runway. No fire resulted. On 12 July 1918, Resch repeatedly fired into an Albatros D.III, which fell in a flutter emitting puffs of smoke. Alessandro Resch was officially an ace, two years after his first victory. Although that was Resch's last credited victory, he served through war's end. When the Armistice came, he had earned a Bronze Medal for Military Valor and two War Merit Crosses to add to his prior Silver Medal for Military Valor. The postwar committee that evaluated aerial victories sent Resch a letter confirming his five victories, though it enumerated only four. Post World War I career Resch transferred to 91a Squadriglia on 10 January 1919. At some point, he left the military, but returned to service in 1927. However, he went to work for Avio Linee Italian Airlines as chief pilot and captain on 1 September 1928. He flew half a million miles over the next 7 years. In 1935, he returned once more to military service, this time as a maggiore. By 1939, he had risen to tenente-colonnello. Further details are unknown, except that Alessandro Resch died in Avezzano on 8 January 1966.http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/italy/resch.php Retrieved on 29 May 2010.

(PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-06-23.  Life and work  Babi Badalov was born as Babakhan Badalov in Lerik, a small town near the Iranian border in the Talysh region of Azerbaijan, to an Azeri father and a Talysh mother. After serving two years in the Soviet Army, he moved to Leningrad (St. Petersburg) in 1980, where he quickly became a leading underground artist and a member of the unofficial artists group The Association of Experimental Visual Art (TEII). [2] Badalov participated in numerous art shows with the group in Russia and abroad. In the late 1980s, he met artists Vadim Ovchinnikov and Timur Novikov, members of the New Artists Group, and became involved in a variety of their projects and art campaigns. Badalov always found different ways of expressing his ideas through art objects, paintings, installations and live performances. He also tested himself on the movie set of avant-garde Russian film director Evgeniy Kondratiev. (2008-07-18). Retrieved on 2011-06-23. In addition to his visual explorations, Badalov experiments with words and writes obscure poetry, mixing the languages and mentalities of different cultures. Even though Russian is not his first language,Azerbaijani language and native Talysh language he won the Pushkinskaya 10 poetry contest. In 1990, Badalov mysteriously disappeared from the St. Petersburg art scene and became a legendary figure, and an inspiration and a role model for younger generations of Russian artists. Today, Badalov continues to exhibit around the world and develop his new ideas. His latest concept was a series of ecological art objects called Dolls for Adults, where he isolated the plastic of nature inside his own clothes. He is also working on a number of visual projects dedicated to linguistic explorations, questioning how a person can become the victim of a language barrier, trying to untangle the confusion of the Cyrillic/Latin mix.

Early life and education  Kelman was born in 1923 in Vienna to Rabbi Zvi Yehuda Kelman, the scion of a line of Hasidic rabbis originally from Poland. He moved with his family to Toronto, Ontario, Canada as a child. His mother took on the responsibilities of leading the Jewish community after the death of his father when Kelman was a 13-year-old. His mother's assumption of the leadership role was one of the factors that led Kelman to \\"believe women could function as rabbis\\". He served with the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II.Goldman, Ari L. \\"Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, 66, Leader In Judaism's Conservative Branch\\", The New York Times, June 27, 1990. Accessed September 9, 2020.  Leadership in Conservative Judaism  Upon the completion of his military service, Kelman attended the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he received his rabbinic ordination. Eschewing a congregation and a pulpit, and at the prompting of Dr. Louis Finkelstein and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, he accepted a post at the Rabbinical Assembly in 1951. There he helped professionalize the Conservative rabbinate, adding educational retreats and ensuring that rabbis received compensation and benefits commensurate with their role. In the nearly four decades before his retirement in 1989, the number of Conservative rabbis quadrupled from 300 to 1,200 during a period when the Conservative movement grew together with the rise of suburban Jewish communities. Kelman joined his mentor Rabbi Heschel during the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Throughout his career, Kelman sought to build better connections between the branches of Judaism in the United States and between its Christians and Jews, as well as improving ties to the Jews of Israel. He did advance work with Rabbi Heschel preparing him for his 1964 meeting with Pope Paul VI in Vatican City. He fought against increasing intermarriage, receiving publicity for his outspoken criticism on religious grounds of the popular television show, Bridget Loves Bernie, which showcased a happily married Jewish man and Catholic woman. He called the show \\"an insult to some of the most sacred values of both the Jewish and Catholic religions.\\"\\"Jewish Groups Score New TV Show for Intermarriage Theme\\", The Jewish Daily Forward, October 24, 1972. Accessed September 9, 2020. In addition to his duties with the Conservative Assembly, Kelman was the head of the U.S. division of the World Jewish Congress starting in 1986.  Death  A resident of Manhattan with an apartment on West End Avenue, Kelman died of melanoma at age 66 at the New York University Medical Center on June 26, 1990.

His parents spoke Samoan at home growing up. He was an All-American Quarterback at Vista High School, where he and his teammates won not only the C.I.F. San Diego section championship, but also the state championship. He attracted interest from several college programs including the University of Nebraska and the University of Colorado. Aunese's final high school transcript and his low ACT scores caused him to fall under the 1983 Convention Proposal No. 48, commonly referred to as Proposition 48. Because of this provision, he missed the freshman year of his college career. College career Aunese chose Colorado after heavy recruiting from assistant coach Les Miles and head coach Bill McCartney.All in the family: Miles coaches son of late QB recruit Because of the Prop 48 conditions, Aunese missed his first year of eligibility with the team in 1986.

Teammates told him he looked sluggish on the field and family members wished he would be taken out of the game. In the months following the bowl game, Aunese experienced a multitude of symptoms, including coughing consistently, a loss of appetite, and vomiting blood, which caused him to miss many workouts and drills. Aunese was examined in March 1989 and doctors diagnosed him with a rare form of inoperable stomach cancer. He was given six months to live after his initial diagnosis.

Early years Croft was born at the St Pancras Workhouse in Somers Town, London, and baptized there on 5 June 1861. He was raised in an orphanage after his father, a musician, died in around 1871. He worked as a municipal road sweeper from around 1876, employed by St Pancras vestry and later St Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council until the 1920s. Suits of Fame Croft started to wear his pearly suit to raise money for charity in the late 1870s. The origin of the pearly tradition is obscure. Croft began to decorate his clothes with mother- of-pearl buttons, which were mass-produced at factories in the East End of London. The inspiration for this form of decoration is a matter of debate. It may have been inspired by the clothes of costermongers (street vendors of fruit and vegetables) in Somers Town: some sources mention a common practice of adding decorative metal buttons to their plain clothes, others indicate that it was unknown. Croft himself was never a costermonger. Alternatively, the costume may also have been inspired by coster singers - such as Hyram Travers who performed as the \\"Pearly King\\"‚Äô - or the stage clothes of other music hall entertainers. By 1880, Croft was wearing a \\"smother\\" suit completely covered with thousands of white buttons. He later created more sparsely decorated \\"skeleton\\" suits. He is thought to have made at least seven suits to wear himself, two of which he left in his will. He also made pearly clothes - suits, hats, belts, and ties - for others. The suit would have drawn attention to Croft when he participated in charitable pageants and carnivals to raise money for local hospitals, an important source of funding before the National Health Service. Croft wore his pearly suit to raise funds for the London Temperance Hospital in the 1880, but the first surviving reference to him in a printed source is a photograph and accompanying letter in The Strand Magazine in February 1902, which describes \\"Mr F. Croft\\" as the \\"Pearlie King of Somers Town\\". The Royalty of Pearl Croft was presented to Edward VII and Queen Alexandra at the Horse of the Year Show at Olympia in 1907, and led a display by costermongers and their donkeys at the show in 1912. By 1911, all 28 of the metropolitan boroughs of London had its own pearly king, pearly queen, and pearly family, often members of the local costermonger community. The Original Pearly Kings' and Queens' Association was established that year. South of the River Thames, the pearly families were associated into a Pearly Kings' and Queens' Guild. In July 1926, he claimed publicly that he was the \\"original Pearly-King in London\\". Croft raised money for a variety of hospitals and other charities, including St Dunstan's, the Hospital Saturday Fund, and the Sons of Phoenix temperance society. He received a medal from the Lord Mayor of London for raising ¬£72 following the 1928 Thames flood. He is thought to have received around 2,000 medals and ribbons to recognise his fund-raising efforts, which were estimated to have totalled around ¬£4,000 to ¬£5,000. A Royal Funeral Statue, St Martin in the Fields Croft died from lung cancer in St Pancras workhouse, where he had been born more than 68 years earlier. He was buried at St Pancras Cemetery in East Finchley. His funeral cort√®ge stretched for approximately half a mile, with a procession that included a horse-drawn hearse, musicians, 400 pearly kings and queens, and representatives from the charities that he had supported. The event was filmed by Path√© News. (Ian Dury requested that the same hearse was to be used at his funeral in April 2000.) Croft's Family and Memory Croft had married Lily Newton on 21 February 1892, at Bedford New Town Chapel in St Pancras. He was survived by his wife and by eleven of their twelve children, his eldest son having been killed in action in the First World War. A life-sized marble statue of Croft, standing high, wearing a \\"smother\\" pearly tail-coat with top hat and cane, was commissioned in 1931 and erected at his burial site in 1934. After being vandalised several times, the statue was restored and removed to the crypt of St Martin-in-the-Fields in 2002, where the Original Pearly Kings and Queens Society has held its harvest festival since 1956. Perpetuating the family tradition, Croft's great-granddaughter later became pearly queen of Somers Town.

Kennedy's descendants owned and inhabited the house for more than a century; the state government bought the land in 1942, but Kennedys were permitted to continue living in the house. When Salt Fork State Park was being developed, the house could no longer be inhabited, and its final resident, Benjamin's great-great-grandson Don Kennedy, moved out in 1966. In 1975 it was placed on the National Register and remained in its abandoned state. The roof was damaged during a storm when a tree branch fell through the roof, but the parks crew replaced it. This started a movement to fix the house and it was named the Guernsey County Bicentennial Commission Legacy Program. Local volunteers cleaned up the area and soon transformed themselves into Friends for the Restoration of The Kennedy Stone House. Major restoration was done from 2000‚Äì2002. The organization transformed itself into the Friends of the Kennedy Stone House Salt Fork State Park and maintains the house as a museum. One of the programs the organization performs is the docent program, where retirees or history students from Muskingum College occupy a cabin above the stone house and are charged as caretakers to the property. Exterior The stone house contains a central door reached by a flight of stairs and a small porch. The porch was once covered over during the Victorian era and contained columns and a balcony. To either side of the door are two rectangular windows. The second floor contains five windows in line over the first floor windows. The gabled roof is pierced at either end by a large stone chimney. The house being only one room deep meant during the family's growth a new addition would be made. A two-story wooden-frame wing was added to the rear of the building and contained the summer kitchen and several bedrooms. This addition would not last and today's reconstruction only includes the summer kitchen. A root cellar is located to the right of the house and built of thick stone blocks. The sides of the cellar are lined with dirt and plants to allow for cooler internal temperatures. The ceiling is penetrated by two diamond-shaped holes for ventilation and light. The well is now covered over and a natural spring has been capped.

Thomas was born in Rhuthun, Denbighshire, the son of the Clerk to the Department of Education for the county. He was educated at Denbigh Grammar School, after which he worked as a bank clerk. In 1943, after two years in the bank, he joined the RAF. He served until 1946. Stationed for most of the time in the Middle East, he served one and a half years in Iraq. At the end of his service he took advantage of a scheme for demobilizing into university and studied philosophy at the University College of Wales, Bangor. His student days were marked by the onset of ankylosing spondylitis. After completing his degree, Thomas studied the British idealists for his MA, and then moved from Bangor to London where, for his PhD, he studied the political philosophy of Richard Price. His choice of subject had been influenced by the publication in 1948 of D.D. Raphael's new edition of Price's A Review of the Principal Questions in Morals, first published 190 years earlier. He was successively Tutor in Philosophy and Psychology at Coleg Harlech 1955-60; Lecturer in Philosophy, UCW Aberystwyth 1960-67, Senior Lecturer 1967-79, Reader 1979-83. In 1965, he married Dr Beryl Jones, with whom he had one daughter, Janet. Thomas died in Aberystwyth on 28 May 2005. Dr. Thomas made Richard Price, the eighteenth- century Welsh philosopher and polymath, his life's work. In 1977 he published the definitive study of Price, The Honest Mind. This was followed by the complete correspondence of Price, which he produced in collaboration with Bernard Peach of Duke University, and with the assistance of his wife, Beryl Thomas. Thomas felt that thinkers like Price had received insufficient attention and wished to encourage studies in that area. In 1977, in collaboration with Dr. Martin FitzPatrick, he began the Price-Priestley Newsletter, which in 1982, matured into the journal Enlightenment and Dissent. The journal itself fulfilled his expectations, publishing major articles on eighteenth-century thought including special issues on Samuel Clarke and Enlightenment, Religion, Science and Popular Culture. Thomas had a special ability to combine philosophical insight with historical understanding. Immune to fashionable trends in the history of philosophy and of ideas, he was critical of the concept of paradigms of thought associated with the work of J. G. A. Pocock. He preferred the notion of traditions, yet was also insistent that traditions of thought should not be viewed as mutually exclusive. His own method enabled him to analyse philosophical problems as they appeared to eighteenth-century writers and at the same time to indicate how those problems might still pose difficulties for us today. His examination of the conflict between Price and Edmund Burke in The Honest Mind is a fine example of his approach. He identified the essential differences between the two thinkers while also demonstrating that Burke's attack on Price was founded, at least in part, on a misunderstanding of Price's political principles.Martin Fitzpatrick and W.

He has also distinguished himself in attacking troops at low altitudes, and has carried out valuable reconnaissance service. Detailed to make a reconnaissance of an important area, he realised, on crossing our lines, that the wind was almost at hurricane strength, and that in face of such a wind his return journey would only be accomplished with extreme difficulty. However, knowing the urgency of his mission, he completed his reconnaissance, penetrating 12 miles behind the enemy lines. On the return journey, owing to the strength of the gale, he was forced to descend to a very low altitude, and was subjected to heavy anti-aircraft and machine-gun fire, which badly damaged his machine.\\" References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Category:1896 births Category:1980 deaths Category:People from Broughton, Lancashire Category:Royal Flying Corps officers Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War I Category:British World War I flying aces Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom) ","title":"Norman Roberts"},{"id":"24462302","text":"Gerald (Gerry) M. Czarnecki (born March 22, 1940, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American corporate executive, an author of leadership books, and the founder of the National Leadership Institute, a non-profit organization. Early life Gerald Milton Czarnecki was born in Philadelphia, the son of Casimer Czarnecki, a manufacturing worker, and Rose-Mary Czarnecki, a homemaker. Raised in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, he attended Jenkintown High School and graduated in 1957. After two years of higher education at Johns Hopkins University, Czarnecki left to attend the US Army Artillery Officer Candidate School in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and was eventually commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Army Artillery. He then became an instructor at the Field Artillery School until his release from active duty in 1963. After leaving active duty as a First Lieutenant, he attended Temple University where he completed his B.S. in Economics in 1965, and Michigan State University where he earned an M.A. in Economics in 1967.

Simon to become Chairman, President & CEO of Honfed Bank in Honolulu, Hawaii. During his stay in Hawaii, Czarnecki was elected Chairman of the Hawaii State Chamber of Commerce, a position he held for two consecutive terms.

Following his employment with IBM, Czarnecki held executive positions at a variety of companies beginning with a stint as President of UNC Incorporated and including time at Florida Computer Services and O2 Media Inc. During this time he also began giving leadership seminars designed to help managers at various levels achieve peak performance in the workplace. Czarnecki‚Äôs first book You‚Äôre in Charge‚Ä¶ What Now? is based upon his most popular seminar of the same name. Czarnecki is the co-founder of The National Leadership Institute (NLI), Chairman of the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) Florida Chapter, Senior Managing Director & Executive Producer at Ventureland Productions, and the Chairman and CEO of The Deltennium Group, a consulting firm offering leadership training, career coaching, financial planning, and investment management services.

It was previously known as the York Minster, but was informally called \\"the French pub\\" or \\"the French house\\" by its regulars. It sells more Ricard than anywhere else in Britain, and only serves beer in half-pints except on 1 April, when a recent custom has been that Suggs serves the first pint of the day.  History  The pub was opened by a German national named Christian Schmitt in 1891 and traded as \\"York Minster\\". Schmitt died in 1911. His wife, Bertha Margaretha Schmitt, continued to run the pub until 1914. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Bertha Schmitt sold the pub to a Belgian, Victor Berlemont, who had moved to London in 1900. The bill of sale is posted on a wall at the French still today. He was succeeded by his son Gaston Berlemont, who was born in the pub in 1914, and worked there until his retirement in 1989. After the fall of France during the Second World War, General Charles de Gaulle escaped to London where he formed the Free French Forces. His speech rallying the French people, \\"√Ä tous les Fran√ßais\\", is said to have been written in the pub. The French House has always been popular with artists and writers. Brendan Behan wrote large portions of The Quare Fellow there, and Dylan Thomas once left the manuscript of Under Milk Wood under his chair. Other regulars over the years have included Francis Bacon, Tom Baker, Daniel Farson, Lucian Freud, Slim Gaillard,Augustus John, Malcolm Lowry, Calum, Rosie and John Mortimer.The Times http://cuttingsarchive.org/index.php/A_Life_in_the_Day_of_Tom_Baker Sylvia Plath is also reported to have visited the French House. Clive Jennings says of regular clientele such as Jeffrey Bernard that \\"the lethal triangle of The French, The Coach & Horses and The Colony were the staging points of the Dean Street shuffle, with occasional forays into other joints such as The Gargoyle or the Mandrake ... The Groucho or Blacks\\". The name was changed to \\"The French House\\" after the fire at York Minster in 1984. Contributions toward the restoration fund started arriving at the pub. Upon forwarding them, Gaston Berlemont found that the cathedral had been receiving deliveries of claret intended for him. In recent years, landlady Lesley Lewis has encouraged Soho photographers to exhibit in the pub with regular contributions from John Claridge, William Corbett, Carla Borel and Peter Clark; and members of illustrators' collective, Le Gun. Claridge based his Soho Faces project at the French from 2004 to 2017. He said, \\"I decided to document the customers at The French in earnest. For me, it was the one place in Soho that still held its Bohemian character, where people truly chose to share time and conversation, and I became aware that many I had once chinked glasses with were no longer around.\\" The dining room at the French House was opened by Fergus and Margot Henderson in 1992. Fergus would later leave in 1994 to establish his St. John restaurant in Smithfield. Margot continued to run the dining room for several years with Melanie Arnold. Anna Hansen worked under the Hendersons as head chef.  References   External links   *John Claridge‚Äôs Soho Portraits Category:Alfred W.

In fact, it is an Advent hymn in which the morning star is an allegory for the arrival of Jesus, not the Star of Bethlehem. In the original Cornelius setting, the accompaniment was played on a piano but the English organist Ivor Atkins later arranged the accompaniment for choir, with the choir singing the words of the original hymn.

History \\"Die K√∂nige\\", from: Weihnachtslieder Opus 8,3 Composer Peter Cornelius Cornelius wrote the German hymn \\"Die K√∂nige\\" in 1856 as part of Weihnachtslieder, Op. 8, for a solo voice and piano; he rewrote it in 1870 for soloist and chorus. The hymn was originally translated in 1916 by W. G. Rothery. The more commonly used translation, including references to the Magi being from Persian lands, was made in 1928 by H.N.

Biography Born in San Francisco's Chinatown on April 30, 1921, Benjamen Chinn was the ninth of twelve children. He was introduced to photography at the age of ten by his older brother, John, who taught him how to develop and print photos. Together the two assembled a darkroom in the basement of the family home. Throughout his photographic career, Chinn, an engineer by profession, would become known for his skills in the darkroom. During World War II, he served in the Pacific as an aerial and public relations photographer for the U.S. Army Air Corps. Based at Hickam Field in Hawaii, he and a lone pilot flew reconnaissance missions in bombers that had been converted into unarmed camera planes. After the war, Chinn returned to San Francisco and was accepted into a new fine art photography program at the California School of Fine Arts (CSFA), now the San Francisco Art Institute. In this program, Ansel Adams and Minor White groomed the next generation of fine art photographers in the so-called ‚ÄúWest Coast School of Photography.‚Äù Lecturers included Edward Weston, Imogen Cunningham, Lisette Model and Dorothea Lange. \\"The climax of every year was the five day, early spring trip to visit Edward Weston and to photograph at Point Lobos State Reserve, which his pictures had made famous. Full time concern with photography was nothing new to us, but on this trip the intensity rose like a thermometer held over a match flame.\\"Minor White, \\"A Unique Experience in Teaching Photography\\", Aperture, vol. 4 no. 4 (1956):151. Copyright ¬©1956 by Minor White renewed by the Trustees of Princeton University. Use here is by permission of the Minor White Archive, Princeton University Art Museum. The close-knit circle of teachers and students would become lifelong friends. Chinn was particularly close to Cunningham, and through the end of her life he would often bring dim sum to her house for their lunches together. During this time Chinn began photographing San Francisco's Chinatown. His images exhibit a non-judgmental eye and a natural curiosity about people. He made intimate portraits of everyday life in the post-war era. His photos display an intuitive sense of form and movement and he credited his development to his CSFA painting instructors Dorr Bothwell and Richard Diebenkorn. The photos, many of which were taken from his doorstep, create a unique portrait of Chinatown from an insider's point of view.Benjamen Chinn dies at 87, Jon Thurber, Los Angeles Times, May 25, 2009 Chinn went on to Europe and photographed Parisian street life from 1950 to 1951 while studying sculpture from Alberto Giacometti at the Acad√©mie Julian. He also took painting classes at Fernand L√©ger‚Äôs school, and geography and philosophy at the Sorbonne. He became friends with L√©ger and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Living in Paris, without a darkroom for the first time, he developed the negatives of the photos he took, but did not print or see any of the images until after he returned to San Francisco. In 1954, Minor White exhibited some of Chinn‚Äôs Paris photos at a show titled Perceptions at the San Francisco Museum of Art (now the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art). White used one of them for the cover of the second edition of Aperture magazine. At this time, Chinn assisted Wayne Miller and Dorothea Lange as part of the West Coast Selection Committee for Edward Steichen's Family of Man exhibition. In 1953, Chinn went to work for the Sixth United States Army Photo Lab in the Presidio of San Francisco. He met Paul Caponigro, then a twenty-year-old enlisted man doing his military service at the lab. Initially attracted by their mutual interest in classical music, Ben volunteered to train Caponigro in the technical aspects of negative and print making. Caponigro would go on to become a substantial landscape art photographer. Additionally, he introduced Caponigro to his teachers, now friends, from the CSFA: Adams, White, Lange and Cunningham. Caponigro writes, ‚ÄúThrough Ben, I felt that I had been admitted into a 'guild' of serious image makers using light and silver emulsions. Ben's own talent and ability with the camera coupled with his willingness to reach out to another human being gave me a great start and the inspiration to extend myself to those searching to develop within the realm of great art.Paul Caponigro, Benjamen Chinn at Home in San Francisco. Chinese Historical Society of America, San Francisco, 2003 ‚Äù Chinn had a thirty-one year career at the army photo lab where he rose to Chief of Photographic Services and later, Chief of Training Aids & Services Division. Though he stopped pursuing photography as a fine art, his life and relationships as a photographer never ceased. He continued to travel with his camera, photographing the Tarahumara Indians in Copper Canyon, Mexico, and the indigenous peoples of Teotitl√°n. Throughout his life, Chinn developed and maintained numerous lifelong friendships. He actively participated in social groups that shared his beliefs in religion, the arts, travel and the enjoyment of food and good company ‚Äì spending hours discussing classical music, films and the books of the day. He continued to photograph with a 35mm camera and shared his artistry through holiday cards and documentary photography support for Project Concern International. Even after retiring, Chinn's passion for photography continued, as he volunteered at a one-hour photo store in Chinatown developing people's photos. Benjamen Chinn lived in the family house in Chinatown until February, 2008, when he was moved to an assisted-living facility. He died on April 25, 2009 at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in San Francisco, California.Benjamen Chinn dies at 87, Jon Thurber, Los Angeles Times, May 25, 2009 Legacy Benjamen Chinn's work evidenced the influence of the world of black and white art photography in the United States, during the 1940s and 1950s. His work also became influential for many new and already esteemed artists. While his work has had a number of exhibitions (see below), it has largely lain unrecognized until the turn of the 21st century. In more than one of his publications, noted landscape photographer Paul Caponigro has acknowledged the influence that studying with Benjamen Chinn had on him.Paul Caponigro, Stone Churches of Ireland, Lodima Press, 2007, ISBN I-888899-39-5 Author Alexandra Chang wrote, \\"His work, varying from still life, to the architecture of San Francisco Chinatown, to portraits, exudes an Atget-like quality of a moment from everyday life frozen in time.\\"Alexandra Chang, \\"Envisioning Diaspora, Asian American Visual Arts Collectives,\\" Timezone 8 Editions, 2009, Since his death, a process has been developed to archive Chinn's entire photographic work and digitize it for analysis by artists and scholars.

The rubber guard (sometimes referred to as Mission Control) is a Brazilian Jiu-jitsu technique, which involves the practitioner ‚Äòbreaking down‚Äô the opponent into the rubber guard, while maintaining a high level of control. It utilizes extensive flexibility to control the opponent with one arm and one leg. The opposite arm in turn is free to attempt submissions, sweeps or to strike the trapped head of the opponent. Rubber guard, as well as other innovative guard moves, is attributed to Eddie Bravo who adopted it as a staple technique of his 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu. Modern variations of the Rubber guard have been created in the gi, with the Gubber guard being used by Keenan Cornelius. This is a similar set up to the Rubber guard but involves the use of the lapel to control the opponent's posture.

Established in the early 19th century, the farm has been operated for nearly two centuries by the same family, including a prominent politician. Its inhabitants have pioneered forestry in the region and preserved the original buildings to such an extent that they have been named a historic site. Isaac Vanmeter bought the present property in 1801 from Piketon's founder, a Mr. Guthrie. Vanmeter soon returned to his home in Virginia, giving the land to his son John after the younger Vanmeter completed his undergraduate studies in the East. He later headed westward and settled at the present farmstead,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999. at which the house had been built in 1823. Besides raising livestock and growing a range of crops, Vanmeter was active in politics, serving a term in the United States House of Representatives. Although he moved out of the house in 1856, his family remained in the house; by the 1970s, its residents were the sixth generation of Vanmeters living at the property. Rather than employing the entire property as pasture or crop fields, the family maintained some lands for unusual purposes. As late as the 1890s, the farm extended well to the northeast; the twin Piketon Mounds were part of the property.Thomas, Cyrus. Catalogue of Prehistoric Works East of the Rocky Mountains. Washington: GPO, 1891, 182. Meanwhile, the family cut only some trees instead of cutting all down; this unusual decision soon enabled them to begin operating one of Ohio's earliest tree farms. Vanmeter's house is a simple sandstone and brick I-house featuring details of wood and stone. Covered by a gabled roof with two chimneys, the two-story house has a three-bay front with its main entrance centered amid two windows on the first story and three on the second. No windows are placed in the sides, which are substantially narrower than the front and rear., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2013-12-21. Typical of southern Ohio's early stone farmhouses, the property still retains some of its early outbuildings as well as the house. In 1975, the house and historic outbuildings were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of their historically significant architecture; the complex is one of eight National-Register listed locations in Pike County. Four years after the farmstead was designated, a similar honor was given to the Vanmeter Church Street House in Chillicothe to the north, where John Vanmeter moved after leaving his Pike County home.

Description The starry night cracker is a black butterfly with iridescent blue speckling on its wings. The female has a white band on the underside of the forewing that is broader than the band on the male. The wingspan is about . The caterpillars have short horns on their heads, the function of which is unknown, and the pupae are bright green. Distribution This butterfly is native to the Caribbean area, Central America and tropical South America. It occurs at altitudes of up to on both the Pacific and Atlantic slopes of the Andes Ranges, but it is at its most common in lowland forests in the Caribbean region where it inhabits the mid and upper parts of the canopy. Ecology The larvae of the starry night cracker feed on the leaves of Dalechampia triphylla, a vine in the family Euphorbiaceae. This butterfly exhibits aposematic colouring and is avoided by jacamars, birds that feed on other members of this family that rely on camouflage for their protection. It appears that the larvae of the starry night cracker store up distasteful toxic chemicals from the leaves, and the jacamars learn to avoid the vividly coloured adult butterflies. The adult butterflies do not visit flowers, instead obtaining their nourishment by sucking the juices from rotting fruit. Like their well-camouflaged relatives, starry night crackers like to rest head-downward on the trunks of trees with their wings flattened against the bark.

It is found in the southern parts of North America and southwards to Brazil. Description 200px Hamadryas feronia is similar in appearance to Hamadryas guatemalena and Hamadryas iphthime. The upperside of the fore wing is a mosaic pattern of white, brown and bluish-grey, with a row of small eyespots parallel with the outer margin; a small red bar occupies the discal cell. The upperside of the hind wing is similar but has few white patches and larger more distinct eyespots. The underside of the fore wing is white or whitish-tan with dark markings, a small red bar and a black submarginal eyespot, and the under hind wing is white or whitish-tan, with dark markings and blue rings containing larger eyespots near the rear margin. The larva has two colour morphs; it is either bluish-black above with brownish-white speckles and reddish spots on the side, or it is greyish-green with a pale-coloured longitudinal line on the side. It has dorsal spines on the second and third thoracic segments and on the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The pupa has two long processes on its anterior end. Distribution and habitat Two subspecies are recognised; H. feronia feronia occurs in Brazil, Paraguay and Peru, and H. feronia farinulenta occurs in Mexico, Honduras, Venezuela, Colombia and Trinidad. This butterfly is found in open areas with trees. Ecology In Mexico, the adults are on the wing all year, but are most common between June and September. The larvae feed on vines in the family Euphorbiaceae; in South America, Dalechampia triphylla is often the host plant. The adult butterflies feed on rotting fruit. They often perch head-down, flattened against the surface of tree trunks; their colouring makes them well-camouflaged against the bark. When a butterfly approaches, a male will fly out, making a characteristic cracking sound, probably by means of a pair of rods on the abdomen. If the new arrival is a male it will click in response, while if a female, it will remain silent. Females also perch on tree trunks, but in an experiment it was found that when offered perching places that were black, grey or white, males showed a preference for white while females preferred grey.

Etymology The word landflucht has some negative connotations, as it was coined by agricultural employers (often of the German aristocracy), who were lamenting their labor shortages due to depopulation of rural areas.McLean, Kromkowski 1991, p. 56. Background In 1800, about 25% of the \\"German\\" population lived in cities, and about 75% lived in rural areas.Rankl 1999, p. 8. Beginning in the 1850s, ostflucht (\\"flight from the east\\"), reflected a growing migration from the less industrialized and urbanized east to the more developed west. The 1870s saw the beginning of the landflucht‚Äîwhen the more industrialized regional cities became increasingly the focus of this migration. At the time, the rural population of Germany still constituted 64% of the population. By 1907, however, it had shrunk to just 33%.Schapiro, Shotwell 1922, p. 300. The Prussian provinces of East Prussia, West Prussia, Posen, Silesia, and Pomerania had lost about 1,600,000 people in this rural flight to the cities by 1900.Kirk 1969, p. 139. The former agricultural workers and farmers were absorbed into a rapidly growing factory labor class.Mises 2006, p. 8. While in 1800 there had been fewer than 100,000 industrial workers in Germany, their number approached eight million at the turn of the next century. One cause of this mass-migration was the relative decrease in rural income compared to the rates of pay in the cities.Shafir 1996, p. 150. This migration resulted in a major transformation of the German countryside and agriculture system. Mechanized agriculture and migrant workers (particularly Poles from the east‚Äîthe Sachseng√§nger) became more common. This was especially true in the province of Posen, which was gained by Prussia when Poland was partitioned. The Polish population of eastern Germany was one of the justifications for the creation of the \\"Polish corridor\\" after World War I, and the absorption of the land east of the Oder-Neisse line into Poland after World War II. Also, some labor-intensive enterprises were replaced by much less labor-intensive ones such as game preserves.Drage 1909, p. 77.

It was the first Roman Catholic version of the Bible printed in the United States. Carey was an expatriate Irish journalist who established himself as a printer and publisher in Philadelphia around 1784. In 1789 he announced plans to print the first American Catholic Bible and solicited subscriptions; the work was to be published in 48 weekly parts. This plan failed, largely in part to the small number of Roman Catholics in the United States (then about 25,000 out of 1 million citizens) and also because American Catholics at the time were often unfamiliar with Scripture.The Bible in English: its history and influence, by David Daniell, 2003 \\"Mathew Carey and the American Bible Flood\\" Undeterred, in 1790 Carey came up with a new approach to publishing his Bible. He would print it in two volumes, abandoning the installment arrangement, and he would also market the book to Protestants. His appeal to potential Protestant subscribers emphasized the supposed superior scholarship of the Douay-Rheims version over the King James Version. Among his enthusiastic supporters was John Carroll, the nation's first Roman Catholic bishop, who promoted Carey's project as part of his desire to make Catholics more familiar with Scripture. The price of a subscription was six dollars. The bible was completed December 1, 1790 and was soon also available in a single volume. Probably fewer than 500 copies of the Carey Bible were printed. Carey published two more versions of the Douay-Rheims Bible in 1805; one of these editions was reprinted in 1811 and 1816.

He returned to military service during World War II, and served with the French Resistance from the fall of France to war's end. Background and early life Roques was born in Paris to a Swiss father and a Venezuelan mother. He was still a student when the war broke out in August 1914, and in October 1914, while preparing for his baccalaur√©at, he attended a preparatory school close to Lyc√©e Carnot where he befriended Robert Bajac, whom he would later serve alongside and share several aerial victories. He then learned to fly, being awarded A√©ro-Club de France civilian pilot licence No. 2279 on 15 September 1915, and then volunteered to enlist in the French Army in November. World War I service As a Swiss national Roques was assigned to the Foreign Legion unit 2√®me r√©giment √©tranger, with service number 36810. On 13 March 1916 he was transferred to the Army's aviation branch, the Aeronautique Militaire, assigned to 1er r√©giment aviation and sent to the military flying school at Chartres for his basic military flying training. He was awarded Military Pilot's Certificate No. 3495 on 26 May 1916 and was promoted to corporal the same day. He received advanced flight training, including fighter tactics and aerial gunnery, at the military flying schools at Avord, Pau, and Cazaux, completing his training in November 1916. After two months in a reserve unit Roques was posted to Escadrille N.48 in early January 1917, based near Verdun, to fly Nieuport 17 fighters. From the beginning of April 1917, the escadrille began to replace its Nieuports with the SPAD S.VII, and thus would eventually be redesignated Escadrille SPA.48. Roques was promoted to sergeant on 25 April 1917, and gained his first aerial victory the following day, sharing in the shooting down of an Albatros over Loivre with Sergeant Robert Bajac. In mid-1917, Escadrille SPA.48 were moved to the Dunkirk area, and on 27 July Roques and Bajac, with Jacques Ortoli of Escadrille N.31, were credited with shooting down a Fokker two-seater over the forest of Houthulst in Belgium. On 10 August 1917, Adjudant Bajac was on patrol with Sergeants Roques and Hutteau when they spotted an apparently lone enemy aircraft, and despite orders to the contrary, Hutteau dove in to attack. However, the aircraft was the bait to a trap and the three French aircraft suddenly found themselves under attack by a group of Germans. Hutteau managed to escape and return to the French lines, despite having his aircraft riddled with bullets, while Bajac was wounded in the forearm and thigh, and lost consciousness briefly, recovering only from the ground, and managing an emergency landing on a road. Only Roques escaped unscathed. On 13 September 1917 Roques was awarded with the Belgian Croix de guerre with palm, presented by King Albert I at Bergues, and in November he was promoted to adjudant. On 19 February 1918 Sous-Lieutenant Bajac and Adjudants Roques and Edmond Caillaux, now flying the SPAD S.XIII, shot down a Rumpler two-seater which crashed near Nogent-l'Abbesse. Roques claimed shares in an enemy aircraft shot down on 17 May, and another two-seater downed on 11 June, but was not credited. However, on 12 June he and Bajac shot down a Fokker D.VII over Ressons-sur-Matz, and on 17 June he and Sous-Lieutenant Gilbert de Guingand shared in the downing of a Halberstadt CL.II over Chaudun. On 9 September 1918, after having gained the five confirmed victories required to become a flying ace Roques was awarded the M√©daille Militaire. By the end of the war his Croix de Guerre had three palms and the silver-gilt star (√©toile vermeil), and he also received the Croix du combattant volontaire. Inter-war activities Roques left the army in 1919, also becoming a naturalized French citizen the same year. He remained active as a reserve flying officer, and was made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur on 23 August 1925. He also served as technical director for the flight sequences in Ren√© Clair's 1927 film The Prey of the Wind. In 1930 he was listed as the owner of two Morane-Saulnier-built DH.60 Moths, F-AJQC and F-AJQD, and was still flying the latter in 1934. He transferred to the Arm√©e de l'air when it became independent of the army in 1934, and on 30 May 1936 was made an Officier of the L√©gion d'honneur. World War II service Roques was recalled to serve in the air force on 25 August 1939, with the rank of captain. Posted to Base airenne 112 at Chartres, he served as second-in-command of the 2e escadrille of Groupe de Chasse I/1, then as second-in-command of the entire Groupe from 10 January 1940. He was discharged from the air force on 31 July 1940, following the fall of France, but became an active member of the French Resistance for the rest of the war. Roques died in Paris on 24 May 1988.

Its collection was founded in 1986 by Ronald Grant and Martin Humphries, from their own private collection of cinema history and memorabilia. Its current building was once a workhouse where Charlie Chaplin lived as a child. History First established in 1986 in Raleigh Hall in Brixton, the museum later moved to Kennington; since 1998, it has been based at 2 Dugard Way in the London Borough of Lambeth, the administration block of the former Lambeth Workhouse, in a building owned by the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. The workhouse has a link to cinema history as Charlie Chaplin lived there as a child when his mother faced destitution. The museum runs a programme of talks and events and is currently open by appointment for tours. Having survived a threat to its existence owing to the proposed sale of the building, the museum was engaged in efforts to secure its future with public funding. The museum has been the subject of a documentary by The Guardian, and a 2008 documentary by the Canadian film artist Mark Lewis.Sarah Milroy, \\"Odes to a digital industry's handmade past\\", The Globe and Mail, 11 September 2009. Collection Wikimedia UK short film about the Cinema Museum The museum's collection includes items relating to film production, film exhibition and the experience of cinema-going from the earliest days of cinema to the present. It holds examples of every gauge of film projector, professional and amateur, ever manufactured. The museum holds a collection of early films by Mitchell and Kenyon, the Blackburn film production company, dating from 1899 to 1906. These films were featured at the Pordenone Cinema Muto (silent film festival) in 1997. According to Time Out, \\"The Cinema Museum in Lambeth boasts an idiosyncratic collection of film memorabilia, including posters, art deco cinema chairs, ushers' uniforms from the 1940s and ‚Äò50s, tickets, ashtrays and popcorn cartons, as well as an archive boasting hundreds of books, an estimated one million plus photos and 17 million feet of film.\\"\\"Inside the Cinema Museum\\", Time Out London, 27 March 2008. At its events volunteers regularly dress in original cinema attendants' costumes. The museum seeks to celebrate all aspects of cinema and the moving image from silent films shown in exactly the correct gauge and at the right speed using specially adapted projectors, to screenings of modern television culture. It is developing a growing reputation for its eclectic range of events. The cinema bar was rated the eighth-best pub in Kennington by readers of Londonist in 2013. It is located near Elephant and Castle and Kennington tube stations. Sale of museum building In 2017, it was announced that the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust which owns the building and leases it to the Museum, had decided to put the building up for sale on the open market. A campaign was launched with support from actors and filmmakers such as Ken Loach, and a petition to keep the Museum at the site has gained almost 52,000 (as of October 2020) signatures.Volunteers dressed in original cinema uniforms Items from the collection File:Cinema Museum, London object 133.JPG|Spotlight File:1912 Path√© KOK 28mm Projector.jpg|1912 Path√© KOK 28mm projector File:Cinema Museum, London object 103.JPG|Wooden seating availability indicator File:Cinema Museum, London object 125.JPG|Cinema carpet File:Cinema Museum, London object 134.JPG|Popcorn machine File:Cinema Museum, London object 140.JPG|Seating File:Cinema Museum, London object 14.JPG|Bound volumes of The Cinema News and Property Gazette File:Cinema Museum, London object 18.JPG|Film canisters File:Cinema Museum, London object 23.JPG|Records File:Cinema Museum, London object 45.JPG|Usherette's hat File:Cinema Museum, London object 28.JPG|Entrance doors References External links London's unusual museums in The Daily Telegraph *British Home Movie Day in The Guardian *10 Best Arts venues in South London in The Guardian *Behind the scenes at the Cinema Museum with Michele Hanson in The Guardian Category:1986 establishments in England Category:Brixton Category:Cinema museums in London Category:Kennington Category:Museums established in 1986 Category:Museums in the London Borough of Lambeth ","title":"Cinema Museum (London)"},{"id":"24462771","text":"Rose Glen was an antebellum plantation in Sevier County, in the U.S. state of Tennessee. At its height, Rose Glen was one of the largest and most lucrative farms in Sevier County, and one of the most productive in East Tennessee. While the farm is no longer operational, the plantation house and several outbuildings-- including a physician's office, loom house, and double- cantilever barn-- have survived intact, and have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Rose Glen was established in the late 1840s by Dr. Robert Hatton Hodsden (1806-1864), a Sevier County physician and politician who by 1860 had become one of the county's wealthiest individuals. Hodsden was an attending physician for the Cherokee Removal (commonly called the Trail of Tears) in the late 1830s, and between 1841 and 1845, he represented Blount County in the Tennessee state legislature. Although he was a slave owner, Hodsden was staunchly pro-Union during the American Civil War, and was a member of the Sevier County delegation at the East Tennessee Convention in Greeneville in 1861. Rose Glen is still owned and maintained by Hodsden's descendants.Beulah Linn and Sally Ripatti, History of Early Sevier County Doctors. Smokykin.com. Retrieved: 2009-09-24. Location Rose Glen is located at the junction of State Highway 416 (Pittman Center Road) and Old Newport Highway, a few miles east of Sevierville near the Harrisburg community. The house lot and surrounding land (much of which is still undeveloped) are situated on the east bank of the Middle Fork of the Little Pigeon River, about a half-mile south of the river's strategic confluence with the East Fork to form the Little Pigeon River proper. The house lot is across the street from the Walters State Sevier County Campus. History Robert Hodsden biography Graves of Robert Hodsden (right) and daughter Mary Pasteur Hodsden Hicks at Brabson Cemetery Born in Smithfield, Virginia in 1806, Robert Hodsden initially worked as a tailor in various cities across the country before he decided to study medicine. After obtaining his medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia in 1833, Hodsden joined the practice of James Gillespie in Maryville, Tennessee. He married his first wife, Elizabeth Hook (d. 1842), in 1832. In 1838, Hodsden was appointed attending physician for the Cherokee Removal, known commonly as the \\"Trail of Tears.\\" A member of the Whig Party, Hodsden was elected to the Tennessee state legislature in 1841, where he represented Blount County for four years. In 1843, after the death of his first wife, Hodsden married a widow, Mary Brabson-Shields (1818-1888), whose father, John Brabson, had established the Brabson's Ferry Plantation at Boyds Creek, and had given his daughter what is now Rose Glen as a gift for her first wedding. Hodsden and Brabson-Shields initially resided in Maryville, but eventually moved to Rose Glen, where they completed the current plantation house and villa in 1850. In the decade after the completion of Rose Glen, Hodsden served as the first president of the East Tennessee Medical Society and helped establish Sevier County's first masonic society. Although he was a slave owner, and in spite of being married into the pro-secession Brabson family, Hodsden remained a staunch Union supporter throughout the Civil War. He represented Sevier County at the East Tennessee Union Convention in June 1861, and in November of that year was imprisoned after Confederate authorities accused him of aiding Unionist guerillas in the destruction of several railroad bridges across the Tennessee Valley. Hodsden was eventually released, however, and returned to Rose Glen, where died of heart failure on June 18, 1864.Jones, pp. 37-41. In spite of the rift the war had created between Hodsden and his in-laws, Hodsden was buried in the Brabson Cemetery at Brabson's Ferry Plantation. Rose Glen Hodsden's office at Rose Glen In the early 19th century, what is now Rose Glen was part of a farm known simply as the \\"Bush place,\\" which had been established by early settler George Bush. By the 1830s, John Brabson had become owner of the Bush place, and when Brabson's daughter, Mary, married David Shields in 1837, Brabson gave them the Bush place as a wedding gift. Shields built a house at the Bush farm, which he called \\"Rose Glen,\\" but died suddenly in 1839. In 1843, Mary Brabson- Shields married Robert Hodsden, and Hodsden thus assumed ownership of the Bush place. In 1846, Hodsden and his wife began building the present house and villa at Rose Glen, which they completed in 1850. By 1860, Rose Glen had grown to worth $28,000, making it by far the most valuable farm in Sevier County. Livestock at Rose Glen included fourteen horses, thirty-seven cattle, sixty- seven sheep, four oxen, and one-hundred eighty hogs. Hodsden and fifteen slaves produced 3,400 bushels of oats, 360 bushels of wheat, 50 bushels of sweet potatoes, 18 tons of hay, 100 pounds of wool, 300 gallons of molasses, and over 3,000 pounds of butter. Rose Glen's 1,200 pounds of rice was one of the largest rice crops in East Tennessee. The plantation also had a small winery.Jones, p. 29. On January 27, 1864, Rose Glen was a strategic point in a skirmish known as the Battle of Fair Garden, fought between Union forces led by Colonel Edward McCook and Confederate forces led by Major-General William Martin (Martin was helping to cover James Longstreet's retreat after the Siege of Knoxville). In 1873, Abraham Jackson Hicks (1841-1903) took control of Rose Glen when he married Hodsden's daughter, Mary Pasteur Hodsden (1854-1942). After Hicks' death, Rose Glen passed to eldest his son, John Hodsden Hicks (1874-1948). Historical structures at Rose Glen Rose Glen house East end of the house at Rose Glen Historian Robbie Jones called the house at Rose Glen the \\"most impressive antebellum house ever constructed in Sevier County.\\" The house is a tripartite Greek Revival home consisting of a two-story central block flanked by one-story wings. The front facade of the central block includes a recessed portico supported by square Doric columns. Enclosed porches are located on both sides of the rear of the central block. The house rests on a mostly limestone foundation, although the west wing rests on a brick foundation (possibly left over from the earlier Shields house). A split- run staircase in one of the rear porches provides access to the second story of the central block, which contains three bedrooms. The house has three cellars, one of which (under the central block) was used as a kitchen, and has three brick chimneys with post-and-lintel mantels. The design of Rose Glen was modeled after architect Minard Lafever's \\"Design for a Country Villa,\\" which appeared in both Lafever's Modern Builders Guide (1833) and Beauties of Modern Architecture (1835). The design called for a \\"five-part\\" villa, consisting of the central block and two wings, and two symmetrically-placed outbuildings aligned with the house's northeast and northwest corners. At Rose Glen, these two outbuildings-- which were used as an office and a loom house-- were connected to the main house by flower-lined walkways. The loom house and office have designs that match the house, with the same weatherboarding and brick chimneys. A rose garden was maintained in the space between the outbuildings and the main house. Outbuildings Outbuildings at Rose Glen, showing silo and cantilever barn in the distance on the left, the outhouse and corn crib in the center, and the smokehouse on the right Along with the loom house and Hodsden's office, which were built as part of the \\"country villa,\\" surviving outbuildings at Rose Glen include a double-cantilever barn, smokehouse, springhouse/wellhouse, a hay barn, a concrete silo, and an outhouse. Hodsden added the smokehouse, Hodsden's son-in-law Abraham Hicks probably built the springhouse and double-cantilever barn, and Hodsden's grandson John Hodsden Hicks added the corn crib, silo, and rack-sided barn.Jones, pp. 326-329. The smokehouse, constructed around 1850, is built of hewn logs and is accessed by a board and batten door with iron hinges. The double-cantilever barn, built late-19th century, is a double-pen barn retaining much of its original cantilevered form, although a tractor shed was later added to the barn. The hay barn, located across the street from the main house lot, is a rack-sided barn with a gambrel roof, built in the 1920s. With the exception of the smokehouse, all the outbuildings are frame structures.

It was first designated as a National Park by Proclamation no. 811 on June 7, 1935.\\"Initial Components of the NIPAS Act\\" . Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau. Retrieved on 2012-06-18. Under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) of 1992 managed by the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources, the park was reclassified as a Natural Park by Proc. 421 on November 27, 2000.\\"Protected areas of Region 5\\" . Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau. Retrieved on 2012-06-18. The area features the volcano itself, Bulusan Lake, the two other mountains known as the 'Sharp Peak' and 'Hormahan' and Lake Aguingay. The park is in the south central part of Sorsogon Province, southern Luzon, Bicol Region, Philippines, bounded by five municipalities: Bulusan, Barcelona, Irosin, Juban and Casiguran. Physical characteristics and biodiversity There are three main peaks in the park ‚Äî the active Bulusan Volcano, the highest, which is characterized by numerous deep ravines and caves ‚Äî Sharp Peak, and the mountain called Hormahan. The center of the mountain complex forms a vast plain that is occasionally flooded known as Lake Aguingay, which dries up during summer. Another lake in the park is Lake Bulusan. A substantial area of forest remains in the park, including forest around the peak and lowland forest on the slopes. Other habitats include secondary grassland, freshwater lakes and pools, small settlements and rural gardens, abandoned farmland and disturbed ground. The park supports the needs of the nearby communities through its forest products, watershed, and recreational values. Local communities use the lower slopes as agricultural land. It is the source of water for several communities and for the irrigation of surrounding agricultural land, and it provides natural protection from calamities such as typhoons and flash floods. Flora Giant ferns: the most common vegetation found in the park. The most common vegetation is the giant ferns and tall trees such as the red lauan (Shorea teysmanniana), molave (Vitex parviflora) and many others. Other plant species including ground orchids. Two endemic plant species, Prenephrium bulusantum (a fern) and Schefflera bulusanicum, are found in the area. Fauna Some animals are in the area, such as the Philippine baboon, Philippine duck, Philippine hawk-eagle, flame-breasted fruit-dove, Philippine eagle-owl, monitor lizards, endemic frogs, snakes, and other reptiles. Philippine brown deer, warty pigs and rare civets were spotted in the area in the late 1980s, although there is no evidences of their existence in the park at present. The park also supports endangered species of frogs, lizards, bats, snakes and other reptiles. Management and conservation As the natural habitats declined over the years as a result of extensive kaingin, heavy hunting, and human settling, cooperating municipalities especially Bulusan and Irosin joined in responding to conservation efforts. Plans have been drawn with the support from DENR, local communities, local government units, non-government organizations and concerned citizens for the rehabilitation of affected areas and protection of remaining untouched forests. Eco-tourism has been encouraged to give more jobs to the locals to limit the use of produce found in the park. Gallery Image:Bulusan.jpg|Bulusan Lake at the heart of the park.

Route East Kilbride The road starts off at a roundabout called \\"The Whirlies\\", with a junction for the A725 road, starting as a dual carriageway. Running north it meets another roundabout for the A749 spur which leads onto the A725 road. The road continues past the Kingsgate Retail Park (Nerston) and the junction for the road to the Stewartfield district. After a traffic light junction the road becomes National Speed Limit descending down a long hill towards Rutherglen offering panoramic views over Greater Glasgow. Rutherglen Around two miles north-west there is a grade separated staggered junction for the B759 road to Cambuslang/Kirkhill and Carmunnock and the road reduces to a 40-mile-per-hour speed limit. The junction can be dangerous due to the speeds involved, and the fact that the traffic for Cambuslang queues in the fast lane at busy times and crosses the southbound lanes, as does traffic from the B road onto the northbound carriageway. Fatalities have occurred and the construction of a new residential development in the adjacent fields led to safety measures being proposed in 2017. The road continues after another roundabout where an unclassified road for Cathkin joins. The road continues for another brief spell as a 40-mile-per-hour dual carriageway passing the Springhall and Whitlawburn housing schemes. Soon afterwards the road drops to a 30-mile-per-hour zone and the dual carriageway section ends at a junction with the A730 road at Burnside railway station. Turning right onto Stonelaw Road through the Burnside district the road continues down to Rutherglen town centre, meeting the historic Main Street at Rutherglen Cross. It crosses over the West Coast Main Line railway beside Rutherglen railway station, and under the M74 motorway (however offers no access). A junction with the A724 (Cambuslang Road) at Farme Cross is followed by crossing the River Clyde; passing the Clyde Walkway, the road enters Dalmarnock and the City of Glasgow proper still heading in a northwesterly direction. Glasgow The road approaches Bridgeton where it meets the Glasgow East End Regeneration Route (A728) at Dalmarnock railway station and continues past the B763 road as Dalmarnock Road, although signs suggest Dunn Street heading west is the A749 when this is incorrect. At Bridgeton Cross the road switches to London Road (with small sections swapping designation with the A74 near to Glasgow Green) and carries on west to Glasgow City Centre, passing Calton and The Barras flea market. It forms a brief part of the one- way system along with the A89 road (Gallowgate) on the eastern edge of the Merchant City.

Individuals cause GHG emissions from a variety of direct and indirect activities including transportation use, electrical use and home heating and cooling. Verifiable reductions in GHG emissions are aggregated into 1 metric ton increments and they become personal Carbon Credits. Traditional carbon credits are purchased by GHG emitters to offset the difference between their actual emissions and their allowable limit under a cap and trade type GHG reduction program or to reduce their total GHG emissions under a voluntary limit. These same credits are created when specific GHG reduction projects produce real, additional and verifiable GHG reductions. These carbon projects are typically large in scale and include reforestation, fuel switching and biogas projects. Personal carbon credits follow the same concept as traditional carbon credits, but these projects are small in scale, developed by individuals and encourage actual reduction in energy demand at the use point. They are applicable globally, wherever the verification requirements can be satisfied. Personal carbon credits differ from personal carbon trading which imposes a cap or allowance on individual GHG emissions. Personal carbon credits are a voluntary method for individuals to directly reduce energy consumption and the resulting GHG emissions. Successful individual reductions are rewarded through lower utility costs and the value of the created personal carbon credits. Personal carbon credits were first introduced by My Emissions Exchange in April 2009. Some experts on carbon credit markets have called for inclusion of small scale GHG reduction projects and verification methods that are valid, appropriate and cost effective for projects of this size. Personal carbon credits address this need and create more opportunities for GHG reductions. Verification Verification and certification of all carbon credits are necessary to insure real GHG reductions are occurring and to insure buyer confidence in using credits to offset GHG emissions. There are many certification standards in existence today for both the compliance and voluntary credit markets.Fortifying the Foundation ‚Äì State of the Voluntary Carbon Markets 2009 by Katherine Hamilton, et al. at Ecosystems Marketplace and New Carbon Finance, May 20, 2009 Chapter 7. Personal carbon credits are a new approach to GHG reduction strategies and as such there are no specific protocols existing today within the various certification standards, specifically, because personal carbon credits are so new. However, the proper design of the verification system, such as the use of utility company billing meters and review of historical consumption patterns, can insure that personal carbon credits comply with all the requirements of The Greenhouse Gas Protocol by the World Resources Institute, including additionality. Greater awareness of personal carbon credits will encourage certification organizations to develop specific protocols in the future.

Mondak‚Äîa portmanteau derived from Montana and adjacent North Dakota‚Äîwas created in 1903, mostly by local investors who realized that profit could be made by selling beer and liquor to North Dakotans. Because of its strategic location on the Missouri River and the Great Northern Railway, Mondak quickly became a thriving village. The first building was constructed in 1904, and Mondak soon boasted a bank, two hotels, three general stores, and several grain elevators. It also eventually had a church, a newspaper, a two-story brick school, and a part-time electric generating plant.. Although the church never had a resident minister, the town welcomed periodic visits from the noted Methodist prohibitionist Rev. William Van Orsdel. Locally raised grain and cattle were shipped to Minneapolis on the Great Northern, but the town's most profitable business remained alcohol sales. During its heyday, Mondak had at least seven saloons and a number of warehouses to store alcohol.. Gambling and prostitution were never legal but always winked at. There were many accidents involving inebriated men, and the crime rate was high for the size of the community. On April 4, 1913, a black construction worker, J. C. Collins, shot and killed Sheridan County Sheriff Thomas Courtney and a deputized citizen, Richard Bermeister, when they tried to arrest him at the company's office.\\"Mondak Citizens Lynch Negro Who Shoots Down Peace Officer\\", Billings (MT) Daily Gazette, April 5, 1913, p1 Hours after Collins was jailed in Mondak, a mob of local residents stormed the building and lynched him, hanging him from a telephone pole and then making \\"a futile attempt to burn his body.\\" \\"Lynch Mondak Negro Who Kills Sheriff and Deputy for Double Murder\\", Great Falls (MT) Tribune, April 5, 1913, p1 . Booker T. Washington mentioned the lynching in a July 15, 1913 letter to the Boston Transcript. ODMP memorials Mondak's prosperity was short-lived. The area entered a drought cycle in 1916; and the Snowden Bridge, completed in 1913, reduced ferry traffic across the Missouri. In 1916, a fire destroyed several saloons and a warehouse and badly damaged a hotel and a general store. In 1919 Montana instituted prohibition. Although Mondak was never entirely dry, prohibition \\"cramped Mondak's style.\\" When the county seat, provisionally located in Mondak, moved to Poplar in 1920, Mondak's decline accelerated. In early 1924, the railroad station closed, and the bank, the town's last viable business, closed in 1925. In 1928 another fire destroyed many remaining buildings.. The scant remains of the ghost town are on private property within a mile of Fort Union Trading Post National Historic Site and within two miles of Fort Buford State Historic Site, North Dakota.

Substances, events, or circumstances can constitute hazards when their nature would allow them, even just theoretically, to cause damage to health, life, property, or any other interest of value. The probability of that harm being realized in a specific incident, combined with the magnitude of potential harm, make up its risk, a term often used synonymously in colloquial speech. Hazards can be classified in several ways. They can be classified as natural, anthropogenic, technological, or any combination therefore, such as in the case of the natural phenomenon of wildfire becoming more common due to human-made climate change or more harmful due to changes in building practices. A common theme across many forms of harzards is the presence of stored energy that, when released, can cause damage. Stored energy can occur in many forms: chemical, mechanical, thermal, radioactive, electrical, etc. Situations can also be hazardous, as for example confined or limited egress spaces, oxygen-depleted atmospheres, awkward positions, repetitive motions, low-hanging or protruding objects, etc. They may also be classified as health or safety hazards, by the populations that may be affected, and the severity of the associated risk. In most cases a hazard may affect a range of targets, and have little or no effect on others. Identification of hazards assumes that the potential targets are defined, and is the first step in performing a risk assessment. Characteristics Environmental hazards include long term environmental deterioration such as acidification of soils and build-up of atmospheric carbon dioxide to communal and involuntary social hazards such as crime and terrorism to voluntary and personal hazards such as drug abuse and mountain climbing. Environmental hazards usually have defined or common characteristics including their tendency to be rapid onset events meaning they occur with a short warning time, they have a clear source of origin which is easily identified, impact will be swift and losses suffered quickly during or shortly after on-set of the event, risk of exposure is usually involuntary due to location or proximity of people to the hazard and the \\"disaster occurs with an intensity and scale that justifies an emergency response\\" . Hazards may be grouped according to their characteristics. These factors are related to geophysical events which are not process specific: # Areal extent of damage zone # Intensity of impact at a point # Duration of impact at a point # Rate of onset of the event # Predictability of the event Natural hazards may be defined as \\"extreme events that originate in the biosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere or atmosphere\\" or \\"a potential threat to humans and their welfare\\" which include earthquake, landslide, hurricane and tsunamis. Technological and man made hazards include explosions, release of toxic materials, episodes of severe contamination, structural collapses, and transportation, construction and manufacturing accidents etc. A distinction can also be made between rapid onset natural hazards, technological hazards and social hazards which are described as being of sudden occurrence and relatively short duration, and the consequences of longer term environmental degradation such as desertification and drought, . In defining hazard Keith Smith argues that what may be defined as hazard is only a hazard if there is the presence of humans to make it a hazard and that it is otherwise merely an event of interest. In this sense the environmental conditions we may consider hostile or hazardous can be seen as neutral in that it is our perception, human location and actions which identify resources and hazards within the range of natural events. In this regard human sensitivity to environmental hazards is a combination of both physical exposure (natural and/or technological events at a location related to their statistical variability) and human vulnerability (in regard to social and economic tolerance of the same location). Smith states that natural hazards are best seen in an ecological framework in order to distinguish between natural events as natural hazards. He says \\"natural hazards, therefore, result from the conflict of geophysical processes with people and they lie at the interface what has been called the natural events system and the human interface system.\\" He says that \\"this interpretation of natural hazards gives humans a central role. Firstly through location, because it is only when people and their possessions get in the way of natural processes that hazard exists.\\" A proposed level crossing at railroad tracks would result in \\"the worse death trap in Los Angeles,\\" a California traffic engineer warned in 1915, because of the impaired view of the railway by automobile drivers. A viaduct was built instead. A natural hazard can be considered as a geophysical event which when it occurs in extremes and a human factor is involved that may present a risk. In this context we can see that there may be an acceptable variation of magnitude which can vary from the estimated normal or average range with upper and lower limits or thresholds. In these extremes the natural occurrence may become an event that presents risk to the environment or people. Smith says \\"most social and economic activities are geared to some expectation of the 'average' conditions. As long as the variation of the environmental element remains fairly close to this expected performance, insignificant damage occurs and the element will be perceived as beneficial. However when the variability exceeds some threshold beyond the normal band of tolerance, the same variable starts to impose a stress on society and become a hazard.\\" Thus above average wind speeds resulting in a tropical depression or hurricane according to intensity measures on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale will provide an extreme natural event which may be considered a hazard. Classification Hazards can be classified as different types in several ways. One of these ways is by specifying the origin of the hazard. One key concept in identifying a hazard is the presence of stored energy that, when released, can cause damage. Stored energy can occur in many forms: chemical, mechanical, thermal, radioactive, electrical, etc. Another class of hazard does not involve release of stored energy, rather it involves the presence of hazardous situations. Examples include confined or limited egress spaces, oxygen-depleted atmospheres, awkward positions, repetitive motions, low- hanging or protruding objects, etc. Hazards may also be classified as natural, anthropogenic, or technological. They may also be classified as health or safety hazards and by the populations that may be affected, and the severity of the associated risk. In most cases a hazard may affect a range of targets, and have little or no effect on others. Identification of hazards assumes that the potential targets are defined. Based on energy source ;Biological hazard: :Biological hazards, also known as biohazards, originate in biological processes of living organisms, and refer to agents that pose a threat to the health of living organisms, the security of property, or the health of the environment. :The term and its associated symbol may be used as a warning, so that those potentially exposed to the substances will know to take precautions. The biohazard symbol was developed in 1966 by Charles Baldwin, an environmental-health engineer working for the Dow Chemical Company on the containment products. and is used in the labeling of biological materials that carry a significant health risk, such as viral samples and used hypodermic needles. :Biological hazards include viruses, parasites, bacteria, food, fungi, and foreign toxins. :Many specific biological hazards have been identified. For example, the hazards of naturally-occurring bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella, are well known as disease-causing pathogens and a variety of measures have been taken to limit human exposure to these microorganisms through food safety, good personal hygiene and education. However, the potential for new biological hazards exists through the discovery of new microorganisms and through the development of new genetically modified (GM) organisms. Use of new GM organisms is regulated by various governmental agencies. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) controls GM plants that produce or resist pesticides (i.e. Bt corn and Roundup ready crops). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates GM plants that will be used as food or for medicinal purposes. :Biological hazards can include medical waste or samples of a microorganism, virus or toxin (from a biological source) that can affect health. :Many biological hazards are associated with food, including certain viruses, parasites, fungi, bacteria, and plant and seafood toxins. Pathogenic Campylobacter and Salmonella are common foodborne biological hazards. The hazards from these bacteria can be avoided through risk mitigation steps such as proper handling, storing, and cooking of food. Disease in humans can come from biological hazards in the form of infection by bacteria, antigens, viruses, or parasites. ;Chemical hazard: :A chemical can be considered a hazard if by virtue of its intrinsic properties it can cause harm or danger to humans, property, or the environment. :Health hazards associated with chemicals are dependent on the dose or amount of the chemical. For example, iodine in the form of potassium iodate is used to produce iodised salt. When applied at a rate of 20 mg of potassium iodate per 1000 mg of table salt, the chemical is beneficial in preventing goiter, while iodine intakes of 1200‚Äì9500 mg in one dose have been known to cause death. Some chemicals have a cumulative biological effect, while others are metabolically eliminated over time. Other chemical hazards may depend on concentration or total quantity for their effects. :A variety of chemical hazards (e.g. DDT, atrazine, etc.) have been identified. However, every year companies produce more new chemicals to fill new needs or to take the place of older, less effective chemicals. Laws, such as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act in the US, require protection of human health and the environment for any new chemical introduced. In the US, the EPA regulates new chemicals that may have environmental impacts (i.e. pesticides or chemicals released during a manufacturing process), while the FDA regulates new chemicals used in foods or as drugs. The potential hazards of these chemicals can be identified by performing a variety of tests prior to the authorization of usage. The number of tests required and the extent to which the chemicals are tested varies, depending on the desired usage of the chemical. Chemicals designed as new drugs must undergo more rigorous tests that those used as pesticides. :Some harmful chemicals occur naturally in certain geological formations, such as radon gas or arsenic. Other chemicals include products with commercial uses, such as agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as products developed for home use. Pesticides, which are normally used to control unwanted insects and plants, may cause a variety of negative effects on non- target organisms. DDT can build up, or bioaccumulate, in birds, resulting in thinner-than-normal egg shells which can break in the nest. The organochlorine pesticide dieldrin has been linked to Parkinson's disease. Corrosive chemicals like sulfuric acid, which is found in car batteries and research laboratories, can cause severe skin burns. Many other chemicals used in industrial and laboratory settings can cause respiratory, digestive, or nervous system problems if they are inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin. The negative effects of other chemicals, such as alcohol and nicotine, have been well documented. ;Ergonomic hazard: :Ergonomic hazards are physical conditions that may pose risk of injury to the musculoskeletal system, such as the muscles or ligaments of the lower back, tendons or nerves of the hands/wrists, or bones surrounding the knees. Ergonomic hazards include things such as awkward or extreme postures, whole-body or hand/arm vibration, poorly designed tools, equipment, or workstations, repetitive motion, and poor lighting. Ergonomic hazards occur in both occupational and non-occupational settings such as in workshops, building sites, offices, home, school, or public spaces and facilities. ;Mechanical hazard: :A mechanical hazard is any hazard involving a machine or industrial process. Motor vehicles, aircraft, and air bags pose mechanical hazards. Compressed gases or liquids can also be considered a mechanical hazard. :Hazard identification of new machines and/or industrial processes occurs at various stages in the design of the new machine or process. These hazard identification studies focus mainly on deviations from the intended use or design and the harm that may occur as a result of these deviations. These studies are regulated by various agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. ;Physical hazard: :A physical hazard is a naturally occurring process that has the potential to create loss or damage. Physical hazards include earthquakes, floods, fires, and tornadoes. Physical hazards often have both human and natural elements. Flood problems can be affected by the natural elements of climate fluctuations and storm frequency, and by land drainage and building in a flood plain, human elements. Another physical hazard, X-rays, naturally occur from solar radiation, but have also been utilized by humans for medical purposes; however, overexposure can lead to cancer, skin burns, and tissue damage. ;Psychosocial hazard: :Psychological or psychosocial hazards are hazards that affect the psychological well-being of people, including their ability to participate in a work environment among other people. Psychosocial hazards are related to the way work is designed, organized and managed, as well as the economic and social contexts of work and are associated with psychiatric, psychological and/or physical injury or illness. Linked to psychosocial risks are issues such as occupational stress and workplace violence which are recognized internationally as major challenges to occupational health and safety. Based on origin ;Natural hazards: :Natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, volcanoes and tsunami have threatened people, society, the natural environment, and the built environment, particularly more vulnerable people, throughout history, and in some cases, on a day-to-day basis. According to the Red Cross, each year 130,000 people are killed, 90,000 are injured and 140 million are affected by unique events known as natural disasters. :Recent policy-oriented work into hazard management began with the work of Gilbert White, the first person to study engineering schemes as a means of mitigating flooding in the US. From 1935 to 1967 White and his colleagues led the research into flood defences, and further collaboration on investigation was undertaken at the University of Chicago. :In December 1989, after several years of preparation, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution 44/236 proclaiming the 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction. The objective of that decade was stated in the annex of Resolution 44/236 as follows: > \\"‚Ä¶to reduce through concerted international action, especially in developing > countries, the loss of life, property damage, and social and economic > disruption caused by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wind-storms, > tsunamis, floods, landslides, volcanic eruptions, wildfire, grasshopper and > locust infestations, drought and desertification and other calamities of > natural origin.\\" :Methods to reduce risk from natural hazards include construction of high-risk facilities away from areas with high risk, engineering redundancy, emergency reserve funds, purchasing relevant insurance, and the development of operational recovery plans. ;Anthropogenic hazards: :Hazards due to human behaviour and activity. :The social, natural and built environment are not only at risk from geophysical hazards, but also from technological hazards including industrial explosions, release of chemical hazards and major accident hazards (MAHs). ;Technological hazards: :Hazards due to technology, and therefore a sub-class of anthropogenic hazards. ;Sociological hazards: :Hazards due to sociological causes, also a sub-class of anthropogenic hazards :Sociological hazards include crime, terrorist threats and war. ;Environmental hazards: :Any single or combination of toxic chemical, biological, or physical agents in the environment, resulting from human activities or natural processes, that may impact the health of exposed subjects, including pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, biological contaminants, toxic waste, industrial and home chemicals.  Based on effects  ;Health hazards: :Hazards affecting the health of exposed persons, usually having an acute or chronic illness as the consequence. Fatality would not normally be an immediate consequence. Health hazards may cause measurable changes in the body which are generally indicated by the development of signs and symptoms in the exposed persons, or non-measurable, subjective symptoms. ;Safety hazards: :Hazards affecting the safety of individuals, usually having an injury or immediate fatality as the consequence of an incident. ;Economic hazards: :Hazards affecting property, wealth and the economy. ;Environmental hazards: :Hazards affecting the environment, particularly the natural environment and ecosystems.  Disasters  Disaster can be defined as a serious disruption, occurring over a relatively short time, of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic, societal or environmental loss and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. Disaster can manifest in various forms, threatening those people or environments specifically vulnerable. Such impacts include loss of property, death, injury, trauma or post-traumatic stress disorder. Disaster can take various forms, including hurricane, volcano, tsunami, earthquake, drought, famine, plague, disease, rail crash, car crash, tornado, deforestation, flooding, toxic release, and spills (oil, chemicals). These can affect people and the environment on the local regional level, national level or international level (Wisner et al., unknown) where the international community becomes involved with aid donation, governments give money to support affected countries' economies with disaster response and post-disaster reconstruction. A disaster hazard is an extreme geophysical event that is capable of causing a disaster. 'Extreme' in this case means a substantial variation in either the positive or the negative direction from the normal trend; flood disasters can result from exceptionally high precipitation and river discharge, and drought is caused by exceptionally low values. The fundamental determinants of hazard and the risk of such hazards occurring is timing, location, magnitude and frequency. For example, magnitudes of earthquakes are measured on the Richter scale from 1 to 10, whereby each increment of 1 indicates a tenfold increase in severity. The magnitude-frequency rule states that over a significant period of time many small events and a few large ones will occur. Hurricanes and typhoons on the other hand occur between 5 degrees and 25 degrees north and south of the equator, tending to be seasonal phenomena which are thus largely recurrent in time and predictable in location due to the specific climate variables necessary for their formation. Major disaster, as it is usually assessed on quantitative criteria of death and damage was defined by Sheehan and Hewitt (1969) having to conform to the following criteria: * At least 100 people dead, * at least 100 people injured, or * at least $1 million damage. This definition includes indirect losses of life caused after initial onset of the disaster such as secondary effects of, e.g., cholera or dysentery. This definition is still commonly used but has the limitations of number of deaths, injuries and damage (in $). UNDRO (1984) defined a disaster in a more qualitative fashion as: > an event, concentrated in time and space, in which a community undergoes > severe danger and incurs such losses to its members and physical > appurtenances that the social structure is disrupted and the fulfillment of > all or some of the essential functions of the society is prevented. As with other definitions of disaster, this definition not only encompasses social aspect of disaster impact and stresses potentially caused but also focuses on losses, implying the need for an emergency response as an aspect of disaster. It does not however set out quantitative thresholds or scales for damage, death or injury respectively. Status of a hazard Wreck on rocks off right Ukrainian \\"danger\\" road sign. Stop for dangers, including traffic accidents, natural disasters or other road obstructions Hazards are sometimes classified into three modes or statuses: *Dormant‚ÄîThe situation environment is currently affected. For instance, a hillside may be unstable, with the potential for a landslide, but there is nothing below or on the hillside that could be affected. *Armed‚ÄîPeople, property, or environment are in potential harm's way. *Active‚ÄîA harmful incident involving the hazard has actually occurred. Often this is referred to not as an \\"active hazard\\" but as an accident, emergency, incident, or disaster.  Risk  The terms \\"hazard\\" and \\"risk\\" are often used interchangeably. However, in terms of risk assessment, these are two very distinct terms. A hazard is an agent that can cause harm or damage to humans, property, or the environment. Risk is the probability that exposure to a hazard will lead to a negative consequence, or more simply, a hazard poses no risk if there is no exposure to that hazard. Risk can be defined as the likelihood or probability of a given hazard of a given level causing a particular level of loss of damage. The elements of risk are populations, communities, the built environment, the natural environment, economic activities and services which are under threat of disaster in a given area. The total risk according to UNDRO 1982 is the \\"sum of predictable deaths, injuries, destruction, damage, disruption, and costs of repair and mitigation caused by a disaster of a particular level in a given area or areas. David Alexander distinguishes between risk and vulnerability saying that \\"vulnerability refers to the potential for casualty, destruction, damage, disruption or other form of loss in a particular element: risk combines this with the probable level of loss to be expected from a predictable magnitude of hazard (which can be considered as the manifestation of the agent that produces the loss).\\" As hazards have varying degrees of severity, the more intense or severe the hazard, the greater vulnerability there will be as potential for damage and destruction is increased with respect to severity of hazard. Ben Wisner argues that risk or disaster is \\"a compound function of the natural hazard and the number of people, characterised by their varying degrees of vulnerability to that specific hazard, who occupy the space and time of exposure to the hazard event.\\" (Wisner, et al., 1994). Another definition of risk is \\"the probable frequency and probable magnitude of future losses\\". This definition also focuses on the probability of future loss whereby degree of vulnerability to hazard represents the level of risk on a particular population or environment. The threats posed by a hazard are: # Hazards to people ‚Äì death, injury, disease and stress # Hazards to goods ‚Äì property damage and economic loss # Hazards to environment ‚Äìloss of flora and fauna, pollution and loss of amenity Marking of hazards Skull and crossbones, a common symbol for poison and other sources of lethal danger (GHS hazard pictograms). Hazard symbols or warning symbols are easily recognisable symbols designed to warn about hazardous materials, locations, or objects, The use of hazard symbols is often regulated by law and directed by standards organisations. Hazard symbols may appear with different colors, backgrounds, borders and supplemental information in order to specify the type of hazard and the level of threat (for example, toxicity classes). Warning symbols are used in many places in lieu of or addition to written warnings as they are quickly recognized (faster than reading a written warning) and more universally understood, as the same symbol can be recognized as having the same meaning to speakers of different languages.

The disasters feature worst-case scenarios, with Courtley giving the individuals advice on how to survive based on the situation, also giving tips to the audience on survival. This always includes interviews with experts and survivors of similar disasters. On occasion the show may describe two or more different scenarios within the same disaster (being caught at different distances from a nuclear blast, being held under different circumstances during a home invasion/hostage situation or escaping different pandemics). In these cases, Courtley still participates as a member of both scenario groups simultaneously.

Background Development When the band's mockumentary television series was commissioned for a second season, the boys' mother Polly Draper asked her sons to record a new album. Initially, the siblings started to write new songs in 2007. Nat Wolff wrote the title's hit track, \\"I Don't Want to Go to School\\", after pestering his parents to stay home from school, because if he did he would write a song. Subsequently, Nat wrote the song and then he was sent to school anyway. Recording The band began recording their new album in mid-2007. The songs were recorded for the second season of The Naked Brothers Band television series. Recording took as short as three months, which ended in October 2007. Release The album was slated for an April 2008 release, just five months after their debut album, \\"The Naked Brothers Band\\". Nat and Alex released two versions, the normal album and a fan pack edition, including two bonus tracks, a poster with lyrics and a DVD with behind the scenes. It ranked #23 on the top 200 Billboard charts. Singles The album released one single, the title track, I Don't Want to Go to School.

Starring Solax stock actors, the story concerns a child's earnest effort to keep her dying sister alive by naive means. A print of the film is preserved in the Library of Congress. Plot In the opening scene, Dr. Headley demonstrates the success of his cure for consumption. He is congratulated by his colleagues. Meanwhile, it is autumn and Winifred is seriously ill with consumption. Her mother and younger sister, Trixie, are distraught. The family doctor tells Winifred's parents that she will die by the time the last leaf falls. Trixie takes these words literally; after the child is tucked into bed, she sneaks outside and starts tying fallen leaves back on branches with string. Passerby Dr. Headley sees her and learns from her what she is doing. He is led into the house where he administers an injection of his serum cure. Three months later, Winifred is well on the way to recovery. The beginnings of romance between doctor and patient are depicted in the closing scene. Cast *Mace Greenleaf as Dr. Earl Headley, a specialist *Blanche Cornwall as Mrs. Griswold Thompson *Marian Swayne as Winifred Thompson *Magda Foy as Little Trixie Thompson *Darwin Karr as Mr. Griswold Thompson Production The plot of Falling Leaves owes elements to the O. Henry short story \\"The Last Leaf\\" (1907). The child hero is a recurring theme in Guy-Blach√© films; the first film produced by Solax, A Child's Sacrifice (1910), which also starred Magda Foy, is another example. When Falling Leaves was made in early 1912, Solax still was operating out of the Flushing studio it rented from Gaumont. The sets were designed by Henri M√©nessier, who had worked with Guy-Blach√© since 1904. All the primary roles were filled by members of the Solax stock company. Release Falling Leaves was released March 15, 1912. The review in The New York Dramatic Mirror commented on the cast's capability and complimented the production as \\"developed and played with a compelling naturalness\\". In a similar vein, Moving Picture News said of the film that the story unfolded \\"in an atmosphere of delicacy and charming naturalness\\". Preservation A 35mm print of Falling Leaves is in the collection of the Library of Congress, transferred there in 1983 from the Library and Archives Canada where it was part of the Jerome House collection. In 2004, the National Film Preservation Foundation included Falling Leaves on its second DVD set, a restored print that runs 12 minutes. The Whitney Museum's 2009‚Äì2010 retrospective of Guy-Blach√© included a print of Falling Leaves, restored by Dayton Digital Filmworks and with a new score composed by Tamar Muskal.

The Yardley Inn‚Äôs kitchen offers a diverse menu of seafood and shellfish, beef, chicken, pork, and pasta. Banquet rooms and individual dining rooms are available for private parties and special events. From September 2004 through June 2006, three major floods devastated much of Yardley, causing the inn to close its doors several times to repair floodwater damages and replace restaurant equipment. The damages from all three floods summed more than 1 million dollars in repairs and restorations. The Yardley Inn added its Riverside Kitchen Garden and farm plot along River Road in early 2011, a longtime dream of Chef Eben and the owners of the inn. The garden and farm land provide many ingredients for the Yardley Inn's meals, and other ingredients like poultry and eggs from Griggstown Quail Farm and all of the inn's cheeses are sourced as locally as possible. History Founded in 1832, The Yardley Inn originally went by the name of The White Swan. Near the Delaware River in Yardley, PA, the restaurant served as a stopping point for farmers traveling to the Philadelphia Front Street Market. In 1882 a Temperance Reform Movement rescinded the tavern‚Äôs license. From this time until John J. Fitzgerald purchased the inn and regained the license, the building carried on as a cycler‚Äôs road house. The inn continued to enjoy much success until the flood of 1955. The White Swan closed its doors until 1958, when it reopened as The Yardley Inn. Today, Bob and Robin Freed are the owners of The Yardley Inn Restaurant & Bar.

History   1990s  Having performed as DDT, formed in 1989 by former ≈†arlo Akrobata member Ivan Vdoviƒá \\"VD\\" (drums, rhythm machine), with Srƒëan Markoviƒá \\"ƒêile\\" (vocals) and Miodrag Stojanoviƒá \\"ƒåeza\\" (rhythm machine), the band changed the name to Supernaut, after Vdoviƒá's death in 1992. Influenced by the band Suicide, the rest of the band continued working in the same musical direction as on their previous efforts with DDT, explained by the band members as the \\"social art and its reflections on theatre, painting, film, and rock music\\". At the time, the band became a support for the Sonja Saviƒá alternative theatre troupe, performing at various alternative theater festivals. The debut studio album, Buduƒánost sada (The Future Now), released in 1993 by the independent record label Zvono Records, featured an experimental form of industrial rock, crossed with diverse musical influences, including the 1960s acid rock acts such as the 13th Floor Elevators. The album, available on compact cassette only, featuring the prominent tracks \\"Ja sam jedini\\" (\\"I Am The Only One\\") and \\"ƒåaj\\" (\\"Tea\\"), provided the band with the title \\"the most non-commercial band in Belgrade\\". The cover for the album was designed by Markoviƒá, which was also the case with all their later releases. The next release was the Live in Zombietown, a live album released in 1995 and recorded at the BITEF theatre on September 7, 1995, during the Zombietown movie premier, in a new lineup, featuring the new bassist Sa≈°a Radiƒá, who previously worked with Kazimirov Kazneni Korpus, presenting the band's minimalist music live intensity. The album was released by the independent record label Urbazona Trotorock, founded by the Belgrade underground painter Momir Grujiƒá \\"Fleka\\", in collaboration with Radio B92 in 300 copies only, but free of copyright limitations, thus available for free copying and broadcasting. After the album release, Stojanoviƒá left the band. On mid-1997, the band changed the lineup which, beside Markoviƒá (guitar, vocals) and Radiƒá (bass), featured Svetolik Trifunoviƒá \\"Trile\\" (rhythm machine). Together, they recorded Ni≈æe nego ljudski (Less Than Human), recorded at the Triling studio during the Summer of 1997, and released in 1998. The album featured the band's first hit song \\"Tata Roll\\" (\\"Papa Roll\\"). Most of the tracks from the album already appeared on Live in Zombietown, however, the song arrangements were changed with the inclusion of Markoviƒá's guitar sections, moving towards psychobilly, blues and hard rock, making a fusion of rock & roll and electronic music. Having left the band, Trifunoviƒá formed the experimental music duo Tron, with the Presing frontman Zoran Radoviƒá \\"Kiza\\", performing improvised instrumental music.  2000s  The new lineup, featuring backing vocalists Aleksandra Arizanoviƒá and Dejana Jovanoviƒá, recorded the album Raj na nebu, pakao na Zemlji (Heaven in the Sky, Hell on Earth), released by the independent record label Beograund in 2000. The album featured cover versions of the Kraftwerk single \\"Das Model\\", with lyrics in Serbian language entitled \\"Model\\", for which a promotional video was recorded, and Dr. Feelgood song \\"Because You're Mine\\". The song \\"Superzao\\" (\\"Superevil\\"), which appeared on the album, was written and performed by Markoviƒá during the period with DDT. After the album release, the band went on hiatus, reactivating in 2005, in the lineup Srƒëan Markoviƒá (vocals, guitar, sequencing) and Sa≈°a Radiƒá (bass, rhythm machine). After a six-year discography break, the band recorded the album Eli (short for Eli Eli lama sabachthani, trans. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?), released by Automatik Records in 2006. The album, featuring guest appearance by the former Urbana Gerila and Laibach drummer Dragoslav Radojkoviƒá \\"Dra≈æa\\", included cover versions of Atomsko Skloni≈°te song \\"Pakleni vozaƒçi\\" (\\"Hell Drivers\\"), The Stooges song \\"No Fun\\", and The Cramps' \\"Human Fly\\". The album appeared on the fifth place on the annual webzine Popboks list of the best albums released in 2006. Promotional videos were recorded for the tracks \\"≈†ifra\\" (\\"Password\\") and \\"Oh mili (Neupokojeni)\\" (\\"Oh, Dear Ones (The Undead)\\"), both directed by Joca Backulja. After the album release, the band lineup had included an additional guitar player, Vlada Buriƒá, with whom the band appeared on the RTS 2 television show Bunt (Rebellion), and performed at the 2006 Jelen Pivo Live festival on December 16, 2006, however, the lineup did not last long and the band remained a duo. In 2008, the band finished the recording sessions for the new studio album, with the working title Supernaut 6. Announcing the album, recorded at the Master Blaster studio, Markoviƒá stated that it was musically a followup of the previous two albums, but with more complex guitar arrangements and production. In order to retain an authentic sound, the material, written and arranged by Markoviƒá and Radiƒá, featured a fifteen-year-old rhythm machine and twice as older guitar and bass guitar. Despite the announcement that Automatik Records was to release the album, the band was looking for a record label to release the new album for the following two years. Also, bassist Radiƒá announced that the band was looking for the original tapes from the first three albums, available only on compact cassette, in order to rerelease them on CD.  2010s  On April 2010, the band independently released the fifth studio album, Pobuna ma≈°ina (Rebellion of the Machines), thus completing the trilogy of albums which started with Raj na nebu, pakao na Zemlji and Eli. The album, consisting of ten songs, presented the band's final collaboration with the deceased producer Goran ≈Ωivkoviƒá, who also produced Buduƒánost sada and Eli. The album featured two previously released songs, \\"ƒêavo pod maskom\\" (\\"Devil in Disguise\\"), originally recorded and released in 1987 on the various artists compilation Beogradski grafiti - Bad Boy Rock (Belgrade Graffiti - Bad Boy Rock) by Markoviƒá with his former band Plaƒáenici, also featuring Partibrejkers guitarist Neboj≈°a Antonijeviƒá \\"Anton\\" and Miodrag Stojanoviƒá \\"ƒåeza\\", and the title track, first released on Live in Zombietown, as well as the cover version of the Roky Erickson track \\"Nothing In Return\\", with lyrics in Serbian language entitled \\"Ni≈°ta zauzvrat\\". After the album release, on July 18, 2010, the band performed on BELEF, the Belgrade Summer festival. The following year, on January 28, Pobuna ma≈°ina appeared on the 13th place of the Popboks list for the best domestic album in 2010. The following month, the critics of Popboks made a list of the best domestic albums released in the previous decade on which the album Eli appeared on the 41st place. At the time, Vujiƒçiƒá Kolekcija released the monograph Ni≈æe nego ljudski: Srƒëan ƒêile Markoviƒá i andergraund figuracija (Less Than Human: Srƒëan ƒêile Markoviƒá and the Underground Figuration) by Nikola Dediƒá, featuring Markoviƒá's works from 1987 until 2011, promoted with an exhibition of Markoviƒá's works as well as the projection of the film Superstvarnost (Superreality), recorded by Supernaut and Sonja Saviƒá, and Supernaut music videos. In May of the same year, at the Belgrade Mixer festival, the Serbian alternative rock band Neoƒçekivana Sila Koja Se Iznenada Pojavljuje i Re≈°ava Stvar performed the album Live in Zombietown in its entirety, with the whole performance being broadcast on Radio B92.  Theater and film activities  With the actress Sonja Saviƒá, the band worked on the theater pieces Ubistvo na ivici grada (A Murder on the Edge of Town), Superstvarnost (Superreality) and Play, for the former two the band recorded alternative film versions, directed by Sonja Saviƒá. The latter two were turned into films, Superstvarnost, a 55-minute film, dealing with 300,000 intellectuals who had left Yugoslavia in order avoid the Yugoslav wars, and Play, a computer animated movie featuring Markoviƒá's animations, dealing with the 1997 student protests in Belgrade. Beside the two films, the troupe appeared in a musical semi-documentary Filmska akademija SuperNaut-BelgradeUnderground (The SuperNaut- BelgradeUnderground Movie Academy). The film soundtracks were entirely recorded by the band themselves. The three plays were also presented to the London audience at the Tate Gallery. After the performance of the piece Play, in 1997, the band stopped collaborating with Sonja Saviƒá. On March 1996, the band participated the International Alternative Theatre Festival FIAT, and the following year, at the Novi Sad Spens Sports Center organized the Veƒçe Supernauta (A Supernaut Evening), which featured a rock concert, a theater play, and an art exhibition. During the same year, the band appeared as performers in the film Geto (Ghetto), starring the Elektriƒçni Orgazam drummer Goran ƒåavajda \\"ƒåavke\\". They also wrote the plays Masovna narkomanija (Massive Drug Addiction), Superstvarnost II (Kosmogonija) (Superreality II (Cosmogony)), and Pobuna ma≈°ina (Rebellion of the Machines), the later being co-written with the painter Miomir Grujiƒá \\"Fleka\\".

Powell, himself, could be considered a native of Airmont, having been born a few miles southeast, near Upperville, Virginia. Career Powell Served with the Confederate Army, 1863‚Äì65 and studied with Thomas Moran at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He travelled to Europe in 1876 and studied with Fitz at the West London School of Art, and studied closely the works of Joseph Mallord William Turner. He also studied Thomas Cole's works. Powell married Nan Fitzhugh in 1880 and lived in Washington, D.C. from 1885 until his death in 1930 of double pneumonia. He maintained a studio residence at 1923 G Street Northeast until his death.http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/lwpowell.htm Arlington National Cemetery Web site Andrew J. Cosentino and Henry H. Glassie The Capital Image: Painters in Washington, 1800‚Äì1915 (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press for the National Museum of American Art, 1983) Landscapes dominated the career of Lucien Powell. Powell enjoyed popularity in the Washington, D.C., are community and was a member of several local art organizations including the Landscape Club, the Society of Washington Artists, and the Washington Watercolor Club. His paintings were widely collected and exhibited at local and national art exhibitions as well as being lauded in the regional press. Early exhibitions of Powell's works included the Louisville Industrial Exhibition in the 1870s. Mr. Powell was the first artist to hold an exhibition on an ocean liner in 1891. He accompanied a geological survey party to the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone in 1901 and visited the Holy Land, Egypt, and Italy in 1910. Powell was patronized by Senator and Mrs. John B. Henderson, who established a studio for him in their \\"Castle.\\" Mrs. Henderson grew very fond of Mr. Powell's artistic talent and came to own over seventy of his paintings. A few years after her death, Adam Weschler & Son held her estate auction. This auction, held in 1935, is believed to be the largest known sale of Mr. Powell's works. J. Edgar Hoover also owned more than a dozen of Powell's works. Some of Lucien Powell's favorite scenes to paint were: Venice, Rock Creek Park in Washington DC, Grand Canyon, scenes from the Holy Land and Egypt and scenes around Northern Virginia. He died on 27 September, 1930 (aged 83) at Takoma Park, Montgomery County, Maryland.

She played a central role in the Norwegian women's movement from the 1880s until her death, notably as a leading campaigner for women's right to vote. In 1884, Krog co- founded the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights with liberal MP Hagbart Berner. Over the next two decades, Krog co-founded the Women's Voting Association, the National Association for Women's Suffrage, and the Norwegian National Women's Council, spearheading the presentation of women's suffrage proposals to the Storting (the Norwegian parliament). Krog wrote articles and gave speeches, travelling throughout Europe and North America to attend international women's rights conferences. She was editor of the Norwegian feminist periodical Nyl√¶nde (New Land) from 1887 until her death in 1916. Krog was considered radical in her views, seeking full and equal voting rights for all women on the same conditions as men. These views often brought Krog into conflict with more moderate members of the Norwegian women's movement, many of whom argued for narrower approaches, focusing first on enfranchising privileged women. In 1910, the Storting granted universal voting rights to women for municipal elections, extending this to general elections in 1913. Krog was the first woman in Norway to receive a state funeral. Since 2009, the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights has awarded an annual Gina Krog prize for feminist advocates. In March 2013, for International Women's Day, the Dagny oil field was renamed Gina Krog in her honour. Early life  Carte de visite of Gina Krog, ca. 1873. J√∏rgine Anna Sverdrup \\"Gina\\" Krog was born on 20 June 1847 in Flakstad, Lofoten as the daughter of parish priest J√∏rgen Sverdrup Krog (1805‚Äì1847) and Ingeborg Anna Dass Brinchmann (1814‚Äì1872). Gina Krog's brother was barrister Fredrik Arentz Krog. After her father's early death, Krog lived with her mother in Karm√∏y until she was eight years old, and then moved to Christiania. In Christiania, she attended a school for girls. As a young adult, she worked as a teacher in private schools for several years, continuing to improve her knowledge of languages and literature through self- study. Through her brother, she became the aunt of writer Helge Krog and the sister-in-law of feminist Cecilie Thoresen Krog. Krog was among the first women to go hiking in the mountains of Jotunheimen, which gave her a reputation as \\"mountaineer\\". She never married. Suffrage work In 1880, Krog gave up her teaching career permanently in order to advocate for women's rights. She travelled to Great Britain, where she stayed at Bedford College and made contacts within the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, including its leader Millicent Garrett Fawcett. While in Britain, Krog wrote articles and sent them back to Norwegian newspapers, at first using pseudonyms. Her experiences with the British suffrage movement helped develop her own feminist views. In contrast to more moderate feminists of the time ‚Äì who focused on more generally improving the economic conditions of women ‚Äì Krog's views were considered radical: a demand for full political rights for women. Her goal was the achievement of women's suffrage in conditions equal with men, without compromise. In her arguments, Krog emphasized the common human qualities shared by men and women, reasoning that anyone who paid taxes and accepted civic responsibilities should receive the same freedoms and political status. Although some suffragists preferred to focus on gender differences, claiming women had special feminine qualities that made them deserving of the vote, Krog avoided using this rhetoric. Upon returning to Norway, in 1883 Krog became a founding member of the first Norwegian women's business club. The following year, she was one of the first Norwegian women to engage in a public debate, tackling women's rights in a three-day debate organized by students. In 1884, Krog co-founded the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights () together with its first chairman Hagbard Emanuel Berner. The association initially attracted 220 members, both women and men, and was based out of Kristiania. It was decided that the association would focus on supporting women's education, work benefits and marriage rights. When Berner drafted the association's mission statement, he declared a neutral purpose of aiming \\"to provide the woman with her right and place in society\\". Many association members shared the view that women's suffrage should not be considered a priority, since Norwegian women \\"had not shown sufficient interest in participating in politics\\". Krog, however, wanted the association to pursue equal voting rights for men and women, and her position brought her into direct conflict with Berner. Gina Krog, painted by Asta N√∏rregaard. The painting is owned by the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights. In 1884, Krog wrote a series of articles for the magazine Nyt Tidsskrift, entitled \\"Some Words on the Development of Women's Affairs and Nearest Tasks in Our Country\\", urging women to take on more leadership roles in support of women's rights. The following year, when Krog gave a talk entitled \\"Voting for Women\\", Berner resigned as chairman in protest. Despite her disagreements about the association's direction, Krog edited its periodical Nyl√¶nde (New Land) from its start in 1887 until her death in 1916. In December 1885, Krog co-founded the Women's Voting Association () alongside nine other women from the Association for Women's Rights. Her co-founders included Ragna Nielsen, Anne Holsen and Anna Rogstad. Krog was leader of the association from 1885 to 1897. She had been inspired by reading The History of Woman Suffrage, a set of historical volumes sent by American women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony. The Women's Voting Association was open only to women members, with the philosophy that women should be responsible for achieving their own political equality. Despite the Women's Voting Association's efforts, however, their initial suffrage proposals were unsuccessful. In 1886, the association submitted the first Norwegian proposal for women's suffrage to the Storting (the Norwegian Parliament), but the proposal was rejected by lawmakers in 1890, defeated by 114 to 44 votes. In response, Women's Voting Association members decided to adjust their goals and fight only for local municipal voting rights instead‚Äîan idea proposed by Berner. Krog refused to agree to this strategy. In 1893, a new women's suffrage proposal was submitted to the Storting, and although it received support from more than 50 percent of parliament members, it did not reach the necessary two-thirds support it needed to create constitutional change. Women's suffrage in Norway had formerly benefited from strong support from the Liberal Party. During the 1890s, however, many liberal politicians had withdrawn from the cause, expressing fears that women with the vote would naturally gravitate towards supporting conservative candidates. The women's movement claimed a number of smaller victories during this time: women were permitted to become members of school and child welfare boards and received the right to vote in local alcohol prohibition referendums. In 1896, Norwegian lawmakers granted voting rights to all taxpaying men, but again refused to grant voting rights to women. Two years later, men received universal suffrage. Gina Krog and Fredrikke Marie Qvam at a Nordic Women's Congress in Oslo (1902) Disagreements within the Women's Voting Association meant that the association began splitting into two factions. All members were middle-class women, and this affected the association's views on whether or not the vote should be granted to women of all classes. Although some, including Krog, continued to argue for universal women's suffrage, the majority wanted to pursue partial, property- based suffrage instead. Krog remained firm in her belief that women must fight for complete voting rights \\"on the same conditions as men\\", regardless of class. In 1897, Krog left the Women's Voting Association and subsequently established the Norwegian National Association for Women's Suffrage () alongside women's rights activist Fredrikke Marie Qvam. In 1899, Krog attended a Congress meeting of the International Council of Women in London, England, where she was named an honorary vice-president of the council, representing Norway. Krog accepted responsibility for creating a Norwegian branch of the International Council of Women, and began making plans. After much petitioning, the Norwegian government granted limited voting rights to women in 1901. Norwegian women who owned property ‚Äì or whose husbands owned property ‚Äì could now vote in municipal elections. The National Association for Women's Suffrage was admitted as a member of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in 1904.Norwegian National Women's Council members, from left: Karen Grude Koht, Fredrikke Marie Qvam, Gina Krog, Betzy Kjelsberg and Katti Anker M√∏ller (1904) In 1904, Krog founded the Norwegian National Women's Council (), a regional branch of the International Council of Women. The branch was notably active the following year, when the Storting held a national vote on the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. The Norwegian National Women's Council campaigned in support of the dissolution, circulating a brochure advocating for Norwegian independence. Only men were permitted to cast a vote in the decision, despite calls from women who wanted to participate. On 13 August 1905, the day of the dissolution vote, Krog led female delegates from the most prominent Norwegian women's organizations into the Storting building, informing government that thousands of Norwegian women wished to vote their approval of the dissolution. Having organized a nation- wide poll among women, the women later presented a petition with 300,000 names. The incident impressed parliament members, contributing to serious discussions about granting suffrage to women. By 1906, the National Association for Women's Suffrage had continued to grow, with 40 local branches and 2500 members across the country. The association was increasingly better positioned to lobby politicians in all parts of Norway. Krog was part of the official Norwegian delegate sent to Amsterdam for the Fourth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in 1908. She was an early member of the Norwegian Liberal Party, and in 1909 she was elected a deputy member of its national board. Krog visited Toronto, Canada, for an International Council of Women meeting. She followed up the meeting with a tour of the United States where she gave speeches about the Norwegian women's suffrage movement. That same year, Krog's fellow activist Anna Rogstad was elected a deputy MP, becoming the first female member of the Storting. In 1910, Norwegian women were granted universal suffrage in local elections. In 1913, the Storting voted unanimously to extend universal women's suffrage to general elections. Death and legacy Bronze bust of Gina Krog at alt= Krog died on 14 April 1916, during an influenza epidemic. She was the first woman in Norway to be honoured with a funeral at public expense. Several female university graduates provided a guard of honour, and the Norwegian mezzo-soprano Bergljot Bj√∏rnson sang. Krog's funeral was attended by the Prime Minister, the President of the Storting, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. A bronze bust of Krog, sculpted by Ambrosia T√∏nnesen in 1919, is located at her grave at V√•r Frelsers gravlund in Oslo. There are streets named Gina Krog's Way at Persaunet in Trondheim, named in 1956, as well as in the district of Lambertseter, Oslo. The Gina Krog Prize, awarded by the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights since 2009, is also named in her honour, and the prize is given to Norwegian women for work promoting feminist issues. On 8 March 2013, for International Women's Day, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy announced that the Dagny oil field would be renamed Gina Krog in her honour.

It was a predecessor of Mal√©v. History Planes at Buda√∂rs Airport A Lisunov Li-2 (HA-LID) operated by Maszovlet at Buda√∂rs in 1946 The first Hungarian airline companies, Aero Rt., Magyar Aeroforgalmi Rt. (Maefort) and Magyar L√©giforgalmi Rt. (Mal√©rt) had to suspend operations during World War II. Maszovlet was founded after the war as the national airline of the newly Communist state, with technical assistance from the Soviet Union. The airline was jointly owned by Hungary and the USSR. In the beginning its fleet consisted of five 21-seat Lisunov Li-2 passenger aircraft (a licensed Soviet version of Douglas DC-3) and five 3-seat Po-2 plane which carried air mail. Its base was Buda√∂rs Airport, the pre-war international airport of the country (Ferihegy airport had already been under construction but suffered severe damages during the war). Domestic flights started on October 15, 1946 from Budapest to Szombathely and Debrecen; flights to Szeged and Gy≈ër started the same year. The airline had 1864 passengers in the short period between October 15 and the end of the year. In 1947 the airline received another four Li-2 aircraft, followed by two in 1948, finally in 1952 another Li-2, originally bought for the Army, was added to the airline fleet to replace a plane lost to an accident earlier during the year. From 1947 the capital was connected by regular flights to Miskolc and P√©cs, and during the next years B√©k√©scsaba, Kaposv√°r, Nagykanizsa, Ny√≠regyh√°za and Zalaegerszeg also joined the list of destinations. Seasonal summer flights connected the capital to Si√≥fok, a popular holiday destination next to Lake Balaton. Not all flights originated from Budapest; for example, from 1952 there were flights between Szeged and P√©cs, and from 1954 between P√©cs and Kaposv√°r. The extensive domestic flight network consisting of relatively short routes (the distance to most of these cities is between 120 km and 230 km) was necessitated by the fact that motorways and railways suffered great damage during the war. Flights cost around the same as a first-class train ticket. International flights started already in 1947, with the Budapest-Prague route. By the summer of 1954 the airline served 12 domestic airports and started services on the Warsaw, East Berlin and Bucharest routes. In 1950 operations moved to the newly finished Ferihegy International Airport which has been Hungary's main airport ever since then. Buda√∂rs airport is now used for general aviation only. On November 25, 1954 Hungary bought the Soviet Union's shares in the company. This meant the end of Maszovlet and the birth of the new national airline Mal√©v, which existed until its dissolution in 2012. Incidents and accidents * On January 4, 1949 an Li-2 (HA-LIE) en route from P√©cs to Budapest was hijacked by reserve flight lieutenant J√°nos Majoros and pilot Mikl√≥s Kun. The plane landed in Munich, West Germany. This was the first plane hijacking in Hungary after World War II. Both hijackers and some passengers stayed abroad; others returned to Hungary. After this incident planes carried √ÅVH agents in civilian clothing, disguised as passengers. * On November 14, 1949 an Li-2 (HA-LIK), en route from Budapest to P√©cs, crashed into the Mecsek mountains due to poor visibility. All crew and one passenger, six persons in total, died, a security officer survived. * On March 2, 1951 two aircraft mechanics took off in a Po-2 from Ferihegy and fled to the West. * On October 2, 1952 an Li-2 (HA-LIL) was flying the Budapest‚ÄìMiskolc‚ÄìNy√≠regyh√°za‚ÄìBudapest route. Due to poor weather conditions the landing in Miskolc succeeded only at the third attempt, yet the crew decided to continue the flight towards Ny√≠regyh√°za, where after several landing attempts the plane landed on slippery grass and crashed into a building. Three crew members, including the pilot and the co-pilot, died, two other crew members and the three passengers suffered severe injuries.

Formed as a bomber reconnaissance squadron at RCAF Station Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada on 19 May 1942 with Canso A aircraft, the squadron spent an uneventful eighteen months on east coast anti-submarine duty. In January 1944 it was seconded to RAF Coastal Command and stationed at RAF Reykjavik, Iceland to cover the mid-ocean portion of the North Atlantic shipping route. In May 1944, the squadron moved east to RAF Wick, Scotland to support the invasion of Normandy. Their task was to intercept U-boats operating from Norwegian ports. No. 162 sank four German submarines, and shared in the sinking of a fifth that tried to break through the North Transit Area to attack the Allied D-Day invasion fleet. These engagements took place in the Norwegian Sea roughly 200 miles north of the Shetland Islands, for example at . On 24 June 1944 Flight Lieutenant (F/L) D.E. Hornell won the Victoria Cross for attacking and sinking U-1225 despite withering anti-aircraft fire from the U-boat. No. 162 returned to Camp Maple Leaf at RAF Reykjavik later in the summer of 1944, and remained there until it returned to Canada in June 1945. No. 162 Squadron was one of the few squadrons that was not renumbered in the 400-series for overseas deployment as were most RCAF units. It was the RCAF's most successful anti-submarine squadron during the Second World War with five U-boats destroyed, one shared sinking and one U-boat damaged. The squadron flew the Canso during its entire operational lifetime. From the beginning of operations until the end of the war, the squadron flew 2100 sorties and lost 6 aircraft and 34 crew on operations, with a further 3 aircraft and 8 crew lost non-operationally.

Braathen in 1946. It started as a charter airline based at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen in Norway, flying to destinations in the Far East and in South America. At first the airline used Douglas DC-4s, and later also Douglas DC-3s. In 1948, the airline moved to Oslo Airport, Fornebu and started regular scheduled flights to the Far East. In 1952, the airline started cooperation with the Icelandic airline Loftleidir, where until 1960 the two airlines in cooperation flew flights to Reykjav√≠k. Domestic services started in 1951, using de Havilland Herons on a route from Oslo to Stavanger via T√∏nsberg. Braathens SAFE also established at Stavanger Airport, Sola. A second route was started two years later to Trondheim. The Heron routes also stopped in Farsund, Kristiansand, Notodden to Stavanger and Hamar, R√∏ros to Trondheim. In 1958, Braathens SAFE started flying to √Ölesund and at the same time started flights along the West Coast. In 1959, Fokker F-27s were taken into use, and with the Herons taken out of service, Hamar, Farsund and T√∏nsberg were terminated. During 1960, the airline flew a single season to Sandefjord and Aalborg. The company also entered the domestic and international charter market during the 1960s, an industry where the airline would eventually grow to become a large Norwegian and Swedish contestant. Services to Bod√∏ and Troms√∏ started in 1967, although only from Western Norway. Braathens' main domestic competitor was Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), which operated all the primary domestic routes Braathens SAFE did not, in addition to the international routes. Braathens took Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s into use in 1969; Kristiansund was first served in 1970 and Molde in 1972. From 1984, the airline also operated two Boeing 767s, although they were retired along with the F-28s were in 1986. Services to Longyearbyen started in 1987. From 1987, Braathens SAFE was allowed to make international scheduled flights on certain routes. In 1989, it opened a route to Billund, in 1991 to Malm√∂, Newcastle and London, and in 1993 to Murmansk. From 1989 to 1994, the airline replaced its fleet with Boeing 737-400 and -500s. From 1989 to 1994, Braathens Helikopter operated services on contract with oil companies to their oil platforms in the North Sea. Far East Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport A/S was founded on 26 March 1946 by Ludvig G. Braathen through his shipping company Braathens Rederi.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 22 Share capital was , plus loans from the shipping company.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 31 Braathens had made good money during World War II with the participation in the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission, and received permission to use US$1 million to purchase aircraft.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 30‚Äì31 The idea to start an airline had occurred to Braathen in 1936, when the ship Brajara had engine trouble while en route to Japan. The Japanese shipyards could not guarantee that they could repair the ship, and at first it was considered whether the ship should be towed to Europe for repairs. The solution chosen was instead to have the necessary piece made in Amsterdam and flown by KLM. Braathen wanted to have an airline that would be able to fly crew and supplies to his and other ships throughout the world‚Äîprimarily in the Far East.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 17 Braathen traveled to the United States, where he bought several used Douglas C-54 (DC-4) aircraft from the United States Air Force. These were rebuilt by Texas Maintenance Company (Temco) in Fort Worth, Texas, giving them a capacity of 44 passengers, or 22 passengers and of cargo. Twenty pilots were recruited and sent to Fort Worth for certification. The first plane, LN-HAV Norse Explorer, landed at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen on 26 December 1946. The next planes were LN-HAT Norse Skyfarer on 11 February 1947 and LN-NAU Norse Trader on 13 March.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 31‚Äì34 The first route ran from Oslo to Cairo via Copenhagen and Paris on 30 January 1947. Afterwards, the company was chartered for several trips from Paris and Marseille, France, to Lydda, Palestine, and Tunis, Tunisia. From Lydda, the aircraft were used to evacuate French and British personnel prior to the creation of Israel. The company's route to Hong Kong was the longest air route in the world. At the time, the only scheduled service to the Far East was operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation using Sandringham flying boats. This route took a fortnight, while KLM had a land-plane route from Amsterdam to Batavia (Djarkarta). The first Braathens SAFE flight was made on 24 February from Oslo, landing at Amsterdam, Marseille, Cairo, Basra, Karachi, Culcutta and Bangkok before Hong Kong, where Norske Skyfarer landed on 8 March. Total flight time was 46 hours. Along the route, Braathens SAFE established contracts with agents, or stationed their own employees.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 34‚Äì35 The regular services could be done with a round trip time of nine to ten days, including overnighting in Cairo, Karachi and Bangkok, and with technical revision of the plane in Hong Kong. At first there were semiweekly services, but by the end of 1947, these had increased to weekly. In June, Braathens SAFE bought a Douglas DC-3, LN-PAS Norse Carrier, and in August another DC-4, LN-PAW Norse Commander, both from KLM. In 1947, Braathens SAFE flew twenty-five trips to Hong Kong, five to New York and one to Johannesburg, South Africa, making a profit of NOK 750,000. The following year, Braathens SAFE started the first trial flights to South America. The first flight was made on 23 August from Stavanger via Reykjav√≠k, Gander and Bermuda to Caracas, where the plane landed on 26 August. In October, the airline flew to Panama, but neither route gave sufficient contracts to commence regular services. In 1948, the airline made fifty trips to Hong Kong, eight to Johannesburg, two to the United States, three to Venezuela and two to Panama.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 35‚Äì43 Concession From 1948, Oslo Airport, Fornebu was Braathens SAFE's main base During World War II, the civil aviation planning was conducted by the Aviation Council. In 1945, they started a limited number of flights that were operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force. On 2 July 1946, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, several large shipping companies and other private investors reestablished Det Norske Luftfartselskap (DNL), with the state owning 20% and the shipping companies 49%. This airline was granted a 20-year monopoly on domestic and international flights. According to the concession, only routes that DNL were not willing to fly themselves, could be granted to other airlines.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 27 By 1948, Braathens SAFE's routes were so regular that several countries stated that a bilateral agreement would have to be negotiated for them to continue. However, the concession that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE applied for fifteen-year concession on 5 February 1948; Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL's concession by granting Braathens SAFE a concession, but at the same time he was worried that Braathens SAFE could easily flag out to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL's concession could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL/SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens SAFE be granted the route. Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, with a duration of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger ‚Äì Amsterdam ‚Äì Geneva ‚Äì Rome ‚Äì Cairo ‚Äì Basra ‚Äì Karachi ‚Äì Bombay ‚Äì Calcutta ‚Äì Bangkok ‚Äì Hong Kong. The concession was made conditional that Braathens SAFE built a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 39‚Äì46 The Hong Kong-route was officially opened on 5 August 1949. Braathens SAFE had then moved its operative base from Gardermoen to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The company stationed technical employees in Rome, Karachi, Bangkok and Hong Kong, as well as having an agreement with KLM. The planes would stop each night and crew and passengers would stay at a hotel. Cabin crew had no training, and learned the job as they worked. Chicken was the most common lunch meal, and the cabin crew had to purchase this fresh each day, usually observing the slaughter to ensure its freshness. In 1949, sixty-seven flights were made to Hong Kong, as well as two to Tokyo, to Venezuela and one to Johannesburg.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 47‚Äì49 Braathens Douglas DC-3 in 1952 wearing the airline's full name In 1950, it became increasingly clear that the SAS-cooperation was weak, and that either a full merger or a discontinuation of the cooperation would be necessary. Braathen suggested to the government that DNL, Fred. Olsen Airtransport and Braathens SAFE should merge to create a new domestic airline, but this proposal was rejected by both DNL and Fred. Olsen. In 1949, the Swedish branch of SAS, Aerotransport (ABA), and the Danish branch, Det Danske Luftfartselskab (DDL) started a joint route to the Far East. For a merger to be completed, Danish and Swedish authorities required that SAS be granted all international routes from Norway, meaning that Braathens SAFE would lose its concession from 1 March 1954. The SAS merger was completed on 8 August 1951.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 49‚Äì54 Braathens SAFE applied for a concession on a route from Norway to New York on 27 March 1950. This would allow the airline to connect the route to the Hong Kong-flights, giving one continual service. The proposal would involve the purchase of Douglas DC-6B or Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation aircraft. The proposal was rejected by the government on 19 April. The following year, Braathens SAFE applied to extend the route to Tokyo, but this was also rejected by the government. In 1951, the company applied to purchase two Super Constellations to replace two sold DC-4s, which was granted, and on 14 January 1953 for an extension of the concession for another ten years. On 13 November 1953, the government rejected the concession application, stating that Norway was bound to grant the concession to SAS on the basis of the merger agreement.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 54‚Äì62 Icelandic cooperation In 1952, the Icelandic airline Loftleidir was granted the concession to fly from Keflav√≠k Airport outside Reykjav√≠k to New York and Chicago in the United States, and to Oslo, Copenhagen and London. The company established a hub at Keflav√≠k. Braathens SAFE and Loftleidir made an agreement where Braathens SAFE would lease personnel and mechanical services to Loftleidir, and the two would split profits from the joint venture evenly. This allowed the two airlines to have a continual route between Hong Kong and New York as long as Braathens SAFE's concession lasted. In 1954, another DC-4, LN-HHK, was bought. This aircraft was sold to Loftleidir the following year. In 1956, another DC-4, LN- SUP, was bought, and used for charter and by Loftleidir. In 1959 and 1960, Loftleidir received two new Douglas DC-6B aircraft, with a five-year mechanical agreement with Braathens SAFE. In 1960, the two companies agreed to terminate the cooperation from 1 January 1961.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 75‚Äì83 Domestic with Herons From 1950, Braathens SAFE started flying charter services to Europe with Douglas DC-6, mainly to Copenhagen and Paris. DNL protested because Braathens SAFE was charging too low ticket prices, while DDL protested against the flights to Copenhagen. In September 1951, Braathens SAFE offered Danish authorities to fly all domestic routes without subsidies, but this was rejected because such a permit could only be issued to Danish airlines. After World War II, only Fornebu, Stavanger Airport, Sola and Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik were in use as land airport. A plan for construction was passed by parliament in 1952, that based the financing of airports as joint civilian and military airports, with funding from NATO.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 63‚Äì64 T√∏nsberg Airport, Jarlsberg was served from 1955 to 1958 In 1951, Braathens SAFE applied for concession for a route from Oslo to Bod√∏ via Trondheim without subsidies. They also stated that they were willing to fly all domestic routes without subsidies, granted that they were awarded all routes. This was based on the acquisition of de Havilland Heron aircraft, which could use shorter runways and has a capacity of 15 people. SAS was granted the concession to Bod√∏ and Trondheim, but the Ministry of Transport issued a concession to Braathens SAFE on the route from Oslo via T√∏nsberg Airport, Jarlsberg to Stavanger. The plane started in Stavanger in the morning, and operated the opposite direction of SAS' route from Oslo to Stavanger, which continued onwards to London. The first flight was made on 3 May 1952, with the Heron LN-PSG Per. From 7 to 14 May, the plane went on a tour of the country, visiting several airports. Regular services started on 18 August and a one-way ticket cost NOK 95.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 64‚Äì65 On 30 January 1953, Braathens SAFE applied to start a route from Oslo to Trondheim Airport, Lade. A trial permit was granted, and the first flight was made on 18 August. Because Lade had a grass runway, Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes was used during bad weather. SAS flew a morning flight from Oslo, while Braathens flew the morning route from Trondheim. In 1953, Braathens SAFE stated that to keep their 210 employees and fleet of one DC-4, one DC-3 and two Herons, they would have to receive future domestic services, to compensate for more than 90% of their revenue disappearing with the loss of the Far East route. In 1953, Braathens SAFE applied to fly five routes: Bardufoss ‚Äì Alta ‚Äì Kirkenes; Stavanger ‚Äì Bergen ‚Äì Trondheim (both with Herons); Troms√∏ ‚Äì Alta ‚Äì Hammerfest; Bod√∏ ‚Äì Harstad; and Bod√∏ ‚Äì Harstad ‚Äì Troms√∏ (all with de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters). The five routes would require NOK 725,000 in annual subsidies. The concessions were granted to DNL, who allowed their partially owned subsidiary Wider√∏e to fly the sea routes.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 66‚Äì70 Douglas DC-6B in 1971 Braathens bought six Herons, in addition to one that was leased during 1954. They had been given the common Norwegian names Per, Ola, P√•l and Lars. Because of replacements, the airline never operated more than four at a time.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 116 In June 1955, Braathens SAFE started landing some of the Oslo‚ÄìStavanger planes at Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik and Farsund Airport, Lista. The route, nicknamed the \\"Milk Route\\", operated Stavanger ‚Äì Farsund ‚Äì Kristiansand ‚Äì T√∏nsberg ‚Äì Oslo in the morning, with a return in the evening. The same year, SAS and Braathens SAFE started negotiating splitting up the domestic routes. Nils Langhelle, then regional director in SAS, suggested creating a merged subsidiary that could fly all domestic routes. On 16 May 1956, Braathens SAFE started landing at Hamar Airport, Stafsberg on the Oslo‚ÄìTrondheim route, and at Notodden Airport, Tuven on the Oslo‚ÄìStavanger route. Both airports had runways that could only be served by small aircraft such as the Heron. From 1959, services to both airports were terminated. R√∏ros Airport was opened on 19 July 1957, and Braathens SAFE landed some of the Oslo‚ÄìTrondheim services there. After 1958, services were terminated, but after the runway was extended from , it was taken into use again in 1963.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 104‚Äì108 The route Stavanger‚ÄìBergen‚ÄìTrondheim was awarded to Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap in 1956, but this company filed for bankruptcy the following year. √Ölesund Airport, Vigra was scheduled to open in 1958, and both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the concession, along with the route along the West Coast. At first the ministry wanted to issue the concession on the route Stavanger ‚Äì Bergen ‚Äì √Ölesund ‚Äì Trondheim to Braathens SAFE and the route √Ölesund‚ÄìOslo to SAS. But after negotiations, Braathens SAFE stated they were willing to fly the coastal route without subsidies if they were granted the Oslo-route, since that would allow them to cross-subsidize; this was granted by the ministry. An agreement was then made between the ministry, SAS and Braathens SAFE, where both airlines would fly the routes Oslo‚ÄìTrondheim, Oslo‚ÄìStavanger, Oslo‚ÄìKristiansand and Kristiansand‚ÄìStavanger‚ÄìBergen; Braathens SAFE had a monopoly on the routes Oslo‚Äì√Ölesund and Bergen‚Äì√Ölesund‚ÄìTrondheim, while SAS was granted a monopoly on the routes Oslo‚ÄìBergen and (Oslo)‚ÄìTrondheim‚ÄìBod√∏‚ÄìBardufoss.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 112 In 1958, Braathens SAFE had 77,591 passengers.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 118 Hummelfjell Accident On 7 November 1956, the Heron LN-SUR Lars crashed at Hummelfjell after the aircraft had experienced icing problems. The Hummelfjell Accident killed the pilot and one passenger, but the remaining ten people on board survived. Among them was the famous television actor Rolf Kirkvaag, who, despite injury, succeeded at walking to civilization to inform about the accident.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 111 Friendship Braathens SAFE Fokker F-27 in August 1964 During the late 1950s, Braathens SAFE started looking for a replacement for the aging DC-3s and Herons. An order was placed with Fokker for the delivery of their new Fokker F-27 Friendship, a two-engine turboprop with cabin pressurization. Braathens SAFE was the second airline to receive the plane, after Aer Lingus. The first craft, LN-SUN, was delivered in December 1958, with the second, LN-SUO, delivered the following year. They were put into service on the main routes: once daily Oslo‚ÄìTrondheim, once daily Oslo‚Äì√Ölesund, twice daily Oslo‚ÄìStavanger, including one stopping at Kristiansand, and one trip daily Bergen‚Äì√Ölesund‚ÄìTrondheim. The delivery of the Friendships made the Herons unnecessary, and these were sold. The two DC-3s were kept as a reserve, and were used for the first part of the summer schedules because of late delivery of LN-SUO. They were also used for charter. The airports at Hamar, Farsund and T√∏nsberg had too short runways for the Friendship, and these destinations were terminated.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 118‚Äì120 The first flight to the winter-only airport at Longyearbyen on Svalbard was made on 2 April 1959, when Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani chartered a DC-4 from Bardufoss Airport. Store Norske cleared a runway on snow for the aircraft. More flights were chartered during the 1960s, and Longyearbyen became a regular charter destination for Braathens SAFE.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 155‚Äì158 From 3 June to 30 September 1960, Braathens SAFE was granted concession on the route from Oslo via Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Aalborg Airport in Denmark. This became possible because SAS had abandoned the route the previous year. It was flown with a DC-3, giving an 80% load factor. On 22 July, the Braathens SAFE applied for a three-year concession, but this was rejected because SAS stated that they would restart the route. In 1961, SAS started the route Stavanger‚ÄìKristiansand‚Äì√Ölborg, and in 1963 on the route Oslo‚ÄìKristiansand‚Äì√Ölborg. The concession allowed SAS to also take passengers on the domestic legs, giving Braathens SAFE competition on the routes to Kristiansand.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 121 Fokker F-27 in 1974 Passengers traveling from Western to Northern Norway had to transfer from Braathens SAFE to SAS in Trondheim. Both airlines saw this as a strategic opportunity to get routes in each other's territories. On 31 August 1960, Braathens SAFE applied for an extension of its Bergen‚Äì√Ölesund‚ÄìTrondheim route onwards to Bod√∏ Airport and Bardufoss Airport. The two airports had been served by SAS from Oslo via Trondheim. SAS presented estimates that between 2.5 and 6.1 passengers transferred at Trondheim each day. Braathens SAFE later proposed that they could fly directly from Bergen and √Ölesund to Bod√∏ and Bardufoss, but Braathens SAFE's application was rejected by the ministry. All concessions ended on 31 March 1961, and the ministry extended them all one year. Three new airports, Alta Airport, Lakselv Airport, Banak and Kirkenes Airport, H√∏ybuktmoen, were about to open and the ministry wanted to award new concessions that included these airports. Braathens SAFE applied to operate to all the airports in Northern Norway, but the contract was awarded to SAS. The latter also applied to operate a route from Northern Norway via Trondheim, √Ölesund and Bergen to Stavanger, while Braathens SAFE in 1964 again applied for an extension of the West Coast route to Northern Norway. This was moderated to a direct route from Troms√∏ Airport to Bergen, which SAS received permission for on 4 March 1965.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 121‚Äì125 An additional F-27s was delivered in 1961, and two more in 1962. By then, the Oslo‚ÄìStavanger route was expanded to four daily round trips, of which two went via Kristiansand. √Ölesund had two round trips, while Trondheim had one. The coastal route had two services, and was branded as the \\"Airbus\\". In all, 175,202 passengers were transported, up 40% since the previous year.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 128‚Äì129 By 1965, the Trondheim, √Ölesund and coast routes had three round trips, while there were four to Kristiansand and five to Stavanger. That year, the right-winged Borten's Cabinet was appointed; Braathens SAFE therefore again applied for an extension of the West Coast route to Troms√∏ and Bod√∏. When the government signaled that it would support the application, it caused a major debate, particularly in Denmark and Sweden, and the Danish and Swedish governments threatened to terminate the SAS agreement. On 25 November 1966, with 82 against 62 votes, the Norwegian Parliament voted to allow Braathens SAFE to fly to Bod√∏ and Troms√∏ as an extension of the West Coast route from 1 April 1967.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 165‚Äì172 On 3 March 1967, parliament decided to build four short take-off and landing airports along the Helgeland coast between Trondheim and Bod√∏. Braathens placed an order for a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and planned to start the company Braathens STOL. It applied to operate the route without subsidies, but the concession was rejected and granted with subsidies to Wider√∏e, which had been operating the routes using seaplanes.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 180‚Äì181 Charter During the 1950s, the main customers for charter flights had been Norwegian shipping companies, who flew their crew home from ports in Central Europe. In 1959, Saga Tours was created as the first travel agency for Mediterranean charter trips, and the company started a cooperation with Braathens SAFE. The first DC-4 flew to Mallorca that year. In 1961, the company's first Douglas DC-6B was bought. It had a capacity of 96 passengers, and cooperation was also started with Metro and Paddan in Gothenburg. Other charter destinations were London, Alicante and M√°laga, both in Spain. That year, Braathens SAFE bought 50% of Saga Tours in a private placement. Braathens SAFE established an office in Gothenburg in 1965. After Vingresor had been bought by SAS and moved to Stockholm three years later, three employees started Atlas Resor in Gothenburg, and started using Braathens SAFE as their airline.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 131‚Äì134 By 1966, Braathens SAFE was operating seven DC-6s.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 165 The agreements with Spanish authorities allowed only airlines from the country of origin or from Spain to fly charter flights. But because of the SAS- cooperation, an agreement was made where any Scandinavian airline could fly to Spain from any of the three Scandinavian countries. Domestically, Braathens SAFE received strong competition from Sterling Airways, but on the other hand this allowed Braathens SAFE to fly charter flights from Sweden. In 1968, the large Swedish‚ÄìDanish charter airline Internord went bankrupt, giving Braathens SAFE increased charter traffic. The company also started purchasing a larger share of Altas Resor, until it took over all the whole company in 1978. In Sweden, Braathens SAFE used its partners to sell charter flights to Norway, and then continue their flights using scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE was hindered by the charter regulations from making intercontinental flights, as well as flights between the Scandinavian capitals. The rules also forced business travelers to use scheduled flights.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 134‚Äì138 Into the Jet Age In 1965, Braathens SAFE placed an order for three Boeing 737-200s, costing a total ofNOK 100 million. They were intended to do the main haul of the charter market.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 167 There had been an internal struggle as to whether the company should purchase the Fokker F-28 Fellowship or the Boeing 737-100, a shorter version of the 737-200. Having a single plane type would give a single pool of pilot and mechanic certifications, and would have saved the company NOK millions in costs. Following the decision to purchase the F-28, Bj√∏rn G. Braathen, son of Ludvig G. and later CEO, left the company.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 243‚Äì245 By 1966, Braathens SAFE had sold all its DC-4s, and had purchased eight F-27s. The DC-6s were used exclusively for charter, with all domestic flights being flown with the F-27s. The same year, the booking system was centralized and moved to offices in Oslo. The company established sales offices in Bod√∏ and Troms√∏ on 1 March 1967. A new cargo department was opened at Oslo Airport on 29 September. Braathens SAFE applied in a joint venture with the Norwegian America Line to start a cargo flight to the United States and the Far East, but this was declined by the ministry. From 1967, also DC-6s were used on domestic routes. In August, it was announced that Braathens SAFE would replace the F-27s with six new Fokker F-28, and that the F-27s would be sold to the manufacturer. Later, the number of orders of 737s was reduced to two, and of F-28s to five.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 173‚Äì178 The Fellowships cost NOK 40 million each.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 283 Braathens SAFE Boeing 737-200 in 1976 The first 737, LN-SUS, landed in Oslo on 8 January 1969, followed by LN-SUP on 31 January. Braathens SAFE was the launch customer of the F-28, and the first plane landed in Oslo on 3 March. Five F-28s were delivered in the course of a year, in addition to one aircraft that was leased periodically until 1971. There were several technical problems due to having the earliest models of the F-28, causing some operational difficulties. Two DC-6s were sold, and all but three of the F-27s were sold to Fokker between October 1968 and May 1969. Along with the aircraft came a new simulator, and the simulator division was moved from Sola to Fornebu. On 27 February 1970, the company took into use an IT-system, based at Sola.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 180‚Äì182 With the delivery of the Boeing 737-200s, Braathens SAFE started using these aircraft on the long-haul charter flights. By 1977, there were nine international charter airlines competing with Braathens SAFE: Aviaco, Britannia Airways, Dan-Air, Linjeflyg, Maersk Air, Scanair (owned by SAS), Spantax, Sterling and Transair. In 1976, good exchange rates gave a peak of flights to London, with eleven weekly flights across the North Sea. Braathens SAFE also started flying for Vingresor. In 1976, 44% of the company's revenue was from charter, but by 1979 it had dropped to 36%. During this period, about half of the planes' flying time was related to charter.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 136‚Äì141 More airports Braathens SAFE Boeing 737-200 at Faro Airport in 1986 Prior to the opening of Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, Braathens SAFE applied for a concession to fly to it along the West Coast, as well as the direct route from Oslo. SAS applied to fly the Oslo-service. The ministry wanted Braathens SAFE to fly the route with a concession granted to SAS, but Braathens SAFE rejected this. Instead, they were granted both the routes on temporary basis. The new airport received three daily flights to Oslo, of which two went via √Ölesund, and four services on the West Coast route. At the same time, there was a discussion about who was to operate the new STOL-airports on the West Coast. Braathens SAFE stated that they wanted a local airline to do the flying, and chose not to apply. The concession was granted to Wider√∏e, and Braathens SAFE subsequently bought part of the airline.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 183 On 5 April 1972, Molde Airport, √Ör√∏ opened. Unlike other primary airports, it had been built and financed by the municipality, and did not become state-owned until 1978. Braathens SAFE started flying both to Oslo and along the West Coast from Molde. The same year, the airline for the first time exceeded one million domestic passengers. It also started with five weekly cargo flights with flowers from Genova, Italy. The following year, the last DC-6 was sold, after the type had been phased out since 1969.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 184‚Äì185 The same year, the government appointed a commission, led by Bue Fjermeros, to look into the organization of the domestic air routes. Since the last compromise in splitting routes, the traffic had increased more in Braathens SAFE's domain that SAS'. The commission also looked a to whom the two next airports that would be opened, Haugesund Airport, Karm√∏y and Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes, would be given. Neither company wanted to cooperate beyond the existing arrangement of coordinating their routes time-wise, along with those of Wider√∏e. In addition, Braathens SAFE bought handling services from SAS at Gardermoen, Bergen, Bod√∏ and Troms√∏, while SAS bought handling services from Braathens SAFE at Stavanger. The commission granted SAS the rights to fly from Oslo to Haugesund, Harstad/Narvik and the new airport Svalbard Airport, Longyear. Braathens SAFE was allowed to fly from Bergen to Northern Norway via √Ölesund, Molde and Kristiansund. SAS lost the right to fly directly from Bergen to Northern Norway. When the matter was passed by parliament, they also granted SAS the right to fly from Oslo to Stavanger, even if their planes did not continue abroad.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 186‚Äì194 Flight 239 On 23 December 1972 at 16:30, the company's most fatal accident occurred. F-28 LN-SUY Sverre Sigurdson on Flight 239 from √Ölesund to Oslo crashed at Asker, killing 40 of the 45 people on board, including the crew of three. The cause of the accident was never discovered, although a possibility could have been faults with the instrument landing system.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 198‚Äì199 Times of change An accident with Boeing 737-200 LN-SUD on 31 October 1977 at Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik Following the steep increase of oil prices in 1973, Braathens SAFE increased the ticket prices with about 30%, giving for the first year a reduction in the number of travelers. The IT- system Bracar was introduced on 4 February 1974, connecting all locations with 53 terminals, rationalizing 20 man-years.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 194‚Äì197 In 1974, Ann√¶us Schj√∏dt jr. became chair, and the following year, the employees were represented with two board members. The remaining three F-27s were sold to the Braathens Rederi-owned Busy Bee between 1975 and 1977. From 1 January 1976, Braathens SAFE introduced \\"Green Routes\\", where passengers were granted 35% discount if they traveled on Saturdays or Sunday morning, booked a round trip and were away for at least a full week or over a weekend. From 1972 to 1976, the company's revenue doubled, to NOK 500 million, while production increased 18%. The main contributing factor was the increase of labor costs, that had almost doubled in the four years, although also higher fuel prices and taxes contributed. In 1976, the airline transported 1,154,000 scheduled and 485,000 chartered passengers. Braathens SAFE had a 37% scheduled market share and 31% share of the charter flights. The largest traffic increases were in Stavanger, Bergen and Trondheim. During the late 1970s, Braathens SAFE increased the number of direct flights between these cities, without increasing the number of landings in √Ölesund and Kristiansand. From 1 April 1977, the airline lost its dispensation to operate with reduced cabin crew, and was forced to increase the number on the F-28 from one to two, and on the 737 from two to three. At the same time, the airline introduced in-flight meals.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 203‚Äì211 Ludvig G. Braathen died on 27 December 1976 while he was still CEO. He was succeeded by his son Bj√∏rn G. Braathen, who had returned to the company a few years earlier.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 212‚Äì213 In 1977, Braathens SAFE made NOK 10 million in profit on the Trondheim route and NOK 4 million on the routes from Oslo to Kristiansand and Stavanger. At the same time, the airline lost NOK 6 million on the routes to from Oslo to √Ölesund, Molde and Kristiansund, and NOK 18 million on the coastal routes between Stavanger and Troms√∏. From 1 October 1978, the company also introduced 50% youth discount for people under 26 years. From 1 May 1978, there was introduced a NOK 100 tax on international charter flights. The same year, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of Bergenske Dampskibsselskab, that owned 51% of the travel agency Bennett Reisebureau. This was to try to secure influence over the chain, that was also owned 31% by SAS. A new, neutral ticketing system, SMART, was introduced in 1980 for all travel agents in Norway and Sweden. Following this, Braathens SAFE sold its stake in Bergenske with a profit.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 233‚Äì237 Starting with the delivery of the F-28s and 737s, all planes were named after Norwegian kings. The last three F-27s were also given such names.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 364‚Äì365 During the 1970s, Braathens SAFE took delivery of eleven 737s, supplementing the four F-28s. The third delivered, LN-SUA, had a cargo door on the side, making it ideal for cargo flights. The three planes delivered in 1979 had extended range tanks making direct flights to the Canary Islands possible. In 1979, the company started looking into possible replacements for their fleet, considering larger aircraft.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 237 The late 1970s and early 1980s was a time of economic problems for airlines worldwide. Passenger numbers stabilized, and Braathens SAFE introduced a 15% discount to purchasers of 100 tickets at one time. The company hit NOK 1 billion in revenue in 1981. Discounted tickets were not sufficient to cover the increasing costs, particularly related to fuel, and the company introduced the internal campaign Bra-82. This involved a more market-oriented management and a focus on service increase, including better regularity and free coffee. During the summer, the reduced demand made the airline introduce discounted \\"summer tickets\\" for NOK 280 on any route in Southern Norway. This gave a 75% load factor, the highest for the whole year.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 261‚Äì267 Busy Bee flew Fokker F-27s for Braathens on routes too small for 737s In 1982, Braathens SAFE bought 15% of DNL. It also applied, though the sister company Braathens Helikopter, for concessions for helicopter services from Stavanger to offshore oil platforms. As a reaction, the incumbent, Helikopter Service, applied for Braathens SAFEs West Coast routes. At this point, SAS bought 15% of Helikopter Service. In 1984, Braathens SAFE introduced services to Farsund Airport, using wet leased F-27s from Busy Bee. The same arrangement was used to connect Haugesund to Bergen and Stavanger. In Haugesund, this was in competition with Norving. Busy Bee-operated planes were also used on routes from Sandefjord in competition with Norsk Flytjeneste. The same year, the cabin crew had a 14-day strike, halting all flights. It was caused by the company paying lower wages than SAS and Busy Bee. In 1985, a new booking system was introduced, that allowed overbooking. This gave increased revenue, but the company had to start compensating rejected passengers with a full refund and a free seat on the next flight.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 268‚Äì277 On 16 December 1985, the airline's administration moved into the a new building, the Diamond, located at Fornebu.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 280 The frequent flyer program Bracard was launched in September 1985. It was a cooperation with Inter Nor Hotels, and gave special privileges to travelers that made 25 full-price trips per year with Braathens. New Boeings In 1980, the management of Braathens SAFE decided that it needed larger aircraft if the company was to stay competitive on charter flights. Larger aircraft could be put into service on the main services from Oslo, Gothenburg and Stockholm, while the 737s could be used to smaller destination and from other cities. On 25 February 1980, the company announced that it had ordered two Boeing 767-200 planes, with an option for two addition craft. The cost of the two firm orders was about NOK 500 million. This would allow the aircraft to be used for both domestic scheduled flights and for charter, and was configured with 242 seats. This was less than charter-only airlines, for instance Britannia had their planes configured with 273 seats. Braathens SAFE's planes were delivered on 23 March and in November 1984. The following year showed increasing charter traffic, although it only made up 25% of the company's revenue.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 144‚Äì148 The company had considered the smaller Boeing 757, but did not have sufficient range.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 245 Also the Airbus A310 was close to being chosen.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 256 The 767s were launched as \\"First Business Class\\" to charter travelers, but the business model was not successful. The new consumer groups entering the market had low willingness to pay, and the demand for premium charter services was low. The company was faced with not being able to charter out the plane because of the low seat numbers, but could not put in the extra seats because of the aircraft also being used on the scheduled market. Using so large aircraft on the short- haul flights in Southern Norway gave little economy-of-scale, and the airline seldom needed the increased capacity. Braathens SAFE also had problems, because from order to delivery, the exchange rates had increased from 5 to 9 NOK per USD, almost doubling the price in NOK. In 1986, the two 767s were sold. Two years later, Altas Resor was sold, and the following year Saga. Braathens SAFE closed its bases in Gothenburg and Stockholm, but remained a charter operator with 737s from Norway.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 148‚Äì150 Boeing 767-200 LN-SUV at Stockholm-Arlanda Airport in 1984 Following the decision to sell the two 767s, management also decided to sell the four remaining F-28s. This would allow Braathens to operate a fleet of pure 737-200, giving lower operating costs. One 737 was taken out of service in 1984, and the four F-28s sold in 1986. The same year, seven more 737-200s were delivered, along with two more in 1987 and 1988. By then, Braathens SAFEs entire fleet consisted of nineteen 737-200s. At the same time, Boeing had launched the 737-300, a slightly larger aircraft with new CFM-56 engines. Braathens SAFE considered the new aircraft, but where concerned that it used a traditional mechanical cockpit. The airline also needed larger aircraft for the charter traffic, and smaller aircraft for the domestic routes. The airline also considered the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and the Airbus A320, but settled on the 737 following the announcement of the stretched 737-400, with 156 seats, and the shortened 737-500, with 124 seats. These had glass cockpits, and Braathens SAFE would be among the first airlines to receive both models. To finance the purchase, the airline sold all but two of the 737-200s and leased them back. For some of the aircraft, they received more money than they had paid.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 247‚Äì249 Hijacking On 21 June 1985, the 737-200 LN-SUG Harald Gille, with 121 passengers en route from Trondheim to Oslo, was hijacked by the 24-year-old Stein Arvid Huseby. He had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun. He demanded to talk to Prime Minister K√•re Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona R√∏kke and a press conference to make a political statement. His demands were not met, and he surrendered while the plane was parked in Oslo. This was the first hijacking in Norway.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 279 Competition and new planes A Braathens SAFE Boeing 737-400 in 1989 The F-28s had the largest regularity problems, mostly due to the number of landings, which could count up to 16 per day. For instance, LN-SUO flew 36,000 hours with 76,000 landings. The last flight was made on 16 December 1986, and the aircraft sold for NOK 45 million each. Although the F-28 was taken out of service, some of the routes on the West Coast needed to be operated with smaller aircraft than the 737. The company made an agreement to wet lease Busy Bee F-27s one some of the routes, while the most trafficked ones would be taken over by 737s.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 280‚Äì283 A 1985 government committee, led by State Secretary Per Arne Watle, recommended that more route be flown by both Braathens SAFE and SAS, and that additional airlines be allowed to start other routes. On 5 September 1985, Braathens SAFE applied for the route Trondheim ‚Äì Bod√∏ ‚Äì Harstad/Narvik ‚Äì Troms√∏ and Troms√∏‚ÄìLongyearbyen. SAS had stated that it was fine with them if other airlines started flying international routes they did not, and on 17 October Braathens SAFE also applied for the routes Bergen‚ÄìStavanger‚ÄìParis, Bergen‚ÄìStavanger‚ÄìManchester, Oslo‚ÄìStavanger‚ÄìBrussels and Trondheim‚ÄìBergen‚ÄìNewcastle.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 275‚Äì277 The applications were rejected and it was agreed upon that SAS would retain all rights to fly internationally between Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Copenhagen and √Örhus.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 290 A new round of concession applications were filed in 1987: Trondheim to Northern Norway, Troms√∏‚ÄìLongyearbyen, Oslo‚ÄìBillund and Oslo‚ÄìAlicante. The right-winged Willoch's Second Cabinet decided to use three principles in issuing new concessions: keeping the array of local routes, granting concessions on the terms that the airlines would continue to cross-subsidize routes, and to introduce competition on the largest routes. Braathens SAFE was given permission to fly Oslo‚ÄìBergen and Western Norway ‚Äì Trondheim ‚Äì Bod√∏ ‚Äì Troms√∏, plus once daily Oslo‚ÄìTrondheim‚ÄìBod√∏, as well as Troms√∏‚ÄìLongyearbyen. At the same time, SAS was allowed to fly freely on the routes Oslo‚ÄìTrondheim and Oslo‚ÄìStavanger.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 291‚Äì294 In 1988, Braathens SAFE introduced automatic check-in machines in Oslo, Stavanger, Bergen, √Ölesund and Trondheim. The routes operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle for Braathens SAFE on the West Coast The first 737-400, LN-BRA, was delivered to the airline on 9 July 1989.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 295‚Äì300 The 19 737-200s were gradually handed to their owners, while seven 737-400s and seventeen 737-500s were delivered until 1994. The investment cost NOK 4.5 billion. By the end of 1993, the company had NOK 3.4 billion in debt.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 309 On 1 June 1989, Erik G. Braathen, son of Bj√∏rn G., took over as CEO at the age of 34.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 305 In 1992, Busy Bee filed for bankruptcy; the company's fleet of three Fokker 50s were transferred to the newly established Norwegian Air Shuttle, which started wet-leased operations along the West Coast for Braathens SAFE. As demand increased through the 1990s, the fleet was extended to six aircraft. International routes Braathens SAFE was also given the right to fly its first international scheduled flights for the first time in several decades. On 19 August 1988, the airline was granted concession to fly to Billund in Denmark. At the same time, Air-X was granted concession to fly the route via Sandefjord and Skien. The route started on 2 May 1989. Previously the rules stated that if SAS flew to a non-Scandinavian destination from any capital, no other Scandinavian airlines could fly to that city. Braathens SAFE lost many contracts in the charter market in 1990, following Scanair's purchase of larger Douglas DC-10 aircraft. On 18 May 1990, Braathens SAFE was awarded the concession a route from Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger to Newcastle, which opened on 3 April 1991. The airline was also awarded the route from Troms√∏ to Murmansk, Russia, once per week from 28 January 1993. Braathens SAFE Boeing 737-500 in 1990 in a special summer livery On 19 June 1990, SAS announced that all its services to London Gatwick Airport would be moved to London Heathrow Airport, where most of its services had landed. The same day, the Ministry of Transport announced that any Scandinavian airline could apply for and receive concessions to fly to Gatwick. On 25 June, Braathens SAFE applied to fly to London, but instead wanted to fly to London Stansted Airport, to have better landing slots. The concession was granted on 18 January 1991, but the airline chose to not start the route. The company had been granted a concession to Malm√∏ in Sweden, and the route opened on 2 May 1991 with two daily departures. This was later reduced to one. In October 1992, the two airlines that flew from Oslo to Gatwick, Norway Airlines and Dan-Air, filed for bankruptcy. [--> this information is false: Dan-Air never filed for bankruptcy; they got taken over by British Airways in November 1992!] Braathens SAFE immediately decided to start the route, with a departure at about 10:30 that would allow connections to the rest of the domestic network. Six days later, the first schedules were published in the newspaper, slots and British permission was granted three days after that. Another two days after that, the service started.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 299‚Äì304 At the time, Denmark was a member of the European Union (EU), while Sweden and Norway had applied and were awaiting referenda to determine membership. EU was working to deregulate the airline market from 1995, which could cause problems for the Scandinavian agreements. In preparation for this, Braathens SAFE started negotiations with Linjeflyg of Sweden and Maersk Air of Denmark to crate an alliance to compete with SAS. In particular, the three airlines wanted to capture the two million passengers that travelled between the three Scandinavian capitals: Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. Instead, SAS was given permission to purchase Linjeflyg in exchange for the Swedish airline market being deregulated from 1 July 1992.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 303‚Äì304 From 23 October 1992, the Norwegian Armed Forces stopped chartering aircraft and started using scheduled flights to fly 240,000 personnel annually. Since most of the transport was between Northern and Southern Norway, this gave reduced revenue for Braathens SAFE.Tjomsland and Wilsberg, 1995: 319‚Äì320 Helicopters On 1 September 1989, Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi founded Braathens Helikopter. The shipping company had signed an agreement with the oil companies Norsk Hydro, Phillips Petroleum and Statoil to provide helicopter transport for their crews to their offshore oil installations Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk. This was the first time the incumbent Helikopter Service had received competition on their offshore helicopter services. The initial agreement secured Braathens Helikopter a revenue of NOK 800 million in the course of five years, and gave the company a 20% market share. Four 19-seet A√©rospatiale Super Puma helicopters were ordered, each costing NOK 60 million. Total investment costs were NOK 300 million. Two helicopters were stationed at Stavanger Airport, Sola and two at Bergen Airport, Flesland. The initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year. Aerospatiale AS-332 Super Puma at Groningen Airport in 1990 Twenty-two pilots were hired along with a total staff of 70, and services started on 1 September 1990. In June 1991, Braathens Helikopter signed a three-year agreement with Amoco for flights from Stavanger to Valhall. The contract had an option for a two-year extension. The revenue was between NOK 100 and 200 million, depending on the length of the contract and the capacity needed. Operations started in February 1992, and involved the company purchasing another two Super Pumas. On 10 September, Braathens Helikopter was awarded the contract with British Petroleum for flights from Stavanger to Ula and Gyda. The contract gave a revenue of up to NOK 300 million in the course five years. Operations started on 1 November 1992, and involved about 2,000 hours of flying per year. With this contract, Braathens Helikopter had about a 30% market share. Braathens purchased one more Super Puma as a consequence of the contract. After operations started, the company had grown to 120 employees and was the second-largest helicopter operator in the country. Braathens Helikopter and Helikopter Service announced on 1 October 1993 that the two companies would merge from 1 January 1994. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi would be paid with NOK 225 million in Helikopter Service shares. The Norwegian Competition Authority stated they would have to look at the merger, since the new company would have an almost-monopoly on offshore flights. However, the ministry stated that the authority could not hinder the merger, because by the time new contracts were awarded in 1995, helicopter operators from foreign countries would also be allowed to bid. The ownership of Braathens Helikopter was transferred to Helikopter Service on 14 December. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi received 14% of the shares in the merged company. They were immediately sold, giving Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi a NOK 170 million profit on the five-year venture.

You may also be looking for: territorial changes of Poland or polonization. Poland has never had any formal colonial territories, but over its history the acquisition of such territories has at times been contemplated, though never attempted. The closest Poland came to acquiring such territories was indirectly through the actions of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a fief of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth The Polish nobility was interested in colonies as early as the mid-16th century. In a contractual agreement, signed with king Henri de Valois (see also Henrician Articles), the nobles secured permission to settle in some oversea territories of the Kingdom of France, but after de Valois's decision to opt for the crown of France and return to his homeland, the idea was abandoned. Duchy of Courland and Semigallia On the basis of the Union of Vilnius (28 November 1561), Gotthard Kettler, the last Master of the Livonian Order, created the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia in the Baltics and became its first Duke. It was a vassal state of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Soon afterward, by the Union of Lublin (1 July 1569), the Grand Duchy became the part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Dariusz Ko≈Çodziejczyk, CZY RZECZPOSPOLITA MIA≈ÅA KOLONIE W AFRYCE I AMERYCE? , M√≥wiƒÖ wieki Some colonial territories for the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia were acquired by its third Duke and Gotthard's grandson Jacob Kettler. In his youth and during his studies abroad he was inspired by the wealth being brought back to various western European countries from their colonies. As a result, Kettler established one of the largest merchant fleets in Europe, with its main harbours in Windau (today Ventspils), and Libau (today LiepƒÅja). The Commonwealth never concerned itself with the Duchy of Courland's colonial aspirations, even though in 1647 Kettler met with king W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Waza, and suggested creation of a joint trade company, which would be active in India. However, the ailing king was not interested, and Kettler decided to act on his own. New Courland Trinidad and Tobago on a world map The first colony founded by Jacob was the New Courland (Neu-Kurland) on the Caribbean island of Tobago. However, three initial attempts to establish a settlement (in 1637, 1639 and 1642) failed. The fourth was founded in 1654, but eventually in 1659 was taken over by a competing Dutch colony, also founded on the island in 1654. Courland regained the island after the Treaty of Oliva in 1660 but abandoned it in 1666. It briefly attempted to reestablish colonies there again in 1668 and in 1680 (that lasted to 1683). The final attempt in 1686 lasted till 1690. Gambia Courland settlements in Africa In 1651 Courland bought James Island (then called St. Andrews Island by the Europeans) from a local tribe, establishing Fort James there and renaming the island. Courland also took other local land including St. Mary Island (modern day Banjul) and Fort Jillifree. The colony exported sugar, tobacco, coffee, cotton, ginger, indigo, rum, cocoa, tortoise shells, tropical birds and their feathers. The governors had very good relations with the locals, but were in conflict with other European powers, primarily Denmark, Sweden, and England. England eventually took over Courland's African territories in 1661. Toco The final Courish attempt to establish a colony involved the settlement near modern Toco on Trinidad, Lesser Antilles. Partitioned Poland Cameroon expedition In 1882, almost a century after Poland was partitioned and lost its independence, Polish nobleman and officer of Russian Imperial Fleet, Stefan Szolc-Rogozi≈Ñski organized an expedition to Cameroon.EXPEDITION Out to Sea , 4 September 2003, Warsaw VoiceRogozi≈Ñski Stefan, Encyklopedia WIEM Officially that was an exploration expedition, but unofficially the expedition was looking for a place a Polish community could be founded abroad. Stefan Szolc-Rogozi≈Ñski (1861-1896) He had no official support from the Russian Empire, nor from its puppet Congress Poland, but was backed by a number of influential Poles, including Boleslaw Prus, and Henryk Sienkiewicz. On 13 December 1882, accompanied by Leopold Janikowski and Klemens Tomczek, Rogozi≈Ñski left French port of Le Havre, aboard a ship Lucja Malgorzata, with French and Polish flags. The expedition was a failure, and he returned to Europe, trying to collect more money for his project. Finally, after second expedition, Rogozi≈Ñski found himself in Paris, where he died 1 December 1896. Meanwhile, Cameroon was being taken over by Germany and Great Britain. In 1884 Rogozi≈Ñski signed an agreement with a British representative, who was to provide protection to his settlement, but next year, at the Congress of Berlin, Great Britain ceded its Cameroon possessions to Germany (see Kamerun). Second Polish Republic Poland regained independence in the aftermath of World War I. While colonization was never a major focus of the Second Polish Republic, certain organizations like the Maritime and Colonial League supported the idea of creating Polish colonies. The Maritime and Colonial League traces its origins to the Polska Bandera (Polish Banner) organization founded on 1 October 1918. Taras Hunczak, Polish Colonial Ambitions in the Inter-War Period, Slavic Review, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Dec., 1967), pp. 648-656, JSTOR The League supported purchases of lands by Polish emigrants in places like Brazil and Liberia. The League became highly influential in shaping the government's policies with regards to Polish Merchant Marine, despite its long and ongoing campaign (publications, exhibitions, speeches, lobbying, etc.) and public support, it has however never succeeded in following up with its plans to obtain a colonial territory for Poland. Furthermore, in 1926, Colonial Society (Towarzystwo Kolonizacyjne) was founded in Warsaw. Its task was to direct Polish emigrants to South America, and the Society soon became active there, mostly in Brazilian state of Espirito Santo.Jerzy Mazurek. Kraj a emigracja: ruch ludowy wobec wychod≈∫stwa ch≈Çopskiego, page 151 Some historians, such as Tadeusz Piotrowski, have characterized government policies supporting interwar Polish settlement in modern-day Ukraine and Belarus as colonization (see Osadnik). Using a highly theoretical framework, one scholar argues that Poland's settlement projects, in particular the Liberian affair, should be seen as a rework of the New South ideology that considered Africans as people who could only implement hard labour such as land cultivation and assume inferior economic and political positions, as attributed to African- Americans in the New South. Such projects, the argument goes, would lead to the prioritization of European lives over Africans' with economic and racial implications. In contrast, several Polish and Polish-American historians attribute fewer racist motivations to Poland's attempts in Africa and Latin America. They point out that Poland's largely economic attempts to acquire tropical materials unavailable in continental Europe became infused with counterproductive colonial discourse still popular across Europe at the time. The Polish projects, less politically expansionist than they might seem, fulfilled specific functions in Polish foreign policy not only in relation to the question of Jewish emigration but also in Polish-German relations. The following regions were considered for Polish colonization during the interwar period: * Brazil (Paran√° region): Polish emigration to that region began even before World War I, in the 1930s approximately 150,000 Poles lived there (18.3% of local inhabitants). Government-sponsored settlement action began there in 1933, after the Maritime and Colonial League, together with other organizations, had bought a total of 250,000 hectares of land. Brazilian government, fearing that the Poles might plan to annex part of Brazil, reacted very quickly, limiting activities of Polish organizations. Since the government in Warsaw did not want to intervene, the project ended by late 1930s See also: Polish minority in Brazil * Peru (near Ucayali River): positively sassed in 1927. In January 1928, Polish expedition headed for the area of the Ucayali, to check possibilities of creation of settlements for farmers on several thousand hectares of rainforest. Soon afterward, first settlers arrived in Peru, but because of the Great Crisis, the government in Warsaw ceased to fund the action. Private donations were insufficient, furthermore, the first settlers discovered the local condition to be much worse than advertised. In 1933, the contract with the Peruvians was terminated, and to avoid international scandal, all settlers returned to Poland.Jerzy Mazurek. Kraj a emigracja: ruch ludowy wobec wychod≈∫stwa ch≈Çopskiego, page 152 * Angola: On 14 December 1928, the Maritime and Colonial League sent an expedition to Angola, which was then a Portuguese colony. The plan was to try to bring as many Polish immigrants as possible, and then try to purchase some land from the Portuguese. However, after five years, one of the first pioneers in Angola, Michal Zamoyski, wrote: \\"Personally, I would not persuade anybody to live in Angola\\". Living conditions were difficult, profits were marginal, and the idea was abandoned. * Liberia: Liberian and Polish governments had good relations because of Polish support for Liberia in the League of Nations. In the fall of 1932, the League of Nations drafted a plan which projected turning Liberia into a protectorate, governed by one of members of the League. The plan was the result of internal policies of Liberia, where slavery was widespread. Since Poland was not regarded by the Liberians as a country which had colonial aspirations, in late 1932 unofficial envoy of Liberian government, dr Leo Sajous, came to Warsaw to ask for help. In April 1933, an agreement was signed between Liberia and the Maritime and Colonial League. The Africans agreed to lease minimum of 60 hectares of land to Polish farmers, for a period of 50 years. Polish businesses were awarded the status of the most favoured nation, and Warsaw was permitted to found a society to exploit natural resources of Liberia. Liberian government invited settlers from Poland in 1934. Altogether, the Liberians granted to Polish settlers 50 plantations, with total area of . In the second half of 1934, six Polish farmers left for Liberia: Gizycki, Szablowski, Brudzinski, Chmielewski, Januszewicz and Armin. The project was not fully supported by the Polish government but rather by the Maritime League; only few dozens of Poles took on that offer (because of Liberian requests that the settlers should bring significant capital) and their ventures proved to be, on the most part, unprofitable. The original of the agreement has been lost, but, according to some sources, there was a secret protocol that allowed Poland to draft 100,000 African soldiers. The Polish involvement in Liberia was harshly opposed by the United States of America, creator of the nation of Liberia. As a result of American pressure, in 1938 the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs closed the office of the Maritime and Colonial League in Monrovia. * Mozambique: plans for colonization of Mozambique were tied to business investments by some Polish enterprise near the late 1930s and never progressed beyond normal foreign investment (acquisition of agricultural lands and mines). * Madagascar: another plan for acquiring the French colony of Madagascar by the Polish government was discussed in 1926, but the idea was deemed to be unfeasible. The idea was revisited in the 1930s, when it was proposed that Polish Jews, who were perceived to dominate the Polish professions, be encouraged to emigrate. At one point, Polish foreign minister J√≥zef Beck bluntly proposed that Madagascar be used as a \\"dumping ground\\" for Poland's \\"surplus\\" Jewish population. The Polish government proposed the concept of Jewish emigration to Madagascar to the League of Nations in 1936 and sent a delegation to evaluate the island in 1937. France, seeking to strengthen its ties with Poland and discourage Polish-German cooperation, participated in the venture, which included the French official Marcel Moutet. Warsaw sent a special delegation to Madagascar, under major of the Polish Army Mieczyslaw Lepecki. The plan is variously described as having come to nought shortly after the 1937 expedition or as being terminated by the German Invasion of Poland in September 1939.Michal Jarnecki, Madagascar in Polish Colonial Ideas and Plans, published in Nationalities Affairs (28/2006) * Tanganyika and Cameroon: Various Polish authors, unsupported by the government, expressed interests in this region on the grounds that they were in part discovered by Stefan Szolc-Rogozi≈Ñski and that Europe owed a general debt to Poland for the Polish-Soviet War. * Palestine was also considered as a destination for Polish Jews. Colonel Josef Beck, then Minister of Foreign Affairs, supported the concept.

The show has focused especially on Justin's stressful and awkward relationship with his son, Marcus, and on his equally strained relationship with Marcus's mother, Donna Logan, whom he eventually marries. The character, who first appeared in 2009, is played by Aaron D. Spears. In July 2010, Spears was demoted to a recurring cast member, making appearances until April 2011, at such time he was re-upped to a regular. Starting with April 2012, he was once again demoted to recurring status, making sporadic appearances. In October 2017, Spears returned to regular status. Two years later, it was announced that Spears had been demoted to recurring status. Storylines Justin, the Executive Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions for Spencer Publications, was summoned by his boss and confidant Bill Spencer, Jr. to his side in LA, in Bill's bid to wrestle the struggling Forrester Creations from the Forresters. Shortly after the takeover, while enjoying a cocktail with Bill and Katie Logan, Bill informed Justin that Katie's sister Donna would be joining them and Justin was shocked to see that Bill had meant Donna Logan, Justin's high school sweetheart who had disappeared from his life mysteriously years ago. Justin was talented basketball player in high school and in college on the East Coast with the ability to go into the NBA according Bill. He suffered a career ending knee injury that required five surgeries and doctors said he's be lucky to walk. Justin recovered and refocused his competitive nature from basketball to business working his way to becoming Bill Spencer, Jr.'s right hand man. After the awkward evening together, Donna confided in Katie that Justin was the father of her son, Marcus, who shared a close relationship with Donna's new husband, Eric Forrester. After agonizing over the decision of whether or not to tell Justin about Marcus, Donna decided to keep silent about the matter, but Justin quickly learned all about Donna's African-American son, and, after an intense confrontation with Donna, learned he was Marcus' father. In November 2009, Justin demanded that Donna let him know his son, and Donna reluctantly agreed. It was in November that Justin also began producing an ambitious new fashion talk show, The Catwalk, and, in an obvious attempt to get close to Donna again, invited her to become the host, a position which she would share along with Pam Douglas. In December 2009, Justin, noticing sexual tension between Bill and Steffy Forrester, warned his friend that Steffy was only after him to win back Forrester Creations for her father, and that many other powerhouses had fallen from grace after falling victim to a seductive woman over the course of history. Justin also made an appealing offer to Donna, offering to relieve her stress from work by taking her on a romantic getaway. In February 2010, Justin offered Bill, whose stress continued to build because of Steffy Forrester's plotting, a friend to talk to, only for Bill to rudely dismiss him. A few months later, Justin returned to aid Bill in a bold attempt to take back a portion of Forrester Creations by capitalizing on Donna and Eric Forrester's marriage woes after the suspicious drowning of Donna's mother, Beth Logan. On the behalf of Spencer Publications, Justin wrote up a list of demands in Donna's name, which included 12.5% of Eric's 25% share of Forrester Creations, which she later got thanks to Bill. After delivering the letter to Bill, Justin comforted Donna and reminded her that he was still interested in rekindling his relationship with her. She hasn't decided yet if that's what she wants right now at the moment due to her divorce from Eric. Most recently, he upset his boss, Bill, when he decided to tamper with Steffy's presentation by exposing his sister-in-law Brooke's affair with Oliver Jones in order to cause a scandal at Forrester which Justin hoped would benefit Spencer Publications. Justin and Donna rekindle their relationship after many years and talk about many things. Donna even gets teary-eyed when she talks about Marcus and why giving him up for adoption was the best decision for all involved. Justin is understanding of her. In February 2011, Donna and Justin married. Justin's cousin, Olivia, was a guest at the wedding, confirming his relation to the Barber/Winters family of The Young and the Restless. In November of that year, they divorced for personal reasons feeling they aren't like a married couple. They remain friends as well as loving parents to Marcus and loving grandparents to their granddaughter, Rosie Barber Forrester. In 2018 Justin's niece, Emma, began an internship at Forrester Creations.

Housing a motor and counterweight inside a giant wheel, the driver sits on a platform that extends out in front of the device. This is in contrast to the typical monowheels and their long history, where the rider sits inside the wheel. By moving the wheel's center of gravity forward, the wheel turns. Inside is a lead-weighted engine, which hangs by bearings off a stationary center shaft and uses its torque to move from 0 degrees vertical when stationary to 90 degrees forward at full blast, continually pulling itself forward around a sprocket bolted to the outer spokes. An independent counterweight system keeps the driver floating gently above ground out front, instead of inside the wheel, where most monowheel designs sequester him. Steering is handled by a gyro system and the driver's shifting weight. History Part-time programmer and Renaissance Fair jouster Jake Lyall had never worked for a garage, studied engineering, or even held a welder before he built the RIOT Wheel. Lyall spent $5,000 and 900 hours building a massive 1,100-pound motorized monowheel. The RIOT Wheel (which stands for Reinvention of the Wheel) reaches a top speed of about 28 mph. So far Lyall has no commercial designs on the project, which debuted at 2003's Burning Man Festival. He hopes that a refined electric version will break the monowheel land-speed record of 57 mph. Since the creation of the RIOT wheel, there have been 2 more designed RIOT 2 and RIOT 3. RIOT 2 utilizes a hybrid/electric engine and is mostly aluminum which makes it weigh significantly less. Its gyro is better designed, so it is more effective, while lighter and faster. The RIOT 3 is solely designed for beating the world single-wheel land-speed record. It is powered by a Kostov DC electric motor, which can (for short periods) produce 200 hp. Many electric vehicles have weight problems due to the batteries they utilize, and are slower because of that. The RIOT 3 however, is able to use the weight to its advantage.

Description Quercus libani is a deciduous tree growing to . The deciduous leaf is slender, elongated and often asymmetrical, its base is round and its tip is slightly pointed. In the adult state the leaf's upper side is dark green and the under side is pale green. The flowers are monoecious, meaning that flowers from both sexes can be found on the same tree. They are pollinated by wind. The tree produces acorns that grow to about 2 cm to 3.6 cm in diameter. Its length is half covered by the cupule. Quercus libani leaves. Lebanon oak's green acorns with spiny cupule. Uses Lebanon oak wood is very hard and resistant to insect and fungal attack and is used in construction . Food The Quercus libani acorns are very bitter due to high concentrations of tannins. This bitter taste can be leached out by washing the acorns in running water, but this causes the loss of many beneficial minerals. The acorns can be dried and ground it into a powder and used to thicken stews and may be mixed with cereals for making bread. The roasted bitter acorns may be used as a coffee substitute. Medicinal Galls produced by the larvae of different insects that may be found on the trees have especially high tannin concentrations, are highly astringent and were used in the treatment of haemorrhage and diarrhea. Tannin from the galls are also used as dye. Cultivation Ornamental tree Quercus libani is cultivated and planted as an ornamental tree in gardens, parks, and habitat restoration projects. It is successful in drought tolerant landscape gardens. The Lebanon oak can grow in medium loamy to heavy clay soils, with no preference to soil acidity. The tree can be grown in direct sunlight to semi- shade. It can endure strong winds, but not salty maritime exposures. The Lebanon oak does not tolerate root disturbance well, therefore landscape trees should not be moved once planted, or transplanted from native habitats. Acorns sown in situ will actually produce the best trees, in growth rate and deep rooted drought tolerance. The acorns are sown as they ripen. Acorns lose their viability if they dry out, and so need to be kept in a moist and cool place away from rodents until planting. Biological pest control The leaf litter of the Lebanon oak is used as a biological pest control‚Äîherbivore insect repellent for protecting other plants. Its leaves placed as a mulch layer around vulnerable plants effectively repels snails, slugs, and grubs. Fresh leaves can inhibit plant growth, and so are not used directly from the tree. Being deciduous, much beneficial leaf litter is produced in the autumn.

Early life  Clarke was born on 15 February 1897. He grew up in London and was known to his friends as Nobby, as he would be throughout his life. He attended Greenwich Hospital School (now part of the National Maritime Museum) and the Grocers' Company School (later renamed Hackney Downs School). He studied at the University of London; but he abandoned this for a two-year certificate course with the Officer Training Corps when the First World War broke out in 1914.  World War I  Clarke was gazetted as a Second Lieutenant in the Devonshire Regiment. He then transferred to the 9th Battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment with 23rd Division. This unit was a Pioneer Battalion, whose duties involved tunnelling, and general explosives work. Clarke became an explosives expert and he was said to have loved making loud bangs. Clarke served with the British Expeditionary Force in France. From October 1917 he served in Italy. He was awarded the Military Cross for his part in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto in 1918. Early personal life In August 1928, Clarke married Dorothy Aileen Kendrick. They had three children, John, David and Roger.  Low Loading Trailer Company  Clarke moved to Bedford and became director of HP Webb and Co Ltd., a motor manufacturing firm. He registered patents relating to engine design. In 1924 he bought a house in Tavistock Street, Bedford, together with an adjacent commercial garage; here he started his own engineering firm. In his spare time he built his own design of car engine, but he found that it was not commercially viable because other manufacturers could make similar engines more economically. Clarke's brother ran a large farm and Clarke realised that there was a market for trailers of various types. Clarke thought that existing two-wheeled trailers waggled about too much ‚Äì particularly horse boxes. He established the Low Loading Trailer Company Ltd. (LoLode for short) in Bedford. LoLode produced a wide range of trailers based on Clarke's design for a low-slung chassis and four close-coupled wheels with a stable suspension system. LoLode became known for building caravans to customer requirements. Standard features included Clarke's anti-rolling system with shock absorbers and hydraulic brakes. On-board batteries, water tanks, petrol generators and other internal equipment attracted attention at shows. Clarke's chassis and suspension design allowed passengers travelling in the caravan (which was permitted at that time) at a speed of to pour drinks without spilling them, and some LoLode caravans even featured a gimbal-mounted chemical toilet for use while travelling. After placing an advertisement in The Caravan & Trailer, he received a visit from the magazine's editor, Stuart Macrae. Macrae later recalled their first meeting: > Clarke at once fascinated me. He was a very large man with rather hesitant > speech who at first struck me as being amiable but not outstandingly bright. > The second part of this impression did not last long. Macrae was particularly impressed by Clarke's latest caravan. It was an enormous double-decked design; streamlined and futuristic, it included a toilet and a shower with hot and cold water. Macrae wrote a piece about it in his magazine. In February 1940 the Low Loading Trailer Company contributed ¬£6 18s to the Finland Fund at the time of Finland's Winter War conflict with the Soviet Union.The Finland Fund. The Times, 6 February 1940 p.3.  Limpet mine  Cecil Vandepeer Clarke wearing an early version of the limpet mine on a keeper plate in the position used by a swimmer. In July 1939, Clarke was once again contacted by Macrae, who was by then the editor of Armchair Science, a popular magazine at the time. Macrae explained that he had been contacted by Major Millis Rowland Jefferis of the War Office, who had read a brief article in Armchair Science that described very powerful magnets.Unattributed. World's Most Powerful Magnet. Armchair Science July 1939 p. 70. Those particular magnets were not available, but following discussions it was clear what Jefferis had in mind and Macrae volunteered to design a new weapon that would magnetically adhere to ships below the water line. Now Macrae needed Clarke's experience and workshops.National Archive. T 166 ‚Äì Hearing 16 November 1953 ‚Äì Macrae. Document 328. Macrae visited Clarke at home and after \\"sweeping a number of children out of the living room\\", he laid out his rough drawings and the two men soon agreed to cooperate on the design of a new weapon.National Archive. T 166-21 Awards to Inventors - Macrae and others. Work began the next day. Clarke purchased some large tin bowls from a nearby branch of Woolworth's and a local tinsmith was engaged to make rims with annular grooves and plates which could be screwed on to close the rims. Small horseshoe magnets were fixed in the grooves and with a filling of porridge in place of high explosive, the first prototypes were created. Clarke and Macrae took their prototype to Bedford Modern School baths, which were closed for such occasions. Clarke was an excellent swimmer and was able to propel himself through the water with a prototype bomb attached to a keeper plate on webbing around his waist. Clarke practised attaching the bomb to a metal griddle plate taken from the family kitchen that was used to simulate the hull of a ship. At first, the magnetic adhesion to the keeper plate proved so great that it was difficult to remove the bomb, so the plate was made smaller to reduce the strength of its hold. They also adjusted the bomb to have a slightly positive buoyancy, which was found to be advantageous. Having developed the weapon thus far, it was duly named the limpet mine after the marine sea creature ‚Äì the limpet, a gastropod well known for its ability to adhere to rocks. Clarke's son John later recalled: > I remember going with my father in the motor boat and we trundled up and > down the Ouse at different speeds with this underwater device, which nobody > could see because it was under the water. And we demonstrated that the > launch could travel up to 10 or 15 knots and the limpet mine was still > firmly attached. So that was yet another test that my father had to undergo > and it was all extremely interesting and exciting. The next step was to design a delay mechanism so that when a limpet mine had been put in place, the bomber would have plenty of time to get away before the explosion. A spring-loaded striker was designed which would be held back by a pellet that would slowly dissolve in water. Finding a suitable substance for the pellet was difficult and expert advice was called in, but failed to find an answer: the time taken for the tested materials to dissolve was too variable. The problem was solved when aniseed balls belonging to one of Clarke's children were tried.Unattributed. Limpet Bomb Claim By Inventors ‚Äì Use Of Aniseed Balls. The Times 17 November 1953 p. 4 column F. The manufacturers, Barratt, could not supply the balls with the necessary holes, so Macrae resorted to drilling them through. The delay device had to be protected from water until the limpet mine was actually in position and for this the delay device would be stored in a condom until it was deployed. The first few hundred limpet mines were produced at Clarke's workshop. Soon the job went to outside contractors and over half a million limpets were made and issued for use. When the limpet mine work was over, there was time for a family holiday in Clarke's double-decker caravan. By the time the family returned, the Second World War had started.  Underground tank  When production of the limpet mine was under way, Clarke started work on a radical and ambitious project. Drawing on his experiences of trench warfare in the First World War and his particular expertise in tunnelling and explosives, he drew up a proposal for an armoured trench-forming machine. Although the war had started, there was little real fighting on the Western Front and this period became known as the Phoney War. However, Clarke reasoned that eventually Germany's much vaunted Siegfried Line must be attacked. His trench- forming machine would drive through the earth advancing 2000 yards in a single night, men and tanks following in its wake in the relative safety of the trench it had formed. Clarke's machine would use a hydraulic ram to insert cylinders of ammonal explosive about underground. After detonation, the machine would advance into the crater it had just created and repeat the process. The machine would be protected by of armoured plate at the front to protect it from its own explosions and similarly at the top and rear as a defence against enemy fire. In one record, Clarke mentions \\"I envisaged a machine that would by hydraulic means more or less row itself through the ground.\\" The machine's trench would be about . Clarke's proposal was sent first to the Royal Engineer and Signals Board at the Ministry of Supply. Clarke requested that all communication be passed through Jefferis. The Ministry turned down Clarke's ideas with a standard letter of rejection. A few weeks later, Clarke tried again. This time he sent his plans directly to Winston Churchill, who was at the time First Lord of the Admiralty. Churchill's chief scientific advisor, Frederick Lindemann, contacted Clarke by telegram to requested an immediate interview. Lindemann was impressed by Clarke and his ideas. Churchill already had a trenching machine in development at the Naval Land Section at the Ministry of Supply; it was known by its code name Cultivator No. 6. The Cultivator worked by purely mechanical means and was by this time in an advanced state. Clarke's idea was simpler and it would be able to clear landmines and other obstacles in its path. It would even be able to deal with blockhouses by placing multiple charges underneath them before blowing them up. The main disadvantage of Clarke's trenching machine was that at an estimated speed of per hour it was much slower than Cultivator's per hour. Clarke was made an Assistant Director in the Naval Land Section at the generous salary of ¬£1,000 per annum (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Clarke came to hate his Admiralty job. With the fall of France, it was evident that entrenching machines like Cultivator were not going to be needed soon and probably never would be. Clarke resigned from the project and made his availability known to the War Office; he was soon called up for military service.  Aston House  Soldier with limpet mines on his back While he was still on the Admiralty payroll, Clarke was called upon to make some design improvements to the limpet mine. The mine was being manufactured by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) at their Technical Research and Development Station at Aston House near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, and there were some problems with the original model to be ironed out. Aston House was a large, secluded country house surrounded by of parkland. The house had been acquired by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) in 1939. The SIS, a secret branch of the Foreign Office, then handed the house over to SOE for whom it became known as Station XII. Aston House was used to produce and package special weapons and to train SOE agents in their use. The station had a high wire fence and many security measures. When Clarke first arrived at Aston House he was kept waiting at a guard post, but after a few minutes he slipped past the security measures and got into the house and into the presence of the station's commandant, Arthur Langley. Langley did not take kindly to his initiative and forbade Clarke to enter the house or to be served with meals ‚Äì this continued until Langley was replaced some months later by Captain Leslie John Cardew- Wood (generally known as John Wood). A wide range of munitions, including the limpet mine and the spigot gun, were produced at Aston House. Significant development work went on including some early work on shaped charges. Having resigned from his job at the Admiralty, Clarke joined the Army and was taken on by Wood to work at Aston House, where he was put in charge of training SOE saboteurs.  Spigot gun  Tree spigot gun in position and ready to be fired. Clarke developed a weapon that he called the spigot gun. It was a type of spigot mortar that propelled a projectile consisting of a bomb about in diameter containing of high explosives and a finless tail tube containing a propelling charge similar to a shotgun cartridge.; The bomb had a thin front that collapsed when it struck a target, thereby placing the explosive in intimate contact with the target immediately prior to detonation; the bomb could penetrate up to 50 mm of armour. The hollow tail was placed over a spigot so that when the propelling charge was fired, the projectile would fly off; this sudden acceleration also armed the contact detonator. As soon as the projectile had left the spigot, a plug would block the tail tube, greatly reducing the flash and noise of the discharge. Simple, quiet, and easily portable, the spigot gun was an ideal weapon for the saboteur and it was thought very suitable for jungle warfare. The most widely used version of the spigot gun was the tree spigot gun. This had its spigot mounted on a ball and socket joint attached to a large wood screw. A pair of handles were provided to turn the screw so that it could be secured in a tree or other suitable wooden support; one of the handles had a chisel-shaped end for removing bark from trees. When this had been done, a sighting tool could be placed on the spigot, and the spigot was then adjusted and clamped into position. The sight was then removed and replaced with the mortar projectile. The weapon was fired by pulling on a lanyard, by a trip wire as part of a booby trap or by a pencil detonator delay mechanism. The tree spigot had a range of . As part of a booby trap, it could be positioned to fire downwards onto the relatively thin armour on top of a tank. One account of its use describes a trip wire for a locomotive; placed up high it was likely to be missed by track walkers looking for bombs on the railway line. A variant form was the plate spigot gun. This screwed into a tree but was also equipped with a steel plate that served as a gun shield. This version had a maximum range of and could engage moving targets at up to . Another variant was the ground spigot gun. The weapon was equipped with a small visored plate measuring about that served as a gun shield. The 'gun' was supported by a tubular structure with canvas stretched between two trailing tubular legs; this provided support for the gunner lying prone and the combination of the supporting structure and the gunner's weight helped to absorb the recoil. This version had a maximum range of and could engage moving targets at up to . The tree and plate spigot weapons were taken up by the War Office for use by the Home Guard. The tree spigot was used by SOE agents and resistance fighters, for whom it was available in pre-packed cases for dropping by parachute.; A special rucksack was available to carry a tree spigot and three bombs.; The tree spigot was purchased in large numbers by the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS).  Brickendonbury Manor  In December 1940, Clarke was promoted to Captain (acting Major) and appointed as the commandant of Brichendonbury Manor, SOE's Station XVII. He was responsible for the training of SOE agents in sabotage before they went into action. Clarke was keen to give his recruits training experiences that were as realistic as possible. In an example later recalled by his son, he took his team out one dark night and using scaling ladders they got past the guards and into Luton Power Station. There they planted dummy bombs on the transformers before retreating over the perimeter walls without being noticed. A little later, Clarke, with a pass stating that he, Major CV Clarke, had authority to inspect Luton Power Station ‚Äì a document he had himself created ‚Äì walked up to the front door and asked for the Officer of the Guard. He insisted on doing a routine inspection there and then. Clarke soon located the dummy charges and said to the distraught officer in charge of the guard, \\"Alright old man, you say nothing about this and I'll say nothing about it. But you've learnt your lesson.\\" The decoys were retrieved and the unconventional training operation was over. So that he could experience the full range of training of an SOE agent, Clarke was sent for parachute training. On 8 July 1941, Clarke sustained a bone fracture resulting from a heavy landing while making a jump at No. 1 Parachute Training School RAF at Tatton Park.  Operation Josephine B  Clarke trained three agents who were to be parachuted into Bordeaux on the night of 11‚Äì12 May 1942 for Operation Josephine B (also known as Operation Josephine). The agents were French and replaced a party of Poles who had been badly injured in an aeroplane crash. The agents took with them the smaller, shaped-charge limpets. After reconnoitring their target, the Pessac transformer station, the agents were put off by the difficulty of getting past the guards, the nine-foot-high wall and a high-tension wire. They then failed to make their rendezvous with the submarine sent to pick them up. Instead the raiders lay low for a month and then made their attack with special equipment to climb over the walls and open the main gate. Six of the eight transformers were destroyed ‚Äì the charges having slipped from two of the transformers before exploding ‚Äì and the party escaped. It took a long time for the Germans to recover from the disruption caused. The nearby U-boat docks were put out of action for months, 250 people were arrested, the Pessac area was fined one million French Francs and 12 German guards were shot. The attack was SOE's first successful industrial sabotage attack in France.  Operation Anthropoid  Operation Anthropoid was the code name for the assassination attempt on SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer and General der Polizei Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi Germany acting Reichsprotektor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The operation was prepared by the SOE. Clarke and Wood designed a grenade from a modified No. 73 Grenade, a weapon also known as the Thermos bomb from the resemblance to a Thermos flask. A standard No. 73 grenade was approximately in diameter and in length, and weighed some . It was fitted with a No. 69 \\"All- ways\\" fuse that would detonate the bomb regardless of the way it fell. However, the grenade's considerable weight meant that it could only be thrown short distances. The modified grenade was made from the top third of the standard device. This reduced the weight to just over , making it much easier to throw and to conceal. At Aston House, Clarke and Wood trained Czechoslovak soldiers Jozef Gabƒç√≠k and Jan Kubi≈° to throw the bombs into a slow-moving vehicle by using an old Austin rolled down a ramp. Others then took over the training using a car fitted with armour plates. The two Czechoslovak soldiers were airlifted along with seven other soldiers from Czechoslovakia's army-in- exile in the United Kingdom. They were sent with an arsenal of guns, grenades, explosives, and other equipment including a tree spigot gun so that they could take advantage of whatever situation presented itself. The attack was carried out in Prague on 27 May 1942. The assassination attempt did not go smoothly; Gabƒç√≠k's sten gun jammed and Kubi≈°' grenade fell short. The assassins fled, convinced that they had failed. However, although seemingly only slightly wounded at the time, Heydrich died in hospital just over a week later. The assassins were tracked down and killed in a manhunt and the Germans carried out brutal reprisals against the civilian population.  Other operations  Clarke was also involved in the training of agents who went on to attack ships of the French Fleet at Oran in Algeria in November 1942, and in 1943 the agents of Operation Gunnerside which destroyed the heavy water plant at Rjukan, Vemork, in Norway ‚Äì an operation later evaluated by SOE as the most successful act of sabotage in all of World War II. Clarke also trained an SOE agent Harry R√©e for his activities in occupied France.  MD1  In February 1942, Clarke requested a transfer to MD1. The exact circumstances of his transfer are unclear; it seem that his unconventional training methods ‚Äì breaking into RAF and transformer stations ‚Äì had made him unpopular. Colin Gubbins liked Clarke, but thought he might be of more use elsewhere and approached Clarke's friend and colleague Stuart Macrae. Macrae was now working for MD1, a small organisation for the development of weapons directly under the control of the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. MD1 was run by Major Millis Rowland Jefferis ‚Äì for whom Clarke and Macrae had developed the limpet mine ‚Äì with Macrae as his number two.  Altimeter switch  At MD1, Clarke was able to complete the development of a sabotage device on which he had been working. It was designed to be put on board an aircraft and to explode when a certain altitude was reached. The saboteur would need to place the device on board, and this could conveniently be done by slipping a device through one of any number of small holes that were typically present on aircraft of the time or through a small slit cut in the outer fabric. To make this as easy as possible, the device was designed as a long, thin, flexible 'sausage' of explosive. Clarke considered that a saboteur should carry the device hidden in the legs of trousers. Despite the inevitable ribaldry, this was the method he taught to his students. The detonating mechanism was known as the 'altimeter switch' or 'aero switch'. The altimeter switch was extensively used by the OSS, who distributed it to Chinese forces, especially those in Chungking, where it was used to assassinate Dai Li, the widely hated head of the Kuomintang (KMT) secret police.  The Great Eastern  In the winter of 1943, Clarke had himself sent to various weapon training schools in North Africa, Egypt, Palestine and Italy to demonstrate MD1's PIAT anti-tank weapon and various new fuses. In Italy he soon fell out with the local representative of the Director of Artillery. Disgruntled and dejected, he returned to his home in Bedford without telling anybody where he was and came close to having to face a Court Martial for desertion. Settling back into MD1, he thought up the idea of a rocket-operated tank bridge. Other tank-mounted bridges used hydraulics or winch mechanisms to deploy a portable bridge; the existing Churchill ARK, one of the longest of such bridges, lowered ramps to make a bridge. Clarke's bridge tank was designed to overcome much bigger obstacles than could be bridged by the Churchill ARK, both horizontally and vertically. It was able to form a bridge long and could cross a wall high and wide. MD1 had prospered as the war progressed and the department had little difficulty getting hold of two Churchill tanks and the large amount of steelwork required. On the first live test the rockets were so powerful that they nearly pulled the tank along with the flying ramp, as a result of which the driver was \\"not in good shape\\", but Clarke persisted with the trial and the viability of the design was confirmed. The \\"Great Eastern\\", as the vehicle would become known, was powered by two groups of rockets. The idea was that on reaching a canal, wall or other obstacle the tank would stop. Then a distance-measuring device could be extended by the crew turning a windlass so that the correct position of the vehicle could be gauged. When in position, the rockets were fired, causing the ramps to unfold and be thrown over the obstacle. Within 30 seconds, vehicles could then pass up a smaller ramp to the rear, over the bridging tank itself and then over the long unfolded ramp. Recovering the vehicle took longer and required an A-frame to be put up and a series of manoeuvres to refold the ramps. The sprags were repositioned manually with a special tool. The projected ramp landed on concertina shock absorbers that were liable to be crushed if the ramp landed on anything other than soft ground; damaged shock absorbers had to be replaced. Spare rockets were held in a magazine at the rear of the vehicle. Without deploying its projected ramp, the Great Eastern could be used to bridge gaps of up to such as an anti-tank ditch with a vertical retaining wall. Ten Great Easterns were completed and Clarke went with them to France after D-day. Clarke trained the Canadians in the 21st Army Group, who were then advancing into the Netherlands, where it was hoped they would be of use crossing canals. Clarke's son later recorded: \\"To my father's private disgust and disappointment, it was ready and planned to carry out an operation at the end of April 1945 when the Germans put their hands up in the Low Countries and the operation was therefore called off.\\" The Great Easterns never saw action.  Other weapons  Clarke designed a type of jumping ammunition for a mortar, a different sort of low air-burst mortar bomb, and a self-propelled multiple mortar firing device for the new Black Prince tank.  Later life  Clarke was released from the Army in November 1945. He returned to Bedford and moved his family to a new home in the town. He joined the Territorial Army as a Captain, where he served for six years before being transferred to the Intelligence Corps. Clarke shared a number of awards from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors: in 1953 he received ¬£400 [equivalent to ¬£ in ] for the limpet mine, and shared ¬£300 [¬£] with Stuart Macrae and Charles Neville Wilson for the altimeter switch. Clarke organised the Bedford branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and was an elder of the Presbyterian church. He worked as a Councillor for Putnoe. He was elected as a Labour Party candidate, and then after six years he joined the Liberal Party in 1959 ‚Äì possibly over issues relating to nuclear weapons. At the age of 60, shortly after retiring as a Major, Clarke suffered a nonfatal heart attack. He died in 1961.

Epileptologists are experts in epileptic seizures and seizure disorders, anticonvulsants, and special situations involving seizures, such as cases in which all treatment intended to stop seizures has failed and epilepsy (especially poorly controlled epilepsy) in pregnant women. Some epileptologists specialize in treatment of epilepsy in children. The training required for expertise in epilepsy generally involves a residency in neurology or pediatric neurology followed by a fellowship in clinical neurophysiology or epilepsy. The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology first held subspecialty certifications in epilepsy after a vote in 2010 with ACGME- accredited fellowships appearing in the mid 2010s. Accredited fellowships are one year in duration and focus on training in EEG, surgical planning, and the clinical treatment of epilepsy. An epileptologist is not necessary for the treatment of all seizure disorders, and is generally only consulted if seizures do not stop, despite treatment from a regular physician or neurologist. Origin of the field The field of epileptology was first created early in the 20th century. William P. Spratling is identified as the first epileptologist. He is said to have coined the term in 1904.

The mountain is topographically connected to the Jura Mountains to the west. East of Le Mormont runs the Entreroches gorge (460 m), through which the Canal d‚ÄôEntreroches was dug in the 17th century, enabling water transportation between the Rhone and the Rhine rivers. The canal ceased to be profitable in the 18th century, and when a bridge across the canal collapsed in 1829, it was shut down altogether. The course of the historical canal is now traversed by a railway tunnel of the Lausanne-Yverdon line. Le Mormont has been substantially mined for chalk used in cement production. It was planned to extend the mining pit to the hill's summit in 2006 to 2009; because of this, the cantonal archaeological office of Vaud performed a watching brief excavation, which led to the discovery of a late La T√®ne period (c. 100 BC) Helvetic cult site. The site was reported as being of unprecedented size and richness for the period. A total of 250 pits containing sacrificial deposits were recorded. Among the deposited goods were ceramic and bronze vessels, iron tools, jewelry, grinding stones, coins, and both animal and human remains. It is unclear whether the human remains represent a cemetery or evidence of human sacrifice. The site is of primary importance for Gaulish religion on the eve of the Roman conquest. Because of the importance of the archaeological site, the mining operation has been put on hold until a more detailed archaeological excavation scheduled for 2014/15.

Interior view. The pulpit. Santa Maria di Nazareth is a Renaissance church in the town of Sestri Levante, in the Gulf of Tigullio in the Metropolitan City of Genoa. Located in the center of the old village of Sestri Levante, adjacent to the town hall, its parish community is part of the Diocese of Chiavari.  History  A chapel at the site, dedicated to Mary, is documented as early as 1368, but by 1604, following the sale of a plot by the local nobleman Bernardo Bolasco, construction of the present church began. The final consolidation of the isthmus with the headland, known locally as \\"Island\\", which led to the expansion of Sestri Levante, and linked the community to the existing church of St. Nicholas, located at top of the island is already home parish, was therefore more suitable for the spiritual needs of the population. The construction of the church over 12 years was entrusted to the architect Giovanni Battista Carbone. The church inherited the title of co-cathedral of the diocese of Brugnato from the existing church of St. Nicol√≤. It was the seat of synods, diocesan from 1675 to 1725 and home of the bishops of the diocese from the sixteenth to the 18th century. Elected to the title of Collegiate Church in 1755, it was named a minor basilica on June 22 of 1962. A few years later he switched to the Diocese of Chiavari (1959).  Description The interior has a three naves separated by square pillars with pilasters which rest on rounded arches. The interior was decorated in the 18th and 19th centuries. The nave has a barrel vault with lunettes, a deep chancel raised and a semicircular apse.

Based on a real bank robbery case, the episode features a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) math consultant's prediction being incomplete after FBI agents find themselves in an unexpected shootout with suspected bank robbers. Series writers Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci wanted to explore the emotional effects of the case on Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz). For the mathematics used in the case, they included several mathematical and physics concepts, such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, P versus NP problem, and Minesweeper game. The episode was directed by Davis Guggenheim and filmed in Los Angeles, California. Due to the type of scenes in the episode, filming took over nine days. During production, CBS requested that the producers tone down slightly the level of violence in the opening action sequence and that one additional narrative element involving FBI Agent David Sinclair be removed for the sake of clarity. After being moved from fourth to second, \\"Uncertainty Principle\\" first aired in the United States on January 28, 2005. Critics gave the episode mixed reviews. One mathematician disliked the focus on the emotional reaction while critics liked the episode. Plot summary Following a lead, FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Terry Lake (Sabrina Lloyd), and David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) stake out two banks which are possibly the Charm School Boys' next target. The agents' lead comes from their math consultant and Don's younger brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), who used probability theory and statistical analysis to predict the targets. The Charm School Boys, a pair of nonviolent and polite bank robbers, rob the bank which Terry and David have under surveillance. Terry and David's team attempt to arrest the pair, but Terry and David, and later Don, find themselves in the middle of a shootout with the bank robbers and a couple of the robbers' accomplices. After the firefight dies down, Don and Terry follow the ringleader into a nearby building. The bank robber overpowers Don, shoots Don with Don's own gun, and flees the scene with the gun. Charlie arrives at the scene and finds Don being treated for a minor gunshot wound to his arm. Back at the FBI office, the team determines that Charlie's model is the only viable lead. Charlie, horrified by the sight of the crime scene, withdraws himself from the investigation since one of his model's assumptions was that the robbers were nonviolent. Don sends Charlie home to get some rest. Instead, Charlie begins working on P vs. NP in the family garage, a problem that he had worked on during the three months before his mother died of cancer. Don returns to the house and learns about Charlie's actions from their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch). When Don confronts Charlie, Charlie expresses his fear of Don being fatally shot during another confrontation with the Charm School Boys. At the office, the team uncovers evidence which confirms Don's suspicion that one of the bank robbers was military-trained. They also learn that the robbers had killed a computer programmer and had stolen the programmer's identity. As the agents discuss the case, they learn of another bank robbery committed by the Charm School Boys. This time, the robbers fatally shoot a bank president who attempted to confront them, and video surveillance footage shows that Don's gun is present at the scene. Back at the house, Don, expressing the increased risk to him and his team, tells Charlie that he needs Charlie's help. Later, Alan comforts Charlie by saying that Charlie's mother understood why he chose to work on P vs. NP instead of spending his final three months with her. Charlie then resumes work on the case and realizes that he failed to consider that the bank robbers spent a much longer time outside the bank after the robberies than most bank robbers would have. At the office, Charlie tells the team that the robbers were using Federal Reserve routing numbers stored on each bank's computers to locate a shipment of cash going to an undisclosed Federal Reserve location to be destroyed. The team assumes that the bank robbers need the computer programmer's knowledge to access the data. The team also learns that one shipment is scheduled to leave for the location in a few hours. Don, Terry, and David split up; Don stays with the shipment while David and Terry serve as the decoy shipment. After being diverted under an expressway, David and Terry confront the bank robbers and arrest the team. The ringleader escapes and is soon arrested by Don, who takes back his gun. Back at the house, Don breaks the news about the arrest to Charlie and Alan. Charlie tells Don that he has stopped working on P vs. NP in order to focus on other problems. Production Writing \\"Uncertainty Principle\\" is based on a series of bank robberies, solved with the assistance of an Arkansas mathematician, that occurred in Maryland in 2004. Since bank robbers follow predictable patterns, the FBI called in the mathematician to specifically predict which banks were likely targets. The bank robber was arrested while selecting his next target. Early in the series, series creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci decided that one of the elements in the series would be the emotional effects of cases on the characters. When writing \\"Uncertainty Principle\\", Heuton and Falacci wanted to show Charlie's reaction to the violent nature of Don's work. They learned during their research on mathematicians that, in real-life, most mathematicians dislike violence. Heuton and Falacci decided to incorporate into the episode elements, including an opening shootout, from their earlier feature writing. While discussing the episode in \\"Uncertainty Principle\\"'s commentary, Heuton and Falacci mentioned that Charlie could not tolerate Don being shot shortly after their mother's death. Heuton and Falacci changed the title of the episode from \\"Cause and Causality\\" to \\"Uncertainty Principle\\" after including the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in the script. Heuton and Falacci wanted to use the principle more as a metaphor expressing Charlie's decision to leave the case than as an application to the case. In developing the script, Falacci and Heuton wanted to include a problem that would be unsolvable. They asked Dr. Gary Lorden of the California Institute of Technology for a problem. Lorden suggested using P vs. NP. P vs. NP describes the length of time needed to solve a problem as compared with the number of steps in the problem. Generally, the length of time increases as the numbers of steps increase. P signifies polynomial time, the length of time in which a problem can be solved by a computer algorithm even when the number of steps in the problem increases. NP represents non-deterministic polynomial time. Although a solution to a NP-type problem has not been discovered, a computer algorithm should be able to verify the NP-type problem in polynomial time once the solution is found. Leonid Levin, Stephen A. Cook of the University of Toronto, and Richard Karp of the University of California, Berkeley proposed a type of problem known as a NP-complete problem. They proposed that if one can solve one NP-type problem, one can solve every NP-type problem in the same number of steps as it took to solve the first problem. Previously, scientists assumed that P and NP should be equal. Since a solution to NP-type problems have not been discovered yet, they conclude that the two are not equal. During their research, Heuton and Falacci found a real-life variation of the problem called Minesweeper. With regards to the series, the episode set the backstory of the characters, particularly the Eppes family. First, the episode highlighted the Eppes family's dynamics and the intensity of the dynamics, especially the effects of Charlie's genius on Don. While Don and Charlie's parents met Charlie's educational needs, Don's needs were neglected. Second, the episode explained the absence of Mrs. Eppes. While creating the series, Heuton and Falacci included Mrs. Eppes in the family. During the show's development, CBS asked the creators to eliminate the role of Mrs. Eppes. The episode was also the first episode to end with a family moment. Falacci and Heuton felt that the family moments would show that the series was about a family. Production The cast and crew delayed production of \\"Uncertainty Principle\\" until director Davis Guggenheim could film the episode. Guggenheim decided to film the episode similar to a movie. He used an experiential form of shooting, which allowed the audience to see the action from a character's viewpoint. He also shot through clear boards, a filming technique that would be used in subsequent episodes of Numb3rs. The opening shootout was shot at the LA Center Studios, the studios where Numb3rs filmed, a few weeks after production began on the series. For most of the actors involved, it was their first shootout. Halfway through filming, the production crew realized that they needed nine and one-half days to film the episode instead of the usual eight days. Producers and Guggenheim used the extra day of filming to film the shootout. Also shot at LA Center Studios was the scene where Don lost his gun. Unable to use a hardware store as planned, the producers changed the location to the studio's basement. While filming at the house that series producers rented for the series, Guggenheim suggested that a scene in which Charlie placed chalkboards in the garage. Although the scene was not on the schedule, Guggenheim felt it was essential to the story. David Grynkiewicz, a graduate student of Dr. Rick Wilson's who was working with the series producers, developed the mathematics within one-half hour without any guidance. The boards in the garage would also be used in subsequent episodes. Guggenheim also designed and filmed the Minesweeper audience-vision. During the production of the arrest scene, the production crew and Guggenheim discussed the size of the scene. The producers and Guggenheim debated whether to include the RPG in the scene, and Guggenheim eventually decided to include it. Due to the filming schedule, the scene was filmed during the Christmas break. Producers changed the location for the scene from the Los Angeles River as storms occurred before filming. Throughout production, CBS executives objected to the violent nature of the episode. They asked Guggenheim to make it less violent, but Guggenheim refused when possible. The executives also expressed concern about the overall plot of the episode. They felt that it would be too early in the series to show Charlie's emotional reaction to the violence. The executives expressed concern about Charlie's emotional state during a scene set in the Eppes family garage where Charlie recalled the violence. Heuton and Falacci agreed to remove the scene as they felt that the scene did not suit the plot. Citing the convention that the protagonist in a crime drama does not lose his or her gun, the network executives also felt that the loss of Don's gun was inappropriate for the series. Heuton and Falacci insisted on keeping it in the script, and series regular Rob Morrow also liked the idea of Don losing his gun. Heuton and Falacci assured the executives that Don would have an emotional reward at the end of the episode. Post-production After producers sent the film to the network, the producers learned that CBS's test audience requested the inclusion of two additional scenes. The first scene to be included was a scene in which Don explained Charlie's reaction to their mother's chemotherapy and subsequent death due to cancer. In the original script, the explanation was never given. Heuton and Falacci added the scene for storytelling purposes. CBS wanted the audience to follow the plot without any confusion. The second scene was a scene toward the end of the episode in which Don and Charlie talk while Don prepares for the arrest. The scene was in the original script as Charlie's emotional reward and as the reformation of Don and Charlie's partnership. During production, the production crew realized that they did not have enough time to film the scene, and the scene was removed from the production schedule. After the test audience suggested its inclusion, the cast and crew filmed the scene. Scheduling Originally scheduled to air fourth, the episode instead followed the \\"Pilot\\". The network executives wanted an episode which would attract an audience to the series with both the characters and the action. In spite of earlier protests during production about the violent nature of the episode, the executives felt that \\"Uncertainty Principle\\" was a strong story to follow the \\"Pilot\\". Reception When it first aired on January 28, 2005, \\"Uncertainty Principle\\" marked the first episode that aired on Friday night. Over 15.46 million people watched \\"Uncertainty Principle\\". Critically, \\"Uncertainty Principle\\" received a mixed reception. Raazesh Sainudiin, a mathematics professor at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, disliked the emphasis on Charlie's reaction to the case. Richard Penny, a statistics professor in New Zealand, believed that Charlie confused the observer effect with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In contrast, Cynthia Boris, a reviewer for DVD Verdict, called \\"Uncertainty Principle\\" \\"likely the best episode ever\\". Todd Douglass, Jr., a reviewer for DVD Talk, called the episode \\"solid...to make the payoff worth it\\".

Resin from the extinct tree Hymenaea protera is the source of Caribbean amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics. Caribbean amber differentiates itself from Baltic amber by being nearly always transparent, and it has a higher number of fossil inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest.George Poinar, Jr. and Roberta Poinar, 1999.

However, according to Poinar,George Poinar, Jr. and Roberta Poinar, 1999. The Amber Forest: A Reconstruction of a Vanished World, (Princeton University Press) Dominican amber dates from Oligocene to Miocene, thus about 25 million years old. The oldest, and hardest of this amber comes from the mountain region north of Santiago. The La Cumbre, La Toca, Palo Quemado, La Bucara, and Los Cacaos mining sites in the Cordillera Septentrional not far from Santiago. Amber has also been found in the south- eastern Bayaguana/Sabana de la Mar area.Schlee, D. (1984): Notizen √ºber einige Bernsteine und Kopale aus aller Welt. Stuttgarter Beitr. Naturk. Ser.

Amber from the Caribbean  Dominican Blue Amber Caribbean amber, especially Dominican blue amber, is mined through bell pitting, which is extremely dangerous. The bell pit is basically a foxhole dug with whatever tools are available. Machetes do the start, some shovels, picks and hammers may participate eventually. The pit itself goes as deep or safe as possible, sometimes vertical, sometimes horizontal, but never level. It snakes into hill sides, drops away, joins up with others, goes straight up and pops out elsewhere. 'Foxhole' applies indeed: rarely are the pits large enough to stand in, and then only at the entrance. Miners crawl around on their knees using short-handled picks, shovels and machetes. There are little to no safety measures. A pillar or so may hold back the ceiling from time to time but only if the area has previously collapsed. Candles are the only source of light. Humidity inside the mines is at 100%. Since the holes are situated high on mountainsides and deep inside said mountains, the temperature is cool and bearable, but after several hours the air becomes stale. During rain the mines are forced to close. The holes fill up quickly with water, and there is little point in pumping it out again (although sometimes this is done) because the unsecured walls may crumble.Mart√≠nez, R. & Schlee, D.

Colors  Caribbean amber can be found in many colors, besides the obvious amber. Yellow and honey colored are fairly common. There is also red and green in smaller quantities and the rare blue amber (fluorescent).Schlee, D. (1980): Bernstein-Raritaeten (Farben, Strukturen, Fossilen, Handwerk). ‚Äì 88 S.

The blue amber reportedly is found mostly in Palo Quemado mine, in the Pescado Bobo mine south from La Cumbre but also in the southern part of the Dominican Republic, like in the mines around the town El Valle. The amber found in the later is probably younger than the amber found in the north.

In 1933, the ailing President von Hindenberg appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany in a Coalition Cabinet, and the Holy See concluded the Reich concordat treaty with the still nominally functioning Weimar state later that year. Hoping to secure the rights of the Church in Germany, the Church agreed to a requirement that clergy cease to participate in politics. The Hitler regime routinely violated the treaty, and launched a persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany. Claiming jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, the Nazis interfered with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies, and human rights abuses increased as the Nazis consolidated their power. In 1937, Pius XI issued the Mit brennender Sorge encyclical which denounced the regime's breaches of the Concordat, along with the racial and nationalist idolatry which underpinned Nazi ideology. Pius accused the Nazi Government of sowing \\"fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\\", and noted on the horizon the \\"threatening storm clouds\\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany. Following the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom, Pius joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom, and antisemitism, sparking protest from the Nazis. Pius XI died in 1939, on the eve of World War II, and was succeeded by his Cardinal Secretary of State, Eugenio Pacelli, who took the name Pius XII, and was to govern the Church through the war, The Holocaust, and the remainder of the Nazi period.

From left to right: German prelate Ludwig Kaas, German Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, representing Germany, Monsignor Giuseppe Pizzardo, Cardinal Pacelli, Monsignor Alfredo Ottaviani, German ambassador Rudolf Buttmann. A threatening, though initially mainly sporadic persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the 1933 Nazi takeover in Germany.Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Company; London; p.332 In the dying days of the Weimar Republic, the newly appointed Chancellor Adolf Hitler moved quickly to eliminate Political Catholicism. Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen was dispatched to Rome to negotiate a Reich concordat with the Holy See.Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Company; London; p.290 Ian Kershaw wrote that the Vatican was anxious to reach agreement with the new government, despite \\"continuing molestation of Catholic clergy, and other outrages committed by Nazi radicals against the Church and its organisations\\".Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; WW Norton & Company; London; p.295 On 20 July 1933, the Vatican signed an agreement with Germany, the Reichskonkordat, partly in an effort to stop Nazi persecution of Catholic institutions.Coppa, p. 132-7Rhodes, p. 182-183 quotation \\"His contention seemed confirmed in a speech by Staatsminister Wagner in Munich on the 31st March 1934, only nine months after the signature of the Concordat. Wagner said if the Church had not signed a concordat with Germany, the National Socialist government would have abolished the Catholic Youth organisations altogether, and placed them in the same 'anti-state' category as the Marxist groups. ... If the maintenance of Catholic education and of the Catholic Youth associations was, as we have seen often enough before, the principal aim of Papal diplomacy, then his phrase, 'the Concordat prevented greater evils' seems justified. ... The German episcopate considered that neither the Concordats up to then negotiated with individual German States (Lander), nor the Weimar Constitution gave adequate guarantees or assurance to the faithful of respect for their convictions, rights or liberty of action. In such conditions the guarantees could not be secured except through a settlement having the solemn form of a concordat with the central government of the Reich, I would add that since it was the German government which made the proposal, the responsibility for all the regrettable consequences would have fallen on the Holy See if it had refused the proposed Concordat. Although the Church had few illusions about National Socialism, it must be recognized that the Concordat in the years that followed brought some advantages, or at least prevented worse evils. In fact, in spite of all the violations to which it was subjected, it gave German Catholics a juridical basis for their defence, a stronghold behind which to shield themselves in their oppositions to the ever-growing campaign of religious persecution.\\" The treaty was to be an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria.Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.118 The Bavarian region, the Rhineland and Westphalia as well as parts in southwest Germany, were predominantly Catholic, and the church had previously enjoyed a degree of privilege there. North Germany was heavily Protestant, and Catholics had suffered some discrimination. In the late 1800s, Bismarck's Kulturkampf had been an attempt to almost eliminate Catholic institutions in Germany, or at least their strong connections outside of Germany. With this background, Catholic officials wanted a concordat strongly guaranteeing the church's freedoms. Once Hitler came to power and started enacting laws restricting movement of funds (making it impossible for German Catholics to send money to missionaries, for instance), restricting religious institutions and education, and mandating attendance at Hitler Youth functions (held on Sunday mornings to interfere with Church attendance), the need for a concordat seemed even more urgent to church officials. The revolution of 1918 and the Weimar constitution of 1919 had thoroughly reformed the former relationship between state and churches. Therefore the Holy See, represented in Germany by Nuncio Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII, made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments.Ludwig Volk Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933. Catholic politicians from the Centre Party repeatedly pushed for a concordat with the new German Republic. In February 1930 Pacelli became the Vatican's Secretary of State, and thus responsible for the Church's foreign policy, and in this position continued to work towards this 'great goal'.Klaus Scholder \\"The Churches and the Third Reich\\". Pius XI was eager to negotiate concordats with any country that was willing to do so, thinking that written treaties were the best way to protect the Church's rights against governments increasingly inclined to interfere in such matters. Twelve concordats were signed during his reign with various types of governments, including some German state governments, and with Austria. On the level of the states, concordats were achieved with Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929) and Baden (1932). On the national level, however, negotiations failed for several reasons: the fragility of the national government; opposition from Socialist and Protestant deputies in the Reichstag; and discord among the German bishops and between them and the Holy See. In particular the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 and asked for a concordat, Pius XI accepted. Negotiations were conducted on his behalf by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who later became Pope Pius XII (1939 - 1958). The Reichskonkordat was signed by Pacelli and by the German government in June 1933, and included guarantees of liberty for the Church, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools. Negotiations with Hitler On 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor. On 23 March 1933, his government was given dictatorial powers through an Enabling Act passed by all parties in the Reichstag except the Social Democrats and Communists (whose deputies had already been arrested). Hitler had obtained the votes of the Centre Party, led by Prelate Ludwig Kaas, by issuing oral guarantees of the party's continued existence and the autonomy of the Church and her educational institutions. He also promised good relations with the Holy See, which some interpret as a hint to a future concordat. Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber wrote to Cardinal Pacelli on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \\"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\\".\\"The Holocaust: What Was Not Said\\", Martin Rhonheimer, First Things Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 5 July 2009 Hitler met the representative of the German Bishops‚Äô Conference, Bishop Wilhelm Berning of Osnabr√ºck, on 26 April. At the meeting, Hitler declared: > I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The > Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put > them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In > the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving > back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was > implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the > representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, > and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them > out of schools and public functions. The notes of the meeting do not record any response by Bishop Berning. In the opinion of Martin Rhonheimer \\"This is hardly surprising: for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was really nothing terribly objectionable in this historically correct reminder. And on this occasion, as always, Hitler was concealing his true intentions.\\" In April, Hitler sent his vice chancellor Franz von Papen, a Catholic nobleman and former member of the Centre Party, to Rome to offer negotiations about a Reichskonkordat. On behalf of Cardinal Pacelli, Ludwig Kaas, the out-going chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated the draft of the terms with Papen. One of Hitler's key conditions for agreeing to the concordat, in violation of earlier promises, had been the dissolution of the Centre Party, which occurred on 5 July.Toland & Atkin. Shortly before signing the Reichskonkordat on 20 July, Germany signed similar agreements with the major Protestant churches in Germany. The concordat was finally signed, by Pacelli for the Vatican and von Papen for Germany, on 20 July. The Reichskonkordat was ratified on 10 September 1933.

In his 1937 encyclical Mit brennender Sorge he accused the Nazi regime of sowing \\"fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\\". The Nazis claimed jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, interfering with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies. By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, Pope Pius XI issued the Mit brennender Sorge encyclical ‚Äì accusing the Nazi Government of violations of the 1933 Concordat, and further that it was sowing the \\"tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\\". The Pope noted on the horizon the \\"threatening storm clouds\\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany. He asserted the inviolability of human rights and expressed deep concern at the Nazi regime's flouting of the 1933 Concordat, its treatment of Catholics and abuse of Christian values.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.58 Copies had to be smuggled into Germany so they could be read from the pulpitManners 2002, p. 374. The encyclical, the only one ever written in German, was addressed to German bishops and was read in all parishes of Germany. The actual writing of the text is credited to Munich Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber and to the Cardinal Secretary of State, Eugenio Pacelli, who later became Pope Pius XII.August Franzen, Remigius B√§umer Papstgeschichte Herder Freiburg, 1988, p. 394. Nazi violations of the Reichskonkordat had escalated to include physical violence.Rhodes, p. 197 quotation \\"Violence had been used against a Catholic leader as early as June 1934, in the 'Night of the Long Knives' ... by the end of 1936 physical violence was being used openly and blatantly against the Catholic Church. The real issue was not, as the Nazis contended, a struggle with 'political Catholicism', but that the regime would tolerate the Church only if it adapted its religious and moral teaching to the materialist dogma of blood and race - that is, if it ceased to be Christian.\\"Shirer, p. 235 quotation \\"On July 25, five days after the ratification of the concordat, the German government promulgated a sterilization law, which particularly offended the Catholic Church. Five days later the first steps were taken to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. During the next years, thousands of Catholic priests, nuns and lay leaders were arrested, many of them on trumped-up charges of 'immorality' or 'smuggling foreign currency'. Erich Klausener, leader of Catholic Action, was, as we have seen, murdered in the June 30, 1934, purge. Scores of Catholic publications were suppressed, and even the sanctity of the confessional was violated by Gestapo agents. By the spring of 1937, the Catholic hierarchy, in Germany, which, like most of the Protestant clergy, had tried to co-operate with the new regime, was thoroughly disillusioned.McGonigle, p. 172 quotation \\"Hitler, of course flagrantly violated the rights of Catholics and others whenever it pleased him. Catholic Action groups were attacked by Hitler's police and Catholic schools were closed. Priests were persecuted and sent to concentration camps. ... On Palm Sunday, 21 March 1937, the encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge was read in Catholic Churches in Germany. In effect it taught that the racial ideas of the leader (fuhrer) and totalitarianism stood in opposition to the Catholic faith. The letter let the world, and especially German Catholics, know clearly that the Church was harassed and persecuted, and that it clearly opposed the doctrines of Nazism.\\" Drafted by the future Pope Pius XIIPham, p. 45, quotation: \\"When Pius XI was complimented on the publication, in 1937, of his encyclical denouncing Nazism, Mit Brennender Sorge, his response was to point to his Secretary of State and say bluntly, 'The credit is his.'\\" and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it criticized HitlerVidmar, p. 327 quotation \\"Pius XI's greatest coup was in writing the encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge (\\"With Burning Desire\\") in 1936, and having it distributed secretly and ingeniously by an army of motorcyclists, and read from the pulpit on Palm Sunday before the Nazis obtained a single copy. It stated (in German and not in the traditional Latin) that the Concordat with the Nazis was agreed to despite serious misgivings about Nazi integrity. It then went on to condemn the persecution of the church, the neopaganism of the Nazi ideology-especially its theory of racial superiority-and Hitler himself, calling him 'a mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance.'\\" and condemned Nazi persecution and ideology and has been characterized by scholars as the \\"first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism\\" and \\"one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican.\\"Bokenkotter, pp. 389‚Äì392, quotation \\"And when Hitler showed increasing belligerence toward the Church, Pius met the challenge with a decisiveness that astonished the world. His encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge was the 'first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism' and 'one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican.' Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It denounced the Nazi \\"myth of blood and soil\\" and decried its neopaganism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the Fuhrer himself as a 'mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance'. The Nazis were infuriated, and in retaliation closed and sealed all the presses that had printed it and took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of Catholic clergy.\\"Rhodes, p. 204-205 quotation \\"Mit brennender Sorge did not prevaricate. Although it began mildly enough with an account of the broad aims of the Church, it went on to become one of the greatest condemnations of a national regime ever pronounced by the Vatican. Its vigorous language is in sharp contrast to the involved style in which encyclicals were normally written. The education question was fully and critically examined, and a long section devoted to disproving the Nazi theory of Blood and Soil (Blut und Boden) and the Nazi claim that faith in Germany was equivalent to faith in God. There were scathing references to Rosenberg's Myth of the Twentieth Century and its neo-paganism. The pressure exercised by the Nazi party on Catholic officials to betray their faith was lambasted as 'base, illegal and inhuman'. The document spoke of \\"a condition of spiritual oppression in Germany such as has never been seen before\\", of 'the open fight against the Confessional schools and the suppression of liberty of choice for those who desire a Catholic education'. 'With pressure veiled and open,' it went on, 'with intimidation, with promises of economic, professional, civil, and other advantages, the attachment of Catholics to the Faith, particularly those in government employment, is exposed to a violence as illegal as it is inhuman.' 'The calvary of the Church': 'The war of annihilation against the Catholic Faith'; 'The cult of idols'. The fulminations thundered down from the pulpits to the delighted congregations. Nor was the Fuhrer himself spared, for his 'aspirations to divinity', 'placing himself on the same level as Christ': 'a mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance' (widerliche Hochmut).\\"Norman, p. 167 quotation \\"But violations began almost at once by Nazi Party officials, and in 1937 the papacy issued a Letter to the German bishops to be read in the churches. Mit Brennender Sorge ... denounced the violations as contrary to Natural Law and to the term of the Concordat. The Letter, in fact, amounted to a condemnation of Nazi ideology: 'In political life within the state, since it confuses considerations of utility with those of right, it mistakes the basic fact than man as a person possesses God-given rights which must be preserved from all attacks aimed at denying, suppressing, or disregarding them.' The Letter also rejected absolutely the concept of a German National Church.\\" This encyclical condemned particularly the paganism of National Socialist ideology, the myth of race and blood, and fallacies in the Nazi conception of God: The Nazis responded with, an intensification of their campaign against the churches, beginning around April.Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; WW Norton & Company; London; p.381-382 There were mass arrests of clergy and church presses were expropriated.Joachim Fest; Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933-1945; Weidenfeld & Nicolson; London; p.374 Impact and consequences According to Eamon Duffy, \\"The impact of the encyclical was immense\\" and the \\"infuriated\\" Nazis increased their persecution of Catholics and the ChurchChadwick, Owen p. 254 quotation \\"The encyclical was smuggled into Germany and read from the pulpits on Palm Sunday. It made the repression far worse; but it too was necessary to Christian honour.\\" by initiating a \\"long series\\" of persecutions of clergy and other measures.Courtois, p. 29Duffy, (paperback edition) p. 343 quotation \\"In a triumphant security operation, the encyclical was smuggled into Germany, locally printed, and read from Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday 1937. Mit Brennender Sorge ('With Burning Anxiety') denounced both specific government actions against the Church in breach of the concordat and Nazi racial theory more generally. There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the 'idolatrous cult' which replaced belief in the true God with a 'national religion' and the 'myth of race and blood'. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home 'for all peoples and all nations'. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, Divini Redemptoris denouncing Communism, declaring its principles 'intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever', detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and 'amoral liberalism'. The language of Divini Redemptoris was stronger than that of Mit Brennender Sorge, its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope's own loathing of Communism as the ultimate enemy. The last year of his life, however, left no one any doubt of his total repudiation of the right- wing tyrannies in Germany and, despite his instinctive sympathy with some aspects of Fascism, increasingly in Italy also. His speeches and conversations were blunt, filled with phrases like 'stupid racialism', 'barbaric Hitlerism'.\\" Gerald Fogarty wrote that \\"in the end, the encyclical had little positive effect, and if anything only exacerbated the crisis.\\" The American ambassador reported that it \\"had helped the Catholic Church in Germany very little but on the contrary has provoked the Nazi state ... to continue its oblique assault upon Catholic institutions.\\" Frank J. Coppa wrote that the encyclical was viewed by the Nazis as \\"a call to battle against the Reich\\" and that Hitler was furious and \\"vowed revenge against the Church\\".Frank J. Coppa The German police confiscated as many copies as they could and called it \\"high treason\\". According to John Vidmar, Nazi reprisals against the Church in Germany followed thereafter, including \\"staged prosecutions of monks for homosexuality, with the maximum of publicity\\".Vidmar, p. 254. According to Thomas Bokenkotter, \\"the Nazis were infuriated, and in retaliation closed and sealed all the presses that had printed it and took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of the Catholic clergy.\\" According to Eamon Duffy \\"The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope.\\" According to Owen Chadwick, the \\"infuriated\\" Nazis increased their persecution of Catholics and the Church.Chadwick, Owen pp. 254‚Äì255. While numerous German Catholics who participated in the secret printing and distribution of Mit brennender Sorge went to jail and concentration camps, the press in the Western democracies remained silent, which Pius XI called as \\"a conspiracy of silence\\".Franzen, 395 The pope left Rome to avoid meeting Hitler during the dictator's state visit to Italy in May 1938, denounced the display of Swastika flags in Rome, and closed the Vatican museums. Teachings against Nazi antisemitism As the extreme nature of Nazi racial antisemitism became obvious, and as Mussolini in the late 1930s began imitating Hitler's anti- Jewish race laws in Italy, Pius XI was perturbed. In the 1930s, he urged Mussolini to ask Hitler to restrain the anti-Semitic actions taking place in Germany.Paul O'Shea; A Cross Too Heavy; Rosenberg Publishing; p. 230 When the newly installed Nazi Government began to instigate its program of antisemitism, Pope Pius ordered the Papal Nuncio in Berlin, Cesare Orsenigo, to \\"look into whether and how it may be possible to become involved\\" in their aid. Orsenigo proved a poor instrument in this regard, concerned more with the anti-church policies of the Nazis and how these might effect German Catholics, than with taking action to help German Jews.Paul O'Shea; A Cross Too Heavy; Rosenberg Publishing; p. 232 In 1937, he issued the Mit brennender Sorge () encyclical, in which he asserted the inviolability of human rights. It was written partly in response to the Nuremberg Laws, and condemned racial theories and the mistreatment of people based on race. It repudiated Nazi racial theory and the \\"so-called myth of race and blood\\". It denounced \\"Whomever exalts race, or the people, or the State ... above their standard value and divinizes them to an idolatrous level\\"; spoke of divine values independent of \\"space country and race\\" and a Church for \\"all races\\"; and said, \\"None but superficial minds could stumble into concepts of a national God, of a national religion; or attempt to lock within the frontiers of a single people, within the narrow limits of a single race, God, the Creator of the universe.Mit Brennender Sorge; papal encyclical of Pius XI The document noted on the horizon over Germany the \\"threatening storm clouds\\" of religious wars of extermination. Following the Anschluss and the extension of antisemitic laws in Germany, Jewish refugees sought sanctuary outside the Reich. In Rome, Pius XI told a group of Belgian pilgrims on 6 September 1938 that it was not possible for Christians to participate in anti-Semitism:Martin Gilbert; Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster; HarperPress; 2006; p.137 \\"Mark well that in the Catholic Mass, Abraham is our Patriarch and forefather. Anti- Semitism is incompatible with the lofty thought which that fact expresses. It is a movement with which we Christians can have nothing to do. No, no, I say to you it is impossible for a Christian to take part in anti-Semitism. It is inadmissible. Through Christ and in Christ we are the spiritual progeny of Abraham. Spiritually, we [Christians] are all Semites.\\"Marchione 1997, p. 53. These comments were subsequently published worldwide but had little resonance at the time in the secular media. On 11 November 1938, following Kristallnacht, Pope Pius XI joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom. In response, the Nazis organised mass demonstrations against Catholics and Jews in Munich, and the Bavarian Gauleiter Adolf Wagner declared before 5,000 protesters: \\"Every utterance the Pope makes in Rome is an incitement of the Jews throughout the world to agitate against Germany.\\"Martin Gilbert; Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster; HarperPress; 2006; p.143 On 21 November, in an address to the world's Catholics, the Pope rejected the Nazi claim of racial superiority, and insisted instead that there was only a single human race. Robert Ley, the Nazi Minister of Labour, declared the following day in Vienna: \\"No compassion will be tolerated for the Jews. We deny the Pope's statement that there is but one human race. The Jews are parasites.\\" Catholic leaders including Cardinal Schuster of Milan, Cardinal van Roey in Belgium and Cardinal Verdier in Paris backed the Pope's strong condemnation of Kristallnacht.Martin Gilbert; Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster; HarperPress; 2006; p.172 Pius XI's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli, made some 55 protests against Nazi policies, including its \\"ideology of race\\".Hitler's Pope? ; Martin Gilbert; The American Spectator; 18/8/06 Pacelli succeeded Pius XI on the eve of war in 1939. Taking the name Pius XII, he also employed diplomacy to aid the victims of Nazi persecution, and directed his Church to provide discreet aid to Jews.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica : Reflections on the Holocaust His first encyclical Summi Pontificatus again spoke against racism, with specific reference to Jews: \\"there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision.\\"Pius XII, Summi Pontificatus; 48; October 1939.

Bennett Memorial Library is the primary academic library at Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant, Oklahoma. Construction began in 1927 and was completed in 1928 in Colonial Revival architecture, during Henry Garland Bennett's presidency, SOSU's sixth president. The collection at Bennett Library has over 183,000 volumes, 485,000 microforms, and 878 current periodical titles. It also has a selection of newspapers, sound recordings, videos, and software. Additionally, as a selective U. S. Government depository, the library has holdings of approximately 87,816 government documents and 6,077 Oklahoma documents. History The library at Southeastern Normal School began in 1909. When the permanent building for the school was finished in 1910, the library was housed on the third floor. In 1911, a large shipment of books and materials was sent to the library. In 1915, the library was installed with lights, enabling students to study in the library at night. By 1917 the library had nearly one thousand children‚Äôs books, something that was not found in any other normal school in the state. Plans for housing the library in a separate building began early in 1927. Construction began later that year and completed in 1928 during the presidency of Henry G. Bennett, at a cost of $US114,000. The library building featured four large Corinthian columns, a first floor magazine room and a second floor that could accommodate four hundred students. The third floor was for departmental libraries and contained several classrooms. On the night of October 2, 1934, the library's north end caught fire. The fire was put out quickly by the Durant Fire Department and salvaged the building and many of the 30,000 books inside. The damage to the library was estimated at $50,000. The library building was repaired and in the late 1930s the library was designated as a depository for federal government documents, and lamp posts were installed in front of the library. Through the 1930s and 1940s improvements were made to the library building, and in 1954, air conditioning was installed. Another important event of the 1950s was the addition of the 50,000th book in 1954. For many years the library building housed the cafeteria in the basement, as well as the library and classrooms above. It was a closed-stack library with the stacks on the south side. During the mid- sixties, the building was completely renovated with an addition on the west. It has been an open-stack library since then. As computer technology progressed in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the library slowly began to implement computers in the library. By 1988, there were two databases for students on computer. The library services were automated in 1990 when the Data Research Association Library System was selected, which is an integrated on-line system providing circulation, public access catalog, cataloging, acquisitions, and serials components. The Ardmore Higher Education Center Library‚Äôs holdings are also included in the database. Further purchase of computer equipment and addition of more computer databases further increased the use of computers in the library. By 1997 there were thirteen computer for student use which enabled students to search several databases and use the Internet. The library began a web presence with introduction of its web page in 1997. In 1999 a computer lab was installed in the library with forty computers where students can do research, use library databases, write papers, or check their e-mail. Namesake Henry G. Bennett served as the sixth president of Southeastern Oklahoma State University, from 1919 to 1928. After his presidency at SOSU, Bennett was nominated as president at Oklahoma A&M; College and served from 1928 to 1950. The library building was named the Henry G. Bennett Memorial Library in 1982 during homecoming festivities. External links * Henry G.

He was a son of Miniconjou chief Lone Horn and became a chief upon his father's death. He was a highly renowned chief with skills in war and negotiations. A United States Army soldier, at Fort Bennett, coined the nickname (Si T»ü√°≈ãka) ‚Äì not to be confused with (also known as Ste Si T»ü√°≈ãka and Chetan keah).Michno, 303 In 1890, he was killed by the U.S. Army at Creek, Pine Ridge Indian Reservation Waz√≠ Ah√°≈ãha≈ã Oy√°≈ãke), South Dakota, USA with at least 150 members of his tribe, in what became known as the Wounded Knee Massacre. Early life Spotted Elk (Lakota: U≈ãp»ü√°≈ã Gle≈°k√°) was born about 1826, the son of Lakota Sioux chief Lone Horn (Heh-won-ge-chat). His family belonged to the Miniconjou (\\"Planters by the River\\") subgroup of the Teton Lakota (Sioux). He had three brothers: Roman Nose, Frog and Touch the Clouds (Ma»üp√≠ya Iƒç√°»ütagya), each of whom were to become leaders of Miniconjou bands. In 1877, Spotted Elk became the chief of his tribe upon his father's death at the age of 87. Chief Spotted Elk Skillful diplomat As chief, Spotted Elk (who later became known by the name of 'Big Foot' or Sit»ü√°≈ãka), was considered a great man of peace. He was best known among his people for his political and diplomatic successes. He was skilled at settling mass quarrels and was often in great demand among other Teton bands. Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse alliance During the 1870s, Spotted Elk allied his tribe against the US Army, together with half-brother Sitting Bull (Lakota: T»üat»ü√°≈ãka √çyotake), nephew Crazy Horse (T»üa≈°√∫≈ãke Witk√≥) and brother Touch the Clouds (Ma»üp√≠ya Iƒç√°»ütagya). Spotted Elk saw no major action during the Great Sioux War of 1876-77. However, his tribe ‚Äì the Miniconjou, Lakota Sioux ‚Äì suffered during the war, after which they surrendered. Reservation placement Following the Sioux Wars, the government placed the Miniconjou on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, South Dakota. Spotted Elk encouraged adaptation to reservation life, by way of developing sustainable agriculture and building schools for Lakota children. He was amongst the first American Indians to raise corn in accordance with government standards. Spotted Elk also advocated a peaceful attitude toward white settlers. Ghost Dance conversion and evangelism New religious movement Due to poor living conditions on the reservations, the Lakota struggled greatly to survive. In some cases, Indian agents were corrupt, undertaking fraud and stealing Lakota supplies/annuities. By 1889 they were in despair, and looked for change. The radical solution came in the form of the Ghost Dance movement, a new religion initiated by Paiute prophet Wovoka. Spotted Elk and the Lakota became among the most enthusiastic believers in the 'Ghost Dance' ceremony when it arrived among them, in the spring of 1890. Although governmental reservation rules outlawed the practice of the religion, the movement swept like a wildfire through the camps and local Indian agents reacted with alarm. Some agents successfully suppressed the dancers, while others called for federal troops to restore order. Chief Red Cloud offers refuge After , when Sitting Bull was killed on Standing Rock Reservation, his followers fled for refuge at the camp of his former-ally and half-brother, Chief Spotted Elk. Fearing arrest and government reprisals against his band, Spotted Elk led his band south to the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota, at the invitation of Chief Red Cloud (Lakota: Ma»üp√≠ya L√∫ta). Red Cloud hoped that his fellow chief could help make peace. Seeking safety, flying a white flag and with no intention of fighting, Spotted Elk contracted pneumonia on the journey to Pine Ridge. Death at Wounded Knee Massacre Native American Chief Spotted Elk lies dead after the massacre of Wounded Knee, 1890 Peaceful surrender On December 28, 1890, Maj. Samuel M. Whitside's battalion of the 7th Cavalry intercepted the Lakota. Ill with pneumonia, Spotted Elk surrendered peacefully, with his band; the cavalry took them into custody, escorting them to a campsite near Wounded Knee Creek, Pine Ridge, where they were to set camp. The site was already established with a store and several log houses. Wounded Knee Massacre The night before the massacre, Col. James W. Forsyth arrived at Wounded Knee Creek and ordered his men to position four Hotchkiss cannons around the area in which the Lakota had been forced to camp. On the morning of December 29, 1890, Forsyth's soldiers entered the camp and demanded that the Lakota give up their weapons. In the ensuing confrontation, a firearm was discharged. It was later believed to have been by a deaf man, Black Coyote, who presumably did not hear the command to put down his rifle. A large gun fight quickly ensued. The US forces killed 153 Lakota, mostly non-combatants (women and children) and Spotted Elk was among those killed. Notes References * Michno, Gregory.

Named for Harry Hays, the agriculturalist and politician who developed the breed, it was the first pure breed of cattle created in Canada. Work on breeding the Hays Converter began in 1959, and it was officially recognized by the Canadian beef industry under the Canada Livestock Pedigree Act in December 1975. Senator Hays wished to create a cattle breed that would be based solely on production, and as such would mature to market weight as fast as possible. Characteristics The Hays Converter is a hardy beef cattle breed, meant to stand up to the harsh conditions in Alberta. They are equipped with strong legs and good feet giving this breed increased hardiness. By appearance, they are generally black with some white markings on the face, legs and underbelly. They can also be red and white in colour, but this is a more rare occurrence. Cows typically weigh 1250 to 1500 pounds while bulls can reach a weight of 2300 to 2800 pounds. Hays Converters are an early maturing breed, this feature allows them to breed and produce offspring sooner than other breeds of cattle. Hays chose three particular breeds of cattle in order to achieve the optimal breed of cattle. He achieved this by combination crosses of Holstein cattle on Hereford cattle and Brown Swiss cattle. These three existing breeds were chosen specifically for certain traits they carried. The Holstein cattle were chosen due to their good strong feet and ability to produce milk with a high butter-fat content, allowing calves to grow faster. The Hereford cattle were chosen due to their high fleshing rate, meaning that their ability to mature quickly would also be passed onto their offspring. Lastly, the Brown Swiss cattle were chosen due to their perfectly shaped udder and ability to produce milk up until the end of lactation. Once the crosses began, Hays selected for the traits he wanted, and any offspring that did not make the cut in one way or another would have their tails docked and were shipped off to a processing plant. Once all desired traits were achieved in the offspring, the breed was closed off to mating with any outside breeds. By the time the breed achieved pedigree status in 1975, it had achieved all of the traits Hays had hoped it would. These traits included, high growth rate, sturdy build, good carcass quality, easy calving and excellent milk production.

There had been several attempts to form national general unions in the 1820s, culminating with the National Association for the Protection of Labour, established in 1830. However, this had soon failed, and by the early 1830s the most influential labour organization was the Operative Builders' Union.G. N. Clark, New Cambridge Modern History: the zenith of European power, 1830-70, p.346 In 1833, Robert Owen returned from the United States, and declared the need for a guild-based system of co-operative production. He was able to gain the support of the Builders' Union, which called for a Grand National Guild to take over the entire building trade. In February 1834, a conference was held in London which founded the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union.Ivor Marsh et al, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, p.458 The new body, unlike other organisations founded by Owen, was open only to trade unionists and, as a result, initially Owen did not join it. Its foundation coincided with a period of industrial unrest, and strikes broke out in Derby, Leeds and Oldham. These were discouraged by the new union, which unsuccessfully tried to persuade workers to adopt co-operative solutions. Six labourers in Tolpuddle, Dorset, attempted to found a friendly society and to seek to affiliate with the Grand National. This was discovered, and in 1834 they were convicted of swearing unlawful oaths, and they were sentenced to transportation for seven years. They became known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs and there was a large and successful campaign led by William Lovett to reduce their sentence. They were issued with a free pardon in March 1836. The organisation was riven by disagreement over the approach to take, given that many strikes had been lost, the Tolpuddle case had discouraged workers from joining unions, and several new unions had collapsed. The initial reaction was to rename itself the British and Foreign Consolidated Association of Industry, Humanity and Knowledge, focus increasingly on common interests of workers and employers, and attempt to regain prestige by appointing Owen as Grand Master.Ronald George Garnett, Co-operation and the Owenite socialist communities in Britain, 1825-45, p.142 The organisation began to break up in the summer of 1834Harrison, J.F.C.

In 1837, it registered as a friendly society, but was initially overshadowed by Owen's similar National Community Friendly Society. In 1838, it was able to expand significantly by sending out \\"social missionaries\\", setting up fifty branches, most in Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire.Royle (1998) p.65 In 1839, the National Community and the Association of All Classes merged to form the Universal Community Society of Rational Religionists.Royle (1998) p.95 Despite its name, the Grand National was never able to gain significant support outside LondonW.

Set in World War II, it stars Richard Burton and Curt J√ºrgens as two British Army officers sent out on a commando raid in North Africa. Ruth Roman plays the former lover of one and the wife of the other. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ren√© Hardy. Plot During the Western Desert Campaign of World War II, two Allied officers in Egypt are interviewed to lead a dangerous commando mission far behind enemy lines in Benghazi. Major David Brand, a South African, is a regular army officer but lacks experience of combat and of commanding men in the field. He does not speak Arabic and has only a limited knowledge of the area in Libya in which the patrol is to operate. Captain Jimmy Leith, a Welshman, is the opposite; an amateur volunteer with extensive knowledge of the area who knows a local guide and speaks fluent Arabic as well. It is decided that both officers will go, with Major Brand in command. The men see Brand as a disciplinarian - \\"the only thing he's slept with is the rule book\\". Major Brand's wife Jane is a Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) Flight Officer who enlisted to be near her husband. When Brand invites Leith to drinks with his wife, he picks up the fact that the two had previously had an affair before she married Brand. Leith had walked out on her without explanation. The unit parachutes behind enemy lines with the mission of attacking a German headquarters and bringing back secret plans from a safe to be opened by Wilkins, an experienced safecracker. Dressed as local civilians, Brand's hand shakes with fright when he has to knife a German sentry; the deed is done by Leith. The mission is completed with only one death and one man wounded of the British soldiers. The patrol ambushes a German detachment, capturing Oberst Lutze, who Brand knows was responsible for the secret information. Possibly in the hope of getting rid of Leith, Brand leaves him alone with two seriously wounded men, one British, one German. Leith decides to put them out of their pain. He shoots the German, who pleads for his life. The Briton encourages Leith to act quickly, and get it over with. Leith puts his pistol to the soldier's head and fires but there are no bullets left. Rather than reloading, Leith picks the man up and sets out to carry him to safety. The ironic use of music here, a heroic march, is unusually powerful. The man cries out in agony and curses Leith's failure, but dies before Leith puts him down again. Leith, whose Arab friend has joined him, then catches up with the rest of the unit. The patrol is supposed to escape on camels but they discover the men left with them have been murdered and the camels taken. During the long march back across the desert, Brand's animosity towards Leith grows, not only due to the affair with his wife but to Brand's fear that Leith will reveal him as a coward to headquarters and destroy his career. While the group are resting, Brand sees a scorpion climb up the leg of Leith's trousers but does not warn him in time. When Leith is stung, Brand refrains from shooting him as his orders permit and lets him die in pain during a sandstorm. The men believe he killed him. A patrol eventually picks up the group and takes them back to HQ. Brand's wife is distraught to learn of Leith's death and when Brand is immediately awarded the Distinguished Service Order, instead of congratulating him, she walks off disconsolate. In the closing shot Brand ruefully pins the medal on a stuffed training dummy.

The US co-production consisted of Columbia Pictures putting up some financing in return for worldwide distribution rights. The French financing came from the publisher Robert Laffont. Production started on 17 February 1957 and finished two months later.

It is adjacent to the village of Great Waltham. The Domesday Book refers to the two villages as Waltham, consisting of several manors. The site of an Iron Age village was excavated before upgrading the main road north between the current villages. The village straddles the River Chelmer. Its main street has a number of old houses near the bridge, notably a rare Essex example of a Wealden hall house, now divided into three cottages. A footpath leads south alongside the river to an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, part of which is a nature reserve.Little Waltham Meadows The countryside is under continued threat from housing and road development.threat Amenities The parish church, St Mary the Virgin, is dedicated to St Martin of Tours, and has a Norman south door with a window above.Ages In The Making a history of two Essex villages, R. Phillips and R. Bazett, 1973, 1974 Its East window features local landmarks shown at the foot of the cross. There is also a United Reformed Church in The Street. There is a pub in the centre of the village, The White Hart. This has undergone extensive renovation in recent years to turn it from a traditional pub into a more modern \\"gastro-pub\\" serving quality food. It has good reviews and an overall 4/5 rating on trip advisor. The village has a doctor's surgery in Brook Hill, with a pharmacy on site. There are two main halls in the village, Tufnell Hall and the Memorial Hall. Tufnell Hall is home to the Little Waltham Sports and Social Club, which hosts the village football team as well as badminton. Tufnell Hall has a main hall which is used by the Montessori Nursery School during term times (see Education) and is available for hire for functions, plus a separate bar area open to members and visitors. The Memorial Hall is used by the village playgroup and is also used as the polling station for elections. The United Reformed Church also has a smaller hall which is primarily used for church functions plus the Applepips nursery school. Sport The village also has a cricket team, the ground is in the centre of the village opposite the White Hart pub and Tufnell Hall. A short lived greyhound racing track was opened in the spring of 1930 on the main Braintree-Chelmsford Road. The racing on Friday evenings was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The grass track held races over 550 yards races and had a covered stand with refreshments available on site. The four acre site near Ash Tree Corner was put up for sale in Feb 1931, meetings after this were organised by the Waltham Greyhound and Whippet Club. Equipment from the track at New Writtle Street Stadium was installed here in March 1936. Education Most Primary School age children in Little Waltham attend either Little Waltham Church of England Primary School, with some attending Great Waltham Church of England Primary School nearby. High School age children typically attend Chelmer Valley High School in nearby Broomfield. There are also nursery schools in the village including: a Montessori Nursery School, Rainbow Little Waltham, for 2-5 year olds; Applepips at the URC; and the playgroup at the Memorial Hall.

It is a type of stochastic approximation algorithm. As an optimization method, it is appropriately suited to large-scale population models, adaptive modeling, simulation optimization, and atmospheric modeling. Many examples are presented at the SPSA website http://www.jhuapl.edu/SPSA. A comprehensive recent book on the subject is Bhatnagar et al. (2013). An early paper on the subject is Spall (1987) and the foundational paper providing the key theory and justification is Spall (1992). SPSA is a descent method capable of finding global minima, sharing this property with other methods as simulated annealing. Its main feature is the gradient approximation that requires only two measurements of the objective function, regardless of the dimension of the optimization problem. Recall that we want to find the optimal control u^* with loss function J(u): :u^* = \\\\arg \\\\min_{u \\\\in U} J(u). Both Finite Differences Stochastic Approximation (FDSA) and SPSA use the same iterative process: :u_{n+1} = u_n - a_n\\\\hat{g}_n(u_n), where u_n=((u_n)_1,(u_n)_2,\\\\ldots,(u_n)_p)^T represents the n^{th} iterate, \\\\hat{g}_n(u_n) is the estimate of the gradient of the objective function g(u)= \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial u}J(u) evaluated at {u_n}, and \\\\\\\\{a_n\\\\\\\\} is a positive number sequence converging to 0. If u_n is a p-dimensional vector, the i^{th} component of the symmetric finite difference gradient estimator is: :FD: (\\\\hat{g_n}(u_n))_i = \\\\frac{J(u_n+c_ne_i)-J(u_n-c_ne_i)}{2c_n}, 1 ‚â§i ‚â§p, where e_i is the unit vector with a 1 in the i^{th} place, and c_nis a small positive number that decreases with n. With this method, 2p evaluations of J for each g_n are needed. Clearly, when p is large, this estimator loses efficiency. Let now \\\\Delta_n be a random perturbation vector. The i^{th} component of the stochastic perturbation gradient estimator is: :SP: (\\\\hat{g_n}(u_n))_i = \\\\frac{J(u_n+c_n\\\\Delta_n)-J(u_n- c_n\\\\Delta_n)}{2c_n(\\\\Delta_n)_i}. Remark that FD perturbs only one direction at a time, while the SP estimator disturbs all directions at the same time (the numerator is identical in all p components). The number of loss function measurements needed in the SPSA method for each g_n is always 2, independent of the dimension p. Thus, SPSA uses p times fewer function evaluations than FDSA, which makes it a lot more efficient. Simple experiments with p=2 showed that SPSA converges in the same number of iterations as FDSA. The latter follows approximately the steepest descent direction, behaving like the gradient method. On the other hand, SPSA, with the random search direction, does not follow exactly the gradient path. In average though, it tracks it nearly because the gradient approximation is an almost unbiased estimator of the gradient, as shown in the following lemma.  Convergence lemma  Denote by :b_n = E[\\\\hat{g}_n|u_n] - abla J(u_n) the bias in the estimator \\\\hat{g}_n. Assume that \\\\\\\\{(\\\\Delta_n)_i\\\\\\\\} are all mutually independent with zero-mean, bounded second moments, and E(|(\\\\Delta_n)_i|^{-1}) uniformly bounded. Then b_n‚Üí0 w.p. 1\\\\.  Sketch of the proof  The main idea is to use conditioning on \\\\Delta_n to express E[(\\\\hat{g}_n)_i] and then to use a second order Taylor expansion of J(u_n+c_n\\\\Delta_n)_i and J(u_n-c_n\\\\Delta_n)_i. After algebraic manipulations using the zero mean and the independence of \\\\\\\\{(\\\\Delta_n)_i\\\\\\\\}, we get :E[(\\\\hat{g}_n)_i]=(g_n)_i + O(c_n^2) The result follows from the hypothesis that c_n‚Üí0. Next we resume some of the hypotheses under which u_t converges in probability to the set of global minima of J(u). The efficiency of the method depends on the shape of J(u), the values of the parameters a_n and c_n and the distribution of the perturbation terms \\\\Delta_{ni}. First, the algorithm parameters must satisfy the following conditions: * a_n >0, a_n‚Üí0 when n‚Üí‚àù and \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} a_n = \\\\infty . A good choice would be a_n=\\\\frac{a}{n}; a>0; * c_n=\\\\frac{c}{n^\\\\gamma}, where c>0, \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{6},\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right]; * \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} (\\\\frac {a_n}{c_n})^2 < \\\\infty * \\\\Delta_{ni} must be mutually independent zero-mean random variables, symmetrically distributed about zero, with \\\\Delta_{ni} < a_1 < \\\\infty . The inverse first and second moments of the \\\\Delta_{ni} must be finite. A good choice for \\\\Delta_{ni} is the Rademacher distribution, i.e. Bernoulli +-1 with probability 0.5. Other choices are possible too, but note that the uniform and normal distributions cannot be used because they do not satisfy the finite inverse moment conditions. The loss function J(u) must be thrice continuously differentiable and the individual elements of the third derivative must be bounded: |J^{(3)}(u)< a_3 < \\\\infty . Also, |J(u)|\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty as u\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty. In addition, abla J must be Lipschitz continuous, bounded and the ODE \\\\dot{u}=g(u) must have a unique solution for each initial condition. Under these conditions and a few others, u_k converges in probability to the set of global minima of J(u) (see Maryak and Chin, 2008).  Extension to Second- Order (Newton) Methods  It is known that a stochastic version of the standard (deterministic) Newton-Raphson algorithm (a ‚Äúsecond-order‚Äù method) provides an asymptotically optimal or near-optimal form of stochastic approximation. SPSA can also be used to efficiently estimate the Hessian matrix of the loss function based on either noisy loss measurements or noisy gradient measurements (stochastic gradients). As with the basic SPSA method, only a small fixed number of loss measurements or gradient measurements are needed at each iteration, regardless of the problem dimension p.

History and ownership The original Black Sluice was probably the Skirbeck Sluice where Earl of Lindsey's 1635 attempt to drain what was then called the Lindsey Levels ran to the sea. The ensuing battle with the population left the works destroyed, and this seems to be the origin of the name Black Sluice. The name became associated with the area drained by the original 40 foot drain, and has been used for each successive outfall from the area, and for the name of the authority responsible for the drainage. Created in 1765 the Black Sluice Commissioners are succeeded today by the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board and a range of interlocking boards and authorities: The Witham and Steeping Rivers Catchment Board, Lincolnshire River Board. National Rivers Authority, and now the Environment Agency. There have been at least three Black Sluices, the latest of which incorporates the pumping station built in 1946. The lock The lock which gave passage past the Black Sluice fell into disrepair after the second world war, but was restored to full operation in 2008 as part of the Fens Waterways Link scheme to improve navigation through the fens for pleasure craft. A formal opening of the lock was held on 20 March 2009. The new lock can handle boats up to long, broad, and with draught of up to on the most favourable tides. While the lock itself has no airdraught restrictions, London Road Bridge, immediately upstream has limited headroom in the form of an arch at nearly in the centre and as little as at the lowest usable point. Connection to Lincoln is further restricted by the size of the lock at the Grand Sluice, which is just over long, although longer vessels can pass through at certain states of the tide. Black Sluice Lock is not permanently manned, so bookings for transit will need to be made a minimum of 24 hours in advance. There is a small visitors centre at the new Lock.

Allende himself later enrolled there and studied with Agust√≠n Reyes, Aurelio Silva, Carlos Debuys√®re, Domenico Brescia, Luis Esteban Giarda y Federico St√∂ber, from whom he learned music theory, violin, piano, cello, harmony, counterpoint, fugue and composition. In 1908, he graduated, having specialized in harmony, composition, violin, and song, and obtained a professorship. Two years later he was the prize winner at the musical concourse of the Centenary of Chile. In 1911, he traveled to Europe, with a grant from the Chilean government, to perfect his musical knowledge. He visited Portugal, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. On his return, he suggested certain reforms that were introduced in the National Conservatory. He soon made another trip to Europe, giving lectures on music in Germany, Spain, and France. He had a long, respected career both as a composer and as a professor at the National Conservatory in Chile. His compositions drew inspiration from Chilean folk themes as well as the music of the Mapuche.

She was born in El Barrio, Spanish Harlem and raised in the South Bronx. She moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 2004. She performed locally and on the local NPR station. The single \\"Supposed to Be\\" from Every Second in Between was listed in USA Today's Playlist on September 15, 2009, by Steve Jones. A√±el was accepted into the Leonard Davis Center of Performing Arts at City College of the City University of New York. She later studied with legendary jazz singer Shelia Jordan for one year in her vocal performance workshop. She enrolled in Eddie Simon's Guitar Study Center. Only able to afford to pay for one class, she audited as many classes as possible. Gaining the respect from the instructors, who admired her diligence, she was often allowed to participate in class like the students who were fully enrolled. During her time at Guitar Study Center, she attended open-mike nights in Greenwich Village. She began to get gigs and subsequently put a band together. She continued performing, building a following which eventually took her to recording her first CD, Laughed Last in 1994 on Palmetto Records.  Recordings  In 1994, A√±el signed with Palmetto Records, which released her debut CD, Laughed Last. It was met with rave reviews as well as airplay on AAA stations across the United States, in particular in New York. In 2002, A√±el recorded Hi-Octane Coffee, which was produced by J.B. Moore and featured Drew Zingg (Steely Dan, Alana Davis, Gladys Knight), Frank Vilardi (Donny Osmond, Jill Sobule, The Bacon Brothers), Seth Glassman (James Brown, Paul McCartney, Maceo Parker, Carol King) and Johnny Gale (co-producer Ryan Shaw \\"This is Ryan Shaw\\"). This union provided the opportunity for A√±el's songs to shine, showcasing her music in all its diversity, from the funk of \\"The Way Out\\" to the Americana-Country tinged \\"Nothing in Common\\" to the folk-acoustic guitar- vocal \\"Zora\\". Hi-Octane Coffee received excellent press, continuing to raise A√±el's profile within the industry. In January 2007, A√±el released her third CD entitled Dream Again (Wall-I Records/Quarry Hill Studios). Dream Again marks A√±el's first recording as co-producer. She was joined by bassist Cooke Harvey. JazzTimes magazine said: \\"...part soul sister, part jazz chanteuse and pure dynamite...her songs are consistently excellent...\\". This is A√±el's first international recording on the German label. It was released 10/10/08 throughout Europe and Japan. It was embraced by the European media including Hit Meister and MusicLetter. On her fifth release, Every Second In Between (Wall-I Records), A√±el wanted to continue depicting her love of songwriting, singing and interpretation, but at a whole new level. Enter Producer, four- time Grammy winner, Glenn Barratt. Every Second In Between, released 9/30/09, is a collaboration of heart, soul, words, music, spirit and technique. The songs' landscapes accurately capture A√±el, bringing her voice to the forefront, from the classically tinged Voyager, with its string quartet and A√±el's voice, alone and in chorus, to her cover of Nina Simone's That's All I Want From You, and the Latin flavored Supposed To Be, the album's first single, a song of empowerment with the storyteller's refusal to give up sense of self. Noted jazz journalist Ken Franckling in his review of Every Second In Between when referencing his favorite songs on the CD, stated his \\"Favorites: All 11 Tracks\\". USA Today 's music critic Steve Jones highlights A√±el's song \\"Supposed to Be\\" as one of 10 interesting songs he found during the week of September 15, 2009.

Williams quotes Shakespeare to readers of his autobiography by drawing from Othello: \\"I will a plain unvarnished tale deliver,\\" a line often used in slave narratives but powerful here. The humbleness of this phrase belies a thoughtful, complex life story. While his memoir was actually published in 1929, Williams claims to have composed it in 1914 during a time when he feared he might go blind and wanted to document his life before that occurred. However, he did not go blind, and lived on for at least another two or three decades. Before the War In his narrative, he states: \\"The place of my birth and the conditions under which I was born are matters over which, of course, I had no control. If I had, I should have altered the conditions, but I should not have changed the place; for it is a grand old city, and I have always felt proud of my citizenship.\\"Aleckson, pp. 17. His mother and father were owned by separate families. Like many enslaved children, Williams sometimes lived in a family unit and sometimes did not; he lived in the households of both his father's and mother's owners. During his early childhood, his mother and older brother worked with her owners while he remained in his grandmother's care because he was too young for any practical use. Williams enjoyed his life with his and his father's owners, saying they were \\"of all slave holders, the very best.\\"Aleckson, p. 19. Throughout the entire beginning of this story, there is not a single account of a beating, or of any slave being subjected to any truly disagreeable work. The younger children had almost all of their time free to play. Early on, Williams would play with the neighbor's white children, and later with other black children on the plantation that to which he moved. However, Sam makes sure to clearly indicate, \\"There is nothing good to be said of American slavery. I know it is sometimes customary to speak of its bright and its dark sides. I am not prepared to admit that it had any bright sides, unless it was the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln...\\" Aleckson, pp. 29-30. In his early childhood, while the four white children Williams played with were at school, Williams was taught how to read and write by the children's aunts. He was taught using only one book, which he called \\"Thomas Dilworth's,\\" referring to A New Guide to the English Tongue by Thomas Dilworth. From the book, Williams claims he learned about grammar, weights and measures, ciphers, and morals. In addition, Williams describes the popular use of slates for his lessons, as well as his fascination with fable illustrations that instructed what was moral and what was not: \\"...such as that of the man who prayed to Hercules to take his wagon out of the mire; of the two men who stole a piece of meat; of the lazy maids and of the kindhearted man who took a half frozen serpent into his house.\\"Aleckson, p. 26. He also states many slaves were punished for being found in possession of the schoolbook, though the reward of mastering the book was being considered a \\"prodigy of learning\\" within the slave community. Of his owner, Williams stated: \\"Mr. Ward was what was called a 'good master.' His people were well-fed, well-housed, and not over-worked. There were certain inflexible rules however, governing his plantation of which he allowed not the slightest infraction, for he had his place for the Negro... His place for the Negro was in subjection and servitude to the white man.\\" Aleckson, pp. 52-53. Williams alludes to his master's classism, pointing out that his white supremacy ideology did not extend to all whites and that there were some he would have barred from slaveholding. Ward, like many other slaveholders, asserted his role as owner and enslaver with a paternalistic view. He provided well for his slaves while demanding complete obedience. Ward, for example, took care to always know their whereabouts by insisting he authorize any departure from his land and as Williams depicts in his memoir, Ward had no qualms about punishing those slaves he felt defied him. As a boy, Williams learned to ride horses from one of his owners. Williams states, \\"He taught me to ride, and when I could sit my horse well 'bare-back' he had a saddle made for me at the then famous 'McKinzie's' saddlery, sign of the 'White Horse' at the corner of Church and Chalmers Street.\\" This training to ride was not wholly unique to Williams' experience. In fact, enslaved people were essential to the world of horse racing in the American South. Jockeys and trainers were commonly enslaved people. Despite limited privileges, these enslaved horse riders were still subjected to the realities of being slaves in a slave society. Williams never became a formal jockey, however, and of this he says the following: \\"Possibly Mr. Dane had 'views', concerning me for he owned several fast horses, but before I was old enough to be of practical service, 'Sherman came marching through Georgia.'\\"  During the War  1860 Charleston newspaper informing about the dissolution of the Union Williams recounts his arriving in Charleston one day to find that \\"men were going about the streets wearing blue cockades on the lapels of their coats.\\"Aleckson, p. 86. This was his first realization that there was a war going on, though the effects (amazingly high prices for everything and the disappearance of many of the young men to go fight) had been felt for a while. Williams recounts the conversations between other enslaved men and women at this time regarding the impending war and their support of the Union officer General Robert Anderson, who defied the Confederacy by trying to maintain Federal control of Fort Sumter. Free and enslaved African Americans were barred from being soldiers in the Confederacy. However, after Williams' older brother died of fever, the 10-year-old Williams took his brother's place as a Confederate officer's \\"boy.\\" He ran errands for the soldiers but he was never mentioned in the remembrance of Confederate soldiers. Williams acknowledges this in his memoir: \\"And here I must admit I wore the 'gray.' I have never attended any of the Confederate reunions. I suppose they overlooked my name on the army roll!\\" Williams' childhood home on Guignard Street was destroyed by the Great Charleston Fire on December 11, 1861. This fire destroyed many of the main landmarks such as the Charleston Circular Church and Institute Hall where the Ordinance of Secession was signed,http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20110130/PC1602/301309938/1245 and Williams remembered it to be the biggest blaze he would ever see in Charleston. Remembering the event in his memoir, Williams describes how \\"the sparks seemed to rain down as we ran.\\"Aleckson, p. 118. Thus, Williams' memoir serves as an eye-witness account of the chaos and fear created by the Great Fire. After the War Once the Confederates surrendered, life in South Carolina changed dramatically for Williams and his family. They were reunited under one roof; Alexander Williams and his family resided on Princess Street in Charleston for many years. Williams' account of this era includes reflections about the \\"Black Code\\" or laws passed to restrict civil and social rights of freedmen. He wondered why, at least in his time, one did not hear much about this, saying that perhaps \\"somebody is ashamed of it.\\"Aleckson, p. 140. In 1876, Williams' employer asked him to vote for General Wade Hampton. Williams chose not to vote in the election at all, even though he heard the General speak: \\"Our only desire he said, was to save our dear old state from utter ruin. Then, raising his right hand to heaven he said these very words as near as I can recollect, \\"If I am elected governor, I swear to God that not one right or privilege that you now enjoy shall be taken from you!\\" Williams also noted that many of the promises that General Hampton made did not come to fruition and that, in fact, acts of disenfranchisement and Jim Crow laws were being enacted against blacks during this era. After the Civil War, Williams moved to the Northeast where he and his daughter, Susan, lived in both Lebanon, New Hampshire and Windsor, Vermont. According to the 1910 census, Williams and his daughter were living in Lebanon where they worked as servants for the Carty family. In Vermont, both worked for author Thomas H. Thomas. They were listed in the 1920 United States Federal Census, living in Windsor Village with the Thomas Family. Williams appears to have moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts in the 1920s with his daughter Susan, who married an African- American lawyer/dentist named William Alexander Cox. Cox was also heavily involved in the National Negro Business League.  Autobiography  After an illness weakened Williams' eyes and he feared going blind, he decided to record events from his past. He was also motivated in writing his memoir by the desire to remind future generations of African Americans of the cruel experience of slavery, a reason disclosed in the memoir's preface: \\"It is a remarkable fact that very many of the immediate descendants of those who passed through the trying ordeal of American slavery know nothing of the hardships through which their fathers came. Some reason for this may be found in the fact that those fathers hated to harrow the minds of their children by the recital of their cruel experiences of those dark days.... While it is sweet to forgive and forget, there are somethings that should never be forgotten. If this humble narrative will serve to cause the youth of my people to take a glance backward, the object of the writer will have been attained.\\" Williams' memoir, written in 1914, uses pseudonyms for the majority of individuals and places of which he speaks. For example, the Ward, Bale and Dane families he discusses in his memoir are likely fake names just as Williams himself used a pseudonym in order to author his work. His memoir was later published in 1929 by Gold Mind Publishing Company in Boston, Massachusetts. It is likely the memoir was published with the help of Williams' step-grandson, William A. Cox Jr, the son of William Alexander Cox. William A. Cox Jr. worked in Gold Mind Printers in Boston around the years of 1928 to 1930. It is probable that it is the same printing company that published Williams' memoir, as the publisher named in the book, Gold Mind Publishing Company, was based in the same city and has a similar name. Thus, it is likely Williams received his step-grandson's help in publishing his memoir.  Further reading  * Ashton, Susanna, ed.

Public transport security refers to measures taken by a mass transit system to keep its passengers and employees safe, to protect the carrier's equipment, and to make sure other violations do not occur. This includes the enforcement of various rules and regulations, human and video surveillance, the deployment of a transit police force, and other techniques. Public transport security has become a major issue around the world since the September 11 attacks, and especially the 2004 Madrid train bombings. In the United States, the FBI at times has put the nation's mass transit systems on high alert,http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20090923/NEWS02/909230354 and the U.S. Congress has reconsidered cuts in funding following attacks in other parts of the world..http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/44343 Grants have been given in order to improve security to mass transit systems in the United States,http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-grant-boost-transit- security-0923,0,5812385.story while in the United Kingdom, public transport, due to its \\"open nature\\", is considered a major potential target for terrorists.  Security measures  LASD deputy and a police dog patrol a LA Metro light rail train. It has been proposed that extra security screening of passengers and their bags would be the best option of preventing weapons or bombs on public transport. However, this would also have a number of negative side effects, which could outweigh the benefits, among them: *increased (and prohibitive) costs *reduced public transport convenience, leading to more car travel (and thus road deaths) *making the queues of people waiting for screening vulnerable to attacks *creating a sense of fear and a call for further measures and reduced civil liberties Therefore, most experts recommend against such methods. Like random or profile-based searches of public transport users, they are often considered security theater, because random searches will be unlikely to catch the particular terrorist, and profile-based searching allows the terrorist to reverse engineer the search system, using attackers which are unsuspicious. Passengers are often instructed to be extra- vigilant, including looking out for persons behaving oddly while on or in the vicinity of mass transit vehicles or stations, being dressed out of character for the weather, or leaving behind bags or packages. However, this has also been criticised as scaremongering, as the likelihood of terror attacks on public transport is, for the individual, very low. Individual attacks are also likely to kill fewer people than an attack on an airplane, and are thus of less attractiveness for terrorists. Opponents of security theater therefore argue that even very good security around public transport is relatively useless, as it only moves the threat from transport to other targets - such as movie theaters. They instead advocate spending more money on investigative (police and secret service) ways of apprehending terrorists before they can carry out an attack. Similar arguments have been raised about the United States Federal Air Marshal Service, which provides plainclothes marshals aboard airline flights. According to Congressman John J. Duncan, the air marshalls had led to only 4.2 arrests a year, at an average cost of $200 million per arrest. He argued that this represents a win of the perceived dangers of terror, supported by a profit center-type approach, over realistic spending priorities.

Author of numerous plays, she founded the Society of Dramatic Authors, and helped open doors for other female theatre artists. Early years and education Martha Morton was born in New York City on October 10, 1865. Raised partly in London and in New York City, she attended the Normal College (Hunter College).Engle, Sherry. New Women Dramatists in America, 1890-1920. (NY: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007) 13-53New York Times She began writing stories and poems at a young age, and found some early success in getting published. Career When she was nineteen, in 1884 Morton wrote a parody of David Belasco's May Blossom, which Daniel Frohman used as a skit for a benefit production. Morton then penned a melodrama, Helene, staged in a benefit showing, followed by a two-week production in 1889; Clara Morris, an actress renowned for her emotive acting style, kept the melodrama in her repertoire for a number of years. Morton's next produced play, The Merchant, won first place and $5,000 in the New York World's playwriting contest, enjoying a seven-week run at the Madison Square Theatre in 1891. Four plays for comedian William H. Crane undoubtedly contributed to Morton's high earnings as a playwright; Crane toured the United States and played in New York: Brother John (1893), His Wife's Father (1895), A Fool of Fortune (1896), and The Senator Keeps House (1911). At the age of twenty-one, she directed her first Broadway production, and became increasingly interested in \\"the role of women as active participants in solving problems of a national scope.\\"Gipson 216 Several successful female playwrights followed in Morton‚Äôs footsteps, thanks to her unending encouragement.Londre When she tried to join the American Dramatists Club, she was denied admission because she was a woman. As a result, she, along with other women dramatists, founded the Society of Dramatic Authors in 1907, which included thirty female members, and one male member.Gipson 219 When members of the American Dramatists Club joined Morton‚Äôs group, the cross-saturation eventually led to the joining of the two, called The Society of American Dramatists and Composers - forerunner of the Dramatists Guild of America.Gipson 219-220 Morton married Hermann Conheim in 1897 and died February 18, 1925, after a brief struggle with heart disease.New York Times Themes She contributed to American theatre, serving as an example and encouraging younger women playwrights. Although most of her plays reflect the mode of her time and are not remembered today, she worked to express critical views on stage and to try different genres. One important achievement \\"was in her resolution to present women characters on stage who had the strength to be independent in thought and action.\\"Gipson 217 Eventually, Morton would go on to earn over for her plays.

Durfee High School is a public high school located in the city of Fall River, Massachusetts, United States. It is a part of Fall River Public Schools and is the city's main public high school, the other being Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School. Durfee is one of the biggest high schools in Massachusetts, and is also the 4th biggest high school in Southeastern Massachusetts behind Brockton, Taunton and New Bedford. These three high schools (excluding Taunton) make up the Big Three League, the conference in which all their athletic teams compete.  History  In 2014 the school and Bristol Community College (BCC) were planning an agreement regarding early college classes.  Buildings Old postcard of historic Durfee school building The school has been located in two buildings. From its opening in 1886 until the new building was completed in 1978 the school was located in the historic B.M.C. Durfee High School building on Rock Street, The iconic building, with its tall red-capped clock tower and red-domed observatory tower, overlooks the Taunton River and gives rise to the Fall River school district's seal, the school's athletics nickname, the Hilltoppers, their school colors of black and red (for the two roof colors), the school newspaper, the Hilltop, and their school alumni newspaper, the Chimes. For several decades prior to moving, the school also occupied the former Technical High School building across the street. Since 1978 the school has been located on Elsbree Street in the city's north end. Located in former swamp land, the school was built both to modernize the district and to alleviate the overcrowding at the former sites. The school also moved its athletic fields, which were nearby to the new school, to its new campus, as well as building the on-campus Luke Urban Field House, as the school had formerly used the Fall River Armory for indoor athletics. Since 2011, there has also been a modern recreation of the Durfee clock tower located at the new site. Athletics Durfee's athletic teams are known as the Hilltoppers, a nod to the location of the old school building atop the Highland neighborhood hills overlooking the Taunton River, and their school colors are black and red. As of the 2018-2019 school year, their school mascot is Rocky the Hilltopper. The school fight song is sung to the tune of the Notre Dame Victory March. The school's chief rival has always been New Bedford High School, as the two cities share a deep rivalry in general. The school also has rivalries with Brockton High School, Taunton High School and, to a lesser extent, many of the other local school districts. *Fall **Boys' and Girls' Cross Country **Boys' and Girls' Soccer **Cheerleading **Girls' Swimming **Girls' Volleyball **Football **Field Hockey **Golf *Winter **Boys' and Girls' Basketball **Boys' and Girls' Winter Track **Boys' Swimming **Cheerleading **Ice hockey **Wrestling *Spring **Boys' and Girls' Outdoor Track **Boys' and Girls' Tennis **Boys' Volleyball **Baseball **Softball Notable alumni Many of the below are considered distinguished alumni of DurfeeB.M.C.

Ginger was favoured among tea drinkers, in addition to onion, orange peel, cloves and peppermint.  Japan  In Japan, it is called sh≈çgayu (ÁîüÂßúÊπØ).  Korea  In Korea, ginger tea is called saenggang-cha (, ). It can made either by boiling fresh ginger slices in water or mixing ginger juice with hot water. Sliced ginger preserved in honey, called saenggang-cheong, can also be mixed with hot water to make ginger tea. Nowadays, powdered instant versions are also widely available. When served, the tea is often served garnished with jujubes and pine nuts. When using fresh ginger, the tea can be sweetened with honey, sugar, or other sweetener according to taste. Garlic, jujubes, and pear are sometimes boiled along with ginger.

(2012): A synopsis of the South Asian fishes referred to Puntius (Pisces: Cyprinidae). Ichthyological Exploration of Freshwaters, 23 (1): 69-95. Its stocks have declined in recent decades, and in 1996 it was assessed to be in need of conservation to ensure it stays plentiful. However, this assessment may be outdated by now. Introduction Some authors have recently proved that the diversity of Ichthyofauna of the Southwest Ichthyological zone streams of Sri Lanka has a great significance in the sense of biodiversity (Senanayeke, 1980; Wikramanayake, 1990; Pethiyagoda, 1991). The two-spot barb is distributed in Kelani River, Kalu River, Benthota River and Gin River. Pethia cumingii, a Sri Lankan endemic, has long been presumed to be dichromatic, with some populations possessing yellow fins while others displayed red fins. Until 2008 Pethia reval, the red-finned color form, was not identified as a separate species from P.cumingii, and had been misunderstood as a ‚Äúvariety‚Äù of P.cumingii but has now been elevated to the status of species.http://www.verlag-pfeil.de/04biol/pdf/ief19_2_07.pdf A silvery fish with yellow reflection on shoulders.

Habitat and Microhabitats Schut, De silva and Kortmulder (1984) discuss the habitat associations of this species. They are usually associated with a mud or silt substrate, flowing water, and is associated with substrates from sand to boulders. Puntius cumingii has been introduced into the Mahaweli at Ginigathena, where the river bed comprises boulders and gravel, and has established a population there (Wikramanayake, 1990) They occupy the lower half of the water column. Puntius cumingii is usually active in flowing water and stays close to the substrate, and It is a hardy fish which is usually found in medium-sized shoals (Pethiyagoda 1991). Reproduction They spawn with the onset of rains. About 100 eggs are spawned and hatch in about a day. Most of the fry are free-swimming the next day. De Silva and kortmulder (1977) state that the fish is mature when 3 cm long. Reproductive biology is discussed by De Silva, Schut and Kortmulder (1985).

With the bulk of his professional work taking place in Chicago, Hallett began by working in church civil rights and later turned increasingly toward community economic and environmental sustainability. He and colleagues together created Chicago's Center for Neighborhood Technology(CNT), South Shore Bank (later ShoreBank), Northwestern University's Center for Urban Affairs and Policy Research and other institutions. During his career he worked alongside numerous activists, journalists and religious leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr., Saul Alinsky, George McGovern and Studs Terkel. One of the key concepts that Dr. Hallett would add to urban planning was the idea that there is an 'economy of neighborhoods'; Scott Bernstein, a Hallett disciple and co- founder of the CNT, told an interviewer: \\"Most economists don't admit to an economy of cities, let alone neighborhoods. Stan saw neighborhoods as a place where money flows in and out.\\" Early life Stan Hallett was born in New Hampton, Iowa, on October 6, 1930, one of five children of Reverend Reveley and Stella Hallett. The family moved from town to town in Iowa and finally settled in Rapid City, South Dakota. During World War II, with many young men serving military duty, Hallett began his church career preaching to a congregation in Wall, South Dakota at age 14. At a Methodist Youth Conference in Clear Lake, Iowa, Hallett roomed with future civil-rights leader James Lawson. The two would room together four consecutive years at this annual weeklong program. Hallett received his B.A. from Dakota Wesleyan University in 1950. In 1954, he received his Bachelor of Sacred Theology, magna cum laude, from Boston University's School of Theology. He did a photo study on Boston's Roxbury neighborhood and became acquainted with fellow theology student Martin Luther King Jr. Hallett was influenced by Dean Walter George Muelder, whom Hallett felt \\"...was way before his time on the status of women in the church, and he had a very strong commitment to dealing with questions of race\\". From 1957 to 1959, Hallett served as associate pastor to a church in Newark, N.J. He led a campaign against an industrial park that would displace 10,000 residents. (\\"You develop a special relationship with people as a pastor... And you get angry at the racism they experience. I began to probe myself at levels I didn't even know were there. I discovered that my perceptions of race were like an onion.\\") From 1961 to 1962, Hallett studied urban planning at Harvard University. The Chicago years In 1962, Hallett moved to Chicago to take a job as director of research and planning for the Church Federation of Greater Chicago. Church Federation executive director Rev. Edgar Chandler became a mentor; Chandler would later help organize King's Soldier Field rally and would organize a march on the segregated Rainbow Beach, along with Monsignor John Joseph Egan and Rabbi Robert Marx. At the Urban Training Center for Christian Mission, Hallett taught organizing strategies to civil-rights activists heading south, as he had noticed: In 1963, Hallett received his Ph.D. from Boston University. His dissertation was entitled \\"Ethical Issues in Urban Planning and Development.\\" He spent that summer in the south, at the invitation of Ed King. Hallett says, \\"I had another friend from Boston, Ed King, who was a pastor at Tougaloo College in Mississippi. ...Ed told me 16 civil rights workers had been killed‚Äîthis was the summer of '63‚Äîand he felt the news wasn't being reported. ...I said, 'What can I do?' He said, 'The most important thing is for you to come down here. We have to get outside credible sources in here to get the news out.' I went down and spent a week in Mississippi with Ed. When I came back, I reported it to a meeting of the Church Federation of Greater Chicago. I gave probably the best speech of my life. And then we began to organize a delegation of clergy to go there from northern cities with the purpose of keeping down the violence. The clergy would come back to Detroit or Baltimore, and then there would be an article in the local papers from somebody they trusted. One after another the major metropolitan dailies started to report what was going on. Nicholas von Hoffman was a reporter for the Chicago Daily News. When we were working on desegregating churches in Mississippi, I would talk to Nick every night. Nick would suggest what to do next because he knew what would make the news. And we'd act it out. He was the only reporter I knew who'd help make the news so he could write about it.\\" That year Hallett also worked as a consultant to developer Jim Rouse on the planning and development of Columbia, Maryland. In 1965, Hallett worked to bring clergy from Chicago and other northern cities to the call of the Civil Rights Movement. He and other \\"bishops, rabbis, ministers, priests and nuns felt the call to march in Alabama with Martin Luther King.\\" Hallett was quoted in the Time Magazine article of Friday, April 9, 1965, entitled Churches: The Selma Spirit‚Äî\\"It was a breakthrough into a whole new spirit,\\" he says, \\"a sense of being part of a community at a level and depth that we've never known before.\\" In 1968, Hallett's church, the Church of the Holy Covenant on Diversey Street in Chicago, provided lodging for protesters during the Democratic convention. In 1971, Al Raby, who headed the Coordinating Council of Community Organizations, introduced Hallett to Ron Grzywinski, Milton Davis and Mary Houghton, who would together establish the South Shore Bank's community banking program. He served as a Founding Board Member for the ShoreBank Corporation from 1973 to 1975, and was vice-president of South Shore's holding company in its critical first five years. In 1973, Hallett led the fight to save the South Shore Country Club. In 1974, Hallett took a position at Northwestern University's Center for Urban Affairs and Policy Research. The center was one of 16 research centers started by the Ford Foundation in the wake of the 1968 riots. He developed analysis of credit flows and economics in urban neighborhoods. Hallett became an Adjunct Faculty member at the Kellogg School of Management. In 1976, Hallett was co-founder, along with Scott Bernstein and Dr. John Martin, of the Center for Neighborhood Technology. CNT grew from a project at the Center for Urban Affairs examining appropriate technology for city neighborhoods, initially looking at food production, solar energy and conservation. (\\"A lot of environmental groups are good at saying, 'Stop, don't do this.' But the question of what we should be doing instead requires that you really take a look at technological development.\\" He served as a Board Member until his death in 1998. That same year, Hallett joined five colleagues to launch the Chicago-based Woodstock Institute (originally in hearby Woodstock, Illinois), serving as a Founding Board Member until his death in 1998. In 1978, Hallett became a faculty member at the Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary. He taught courses on History of Western Ethics and Political Philosophy, and the Urban Mission of the Church. Hallett helped lead a coalition of civic organizations in battle against the Deep Tunnel Project. (\\"You start with the assumption that if a project is that big it must be really well thought through. The more you look, the more you begin to come to the conclusion that any project that big is almost certainly not thought through. You get this great mobilization of business, union, and political forces to do things that make no sense.\\") In 1980, Hallett's work helped shape the basis for City Fair, a major alternative technology fair, in Seattle, Wash. In 1985, Hallett and brother Tom launched Pathfinder Systems, Inc., a personal rapid transit system, to free cities from the enormous toll of the automobile. The concept for Pathfinder would become a consuming, lifelong interest, stating: In 1986, Mayor Harold Washington appointed Hallett to the board of the Metra commuter rail system, where he served through 1993. In 1987, Hallett and John L. McKnight co-chaired the Chicago Innovations Forum, providing forums for discussion of evolving urban issues. From 1995 to 1997, Hallett served on Governor Jim Edgar's Task Force on Human Resources Reform. In 1998, Hallett launched the Masters program in Community Development at North Park University, a Christian liberal arts university on Chicago's northwest side. Hallett died on November 24, 1998.

It is located one hour southwest of Cincinnati, one hour northwest of Lexington, and forty-five minutes east of Louisville, and lies on the Kentucky River. History The land that is now Perry Park was originally used as hunting grounds by Native Americans, particularly the Iroquois. The first Caucasian to enter the current land of Perry Park, was Jacob Drennon, a land surveyor, working for James McAfee. He had heard a legend of a healing spring there, and was led by an Indian to the area. He made the first land claim there, and called it, \\"Lick Skillet\\", because the men were so hungry, that when they received their rations, they licked their skillets clean. Kentucky became a state in 1792, and more settlers came in, including a former soldier of the American Revolutionary War, Benjamin Perry. He, his children and grandchildren moved to Perry Park from Virginia circa 1810, along with the Berryman family. In 1832, Benjamin Perry's grandson, Washington Perry, and his wife Martha, built a house called \\"Wildwood\\". For an undetermined cause, they did not reside in that house for long. At some point between 1830 and 1850 the current house \\"Glenwood Hall\\" was built. Glenwood Hall is still in use today as a bed and breakfast and dining hall. The other plantation that was formerly located in Perry Park, was the Inverness. Also a tobacco plantation, it was built by Thomas A. Berryman, and was named after his wife Lucy's birthplace, Inverness, Scotland. The Inverness House was burned down by arsonists in the 1980s. The Perrys and the Berrymans were known for their parties, and had many visitors due to the springs near their homes. In 1849, nearly 1000 guests visited the springs, most likely stopping to see one of the two families. One of their children, Merton, died of an unknown cause at the age of 10. Two other children and a servant were possibly killed by a fire, before the Civil War. It is said they are still playing in the attic, and there are numerous reports of strange occurrences. By the time of the American Civil War, Washington, being a slave holder, most likely supported the Confederacy, yet it is known for certain which side he chose. During the Civil War there were a number of minor Confederate guerrilla movements in the area. Records show that though he lost all his slaves, Washington Perry was more prosperous after the war. Washington Perry died in 1875, Martha in 1893 and are buried at Port Royal Cemetery in Henry County, Kentucky. Their neighbors, the Berrymans, are buried at a family cemetery inside the park. Washington's grandson, Perry Minor, son of George Church Minor and Mary Perry, was given the house after Washington's death, and lived there until 1933. Sometime during his time as master of the house, it is believed that Grover Cleveland sat on a chair, still located in the house. While this may be rumor, the Cleveland campaign of 1884 did attack James G. Blaine with stories of wrongdoings to a young woman at Perry Park. In 1933, John H. Perry, who was publisher of a number of newspapers \\"Publishing Executive John H. Perry Succumbs\\", Associated Press in The Day, December 5, 1952. (including The Palm Beach Post) and another of Washington's grandchildren, bought the entire area, built a post office, and named the community Perry Park, after himself. The community, flourished in the 20th century, with many hotels and restaurants springing up, that have since been demolished. In 1966, Lingenfelter Investments bought the property and developed the land to include a golf course and other amenities. Glenwood Hall was utilized as a clubhouse and restaurant., August 19, 1997, pp. 26-27. Geography and wildlife Perry Park rests on the Kentucky River, which surrounds it on two sides. It is mostly flat, but is surrounded by mountains. Its many rolling hills are perfectly suited for golfing. There are several lakes in the area, the largest of which is \\"Holliday Lake\\". Wildlife is also very abundant in the park; the symbol of Perry Park is the deer, and there are hundreds or thousands of them in the area. Raccoons, opossum, and birds such as cardinals are also frequently seen in the area, and the surrounding forests. Perry Park is located at coordinates . Golfing and nearby attractions Perry Park's main attraction is a 27-hole golf course, with 9 different golf packages. It has a par of 72 and 5 sets of tees ranging from 7355 to 4000 yards. In 1997, after its former owner went into bankruptcy, the golf club (then called Glenwood Hall Golf & Country Club) was converted \\"from a mostly private resort to a club selling public memberships\\".Cliff Peale, \\"Club Tees Off With Public Memberships\\", The Cincinnati Post, April 16, 1997 . Also nearby is historic Carrollton and General Butler State Park.

Terminology The glyph ancestral to modern is first recorded in bronze script, where it could refer to shamans or sorcerers of either sex. Modern Mandarin wu (Cantonese mouh) continues a Middle Chinese mju or mjo. The Old Chinese reconstruction is uncertain, given as *mywo or as *myag,Bernhard Karlgren), mjuo < *' (Zhou Fagao), *mjag (Li Fanggui), mju < *ma (Axel Schuessler). the presence of a final velar -g or -…£ in Old Chinese being uncertain. By the late Zhou Dynasty (4th to 3rd centuries BCE), wu referred mostly to female shamans or \\"sorceresses\\", while male sorcerers were named xi \\"male shaman; sorcerer\\", first attested in the Guoyu or Discourses of the States (4th century BCE). Other sex-differentiated shaman names include nanwu for \\"male shaman; sorcerer; wizard\\"; and n√ºwu , wun√º , wupo , and wuyu for \\"female shaman; sorceress; witch\\". Wu is used in compounds like wugu \\"sorcery; cast harmful spells\\", wushen or shenwu (with shen \\"spirit; god\\") \\"wizard; sorcerer\\", and wuxian (with xian \\"immortal; alchemist\\") \\"immortal shaman\\". The word tongji (lit. \\"youth diviner\\") \\"shaman; spirit-medium\\" is a near-synonym of wu. Chinese uses phonetic transliteration to distinguish native wu from \\"Siberian shaman\\": saman or saman . \\"Shaman\\" is occasionally written with Chinese Buddhist transcriptions of Shramana \\"wandering monk; ascetic\\": shamen , sangmen , or sangmen . Joseph Needham (1954:134) suggests \\"shaman\\" was transliterated xianmen in the name of Zou Yan's disciple Xianmen Gao (or Zigao ). He quotes the Shiji that Emperor Qin Shi Huang (r. 221‚Äì210 BCE), \\"wandered about on the shore of the eastern sea, and offered sacrifices to the famous mountains and the great rivers and the eight Spirits; and searched for xian \\"immortals\\", [xianmen], and the like.\\" compares two later Chinese terms for \\"shaman\\": shanman , which described the Jurchen leader Wanyan Xiyin, and sizhu , which was used for imperial Manchu shamans during the Qing Dynasty. Translations Shaman is the common English translation of Chinese wu, but some scholars (; ) maintain that the Siberian shaman and Chinese wu were historically and culturally different shamanic traditions. Arthur Waley (1955:9) defines wu as \\"spirit-intermediary\\" and says, \\"Indeed the functions of the Chinese wu were so like those of Siberian and Tunguz shamans that it is convenient (as has indeed been done by Far Eastern and European writers) to use shaman as a translation of wu. In contrast, describes the \\"untranslatableness\\" of wu, and prefers using the romanization \\"wu instead of its contemporary English counterparts, \\"witches,\\" \\"warlocks,\\" or \\"shamans\\",\\" which have misleading connotations. Taking wu to mean \\"female shaman\\", Edward H. Schafer translates it as (1951:153) \\"shamaness\\" and (1973:11) \\"shamanka\\". The transliteration-translation \\"wu shaman\\" or \\"wu-shaman\\" implies \\"Chinese\\" specifically and \\"shamanism\\" generally. Wu, concludes , \\"may be rendered as \\"shaman\\" or, perhaps, less controversially as \\"spirit medium\\".\\" criticizes \\"the majority of scholars\\" who use one word shaman to translate many Chinese terms (wu , xi , yi , xian , and zhu ), and writes, \\"The general tendency to refer to all ecstatic religious functionaries as shamans blurs functional differences.\\" The character wu besides the meanings of \\"spirit medium, shaman, witch doctor\\" (etc.) also has served as a toponym: Wushan (near Chongqing in Sichuan Province), Wuxi \\"Wu Stream\\", Wuxia \\"Wu Gorge\\". Wu is also a surname (in antiquity, the name of legendary Wu Xian ). Wuma (lit. \\"shaman horse\\") is both a Chinese compound surname (for example, the Confucian disciple Wuma Shi/Qi ) and a name for \\"horse shaman; equine veterinarian\\" (for example, the Zhouli official). Characters The contemporary Chinese character for wu combines the graphic radicals gong \\"work\\" and ren \\"person\\" doubled (cf. cong ). This character developed from Seal script characters that depicted dancing shamans, which descend from Bronzeware script and Oracle bone script characters that resembled a cross potent. The first Chinese dictionary of characters, the (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi defines wu as zhu \\"sacrifice; prayer master; invoker; priest\\" (\\"\\", ) and analyzes the Seal graph, \\"An Invoker. A woman who can serve the Invisible, and by posturing bring down the spirits. Depicts a person with two sleeves posturing.\\" This Seal graph for wu is interpreted as showing \\"the Â∑• work of two dancing figures set to each other ‚Äì a shamanistic dance\\" or \\"two human figures facing some central object (possibly a pole, or in a tent-like enclosure?)\\" . This dictionary also includes a variant Great Seal script (called a guwen \\"ancient script\\") that elaborates wu . analyzes this guwen graph as gong \\"two hands held upward\\" at the bottom (like shi 's Seal graph) and two \\"mouths\\" with the \\"sleeves\\" on the sides; or (1920:424) \\"jade\\" because the Shuowen defines ling \\"spiritual; divine\\" as synonymous with wu and depicting , \\"an inspired shaman serving the Spirits with jade.\\" compares the Shang Dynasty oracle graphs for wu and nong \\"play with; cause\\" (written with \\"jade\\" over \\"two hands\\") that shows \\"hands (of a shaman?) elevating a piece of jade (the rain-compelling mineral) inside an enclosure, possibly a tent. The Seal and modern form may well derive from this original, the hands becoming two figures, a convergence towards the dancer-type graph.\\" Tu Baikui suggests that the wu oracle character \\"was composed of two pieces of jade and originally designated a tool of divination.\\" (\\"\\" 2014; citing ) Citing Li Xiaoding that gong Â∑• originally pictured a \\"carpenter's square\\", argues that oracle inscriptions used wu interchangeably with fang \\"square; side; place\\" for sacrifices to the sifang \\"four directions\\". This component is semantically significant in several characters: *wu (with the \\"speech radical\\" ) \\"deceive; slander; falsely accuse\\" *shi (with the \\"bamboo radical\\" ) \\"Achillea millefolium (used for divination)\\" *xi (with the \\"vision radical\\" ) \\"male shaman; male sorcerer\\" *ling (with the \\"cloud radical\\" and three \\"mouths\\" or \\"raindrops\\") \\"spirit; divine; clever\\" *yi \\"doctor\\", which is an old \\"shaman\\" variant character for yi (with the \\"wine radical\\" ) Etymology Han Dynasty tomb-tile showing \\"long-sleeved dancers\\" and attendants. A wide range of hypotheses for the etymology of w≈´ \\"spirit medium; shaman\\" has been proposed. proposed a relation between Mongolian b√ºg√§ \\"shaman\\", Turkish b√∂g√º \\"shaman\\", \\"Chinese bu, wu (shaman), buk, puk (to divine), and Tibetan aba (pronounced ba, sorcerer)\\". puts forward a Sino-Tibetan root *' \\"magician; sorcerer\\" for Chinese w≈´ < mju < *mjag \\"magician; shaman\\" and Written Tibetan 'ba'-po \\"sorcerer\\" and 'ba'-mo \\"sorcereress\\" (of the B√∂n religion). notes Chinese xian < sj√§n < *sen \\"transcendent; immortal; alchemist\\" was probably borrowed as Written Tibetan g≈°en \\"shaman\\" and Thai < Proto-Tai *' \\"doctor; sorcerer\\". In addition, the Mon‚ÄìKhmer and Proto-Western-Austronesian *' \\"shaman\\" may also be connected with w≈´. Schuessler lists four proposed etymologies: First, w≈´ could be the same word as w≈´ \\"to deceive\\" . Schuessler notes a written Tibetan semantic parallel between \\"magical power\\" and \\"deceive\\": sprul-ba \\"to juggle, make phantoms; miraculous power\\" cognate with \\"magical deception\\". Second, wu could be cognate with w«î \\"to dance\\". Based on analysis of ancient characters, proposed that w≈´ \\"shaman\\", w√∫ \\"not have; without\\", and w«î \\"dance\\", \\"can all be traced back to one primitive figure of a man displaying by the gestures of his arms and legs the thaumaturgic powers of his inspired personality\\" (1945:5). Many Western Han Dynasty tombs contained jade plaques or pottery images showing \\"long-sleeved dancers\\" performing at funerals, who identifies as shamans, citing the Shuowen jiezi that early w«î characters depicted a dancer's sleeves. Third, w≈´ could also be cognate with m«î \\"mother\\" since w≈´, as opposed to x√≠ , were typically female. Edward Schafer associates w≈´ shamanism with fertility rituals.\\"Linguistic facts reveal the intimate relationships between the word wu (*myu) \\"shamanka\\" and such words as \\"mother\\", \\"dance\\", \\"fertility\\", \\"egg\\", and \\"receptacle\\". The ancient shamanka, then, was closely related to the fecund mother, to the fertile soil, to the receptive earth. The textual evidence supports these philological associations. In Shang and Chou times, shamankas were regularly employed in the interests of human and natural fertility, above all in bringing rain to parched farmlands ‚Äì a responsibility they shared with ancient kings. They were musicians and dancers and oracles.\\" . cites the Japanese sinologist Shirakawa Shizuka 's hypothesis that the mother of Confucius was a w≈´. bronze script character w≈´ (*mjag). Fourth, w≈´ could be a loanword from Iranian *magu≈° \\"magus; magician\\" (cf. Old Persian magu≈°, Avestan mogu), meaning an \\"able one; specialist in ritual\\". Mair (1990) provides archaeological and linguistic evidence that Chinese w≈´ < *myag \\"shaman; witch, wizard; magician\\" was a loanword from Old Persian *magu≈° \\"magician; magus\\". Mair connects the bronze script character for w≈´ with the \\"cross potent\\" symbol ‚ò© found in Neolithic West Asia, suggesting the loan of both the symbol and the word. Early records of wu The oldest written records of wu are Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions and Zhou Dynasty classical texts. Boileau notes the disparity of these sources. > Concerning the historical origin of the wu, we may ask: were they a remnant > of an earlier stage of the development of archaic Chinese civilization? The > present state of the documentation does not allow such a conclusion for two > reasons: first, the most abundant data about the wu are to be found in > Eastern Zhou texts; and, second, these texts have little in common with the > data originating directly from the Shang civilization; possible ancestors of > the Eastern Zhou wu are the cripples and the females burned in sacrifice to > bring about rain. They are mentioned in the oracular inscriptions but there > is no mention of the Shang character wu. Moreover, because of the scarcity > of information, many of the activities of the Zhou wu cannot be traced back > to the Shang period. Consequently, trying to correlate Zhou data with > Neolithic cultures appears very difficult. Wu in Shang oracular inscriptions lists 58 occurrences of the character wu in concordance of oracle inscriptions: 32 in repeated compounds (most commonly \\"wu spirit/sacrifice\\" and \\"bring the wu) and 26 in miscellaneous contexts. differentiates four meanings of these oracular wu: #\\"a spirit, wu of the north or east, to which sacrifices are offered\\" #\\"a sacrifice, possibly linked to controlling the wind or meteorology\\" #\\"an equivalent for shi , a form of divination using achilea\\" #\\"a living human being, possibly the name of a person, tribe, place, or territory\\" The inscriptions about this living wu, which is later identified as \\"shaman\\", reveal six characteristics: > #whether the wu is a man or a woman is not known; #it could be either the > name for a function or the name of a people (or an individual) coming from a > definite territory or nation; #the wu seems to have been in charge of some > divinations, (in one instance, divination is linked to a sacrifice of > appeasement); #the wu is seen as offering a sacrifice of appeasement but the > inscription and the fact that this kind of sacrifice was offered by other > persons (the king included) suggests that the wu was not the person of > choice to conduct all the sacrifices of appeasement; #there is only one > inscription where a direct link between the king and the wu appears. > Nevertheless, the nature of the link is not known, because the status of the > wu does not appear clearly; #he follows (being brought, presumably, to Shang > territory or court) the orders of other people; he is perhaps offered to the > Shang as a tribute. Based on this ancient but limited Shang-era oracular record, it is unclear how or whether the Wu spirit, sacrifice, person, and place were related. Wu in Zhou received texts Chinese wu \\"shaman\\" occurs over 300 times in the Chinese classics, which generally date from the late Zhou and early Han periods (6th-1st centuries BCE). The following examples are categorized by the common specializations of wu-shamans: > men and women possessed by spirits or gods, and consequently acting as seers > and soothsayers, exorcists and physicians; invokers or conjurers bringing > down gods at sacrifices, and performing other sacerdotal functions, > occasionally indulging also in imprecation, and in sorcery with the help of > spirits. A single text can describe many roles for wu-shamans. For instance, the Guoyu idealizes their origins in a Golden Age. It contains a story about King Zhao of Chu (r. 515-489 BCE) reading in the Shujing that the sage ruler Shun \\"commissioned Chong and Li to cut the communication between heaven and earth\\". He asks his minister to explain and is told: > Anciently, men and spirits did not intermingle. At that time there were > certain persons who were so perspicacious, single-minded, and reverential > that their understanding enabled them to make meaningful collation of what > lies above and below, and their insight to illumine what is distant and > profound. Therefore the spirits would descend upon them. The possessors of > such powers were, if men, called xi (shamans), and, if women, wu > (shamanesses). It is they who supervised the positions of the spirits at the > ceremonies, sacrificed to them, and otherwise handled religious matters. As > a consequence, the spheres of the divine and the profane were kept distinct. > The spirits sent down blessings on the people, and accepted from them their > offerings. There were no natural calamities. > In the degenerate time of [Shaohao] (traditionally put at the twenty-sixth > century B.C.), however, the Nine Li threw virtue into disorder. Men and > spirits became intermingled, with each household indiscriminately performing > for itself the religious observances which had hitherto been conducted by > the shamans. As a consequence, men lost their reverence for the spirits, the > spirits violated the rules of men, and natural calamities arose. Hence the > successor of [Shaohao], [Zhuanxu] ..., charged [Chong], Governor of the > South, to handle the affairs of heaven in order to determine the proper > place of the spirits, and Li, Governor of Fire, to handle the affairs of > Earth, in order to determine the proper place of men. And such is what is > meant by cutting the communication between Heaven and Earth. Wu-shamans as healers The belief that demonic possession caused disease and sickness is well documented in many cultures, including ancient China. The early practitioners of Chinese medicine historically changed from wu \\"spirit-mediums; shamans\\" who used divination, exorcism, and prayer to yi or \\"doctors; physicians\\" who used herbal medicine, moxibustion, and acupuncture. As mentioned above, wu \\"shaman\\" was depicted in the ancient variant character for yi \\"healer; doctor\\". This archaic yi , writes , \\"ideographically depicted a shaman-doctor in the act of exorcistical healing with ( 'arrows' in) a 'quiver', a 'hand holding a lance', and a wu 'shaman'.\\" Unschuld believes this character depicts the type of wu practitioner described in the Liji. > Several times a year, and also during certain special occasions, such as the > funeral of a prince, hordes of exorcists would race shrieking through the > city streets, enter the courtyards and homes, thrusting their spears into > the air, in an attempt to expel the evil creatures. Prisoners were > dismembered outside all gates to the city, to serve both as a deterrent to > the demons and as an indication of their fate should they be captured. Replacing the exorcistical \\"shaman\\" in with medicinal \\"wine\\" in yi \\"healer; doctor\\" signified, writes , \\"the practice of medicine was not any longer confined to the incantations of the wu, but that it had been taken over (from an official standpoint) by the \\"priest-physicians,\\" who administered elixirs or wines as treatments for their patients.\\" Hexagram 32, Heng Wu and yi are compounded in the word wuyi \\"shaman-doctor; shamans and doctors\\", translated \\"exorcising physician\\" , \\"sorcerer-physician\\" , or \\"physician-shaman\\" . Confucius quotes a \\"Southern Saying\\" that a good wuyi must have heng \\"constancy; ancient tradition; continuation; perseverance; regularity; proper name (e.g., Yijing Hexagram 32)\\". The (ca. 5th century BCE) Lunyu \\"Confucian Analects\\" and the (ca. 1st century BCE) Liji \\"Record of Rites\\" give different versions of the Southern Saying. First, the Lunyu quotes Confucius to mention the saying and refer to the Heng Hexagram: > The Master said, The men of the south have a saying, Without stability a man > will not even make a good shaman or witch-doctor. Well said! Of the maxim; > if you do not stabilize an act of te , you will get evil by it (instead of > good), the Master said, They (i.e. soothsayers) do not simply read the > omens. Confucius refers to a Yijing line interpretation of the Heng \\"Duration\\" Hexagram : \\"Nine in the third place means: He who does not give duration to his character meets with disgrace.\\" In Waley's earlier article about the Yijing, he translated \\"If you do not stabilize your \\"virtue,\\" Disgrace will overtake you\\", and quoted the Lunyu. > \\"The people of the south have a saying, 'It takes heng to make even a > soothsayer or medicine-man.' It's quite true. 'If you do not stabilize your > virtue, disgrace will overtake you'.\\" Confucius adds , which has completely > baffled his interpreters. Surely the meaning is 'It is not enough merely to > get an omen,' one must also heng 'stabilize it'. And if such a rule applies > even to inferior arts like those of the diviner and medicine-man, Confucius > asks, how much the more does it apply to the seeker after [de] in the moral > sense? Surely he too must 'make constant' his initial striving! Second, the Liji quotes Confucius to elaborate upon the Southern Saying. > The Master said, 'The people of the south have a saying that \\"A man without > constancy cannot be a diviner either with the tortoise-shell or the stalks.\\" > This was probably a saying handed down from antiquity. If such a man cannot > know the tortoise-shell and stalks, how much less can he know other men? It > is said in the Book of Poetry (II, v, ode 1, 3) \\"Our tortoise-shells are > wearied out, And will not tell us anything about the plans.\\" The Charge to > [Yue] says ([Shujing], IV, VIII, sect. 2, 5, 11), \\"Dignities should not be > conferred on men of evil practices. (If they be), how can the people set > themselves to correct their ways? If this be sought merely by sacrifices, it > will be disrespectful (to the spirits). When affairs come to be troublesome, > there ensues disorder; when the spirits are served so, difficulties ensue.\\" > 'It is said in the [Yijing], \\"When one does not continuously maintain his > virtue, some will impute it to him as a disgrace; (in the position indicated > in the Hexagram.) 'When one does maintain his virtue continuously (in the > other position indicated), this will be fortunate in a wife, but in a > husband evil'.\\" This Liji version makes five changes from the Lunyu . (1) It writes bushi \\"diviner\\" instead of wuyi \\"shaman-doctor\\", compounding bu \\"divine by bone or shell, scapulimancy or plastromancy\\" and shi (also with \\"shaman\\") \\"divine by milfoil stalks, cleromancy or sortilege\\". (2) Instead of quoting Confucius to remark \\"well said!\\"; he describes the southern proverb as \\"probably a saying handed down from antiquity\\" and rhetorically questions the efficacy of divination. (3) The Liji correctly quotes the Shijing criticizing royal diviners: \\"Our tortoises are (satiated =) weary, they do not tell us the (proper) plans.\\" (4) It quotes the \\"Charge to Yue\\" (traditionally attributed to Shang king Wu Ding) differently from the fabricated Guwen \\"Old Texts\\" Shujing \\"Classic of History\\" chapter with this name. > Dignities may not be conferred on man of evil practices, but only on men of > worth. Anxious thought about what will be good should precede your > movements. Your movements also should have respect to the time for them. ... > Officiousness in sacrifices is called irreverence; ceremonies when > burdensome lead to disorder. To serve the spirits in this way is difficult. (5) It cites an additional Yijing Hexagram 32 line that gender determines the auspiciousness of heng. \\"Six in the fifth place means: Giving duration to one's character through perseverance. This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man.\\" The mytho-geography Shanhaijing \\"Classic of Mountains and Seas\\" associates wu-shamans with medicinal herbs. > East of the Openbright there are Shaman Robust, Shaman Pushaway, Shaman > Sunny, Shaman Shoe, Shaman Every, and Shaman Aide. They are all on each side > of the corpse of Notch Flaw and they hold the neverdie drug to ward off > decay. > There is Mount Divinepower. This is where Shaman Whole, Shaman Reach, Shaman > Share, Shaman Robust, Shaman Motherinlaw, Shaman Real, Shaman Rite, Shaman > Pushaway, ShamanTakeleave, and Shaman Birdnet ascend to the sky and come > down from Mount Divinepower. This is where the hundred drugs are to be > found. \\"Shaman Whole\\" translates Wu Xian below. Boileau contrasts Siberian and Chinese shamanic medicines. > Concerning healing, a comparison of the wu and the Siberian shaman shows a > big difference: in Siberia, the shaman is also in charge of cures and > healing, but he does this by identifying the spirit responsible for the > disease and negotiates the proper way to appease him (or her), for example > by offering a sacrifice or food on a regular basis. In archaic China, this > role is performed through sacrifice: exorcism by the wu does not seem to > result in a sacrifice but is aimed purely and simply at expelling the evil > spirit. Wu-shamans as rainmakers Wu anciently served as intermediaries with nature spirits believed to control rainfall and flooding. During a drought, wu-shamans would perform the yu \\"sacrificial rain dance ceremony\\". If that failed, both wu and wang \\"cripple; lame person; emaciated person\\" engaged in \\"ritual exposure\\" (Schafer 1951}} rainmaking techniques based upon homeopathic or sympathetic magic. As explains, \\"Shamans had to carry out an exhausting dance within a ring of fire until, sweating profusely, the falling drops of perspirations produced the desired rain.\\" These wu and wang procedures were called pu / \\"expose to open air/sun\\", fen \\"burn; set on fire\\", and pulu \\"reveal; lay bare; expose to open air/sun\\". For the year 639 BCE, the Chunqiu records, \\"In summer, there was a great drought\\" in Lu, and the Zuozhuan notes a discussion about fen wu wang : > The duke (Xi) wanted to burn a wu and a cripple at the stake. Zang Wenzhong > said: this is no preparation for the drought. Repair the city walls, limit > your food, be economic in your consumption, be parsimonious and advise > (people) to share (the food), this is what must be done. What use would be > wu and cripple? If Heaven wanted to have them killed, why were they born at > all? If they (the cripple and the wu) could produce drought, burning them > would augment very much (the disaster). (, citing ) The duke followed this advice, and subsequently \\"scarcity was not very great\\". The Liji uses the words puwang and puwu to describe a similar rainmaking ritual during the reign (407-375 BCE) of Duke Mu of Lu. > There was a drought during the year. Duke Mu called on Xianzi and asked him > about the reason for this. He said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a > long time. I want to expose to the sun a cripple and what about that?' > (Xianzi) said: 'Heaven has not (given us) rain in a long time but to expose > to the sun the crippled son of somebody, that would be cruel. No, this > cannot be allowed.' (the duke said): 'Well, then I want to expose to the sun > a wu and what about that?' (Xianzi) answered: 'Heaven has not (given us) > rain in a long time but to put one's hope on an ignorant woman and offer her > to pray (for rain), no, this is too far (from reason).' (, citing ) Commentators interpret the wu as a female shaman and the wang as a male cripple. De Groot connects the Zuozhuan and Liji stories about ritually burning wu. > These two narratives evidently are different readings of one, and may both > be inventions; nevertheless they have their value as sketches of ancient > idea and custom. Those 'infirm or unsound' wang were non-descript > individuals, evidently placed somewhat on a line with the wu; perhaps they > were queer hags or beldams, deformed beings, idiotic or crazy, or nervously > affected to a very high degree, whose strange demeanour was ascribed to > possession. Wu-shamans as oneiromancers Oneiromancy or dream interpretation was one type of divination performed by wu . The Zuozhuan records two stories about wu interpreting the guilty dreams of murderers. First, in 581 BCE the lord of Jin, who had slain two officers from the Zhao () family, had a nightmare about their ancestral spirit, and called upon an unnamed wu \\"shaman\\" from Sangtian and a yi \\"doctor\\" named Huan from Qin. > The marquis of [Jin] saw in a dream a great demon with disheveled hair > reaching to the ground, which beat its breast, and leaped up, saying: \\"You > have slain my descendants unrighteously, and I have presented my request to > the High God in consequence.\\" It then broke the great gate (of the palace), > advanced to the gate of the State chamber, and entered. The duke was afraid > and went into a side-chamber, the door of which it also broke. The duke then > awoke, and called the witch of [Sangtian], who told him everything which he > had dreamt. \\"What will be the issue?\\" asked the duke. \\"You will not taste > the new wheat,\\" she replied. > After this, the duke became very ill, and asked the services of a physician > from [Qin], the earl of which sent the physician [Huan] to do what he could > for him. Before he came, the duke dreamt that his disease turned into two > boys, who said, \\"That is a skilful physician; it is to be feared he will > hurt us; how shall we get out of his way?\\" Then one of them said: \\"If we > take our place above the heart and below the throat, what can he do to us?\\" > When the physician arrived, he said, \\"Nothing can be done for this disease. > Its seat is above the heart and below the throat. If I assail it (with > medicine), it will be of no use; if I attempt to puncture it, it cannot be > reached. Nothing can be done for it.\\" The duke said, \\"He is a skilful > physician\\", gave him large gifts, and send him back to [Qin]. > In the sixth month, on the day [bingwu], the marquis wished to taste the > new wheat, and made the superintendent of his fields present some. While the > baker was getting it ready, [the marquis] called the witch of [Sangtian], > showed her the wheat and put her to death. As the marquis was about to taste > the wheat, he felt it necessary to go to the privy, into which he fell, and > so died. One of the servants that waited on him had dreamt in the morning > that he carried the marquis on his back up to heaven. The same at mid-day > carried him on his back out from the privy, and was afterwards buried alive > with him. In this quote, \\"witch\\" is a translation of wu. Commentators have attempted to explain why the wu merely interpreted the duke's dream but did not perform a healing ritual or exorcism, and why the duke waited until the prediction had failed before ordering the execution. suggests the wu was executed in presumed responsibility for the Zhao ancestral spirit's attack. Second, in 552 BCE a wu named Gao both appears in and divines about a dream of Zhongxing Xianzi. After conspiring in the murder of Duke Li of Jin, Zhongxing dreams that the duke's spirit gets revenge. > In autumn, the marquis of [Jin] invaded our northern border. [Zhongxing > Xianzi] prepared to invade [Qi]. (Just then), he dreamt that he was > maintaining a suit with duke [Li], in which the case was going against him, > when the duke struck him with a [ge] on his head, which fell down before > him. He took his head up, put it on his shoulders, and ran off, when he saw > the wizard [Gao] of [Gengyang]. A day or two after, it happened that he did > see this [Gao] on the road, and told him his dream, and the wizard, who had > had the same dream, said to him: \\"Your death is to happen about this time; > but if you have business in the east, you will there be successful [first]\\". > Xianzi accepted this interpretation. In this quote, \\"wizard\\" is a > translation of wu. Boileau questions: > why wasn't the wu asked by Zhongxin to expel the spirit of the duke? Perhaps > because the spirit went through him to curse the officer. Could it be that > the wu was involved (his involvement is extremely strong in this affair) in > a kind of deal, or is it simply that the wu was aware of two different > matters concerning the officer, only one connected to the dream? (2002:369) According to these two stories, wu were feared and considered dangerous. This attitude is also evident in a Zhuangzi story about the shenwu \\"spirit/god shaman\\" Jixian from Zheng. > In [Zheng], there was a shaman of the gods named [Jixian]. He could tell > whether men would live or die, survive or perish, be fortunate or > unfortunate, live a long time or die young, and he would predict the year, > month, week, and day as though he were a god himself. When the people of > [Zheng] saw him, they all ran out of his way. \\"As soothsayers.\\" writes , \\"the wu in ancient China no doubt held a place of great importance.\\" Wu-shamans as officials Sinological controversies have arisen over the political importance of wu in ancient China. Some scholars (like and ) believe Chinese wu used \\"techniques of ecstasy\\" like shamans elsewhere; others (like ) believe wu were \\"ritual bureaucrats\\" or \\"moral metaphysicians\\" who did not engage in shamanistic practices. Chen Mengjia wrote a seminal article (1936) that proposed Shang kings were wu- shamans. > In the oracle bone inscriptions are often encountered inscriptions stating > that the king divined or that the king inquired in connections with wind- or > rain-storms, rituals, conquests, or hunts. There are also statements that > \\"the king made the prognostication that ...,\\" pertaining to weather, the > border regions, or misfortunes and diseases; the only prognosticator ever > recorded in the oracle bone inscriptions was the king ... There are, in > addition, inscriptions describing the king dancing to pray for rain and the > king prognosticating about a dream. All of these were activities of both > king and shaman, which means in effect that the king was a shaman. (, cited > in ) Chen's shaman-king hypothesis was supported by Kwang-chih Chang who cited the Guoyu story about Shao Hao severing heaven-earth communication (above). > This myth is the most important textual reference to shamanism in ancient > China, and it provides the crucial clue to understanding the central role of > shamanism in ancient Chinese politics.

Shamans, > therefore, were a crucial part of every state court; in fact, scholars of > ancient China agree that the king himself was actually head shaman. > (1983:45) Some modern scholars disagree. For instance, calls Chen's hypothesis \\"somewhat antiquated being based more on an a priori approach than on history\\" and says, > In the case of the relationship between wu and wang [king], Chen Mengjia did > not pay sufficient attention to what the king was able to do as a king, that > is to say, to the parts of the king's activities in which the wu was not > involved, for example, political leadership as such, or warfare. The process > of recognition must also be taken into account: it is probable that the wu > was chosen or acknowledged as such according to different criteria to those > adopted for the king. Chen's concept of the king as the head wu was > influenced by Frazer's theories about the origin of political power: for > Frazer the king was originally a powerful sorcerer. The Shujing \\"Classic of History\\" lists Wu Xian and Wu Xian as capable administrators of the Shang royal household. The Duke of Zhou tells Prince Shao that: > I have heard that of ancient time, when King Tang had received the favoring > decree, he had with him Yi Yin, making his virtue like that of great Heaven. > Tai Jia, again, had Bao Heng. Tai Wu had Yi Zhi and Chen Hu, through whom > his virtue was made to affect God; he had also [] Wu Xian, who regulated the > royal house; Zu Yi had [] Wu Xian. Wu Ding had Gan Pan. These ministers > carried out their principles and effected their arrangements, preserving and > regulating the empire of [Shang], so that, while its ceremonies lasted, > those sovereigns, though deceased, were assessors to Heaven, while it > extended over many years. Names in this quote have been standardized to > pinyin. According to Boileau, > In some texts, Wu Xian senior is described as being in charge of the > divination using [shi ] achilea.

It is possible that in > fact the text referred to two Shang ministers, father and son, coming from > the same eponymous territory wu. Perhaps, later, the name (wu ) of these two > ministers has been confused with the character wu () as employed in other > received texts. Wu-shamans participated in court scandals and dynastic rivalries under Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE), particularly regarding the crime of wugu (with gu \\"venom-based poison\\") \\"sorcery; casting harmful spells\\". In 130 BCE, Empress Chen Jiao was convicted of using shamans from Yue to conduct wugu magic. She \\"was dismissed from her position and a total of 300 persons who were involved in the case were executed\\", their heads were cut off and exposed on stakes. In 91 BCE, an attempted coup against crown prince Liu Ju involved accusations of practicing wugu, and subsequently \\"no less than nine long months of bloody terrorism, ending in a tremendous slaughter, cost some tens of thousands their lives!\\". Ever since Emperor Wu of Han established Confucianism as the state religion, the ruling classes have shown increasing prejudice against shamanism (, ). Some modern writers view the traditional Confucianist disdain for female shamans as sexism. Schafer wrote: > In the opinion of the writer, the Chou ruling class was particularly hostile > to women in government, and regarded the ancient fertility rites as impure. > This anti-female tendency was even more marked in the state of Lu, where > Confucius approved of the official rain-ceremony in which men alone > participated. There was, within ancient China, a heterogeneity of culture > areas, with female shamans favored in some, males in others. The > \\"licentiousness\\" of the ceremonies of such a state as Cheng (doubtless > preserving the ancient Shang traditions and customs) was a byword among > Confucian moralists. Confucius' state seems on the other hand to have taken > the \\"respectable\\" attitude that the sexes should not mingle in the dance, > and that men were the legitimate performers of the fertility rites. The > general practice of the later Chou period, or at least the semi-idealized > picture given of the rites of that time in such books as the Chou li, > apparently prescribed a division of magical functions between men and women. > The former generally play the role of exorcists, the latter of petitioners. > This is probably related to the metaphysical belief that women, embodying > the principle yin, were akin to the spirits, whereas men, exemplifying the > element yang, were naturally hostile to them. Accepting the tradition that Chinese shamans were women (i.e., wu \\"shamaness\\" as opposed to xi \\"shaman\\"), Kagan believes: > One of the main themes in Chinese history is the unsuccessful attempt by the > male Confucian orthodoxy to strip women of their public and sacred powers > and to limit them to a role of service ... Confucianists reasserted daily > their claim to power and authority through the promotion of the phallic > ancestor cult which denied women religious representation and excluded them > from the governmental examination system which was the path to office, > prestige, and status. In addition, refers to a \\"Confucian medicine\\" based upon systematic correspondences and the idea that illnesses are caused by excesses (rather than demons). The Zhouli provides detailed information about the roles of wu- shamans. It lists , \\"Spirit Mediums as officials on the payroll of the Zhou Ministry of Rites (Liguan , or Ministry of Spring, Chun guan ).\\" This text differentiates three offices: the Siwu Âè∏Â∑´ \\"Manager/Director of Shamans\\", Nanwu \\"Male Shamans\\", and N√ºwu \\"Female Shamans\\". The managerial Siwu, who was of Shi \\"Gentleman; Yeoman\\" feudal rank, yet was not a wu, supervised \\"the many wu\\". > The Managers of the Spirit Mediums are in charge of the policies and orders > issued to the many Spirit Mediums. When the country suffers a great drought, > they lead the Spirit Mediums in dancing the rain-making ritual (yu ). When > the country suffers a great calamity, they lead the Spirit Mediums in > enacting the long-standing practices of Spirit Mediums (wuheng ). At > official sacrifices, they [handle] the ancestral tablets in their > receptacles, the cloth on which the spirits walk, and the box containing the > reeds [for presenting the sacrificial foodstuffs].

(, citing ) The Nanwu and N√ºwu have different shamanic specializations, especially regarding inauspicious events like sickness, death, and natural disaster. > The Male Spirit Mediums are in charge of the si and yan Sacrifices to the > Deities of the Mountains and Rivers. They receive the honorific titles [of > the deities], which they proclaim into the [four] directions, holding reeds. > In the winter, in the great temple hall, they offer [or: shoot arrows] > without a fixed direction and without counting the number.

(part > 26, , citing ) Von Falkenhausen concludes: > If we are to generalize from the above enumeration, we find that the Spirit > Mediums' principal functions are tied up with averting evil and pollution. > They are especially active under circumstances of inauspiciousness and > distress.

Chu Ci The poetry anthology Chu Ci, especially its older pieces, is largely characterized by its shamanic content and style, as explicated to some extent by sinologist David Hawkes(2011: passim). Among other points of interest are the intersection of Shamanic traditions and mythology/folk religion in the earlier textual material, such as Tianwen (possibly based on even more ancient shamanic temple murals), the whole question of the interpretation of the 11 verses of the Jiu Ge (Nine Songs) as the libretto of a shamanic dramatic performance, the motif of shamanic spirit flight from Li Sao through subsequent pieces, the evidence of possible regional variations in wu shamanism between Chu, Wei, Qi, and other states (or shamanic colleges associated with those regions), and the suggestion that some of the newer textual material was modified to please Han Wudi, by Liu An, the Prince of Huainan, or his circle. The Chu Ci contents have traditionally been chronologically divided into an older, pre-Han dynasty group, and those written during the Han Dynasty. Of the traditionally-considered to be the older works (omitting the mostly prose narratives, \\"Bu Ju\\" and \\"Yu Fu\\") David Hawkes considers the following sections to be \\"functional, explicitly shamanistic\\": Jiu Ge, Tian Wen, and the two shamanic summons for the soul, \\"The Great Summons\\" and \\"Summons of the Soul\\". Regarding the other, older pieces he considers that \\"shamanism, if there is any\\" to be an incidental poetic device, particularly in the form of descriptions of the shamanic spirit journey. Background The mainstream of Chinese literacy and literature is associated with the shell and bone oracular inscriptions from recovered archeological artifacts from the Shang dynasty and with the literary works of the Western Zhou dynasty, which include the classic Confucian works. Both are associated with the northern Chinese areas. South of the traditional Shang and Zhou areas was the land (and water) of Chu. Politically and to some extent culturally distinct from the Zhou dynasty and its later 6 devolved hegemonic states, Chu was the original source and inspiration for the poems anthologized during the Han dynasty under the title Chu Ci, literally meaning something like \\"the literary material of Chu\\". Despite the tendency of Confucian- oriented government officials to suppress wu shamanic beliefs and practice, in the general area of Chinese culture, the force of colonial conservatism and the poetic voice of Qu Yuan and other poets combined to contribute an established literary tradition heavily influenced by wu shamanism to posterity. Shamanic practices as described anthropologically are generally paralleled by descriptions of wu practices as found in the Chu Ci, and in Chinese mythology more generally. Li Sao, Yuan You, and Jiu Bian The signature poem of the Chu Ci is the poem Li Sao. By China's \\"first poet\\", Qu Yuan, a major literary device of the poem is the shamanic spirit journey. \\"Yuan You\\", literally \\"The Far-off Journey\\" features shamanic spirit flight as a literary device, as does Jiu Bian, as part of its climactic ending. In the Li Sao, two individual shaman are specified, Ling Fen () and Wu Xian (). This Wu Xian may or may not be the same as the (one or more) historical person(s) named Wu Xian. Hawkes suggests an equation of the word ling in the Chu dialect with the word wu. Questioning Heaven The Heavenly Questions (literally \\"Questioning Heaven\\") is one of the ancient repositories of Chinese myth and a major cultural legacy. Propounded as a series of questions, the poem provides incite and provokes questions about the role of wu shaman practitioners in society and history. Jiu Ge The Jiu Ge may be read as the lyrical preservation of a shamanic dramatic performance. Apparently typical of at least one variety of shamanism of the Chu area of the Yangzi River basin, the text exhibits a marked degree of eroticism in connection with shamanic invocations. Summoning the soul Summoning the soul (hun) of the possibly dead was a feature of ancient culture. The 2 Chu Ci pieces of this type may be authentic transcriptions of such a process. Individual wu shaman  Various individual wu shaman are alluded to in the Chu Ci. In some cases the binomial nomenclature is unclear, referring perhaps to one or two persons; for example, in the case of Peng Xian, who appears likely to represent Wu Peng and Wu Xian, which is a common type of morphological construction in Classical Chinese poetry. David Hawkes refers to some wu shaman as \\"Shaman Ancestors\\". Additionally, the distinction between humans and transcendent divinities tends not to be explicit in the received Chu Ci text. In some cases, the individual wu shaman are known from other sources, such as the Shanhaijing (Classic of Mountains and Seas). The name of some individual shaman includes \\"Wu\\" () in the normal position of the family surname, for example, in the case of Wu Yang (, \\"Shaman Bright\\"). Wu Yang is the major speaker in Zhao Hun/Summons for the Soul. He also appears in Shanhaijing together with Wu Peng (): 6 wu shaman are depicted together reviving a corpse, with Wu Peng holding the Herb of Immortality. In the Li Sao, two individual shaman are specified: Ling Fen () and Wu Xian () . This Wu Xian may or may not be the same as the (one or more) historical person(s) named Wu Xian. suggests an equation of the word ling in the Chu dialect with the word wu. In Shanhaijing (Classic of Mountains and Seas), the name of some individual shaman includes \\"Wu\\" () in the normal position of the family surname, for example, in the case of the following list, where the 6 are depicted together reviving a corpse, with Wu Peng holding the Herb of Immortality. Wu Peng and Wu Yang and others are also known from the Chu Ci poetry anthology. Wu Yang is the major speaker in Zhao Hun (also known as, Summons for the Soul).

Buckland worked as an art director with Cecil B. DeMille and Jesse Lasky, and later with Alan Dwan, from 1914-1927. He was Hollywood's first \\"art director\\" and is credited with a number of advancements in filmmaking, including the advances in lighting techniques, the development of architectural sets, and the use of miniature sets. In 1924, he was named one of the ten individuals who had contributed the most to the advancement of the motion picture industry since the time of its inception. A 1980 exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London advanced the argument that \\"everything we know as 'Hollywood' traces to Wilfred Buckland.\\" Buckland was among the first inductees in the Art Directors Guild Hall of Fame. Early years Buckland was born in New York City, the son of Reverend Rabbi Joseph Wales and Emily (Wilson) Buckland. He worked as an artist for a time and was responsible for much of the interior decoration and paintings of New York's Trinity Church for its bi-centenary celebration in 1897. He also worked with the stage producer, David Belasco, for many years. In 1907, The New York Times described Buckland as the \\"general stage manager\\" for Belasco. He designed the color scheme, draperies and stage curtain at Belasco's Stuyvesant Theatre (now operating as the Belasco Theatre) that opened in 1907. In 1910, Buckland was described as Belasco's \\"art director,\\" responsible for the design of scenery, costumes and other artistic details. One newspaper reviewer wrote the following about the sets designed by Buckland for the stage production of Omar, the Tentmaker: \\"Pictorially nothing finer has ever been disclosed upon the stage than the succession of sumptuous Oriental pictures evolved for the production by Wilfred Buckland, who for 10 years served as art decorator for David Belasco.\\" Buckland's Broadway credits include The Rose of the Rancho (scenic design, 1907), A Grand Army Man (scenic design, 1907), Adrea (stage director and scenic design, 1905), The Music Master (scenic design, 1904), The Darling of the Gods (design, 1903), and Du Barry (design, 1901). Work with DeMille Cecil B. DeMille brought the 47-year-old Buckland to Hollywood to work on his film The Squaw Man (1914). According to some accounts, producer Jesse L. Lasky purchased the movie rights to Belasco's plays, and Buckland's services as art director were part of the deal. Buckland continued to work with DeMille on most of his projects until 1920 and also worked on most of the films produced by Jesse Lasky's Famous Players-Lasky production company. While working with DeMille and Lasky, Buckland was credited with the introduction of artificial lighting to motion pictures with the use of klieg lights, which also became known as \\"Lasky lighting.\\" Jesse Lasky later wrote of Buckland: \\"As the first bona fide art director in the industry, and the first to build architectural settings for films, Buckland widened the scope of pictures tremendously by throwing off the scenic limitations of the stage.\\" Buckland was a collector of ancient firearms. In 1916, The Democrat-Tribune newspaper commented that Buckland, \\"art director of the Lasky Company,\\" was also \\"known as the greatest collector and authority on ancient firearms in the country,\\" and his collection was said to be \\"the most complete in the world, not barring that of the British Museum.\\" Buckland developed a reputation as one of the early film industry's great artists, as reflected in the following 1918 newspaper report: > \\"Among the producing firms who belong to the class where imagination is > based upon culture, are those associated with Paramount. For a long time, > now, picture play reviewers have been fond of saying 'up to the usual > Paramount standard.' That standard to a large extent has been raised higher > and higher by the Wilfred Buckland whose name appears in front of all the > Lasky pictures. Such men as Cecil DeMille, William DeMille, J. Searle > Dawley, Maurice Tourneur, Joseph Kaufman, Robert Vignola, Robert Thorley, > Marshal Neilan, Thomas H. Ince, J. Stuart Blackton and the others who > produce for Paramount have added their very considerable bit to spelling Art > with a capital A in motion pictures, but that is Wilfred Buckland's business > exclusively.\\" Similarly, in 1920, a reviewer noted that the \\"wonderful interior settings for Don't Change Your Husband ... were designed by Wilfred Buckland, art director, whose hand is responsible for so much that is highly artistic in Artcraft and Paramount films.\\" Buckland described his process to a newspaper reporter in 1920. Buckland said he would review the script to get an idea of what the characters were like and what their surroundings should be. He would prepare sketches of the required sets and turn the sketches over to a force of architectural draftsmen in the next room. After a structure was built, Buckland would also direct the interior painting and decorations. He noted at the time that he hoped to see film sets move away from the building of real or photographic interiors and deal more with atmosphere. He added: > \\"In painting a picture an artist does not paint a real house, reproducing > every minute detail. That sort of thing belongs to the old and now despised > photographic school of art. He paints in something to give tone to the > figures. The great secret of art, as Whistler said, is knowing what to leave > out. Every once you get a shock by discovering a picture in which the > director has shown signs of an artistic conscience. But the majority of > moving pictures are still far behind commercial photography, which is > becoming less and less photographic while most of the advertisements in the > back pages of our magazines are more artistic than the average movie.\\" In 1917, Buckland wrote to Cecil B. DeMille expressing his dissatisfaction over having his artistic vision stifled. He said, \\"I came to Hollywood ... in search of a chance to visualize a more 'pictorial' way, by adapting to film the same rules that govern the higher art of painting.\\" Buckland also complained in the press that the art director's job, like that of the actor, suffered from over-production. Buckland noted that he had supervised 56 pictures in a single year and added, \\"Studio necessities compel him to supervise the art work on a number of productions at one time. As a consequence, the art director becomes an architect, or perhaps merely a scenic artist, instead of the illustrator of the dramatic story.\\" Buckland's collaboration with DeMille remained contentious, and the two broke off their working relationship in 1920. Despite the falling out, DeMille spoke at a 1941 testimonial dinner for Buckland and called him a \\"great artist and a great man\\" and said he had been glad \\"to sit at your feet.\\" Alan Dwan and Robin Hood In 1920, Buckland left DeMille and began to work with director Alan Dwan. After the release of the feature Omar the Tentmaker (1922), one reviewer wrote: \\"Settings for this master film were personally designed and executed under the direction of Wilfred Buckland, the first man in his field in the films and still recognized as its finest craftsman.\\" While working with Dwan, Buckland created the castle for Douglas Fairbanks' Robin Hood (also 1922). The castle was one of the largest sets built at the time. When the film was released, the Los Angeles Times reported: > \\"Castle a Marvel. Greatest of all the settings is, of course, the castle > which for months has been a sort of landmark of cinema enterprise on Santa > Monica Boulevard. The vastness of this feudal domain is the most astonishing > of the picture's startling features. One looks through waves upon waves of > light and shadow to the stone walls which mark the background. Fairytale > heights of tower and turret are suggested. ... Yet there is never anything > of grotesquerie in this, only and always a legendary magnificence such as is > suggested by the Maxfield Parrish paintings of the Moyen Age. Artistry is at > its height in these Medieval scenes.\\" Film historian Juan Antonio Ram√≠rez later called Buckland's Robin Hood castle, with its immense size and eight circular turrets, perhaps the most impressive of all the Hollywood castles ever built. Buckland was credited with developing the art of miniature stage building, as reflected in a 1924 Daily Democrat- Tribune newspaper account: \\"The art of miniature stage building has been introduced into the production of motion pictures as another means toward economy and , and of insuring fidelity and realism. This system has been perfected by Wilfred Buckland, a famous art director.\\" Later years and death Dwan signed with Famous Players-Lasky after the release of Robin Hood, and Buckland's career after 1923 declined. He worked mostly as a production illustrator after 1923. Buckland was married to actress Veda (McEvers) Buckland (August 26, 1883 ‚Äì May 20, 1941). After her death their son, Wilfred Buckland, Jr., suffered a mental breakdown and was hospitalized at the Camarillo State Mental Hospital. In 1946, Buckland was part of a murder- suicide at his home located at 2035 Pinehurst Avenue in the Hollywood Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. He shot and killed his 36-year-old son and then shot himself. Buckland left a note that said, \\"I am taking Billy with me.\\" The Los Angeles Times reported on the tragedy as follows: > \\"Hollywood's first art director, 80-year-old Wilfred Buckland Sr., yesterday > killed his mentally ailing son, 36, and then fatally shot himself in a > double tragedy inspired by his fear of impending death from old age and > reluctance to leave the younger man alone in the world. Termed the 'founder > of Hollywood cinema art,' the elder Buckland fired a bullet into the back of > his sleeping son's head, which brought instant death.\\" He was interred at Grand View Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Buckland's place in film history In 1924, the magazine Story World selected a list of the ten individuals who had contributed the most to the advancement of the motion picture industry from the time of its inception. The list omitted DeMille, but included Buckland, who was credited \\"for his work in developing and perfecting technical art in films.\\" Others on the list included D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Carl Laemmle and C. Gardner Sullivan. In his book The Art Direction Handbook for Film, Michael Rizzo wrote: > \\"The practical vision of Buckland, the little known Hollywood art director > and initiator of the use of controlled lighting within studio environments, > set a standard in the first decades of the twentieth century that has become > as commonplace as shooting film sequences in Hollywood soundstages today. He > stands as an art-directing giant; his creative ingenuity ennobles the craft > of film design even now.\\" In 1980, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London held an exhibition called \\"The Art of Hollywood,\\" focusing on the role of art directors in the development of cinema. The United Press International (UPI) described the exhibition's focus on the work of Buckland: \\"More than that, an argument could be made ‚Äî and this show makes it ‚Äî that everything we know as 'Hollywood' traces to Wilfred Buckland, Hollywood's first art director.\\" Buckland was one of the first individuals inducted into the Art Directors Guild Hall of Fame when it was established in 2005.

It is one of the last films to feature Brittany Murphy, as she died some weeks after its premiere.  Plot  In West Virginia, Charles \\"Boomer\\" Baxter is setting mountain-top depletion explosives. He detonates the TNT, and an unprecedented earthquake devastates the area. A few hours later government seismologist Dr. Amy Lane arrives at the quake's epicenter. She realizes that the quake has opened a deep fault running through the center of North America, ending at the San Andreas Fault. Any further instability will cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis, devastating Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities all around the Pacific Ocean, leading to the deaths of millions. Dr. Lane and Boomer chase just behind the expanding crack in the Earth's crust, developing a plan to stop the next quake. They decide to use a satellite orbiting above the continent which can trigger earthquakes. They fire it off when they reach the Grand Canyon, thinking that when the new fault hits the canyon it will be forced to turn south into the Gulf of Mexico. When the fault crosses with the canyon, they fire the satellite at the canyon but plan goes wrong. Instead of heading south, the fault travels north, towards the Yellowstone Caldera. They realize that if the fault crosses the caldera it will explode, expelling several thousand tons of ash into the atmosphere, killing millions and causing a Volcanic winter. They decide to set explosives to block the fault's path. Later, when it reaches the park, Boomer detonates the explosives, causing the fault to stop just short of the volcano, but costing Boomer his life. In the end, an orbiting shot of the United States shows a giant canyon that stretches miles-wide across most of the continent.

When his employer, Hutte, retires and closes the detective agency where he has worked for eight years, Roland embarks on a search for his own identity. His investigations uncover clues to a life that seems to stop during the Second World War. It seems that he is Jimmy Pedro Stern, a Greek Jew from Salonica, who was living in Paris under an assumed name, Pedro McEvoy, and working for the legation of the Dominican Republic. He and several friends (Denise Coudreuse, a French model who shares his life; Freddie Howard Luz, a British citizen originally from Mauritius; Gay Orlov, an American dancer of Russian origin; and Andr√© Wildmer, an English former jockey, all of whom are enemy nationals) went to Meg√®ve to escape a Paris that had become dangerous for them during the German occupation. Denise and Pedro attempted to flee to Switzerland, and paid a smuggler who abandoned them in the mountains, separating them and leaving them lost in the snow. Having partially recovered his memory, Guy Roland goes to look for Freddie, who went to live in Polynesia after the war. When he arrives in Bora Bora, he learns that Freddie has disappeared, either lost at sea or by choice. At the end of the novel he is about to follow the last clue that remains to his past: an address in the Via della Botteghe Obscure in Rome, where Jimmy Pedro Stern is recorded as having lived in the 1930s.

He was founder and frontman of the Nederbeat group The Outsiders (1959‚Äì1969) and the rock group Tax Free (1969‚Äì1971). After commercial and artistic success with The Outsiders in the late 1960s, he had a brief solo career in the 1970s, and then was a successful songwriter, producing a number of hit songs for Dutch artists. He faded into obscurity in the 1980s; after his death in 2005 two benefit concerts in Amsterdam proved his lasting popularity and influence.  Early life  Wladimir Tax was born on 14 February 1948 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. His Dutch father and his Russian Romani mother had met in a concentration camp during World War II. He grew up in Amsterdam and learned English at an early age from contacts with American sailors, for whom he acted as a pimp.  Music career   The Outsiders  In 1959, at age 11, he was one of the founding members of the beat band The Outsiders. The band sang English lyrics, with Tax as the main songwriter; Tax sang and played guitar and harmonica. Even while playing with The Outsiders, Tax recorded a solo album (with a symphonic orchestra), Love- In. Tax performing for TV in 1968 The Outsiders reached a measure of success, opening up for The Rolling Stones in 1966 and scoring a number of hits in the Netherlands. They were one of the best-known bands of the Nederbeat movement ‚Äî when they signed with Phonogram Records in 1968, Billboard reported on it. Leading what Billboard called \\"the leading Dutch beat group,\\" Tax had a high- profile‚Äîhe was reported to have the longest hair in the country, and lived a lavish lifestyle involving expensive dinners, chauffeur-driven cars, and friendships with Little Richard and Johnny Hallyday, as well as rumors of an affair with Brigitte Bardot. Although The Outsiders' records were not distributed in the United States, Tax did go overseas and made friends with notable musicians such as Tim Hardin, Richie Havens, and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and attended the Woodstock Festival. He played with Hardin and Jimi Hendrix at the latter's Electric Ladyland Studio. As he explained in his 1998 autobiography, success came too quick for him, and alcohol and drugs took their toll, and combined with a lack of financial security (he admitted not being good at bookkeeping since his \\"way of life\\" had killed too many brain cells) the next decades of Tax's life were chaotic. After recording three albums, The Outsiders broke up in 1969. In 1997 The Outsiders came together for the last time to play a reunion tour in the Netherlands. The tour was short-lived because of Tax' unpredictable behavior. Jerome Blanes wrote \\"Outsiders by insiders\\" around this time, the official biography of the band.  Solo career  Tax, after briefly heading a band called Tax Free, went solo. He was accompanied, in succession, by Bamboule (1972), George Cash (1973), Watermen (1973), and The Mustangs (1976). In 1974, he won the Silver Harp, an award for musical talent and had significant success with a couple of solo singles, \\"Miss Wonderful\\" and \\"It ain't no use\\". The end of his playing career was \\"Let's Dance\\" (1977), which became a small hit in the Netherlands. Fourteen years after \\"Tax Tonight\\", in 1989, he recorded his fourth solo album with The Music. The album was very well received by critics but the sales were low. It takes until 2002 before his next and last solo effort will be released. On \\"The Entertainer\\" Tax made a musical return to his rock roots. Again well received by critics, \\"The Entertainer\\" was not the success Tax hoped for. On the album Tax sings about his life as 'an entertainer' who is mostly misunderstood by his public.  Songwriting  Afterward his playing career had ended, he concerned himself mainly with songwriting and wrote a number of hits for Dutch artists such as Lee Towers (\\"It's Raining in my Heart\\") and Champagne (\\"Valentino,\\" \\"Oh Me Oh My Goodbye,\\" and \\"Rock 'n Roll Star,\\" the latter charting at #2 in the Netherlands and #83 in the United States).  Personal decline and death  The 1980s saw his personal decline, starting with the slow death by cancer of his long-time partner Laurie Langenbach, who died in 1984 ‚Äî according to close friend Armand, he never recovered from her death and for the next twenty years lived surrounded by her personal belongings. Efforts to revive a music career appear hampered by personal problems caused by alcoholism and tax problems. Tax died in 2005 in relative obscurity, bothered by financial and physical problems. He was buried in Amsterdam, after a gathering in Paradiso in his honor raised enough money for his funeral. A year later, a benefit concert was held in Paradiso to raise funds for a monument to be placed on his grave. The monument, three guitar necks crossing, continues to draw visitors. His biography, Wally Tax - Leven en Lijden van een Outsider, was written by Rutger Vahl and came out ten years after his death in 2015.

Retrieved September 20, 2009. It was written and directed by Jennifer Celotta and originally aired in the United States on NBC on October 1, 2009. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, the office struggles to deal with having both Michael and Jim as managers, with Dwight trying to manipulate the office into thinking that Jim will be a horrible boss. Meanwhile, Pam tries to get people to give money as a wedding gift. Synopsis The office is trying to adjust to having both Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) as bosses, with Jim moving into a newly built personal office space in the main section. Michael and Jim constantly find themselves at odds with each other as Michael keeps having \\"conference room meetings\\" while Jim wants to keep productivity in the office place. They get a call from CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) who tells them that not everyone in the branch will get their desired raise and that they will have to decide how to disperse it amongst the employees. Michael gets annoyed when Jim keeps making pros and cons lists for each idea. Jim decides to give the raises to the sales staff since they bring money to the company. Michael is against the idea, but invites Jim to announce it to the office. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), not wanting Jim as a boss, complains about the unfairness of Jim's decision despite being a salesperson, as do all the non-sales people. Michael, who was scoffing at Jim, is then asked to give his idea, but he does not speak coherently about it, leading everyone to rail against him as much as Jim. Michael and Jim go back into the conference room to decide how to handle the raise issue. They ultimately decide that the raises should be performance-based, and decide to take turns placing beans on employee pictures, with each bean representing a small raise. When Michael and Jim leave the conference room, Dwight goes into the conference room and shows the employees their plan. Everyone gets upset at Michael and Jim for this, particularly Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), whose picture did not have any beans, as Jim was trying to remain unbiased. With the entire office now upset with both Michael and Jim, Dwight uses this opportunity to start an uprising against Jim personally. However, everyone in the office refuses to as they are more concerned about the raise issue. Michael then goes into Jim's office to check on him. Michael explains he felt terrible having to make those kinds of decisions on his own and he leaves to get Jim something. Jim comments that Michael is currently his only friend in the office at the moment, as everyone else, even probably Pam, is upset at him about the raise situation. Michael returns to give Jim his own new \\"World's Best Boss\\" mug and they share some gin together. Pam is trying to discreetly ask everyone to give cash as wedding gifts instead of actual gifts. She first tries Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) to no avail. She manages to get Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) to write her a $40 check, and starts to feel guilty about asking people for simple cash, but she gets ecstatic when she sees that the check is made out to \\"Mrs. Pam Halpert\\". When she then tries Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), he cons her into giving him $50 as a supposed investment in betting on college basketball games. Reception In its original American broadcast on October 1, 2009, \\"The Promotion\\" was seen by 7.28 million households, according to Nielsen ratings. It was a drop in viewership compared to the previous week's episode, \\"The Meeting\\". \\"The Promotion\\" received a 3.7 rating/10 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49. The episode received generally mixed reviews. Several commentators specifically praised the scene in which Meredith and Creed reveal they previously had sex. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club said the episode \\"represented both a return to The Office's roots and a bold look at what the future holds for the Dunder-Mifflin gang\\" due to the Michael and Jim co-manager arrangement. Rabin praised the episode's \\"sharp little character moments\\", like Oscar's deadpan speeches and Ryan's gambling schemes. IGN writer Dan Phillips said the episode further developed the relationship between Jim and Michael, and Phillips liked that they found common ground at the end. He also praised \\"laugh-out-loud gags\\", like the revelation about Creed and Meredith. New York magazine writer Will Leitch said it was smart to make Jim a smug, flawed manager, and said \\"it was impossible not to love the quiet final scene with Michael and Jim bonding over the hatred their co-workers feel for them\\". Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said the episode felt like a \\"placeholder\\", although she said it improved upon a second viewing. Lyons said the episode had some good moments, \\"none of these moments seemed tied to the main plot\\" and was \\"basically just killing a week until The Big Wedding Episode OMG next Thursday\\". Alan Sepinwall of The Star- Ledger said \\"The Promotion\\" did not live up to a \\"promising new dynamic\\" between Michael and Jim set up in the previous episode, \\"The Meeting\\". However, Sepinwall said he liked the gifts subplot with Pam, and said Dwight's new role as \\"the office insurrectionist\\" has promise.

He used to have a special idol he worshipped called Manaf. When Musab Ibn Umair arrived in Madina as the Prophet‚Äôs ambassador, the four sons of Amr Ibn Al Jamuh and his wife Hind, all accepted Islam. His sons were amongst the 70 companions who gave the Prophet their pledge of allegiance in the Great Aqaba pledge. Amr Ibn Al Jamuh was a sixty-year-old man. He was afraid his children would accept Islam. His son Mu‚Äôadh Ibn Amr recited Surah Fatiha to his dad one day, which sparked his interest in Islam. His sons and their friend, Mu‚Äôadh Ibn Jabal, concocted a plan to secretly throw Manaf in the dump. When Amr Ibn Al Jamuh found his idol in the dump, he got very upset, removed it, cleaned it and returned it back to its place. Over the next few nights, his sons and their friend repeatedly threw Manaf in the dump until one day; Amr Ibn Al Jamuh placed a sword with Manaf and asked the idol to protect itself. When he saw the idol in the dump once again, he realised his error. He became a devout Muslim and wished to participate in the Battle of Uhud but his sons refused, especially considering Amr was incapacitated in one leg. Amr complained to the Prophet until the permission to fight was granted. Amr fought until he was martyred. The martyrs of Uhud were not washed, their armour and leather clothes were removed and they were buried. Abdullah bin Amr bin Haram was buried with Amr Ibn Al Jamuh in one grave due to the affection they had for each other and Hamza was buried with Abdullah bin Jahsh who was his nephew Amr ibn al-Jamuh (ÿπŸÖÿ±Ÿà ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ¨ŸÖŸàÿ≠) was an ansari companion of Muhammad, and a chief of Banu Salamah.

He has published eight books, and is frequently quoted as an authority on the history of the band and its recordings. Biography Spizer was born and raised in New Orleans. He attended Isidore Newman School and then received B.A., M.B.A., and J.D. degrees from Tulane University, where he was a member of honorary societies Phi Beta Kappa and the Order of the Coif. While pursuing his legal career, he also managed The Cold, a popular new wave band in New Orleans. In 1997, Spizer earned a large legal fee from the settlement of a class action lawsuit, and decided to use some of the money to replace his childhood collection of Beatles LPs (which had been damaged by cockroaches) with a new set of first edition albums. Drawn into the world of Beatles collectors, he ended up writing and self-publishing The Beatles Records on Vee-Jay, about the relationship between EMI, the Beatles' U.K. record label, and Vee-Jay Records, the U.S. label that released the band's first records in the U.S. As of 2011, Spizer has written and published eight books about The Beatles. A reviewer for The New York Times described his books as containing \\"a wealth of detail about the Beatles' American recordings and their first visit to the United States, touching on everything from contracts and lawsuits to promotional materials, all richly illustrated.\\" A New York Daily News article called his The Beatles' Story on Capitol Records \\"a Beatle collector's fantasy by a fanatic Beatles collector and historian.\\" The books about the Capitol releases were issued into two separate volumes: Part One, Beatlemania & The Singles and Part Two, The Albums, both issued in 2000. These were followed by The Beatles On Apple Records (2003), which told about the record releases on the group's own Apple label. The following book was The Beatles Are Coming!, released in January 2004 which was issued to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the group's arrival in America. Spizer's next book was the 2005 release, The Beatles Solo on Apple Records, which gave a complete documentation about the solo recordings of John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney that were released between 1968 and 1975. His sixth book in the series was The Beatles Swan Song: \\"She Loves You\\" & Other Records, a 2007 publication that told about the American-released Beatles records that were issued on the Swan, United Artists, Decca, MGM, Atco and Polydor labels. It also features information about the Beatles albums and singles released by Capitol in the 1970s and 1980s. In 2011, Spizer released Beatles For Sale On Parlophone, which documented Beatles discs released in the U.K. from 1962 through 1970, including the Parlophone EPs, which, according to Spizer, \\"up until now haven't been accurately documented in any book.\\" In 2017, he also published The Beatles and ‚ÄòSgt. Pepper‚Äô: A Fans‚Äô Perspective which coincided with the 50th anniversary of the release of this ground-breaking album. Spizer has served as a consultant to EMI and Apple Records for their CD re-releases of the American configurations of the Beatles catalog. He wrote the text for the companion booklet for the 2006 box set The Capitol Albums, Volume 2, and for the \\"catalography\\" that accompanies the 2009 \\"Box of Vision\\" release. He was also chosen to write 2,592 questions for a special Beatles edition of the Trivial Pursuit board game. Spizer has appeared on television programs such as CBS's The Early Show, Fox News, and Good Morning America, and on the National Public Radio news program All Things Considered.

The Walsh transform of a Boolean function f:\\\\Z_2^n \\\\to \\\\Z_2 is the function \\\\hat{f}:\\\\Z_2^n \\\\to \\\\Z given by :\\\\hat{f}(a) = \\\\sum_{\\\\scriptstyle{x \\\\in \\\\Z_2^n}} (-1)^{f(x) + a \\\\cdot x} where is the dot product in Z. Alternatively, let and . Then and hence :\\\\hat{f}(a) = \\\\left|S_0(a)\\\\right- \\\\left|S_1(a)\\\\right= 2 \\\\left|S_0(a)\\\\right- 2^n. For any Boolean function f and the transform lies in the range :-2^n \\\\leq \\\\hat{f}(a) \\\\leq 2^n. Moreover, the linear function and the affine function correspond to the two extreme cases, since : \\\\hat{f}_0(a) = 2^n,~ \\\\hat{f}_1(a) = -2^n. Thus, for each the value of \\\\hat{f}(a) characterizes where the function f(x) lies in the range from f0(x) to f1(x).  Definition and properties  Rothaus defined a bent function as a Boolean function f:\\\\Z_2^n \\\\to \\\\Z_2 whose Walsh transform has constant absolute value. Bent functions are in a sense equidistant from all the affine functions, so they are equally hard to approximate with any affine function. The simplest examples of bent functions, written in algebraic normal form, are and . This pattern continues: is a bent function \\\\Z_2^n \\\\to \\\\Z_2 for every even n, but there is a wide variety of other bent functions as n increases. The sequence of values (‚àí1)f(x), with taken in lexicographical order, is called a bent sequence; bent functions and bent sequences have equivalent properties. In this ¬±1 form, the Walsh transform is easily computed as :\\\\hat{f}(a) = W\\\\left(2^n\\\\right) (-1)^{f(a)}, where W(2n) is the natural-ordered Walsh matrix and the sequence is treated as a column vector. Rothaus proved that bent functions exist only for even n, and that for a bent function f, \\\\left|\\\\hat{f}(a)\\\\right= 2^\\\\frac{n}{2} for all . In fact, \\\\hat{f}(a) = 2^\\\\frac{n}{2}(-1)^{g(a)}, where g is also bent. In this case, \\\\hat{g}(a) = 2^\\\\frac{n}{2}(-1)^{f(a)}, so f and g are considered dual functions. Every bent function has a Hamming weight (number of times it takes the value 1) of , and in fact agrees with any affine function at one of those two numbers of points. So the nonlinearity of f (minimum number of times it equals any affine function) is , the maximum possible. Conversely, any Boolean function with nonlinearity is bent. The degree of f in algebraic normal form (called the nonlinear order of f) is at most (for ). Although bent functions are vanishingly rare among Boolean functions of many variables, they come in many different kinds. There has been detailed research into special classes of bent functions, such as the homogeneous ones or those arising from a monomial over a finite field, but so far the bent functions have defied all attempts at a complete enumeration or classification.  Constructions  There are several types of constructions for bent functions. * Combinatorial constructions: iterative constructions, Maiorana‚ÄìMcFarland construction, partial spreads, Dillon's and Dobbertin's bent functions, minterm bent functions, bent iterative functions * Algebraic constructions: monomial bent functions with exponents of Gold, Dillon, Kasami, Canteaut‚ÄìLeander and Canteaut‚ÄìCharpin‚ÄìKuyreghyan; Niho bent functions, etc.  Applications  As early as 1982 it was discovered that maximum length sequences based on bent functions have cross-correlation and autocorrelation properties rivalling those of the Gold codes and Kasami codes for use in CDMA. These sequences have several applications in spread spectrum techniques. The properties of bent functions are naturally of interest in modern digital cryptography, which seeks to obscure relationships between input and output. By 1988 Forr√© recognized that the Walsh transform of a function can be used to show that it satisfies the strict avalanche criterion (SAC) and higher-order generalizations, and recommended this tool to select candidates for good S-boxes achieving near-perfect diffusion. Indeed, the functions satisfying the SAC to the highest possible order are always bent. Furthermore, the bent functions are as far as possible from having what are called linear structures, nonzero vectors a such that is a constant. In the language of differential cryptanalysis (introduced after this property was discovered) the derivative of a bent function f at every nonzero point a (that is, is a balanced Boolean function, taking on each value exactly half of the time. This property is called perfect nonlinearity. Given such good diffusion properties, apparently perfect resistance to differential cryptanalysis, and resistance by definition to linear cryptanalysis, bent functions might at first seem the ideal choice for secure cryptographic functions such as S-boxes. Their fatal flaw is that they fail to be balanced. In particular, an invertible S-box cannot be constructed directly from bent functions, and a stream cipher using a bent combining function is vulnerable to a correlation attack. Instead, one might start with a bent function and randomly complement appropriate values until the result is balanced. The modified function still has high nonlinearity, and as such functions are very rare the process should be much faster than a brute-force search. But functions produced in this way may lose other desirable properties, even failing to satisfy the SAC ‚Äì so careful testing is necessary. A number of cryptographers have worked on techniques for generating balanced functions that preserve as many of the good cryptographic qualities of bent functions as possible. Some of this theoretical research has been incorporated into real cryptographic algorithms. The CAST design procedure, used by Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares to construct the S-boxes for the block ciphers CAST-128 and CAST-256, makes use of bent functions. The cryptographic hash function HAVAL uses Boolean functions built from representatives of all four of the equivalence classes of bent functions on six variables. The stream cipher Grain uses an NLFSR whose nonlinear feedback polynomial is, by design, the sum of a bent function and a linear function.  Generalizations  More than 25 different generalizations of bent functions are described in Tokareva's 2015 monograph. There are algebraic generalizations (q-valued bent functions, p-ary bent functions, bent functions over a finite field, generalized Boolean bent functions of Schmidt, bent functions from a finite Abelian group into the set of complex numbers on the unit circle, bent functions from a finite Abelian group into a finite Abelian group, non-Abelian bent functions, vectorial G-bent functions, multidimensional bent functions on a finite Abelian group), combinatorial generalizations (symmetric bent functions, homogeneous bent functions, rotation symmetric bent functions, normal bent functions, self-dual and anti- self-dual bent functions, partially defined bent functions, plateaued functions, Z-bent functions and quantum bent functions) and cryptographic generalizations (semi-bent functions, balanced bent functions, partially bent functions, hyper-bent functions, bent functions of higher order, k-bent functions). The most common class of generalized bent functions is the mod m type, f:\\\\mathbb{Z}_m^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}_m such that :\\\\hat{f}(a) = \\\\sum_{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_m^n} e^{\\\\frac{2\\\\pi i}{m} (f(x) - a \\\\cdot x)} has constant absolute value mn/2. Perfect nonlinear functions f:\\\\mathbb{Z}_m^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}_m, those such that for all nonzero a, takes on each value times, are generalized bent. If m is prime, the converse is true. In most cases only prime m are considered. For odd prime m, there are generalized bent functions for every positive n, even and odd. They have many of the same good cryptographic properties as the binary bent functions. Semi-bent functions are an odd-order counterpart to bent functions. A semi-bent function is f:\\\\mathbb{Z}_m^n \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}_m with n odd, such that \\\\left|\\\\hat{f}\\\\righttakes only the values 0 and m(n+1)/2. They also have good cryptographic characteristics, and some of them are balanced, taking on all possible values equally often. The partially bent functions form a large class defined by a condition on the Walsh transform and autocorrelation functions. All affine and bent functions are partially bent. This is in turn a proper subclass of the plateaued functions. The idea behind the hyper-bent functions is to maximize the minimum distance to all Boolean functions coming from bijective monomials on the finite field GF(2n), not just the affine functions. For these functions this distance is constant, which may make them resistant to an interpolation attack. Other related names have been given to cryptographically important classes of functions f:\\\\Z_2^n \\\\to \\\\Z_2^n, such as almost bent functions and crooked functions. While not bent functions themselves (these are not even Boolean functions), they are closely related to the bent functions and have good nonlinearity properties.

Gilman Trail The Fox River Trail is a multi-use path in Illinois along the Fox River. Largely in Kane County, the trail connects the communities of (North to South) Algonquin, Carpentersville, Dundee, Elgin, South Elgin, St. Charles, Geneva, Batavia, North Aurora, Aurora, Montgomery, and Oswego.  Route  The trail begins at the McHenry County line in Algonquin and runs south just over to Oswego in Kendall County. A gap in Aurora was closed in 2016 by a new protected bike lane. From St. Charles south most of the route is next to Illinois Route 25 on the east side of the river or Route 31 on the west side. The trail crosses the river in several places and between Batavia and North Aurora the trail splits and runs parallel along both sides. Some of the trail is dedicated-use on the former right of way of the A.,E.&F.R.E.Co.; interurban railroad and the C.&N.W.Ry.; railroad, but some has been purpose-built along the riverbanks. Using the railroad right of ways allows long sections with little grade change and wide curves, while the purpose-built sections can be closer to the river. Dedicated-use sections are asphalt paved. Limited portions require a user to travel across intersections or directly on public streets.  Trail connections  The Fox River Trail provides several direct and indirect connections to other local and regional trails, including: * Illinois Prairie Path in four places, Elgin, Geneva, Batavia, and Aurora. * Great Western Trail in St. Charles. * Virgil Gilman Trail in Aurora. * Prairie Trail in Algonquin. * Numerous forest preserve and local trails. The section connecting the Prairie Trail in Algonquin and the Illinois Prairie Path in Elgin is part of the Grand Illinois Trail, linking over 500 miles of trails together throughout Illinois.  Points of interest   Fox River Trolley Museum  South of South Elgin, this operating museum is the only remaining section of the interurban with rail operations. The trail runs along the side until the end of the track, where the path goes onto the right of way. It then crosses the river on a bridge built on the original 1896 interurban piers. Fabyan Park Forest Preserve upright=0 Named after eccentric businessman Colonel George Fabyan, it is south of Geneva. On the east side the trail passes a ‚ÄúDutch‚Äù style windmill from the 1850s that was moved to the river site and refurbished in 1914. The trail can cross the river on a small island with a lighthouse built as a joke. The west side of the preserve has a Frank Lloyd Wright designed \\"Villa\\", gardens, greenhouses, pools, and other attractions. Batavia Depot Museum upright=0 In Batavia the west side trail follows a former C.&N.W.Ry.; right of way past the Depot Museum. An 1854 station from the C.B.&Q.R.R.; on the east side was moved across the river to its present location in 1973, as was a caboose. Both are used as exhibits, and the museum has been expanded since.  C.B.&Q.; roundhouse  In Aurora a short distance up the connecting Illinois Prairie Path is a large railroad roundhouse. One of two built in the 1850s, it was abandoned in 1974. By 1985 one roundhouse was demolished, the remaining one was refurbished and commercially developed.  Valley Model Railroad Club  In South Elgin at Kenyon Rd. The Valley Model Railroad Club moved into the old Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railway Clintonville Station in 1953 and has been there since. Clintonville Substation was built in 1902 and put into service as a power distribution center to convert AC power to 600 volt DC needed to operate the trains which received this electric current via a third rail.

It would have diverted the Klamath River in Northern California to the more arid central and southern parts of that state. It would relieve irrigation water demand and groundwater overdraft in the Central Valley and boost the water supply for Southern California. Through the latter it would allow for other Southwestern states‚ÄîArizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah‚Äîas well as Mexico to receive an increased share of the waters of the Colorado River. Although many different versions of the plan were put forth, all would have involved damming the Klamath River, as well as the Trinity River and several other tributaries. A tunnel would have carried much of the Klamath's water to the Sacramento River, whose flow would be routed around the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and travel under the Tehachapi Mountains to the Los Angeles Basin. However, the Klamath River has one of the western continental United States' most significant salmon runs, and building the diversion would have all but destroyed this productive fishery. Both commercial fishermen and Native Americans‚Äînamely the Yurok‚Äîopposed the plan, as did the city of Los Angeles. The city saw the Klamath Diversion as a \\"ploy to encourage it to relinquish its claim on the share of the river [the Colorado] it considered its own\\".Reisner, p. 270 Background The rapid development of the American Southwest in the late 19th and early 20th centuries coincided with a wet period that swelled the flow of rivers, allowing for much more water consumption than was sustainable under normal, long-term conditions. The Colorado River, the main water supply of the Desert Southwest, averaged of annual runoff from pre-1920s gaged records. At that time, there was ample amount for all the Southwest states and Mexico. When the region spun out of its wet spell, the Colorado was found to have a maximum sustainable runoff of perhaps per year. This great reduction in water supply spurred Southern California to look north to the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin river system for water. However, most of the water in these rivers was already appropriated for irrigation. The only remaining large, undammed river systems in California were those in the wild North Coast region, which drain to the Pacific Ocean nearly unused by agriculture or cities. The Klamath is the largest of these rivers, discharging more than annually. Not counting smaller rivers in Oregon such as the Rogue and Umpqua, the closest rivers that provide a similar or greater flow are the Columbia River in the north and its tributary the Snake. The Klamath River was not only closer, but has over twice the flow of either the Rogue or Umpqua, and over one-third of the discharge of the Snake. At the time, diverting the Klamath into the Sacramento River system, in turn augmenting its flow for use in Central and Southern California, was an attractive idea. The first plans to divert the Klamath appeared in a 1951 Bureau of Reclamation report called the United Western Investigation: Interim Report on Reconnaissance. The major physical barrier towards development of the Klamath River is the climate of its watershed. The Klamath River begins in the high desert of southern Oregon, and the average annual flow at Keno (about 20 miles below Upper Klamath Lake) is just over . A Klamath Diversion at this point would be simple‚Äìan aqueduct running south to Shasta Lake on the Sacramento River‚Äîbut the flow here is not enough to warrant such an effort. The river gains most of its volume in high rainfall regions as it approaches the coast, but here it is walled off from the Sacramento River system by the Klamath Mountains. Any diversion from the lower Klamath would require one of the most massive engineering projects ever undertaken. Proposals and controversy Due to the heavy controversy, the initial Bureau of Reclamation proposal for the project was defeated, but the project continued to resurface throughout the 1960s and 1970s in several different forms. In 1965 Congress passed a bill requiring the Bureau of Reclamation to seek congressional approval before conducting feasibility studies for water projects. This placed such a handicap on the development of new projects that it may have been responsible for killing the Klamath Diversion in its entirety. The original plan consisted of one large reservoir on the main Klamath, located about above the mouth of the Klamath at the Pacific Ocean. The Ah Pah Reservoir would be formed by the -high Ah Pah Dam. This reservoir would extend up the Klamath River, with a -long Trinity River arm that would also flood part of its South Fork. The lower half of the Salmon River and a number of smaller tributaries would also be flooded under the reservoir. From the Trinity arm, a tunnel would be drilled under the Klamath Mountains to the Sacramento Valley, through which water would flow by gravity into the Sacramento River. From there it would travel to the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California through the proposed Peripheral Canal (which would bypass the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta) and the California Aqueduct. The Klamath Diversion was also considered as part of the California Water Plan, a statewide effort in the early 1960s to provide more water for the State Water Project, for irrigation in the Central Valley and urban uses in Central and Southern California. The California Water Plan was virtually identical to the Bureau of Reclamation proposal, except on a matter of scale. No fewer than sixteen new dams were proposed, including four on the Klamath River, five on the Trinity River, and others on the Smith, Mad, and Eel River systems. Like the Bureau of Reclamation proposal, this iteration died a victim of its own colossal size. Ironically, the City of Los Angeles and other entities within Southern California ‚Äì who would be among the principal beneficiaries ‚Äì heavily opposed the plan. The prevailing local belief was that the Klamath Diversion was a plot by politicians in the other Colorado River basin states (especially Arizona) to get Southern California to let go of the water it was taking from the Colorado. Combined with concerted opposition from Northern California voters, who saw it as just another water grab by the thirsty south that would damage the ecology, fisheries and natural beauty of the North Coast, the project never left the drawing boards. Legacy The scaled-down California Water Plan would become the California State Water Project, drawing its main water supply from the Feather River, a tributary of the Sacramento River. A diversion from the Klamath basin to the Sacramento was eventually undertaken on a far smaller scale, through the construction of the Trinity River Division of the Central Valley Project, which appropriates about per year from the Trinity River, a major Klamath River tributary. Most of the North Coast rivers originally slated for damming have since been granted National Wild and Scenic River status, effectively eliminating the possibility for such a project.

Jimmie's plan fails as Kingsley finds the two original tickets for Jimmie and Buzz, and Jimmie is fired right away. When the two men come home and open Buzz's trunk it turns out there is a dead woman's body in it. Soon after their discovery, a mysterious woman named Margaret Nicholls arrives and offers to buy the trunk from them. When the woman leaves, Jimmie follows her and later contemplates alerting the police, when he hears a radio broadcast announcing himself and a female accomplice as suspected murderers. Jimmy acts with the belief that Margaret is innocent, and together they team up to try to find the real killer. Buzz tells them he bought the trunk at Sam Peter's warehouse. When they go there they find Sam Peter dead. They manage to flee the scene and get Peters' orderbook and get three names to check up on. The first name turns out to be dead ends, but the second leads to the address of a pair of newly-weds. The brand new Mrs. De Borest becomes suspicious and opens up the trunk her husband has, finding out from the contents that he is a traveling salesman and not a count as he has led her to believe. When Jimmie and Margaret arrive at the last address, they meet perfumer Jarvis Woodruff. He offers Margaret to try his latest creation, but sees a picture of Jimmie and Margaret in the paper and alerts the police. Jimmie and Margaret still manage to flee to a nearby diner. Margaret confesses that she is an insurance investigator on the lookout for the banker's stolen money. Using a handkerchief to wipe Jimmies face, she notices that it's not hers but the dead woman's and that it smells just like the perfume she tried at Woodruff's apartment. Jimmie and Margaret both sneak back to Woodruff's apartment but are caught by him and locked into a refrigerator room. The police soon arrive and are also tricked into the refrigerator room. Buzz has picked up Jimmie's trail and arrives at the building, lures his way in and then manage to release everyone locked into the refrigerator room. The police arrest Woodruff for the murder of his wife and Margaret find the million dollars in another trunk in the apartment. Jimmie gets an exclusive on the story to bring to his publisher. Since he has fallen in love with Margaret, they marry and go to Mexico on honeymoon. While they are there, Jimmie reads about the banker's capture in Central Park.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/85810/Opened-by-Mistake/ Cast *Charlie Ruggles as Buzz Nelson *Janice Logan as Margaret Nichols *Robert Paige as Jimmie Daniels *William Frawley as Matt Kingsley *Florence Shirley as Elizabeth Stiles *Lawrence Grossmith as Jarvis Woodruff *Rafael Corio as Mr. DeBorest *Esther Dale as Mrs. DeBorest *James Burke as Sergeant Wilkins *Jack Norton as Al, bartender *Byron Foulger as Roger Weatherby *Cy Kendall as Oberweiser External links * References Category:1940 films Category:1940 comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by George Archainbaud Category:American black- and-white films Category:American comedy films ","title":"Opened by Mistake"},{"id":"24465315","text":"Denna Frank Fleming (1893‚Äì1980) was an American revisionist historian and author who wrote The Cold War and Its Origins, about the Cold War.

(aka Fellow Prisoners) is a 1933 American pre-Code film about World War I prisoners of war in a German camp. The film was directed by Roy Del Ruth and stars Leslie Howard and Douglas Fairbanks Jr..Pendo 1985, p. 104. Captured! was based on the short story \\"Fellow Prisoners\\" (1930) by Sir Philip Gibbs.\\"View: 'Captured!'.\\" American Film Institute, 2019. Retrieved: June 29, 2019.  Plot  British Captain Fred Allison bids farewell to his new wife, Monica, whom he has only known for six days, and sets out for the war. He ends up a prisoner of war (POW), tortured by the fact that his wife has not written to him since the early days of his two year captivity. When a fellow inmate shoots a guard, the prisoners make an impromptu unsuccessful dash for freedom, resulting in much bloodshed on both sides. As punishment, they are locked in a crowded cell for about a month. Finally, a new commandant, Oberst Carl Ehrlich, takes charge of the camp. Allison persuades Ehrlich (a fellow Oxford alumnus) to rescind the punishment. One day, a fresh batch of POWs arrives. Allison is delighted to find his oldest and best friend among them, Royal Flying Corps Lieutenant Jack \\"Dig\\" Digby. For some reason though, Dig is not as pleased to see him. However, Allison attributes that to their situation. Dig is determined to escape, regardless of the consequences to his fellow prisoners. He does manage to break free, stealing an aircraft from the nearby airfield. The Germans find his coat near the dead body of Elsa, a woman who delivered fresh food to the camp. Ehrlich writes to the Allies, demanding Dig's return to stand trial for rape and murder. Allison refuses to cooperate, until he recognizes the handwriting on a letter found in the coat. When he reads it, he discovers that Monica and Dig have been carrying on an affair for the last six months. Allison then adds his signature to Ehrlich's request. On the strength of Allison's endorsement, the British do send Dig back. Dig refuses to defend himself, insisting only that he knows Allison's motive for bringing him back. He is found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad. The real perpetrator, Strogin, writes a note confessing to the crime, then hangs himself. Allison finds the note, but instead of notifying the Germans, crumples it up. Just before Dig is to be executed, Allison's conscience makes him show the confession to Ehrlich. Afterward, Allison tells Dig he will give Monica up. All along, Allison has been planning a mass escape. He seizes the machine gun guarding the front gate, then holds off the guards while his comrades escape. The POWs race to the airfield, overcome the aircrews there, and fly off in a squadron of bombers preparing for their nightly raid. Allison is killed by a grenade. When Ehrlich finds his body, he salutes.

Dwenger was born near Minster, Ohio, in 1837. Orphaned at an early age, he was educated by the Fathers of the Precious Blood, entered their community, and was ordained priest 4 September 1859. Appointed professor in the seminary of his community, he filled that position until 1862, and was then assigned to parochial work. From 1867 to 1872 he was occupied in preaching missions. He was consecrated 14 April 1872. During his time in office he supported the congregation of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ, as had his predecessor Bishop John Henry Luers. He allowed Father Edward Koenig ‚Äì who had served as advisor to the sisters since their arrival ‚Äì to remain in office in their Motherhouse in Fort Wayne. The good relationship continued, and in due course the congregation opened many schools, orphanages and hospitals in his and the neighbouring dioceses. Especially the establishment of orphanages were at his core interest. He served such parishes as Holy Rosary in St. Marys and St. Joseph's in Wapakoneta, both in Auglaize County,McMurray, William J., ed. History of Auglaize County Ohio. Vol. 1. Indianapolis: Historical Publishing Company, 1923, 324. and he aided in establishing Immaculate Conception parish in Celina in Mercer County.\\"Mercer County, Ohio History 1978.\\" Celina: Mercer County Historical Society, 1978, 525. In 1874 Bishop Dwenger was the head of the first American pilgrimage to Rome. In 1875, he erected an orphan asylum and manual labour school for boys at Lafayette. He was a zealous promoter of the parochial school system. In 1884 he attended the Third Plenary Council at Baltimore. The following March he was deputed, with Bishops John Moore and Richard Gilmour, to present the decrees of the council to Pope Leo XIII. In 1886, he erected an asylum for orphan girls at Fort Wayne. In 1888 when he was on his way to Rome he visited the German Motherhouse of the congregation of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ in Dernbach Westerwald from where their community took its beginnings. He stated his intention as to express personally his gratitude for the many services which had been done for the development of his diocese and the many sisters which had been sent to serve in the US. As in 1888, in 1891 he again went to Rome, the last time in the interest of the Pontifical North American College. Soon after his return he fell ill, and died on 22 January 1893. Bishop Joseph's parents were Johann Gerhard Heinrich \\"Henry\\" Dwenger, who died in German Twp., Auglaize County, Ohio, in 1840 (at the time German Twp. was in Mercer County), and Maria Catherine Wirdt, who moved to Cincinnati shortly after Henry died, where she lived for several years, but returned to Mercer County, where she died in October 1849. Bishop Joseph had 2 older brothers Heinrich F. Dwenger and Herman Dwenger. The parents and 2 older sons arrived in Baltimore harbor August 25, 1834, on the ship Cassander.

These starships were first depicted in Return of the Jedi as the main capital ships of the Rebel Alliance fleet during the attack on the Second Death Star. Industrial Light and Magic designed the vessels to visually contrast the Galactic Empire's Imperial Star Destroyers. Various Mon Calamari cruisers also appear in literature and video games of the Star Wars expanded universe. Replicas, toys and other depictions of the ships have been released by several merchandise companies. Origin and design Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) created two Mon Calamari cruiser designs: the cylindrical \\"flying cigar\\" Home One command ship and a \\"winged\\" model identified in the Expanded Universe as the Liberty.https://www.belloflostsouls.net/2016/02/star-wars-armada- mc80-star-cruiser.html The \\"winged\\" model would have its wings removed and thrusters modified to portray another subtype. The ships were designed to be as aesthetically different from the Imperial Star Destroyers as possible, although the filming crew disliked the \\"pickle ships\\" due to the models' unflattering angles. The ships' design precluded ILM's modelmakers from kitbashing other models to create the ships; the model was largely vacuformed. Internal neon lights provided lighting, and detail was painted on by using the second Death Star model's exposed framework as a makeshift frisket. Depiction Expanded Universe According to the old Expanded Universe (now Star Wars Legends) material, the Galactic Empire occupied the planet of Mon Calamari (also known as Mon Cala or Dac). After the Empire destroyed three floating cities to pacify the planet, the peaceful Mon Calamari converted their passenger liners and deep space exploration into warships, driving the Imperials from their homeworld prior to the Battle of Yavin. Joining the Rebellion, the Mon Cala's shipyards supplied the Rebels with badly-needed capital ships to take on the Imperial Navy. For this reason Emperor Palpatine had planned to use the second Death Star against Mon Cal, but this was foiled at the Battle of Endor, and upon Palpatine's return in a clone body the Imperials attacked Mon Cal with World Devastators as told in the Dark Empire comic series. In April 2014, when Lucasfilm rebranded existing Expanded Universe material as Star Wars Legends and declared it non-canonical to the franchise, the new Expanded Universe retcons this history somewhat. Before the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader successfully subjugates Mon Cala, leading to a mass exodus of city-ships from Mon Cala. With Mon Cala remaining under Imperial occupation, many of these escaped ships were converted for war by rebels in deep-space facilities located in the remote Telaris system. A new comic series by Marvel Comics (set between A New Hope and the Empire Strikes Back) starting with Star Wars 50: Hope Dies, Part I covers the mutiny on Mon Cala and Darth Vader's hunt for the Mon Calamari exodus fleet. Each Mon Calamari vessel was individually unique due to the artistry of their Mon Calamari builders, even those of the same \\"class\\", which was frustrating for Rebel technicians. Legends texts state that the original MC80 ships had a command crew consisting almost entirely of Mon Calamari due to the ships' Mon Calamari-oriented controls and interface, although the succeeding MC90 cruisers and follow-up ships are designed to accommodate humans and other species. According to Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game sourcebooks, while smaller and carrying less weaponry than Imperial-class Star Destroyers, the Mon Calamari cruisers are often more than a match in head-to-head engagements. This is attributed to the Mon Calamari cruisers' multiple backup shields and multiple shield generators as well as more balanced all-around firing arcs, in contrast to Star Destroyers who rely upon a single powerful shield and emphasize full-forward firing arcs. The franchise's books, comics, and video games from Legends describe and depict other Mon Calamari cruisers and successor designs, such as the MC80B Mon Remonda in the Star Wars: X-wing novels, the MC90 star cruiser Galactic Voyager, the Mediator-class battle cruisers, and Viscount-class Star Defenders (which were meant to be the answer to the Executor-class Super Star Destroyers) in R.A. Salvatore's Vector Prime. Films In Return of the Jedi, Admiral Ackbar (Timothy M. Rose) leads the Rebels during the Battle of Endor from the flagship, Alliance Headquarters Frigate Home One, a modified MC80A star cruiser; although that ship survives the Battle of Endor, the Death Star's superlaser destroys other Mon Calamari cruisers, including the Liberty. In Revenge of the Sith, the Confederacy of Independent Systems (Separatists) used the Providence-class carrier/destroyer as their frontline capital ship at the Battle of Coruscant, opposite to the Old Republic Navy's Venator-class Star Destroyers. A modified variant, the Invisible Hand, serves as the command ship for Count Dooku and General Grievous. Expanded Universe material states that the Providence destroyers were constructed on the planet of Mon Cala, at the same shipyards that would later produce the Mon Calamari cruisers for the Rebel Alliance. In Rogue One, Admiral Raddus flew his flag on the MC75 Star Cruiser Profundity at the Battle of Scarif. The design of Profundity was meant to be a cross between the MC80 star cruiser from Return of the Jedi and the Separatists' Providence-class carrier/destroyer in Revenge of the Sith. In The Last Jedi, the Raddus, formerly known as the Dawn of Tranquility, was an MC85 Star Cruiser that served as the flagship of General Leia Organa.Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary It was used by the Resistance during its war against the First Order. It was one of the last purpose-built warships before the signing of the Military Disarmament Act by the Galactic Empire and New Republic.Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Incredible Cross-Sections The vessel gained the moniker Raddus upon its entry into the service of the Resistance, when Admiral Gial Ackbar petitioned to rename it in honor of the famed Admiral Raddus, who had died in service of the Alliance at the Battle of Scarif after defying the Rebel Alliance's political leaders and choosing to fight against seemingly insurmountable odds. Merchandise The Mon Calamari cruiser Liberty A 1994 Micro Machines three-pack included a winged Mon Calamari cruiser toy, and a 1996 three-pack included the other variety. Hasbro in 2003 planned to release a Mon Calamari cruiser as part of its Action Fleet collection but they cancelled the line before producing it. Decipher and Wizards of the Coast published Mon Calamari cruiser cards for the Star Wars Customizable Card Game and Star Wars Trading Card Game, respectively. In 2006, Wizards of the Coast created a Mon Calamari Star Defender miniature as part of its Star Wars Miniatures Starship Battles game. Mon Calamari cruisers are player- controllable units in LucasArts' Empire at War real-time strategy. The Fleets -> Mon Calamari Cruiser Fantasy Flight Games's Star Wars: Armada, a table top miniatures game released on March 27, 2015, adds several Mon Calamari cruisers to the Rebel side in the expansions, including the MC80 Home One, MC80 Liberty, MC75 Profundity, and MC30c Frigate.

However, she also hears the voice of a little girl, Sophie, who recounts her short and troubled life in her small town, which once stood on a lush shore but has since been destroyed by an ecological catastrophe. One night, a boat discharged illegal toxic waste that poisoned the fish and local fisherman, eventually contaminating all the vegetation on the coast and the region's inhabitants.

He obtained doctorate from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, in 2000, for the thesis : 'Some Strategies for the Management of Indian Earth Observation System'. Radhakrishnan married Padmini Kizhakke Valappil from Irinjalakuda in 1983. Padmini worked with State Bank of Travancore from 1980 to 2010. Indian Space Research Organisation Radhakrishnan joined ISRO in May 1971 at the Space Science & Technology Centre at Thiruvananthapuram (the present Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre) as a design and development engineer of electro-mechanical devices. Later he worked on system planning and technology management for avionics systems of SLV-3, ASLV and PSLV. During 1981-97, at the ISRO Headquarters, he oversaw the preparation and review of annual budgets of ISRO, formulation of decade profile and Five Year Plans for Indian Space programme and the related techno-economic analysis.  Remote Sensing Applications.  As Project Director, he set up a chain of regional remote sensing service centres (RRSSC) at Bangalore, Nagpur, Kharagpur, Jodhpur and Dehradun for capacity building in central and state government agencies. While he was the Director, RRSSCs came to prominence in the national remote sensing application missions including the Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD) aimed at generation of spatial database of natural resources and action plans for sustainable development of land and water resources. Later, Radhakrishnan succeeded as the Mission Director of IMSD and moved to National Remote Sensing Agency in Hyderabad. IMSD was considered as largest remote sensing application experiment ever done in the world using a meticulous participatory approach. As the Director of National Remote Sensing Agency, he scripted India‚Äôs modern multi-mission ground station for Earth Observation Satellites.  Space Transportation System and Chandrayaan-1 Mission  While at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre as its Director, he oversaw five successful launches of PSLV including development of its high-end version PSLV ‚ÄìXL that lofted Chandrayaan-1 in October 2008 as well as formulation of Indian Human Spaceflight programme.  Chief of India's Space Programme  As India's space chief from November 2009 to December 2014, Radhakrishnan led ISRO to achieve 37 space missions including several historic feats including Mars Orbiter Mission; flying Indian Cryogenic Engine on GSLV; the first experimental flight of the GSLV Mk III; a re-entry experiment of an un-manned crew module; and new space capabilities through IRNSS (1A, 1B, 1C) for navigation; GSAT-7 for strategic communication; and RISAT-1 for microwave radar imaging. ISRO completed two joint satellite missions (Megha Tropiques and SARAL) with the French National Space Agencyand inked another agreement with NASA to jointly build an advanced Radar Imaging Satellite. India's standing in the global space market was enhanced as PSLV launched 18 commercial satellites for 11 countries. Through an inclusive organisational process, Radhakrishnan charted out clear programmatic directions and nurtured younger generation of leaders for carrying forward the legacy of ISRO. Re- defining the Chandrayaan-2 mission with Indigenous lander and rover and extending the application of space technologies and tools to all central ministries are highlights of his leadership regime at ISRO. He worked to enhance the partnership with the Indian space industry for the production of operational launchers and satellites. During his leadership, ISRO received the 2014 Gandhi Peace Prize; the 2014 Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development; the 2014 Knowledge Economy Network KEN Award; the 2014 CNN- IBN Indian of the Year-Lifetime Achievement Award; the 2014 Global Game Changer Award by the Marico Innovation Foundation; and the 2013 CNBC-18 India Business Leader Award-BRAND INDIA.

Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle and Indian Cryogenic Stage  GSLV had a checkered history in its initial flights of 2001-2007 and they were powered by cryogenic upper stage of Russia. After failure of the Indian Cryogenic upper stage on GSLV in April 2010 (GSLV-D3) and recurrence one more failure of GSLV with Russian Cryogeinc upper stage (GSLV-F06) in December 2010, Radhakrishnan steered ISRO towards the landmark success in January 2014 GSLV-D5. This marked the beginning of the successful series of GSLV with Indian Cryogenic Upper Stage.  Ocean Observation and Information Services  Radhakrishnan had a stint of five years the Ministry of Earth Sciences to set up, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS).

Quantitatively, it is the ratio given by the toxic dose divided by the therapeutic dose. A protective index is the toxic dose of a drug for 50% of the population (TD50) divided by the minimum effective dose for 50% of the population (ED50). A high protective index is preferable to a low one: this corresponds to a situation in which one would have to take a much higher dose of a drug to reach the toxic threshold than the dose taken to elicit the therapeutic effect. A drug should ordinarily only be administered if the protective index is greater than one, indicating that the benefit outweighs the risk. \\\\mbox{Protective index} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{TD}_{50}}{\\\\mathrm{ED}_{50}} The protective index is similar to the therapeutic index, but concerns toxicity (TD50) rather than lethality (); thus, the protective index is a smaller ratio. Toxicity can take many forms, as drugs typically have multiple side effects of varying severity, so a specific criterion of toxicity must be specified for the protective index to be meaningful. Ideally a choice is made such that the harm caused by the toxicity just outweighs the benefit of the drug's effect. Thus, the protective index is a more accurate measure of the benefit-to-risk ratio than the therapeutic index, but is less objectively defined. Nevertheless, the therapeutic index can be viewed as an upper bound to the protective index for a given substance. Protective Index Protective index refers to the factor by which the dose of a toxicant must be multiplied to produce a defined level of toxicity in the presence of a nontoxic dose of another chemicalBhat et al., 2007. 'Protective index = LD50 of A with B/LD50 of A alone' The higher the protective index, better is the antidotal value of a given substance. Sometimes the protective index is higher in the presence of two or more substances than in the presence of either of the substances alone. For example, the LD50 of potassium cyanide alone is 11 mg/kg, whereas it is 21 mg/kg in the presence of sodium nitrite, giving a protective index of 1.91. The LD50 of potassium cyanide in the presence of sodium thiosulfate is 35 mg/kg, giving a protective index of 3.2. The LD50 of potassium cyanide in the presence of both nitrite and thiosulfate is 52 mg/kg with a protective index of 4.73 . Since the protective index is higher for the simultaneous use of nitrite and thiosulfate, the two chemicals constitute the antidote against cyanide intoxication.

The type of toxicity should be specified for this value to have meaning for practical purposes. The median toxic dose encompasses the category of toxicity that is greater than half maximum effective concentration (ED50) but less than the median lethal dose (LD50). However, for some highly potent toxins (ex. lofentanil, botulinum toxin) the difference between the ED50 and TD50 is so minute that the values assigned to them may be approximated to equal doses. Since toxicity need not be lethal, the TD50 is generally lower than the median lethal dose (LD50), and the latter can be considered an upper bound for the former. However, since the toxicity is above the effective limit, the TD50 is generally greater than the ED50. If the result of a study is a toxic effect that does not result in death, it is classified as this form of toxicity. Toxic effects can be defined differently, sometimes considering the therapeutic effect of a substance to be toxic (such as with chemotherapeutics) which can lead to confusion and contention regarding a substance's TD50. Examples of these toxic endpoints include cancer, blindness, anemia, and birth defects.

Only Japan (83.2 years), Iceland (83.0 years) and Switzerland (82.8 years) had a higher life expectancy than Spain in 2012. The top three causes of death since 1970 have been cardiovascular diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases.  Health status  Obesity In 2013 there had been a 14% rise in the number of overweight people since 1987 when the figure had been 40% according to a survey conducted by the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica. 18% of men and 16% of women were regarded as obese. These was attributed to an increase in sedentary lifestyles. 14.4% of men and 17% of women declared they don't do any physical exercise. In 2015 according to the World Health Organization 22.8% of men and 24.7% of women were obese. Spain was number 48 on the global obesity scale. Smoking Spain has achieved progress in reducing tobacco consumption over the past decade, with rates of daily smokers among adults coming down 32% in 2001 to 24% in 2011. However, smoking rates in Spain still remain higher than the developed world average. Diabetes In 2015 it was estimated that 10.58% of the population has diabetes, costing about $3,090 per person per year. Vaccination Spain's 19 autonomous communities, consisting of 17 Regions and 2 cities, follow health policies established by the Inter-Territorial Health Council that was formed by the National and Regional Ministries of Health. This Inter-Territorial Council is composed of representatives from each region and meets to discuss health related issues spanning across Spain. The Institute of Health Carlos III (ISCIIII) is a public research institute that manages biomedical research for the advancement of health sciences and disease preventions. The ISCIII may suggest the introduction of new vaccines into Spain's Recommended Health Schedule and is under direct control of the Ministry of Health. Although the Ministry of Health is responsible for the oversight of health care services, the policy of devolution divides responsibilities among local agencies, including health planning and programing, fiscal duties, and direct management of health services. This decentralization proposes difficulties in collecting information at the national level. The Inter-Territorial Council's Commission on Public Health works to establish health care policies according to recommendations by technical working groups via letters, meetings, and conferences. The Technical Working Group on Vaccines review data on vaccine preventable diseases and proposes recommendations for policies. No additional groups outside the government propose recommendations. Recommendations must be approved by the Commission of Public Health and then by the Inter-Territorial Council, at which point they are incorporated into the National Immunization Schedule. The Spanish Association of Pediatrics, in conjunction with the Spanish Medicines Agency, outlines specifications for vaccination schedules and policies and provides a history of vaccination policies implemented in the past, as well as legislature pertaining to the public currently. Spain's Constitution does not mandate vaccination, so it is voluntary unless authorities require compulsory vaccination in the case of epidemics. In 1921 vaccination became mandatory for smallpox, and in 1944 the Bases Health Act mandated compulsory vaccination for diphtheria and smallpox, but was suspended in 1979 after the elimination of the threat of an epidemic. The first systematic immunization schedule for the provinces of Spain was established in 1975 and has continuously been updated by each autonomous community in regard to doses at certain ages and recommendation of additional vaccine not proposed in the schedule. The 2015 schedule proposed the newest change with the inclusion of pneumococcal vaccine for children under 12 months. For 2016, the schedule plans to propose a vaccine against varicella in children at 12‚Äì15 months and 3‚Äì4 years. Furthermore, the General Health Law of 1986 echoes Article 40.2 from the Constitution guaranteeing the right to the protection of health, and states employers must provide vaccines to workers if they are at risk of exposure. Due to vaccination coverage in each Community, there is little anti-vaccine activity or opposition to the current schedule, and no organized groups against vaccines. The universal public health care provides coverage for all residents, while central and regional support programs extend coverage to immigrant populations. However, no national funds are granted to the Communities for vaccine purchases. Vaccines are financed from taxes, and paid in full by the Community government. Law 21 in Article 2.6 establishes the need for proper clinical documentation and informed consent by the patient, although written informed consent is not mandated in the verbal request of a vaccine for a minor. The autonomous regions collect data, from either electronic registries or written physician charts, to calculate immunization coverage.

Early history The regiment was reraised by Lieutenant Edward Dandridge at Shahjahanpur in 1858, during the upheaval of the Indian Mutiny, as the Shahjahanpur Levy. It was initially composed of Hindus from North India and some Sikhs. In 1888, the regiment participated in the Black Mountain Expedition, while in 1890, it dispatched a detachment to Lushai Hills. In 1890, it was reconstituted with Trans-frontier Pathans to become the only all-Pathan regiment in the Indian Army; acquiring in the process, the nickname of \\"Forty Thieves\\". In 1901, it lost its exclusively Pathan character, when two companies each of Punjabi Muslims and Dogras were included. 40th Pathans Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 40th Pathans. In 1904, the 40th Pathans proceeded to Tibet as reinforcements for the Tibet Mission Force. On the outbreak of the First World War the regiment was stationed in Hong Kong. It arrived in France on 2 April 1915, and within days, was on the frontlines. The 40th Pathans fought with great gallantry in the Second Battle of Ypres, where they suffered 320 casualties on 26 April, and in the Battles of Aubers Ridge and Loos. In December, the regiment left for East Africa, where they served till February 1918, and again distinguished themselves in the long and bitter campaign. The 40th Pathans suffered a total of 800 casualties (killed or wounded) during the war, while 1066 officers and men were invalided out of service due to sickness. In 1919, the 40th Pathans participated in the Third Afghan War.Ypres, 26 April 1915. Illustration by AC Michael.|360px British And Indian Officers Who Died In World War I EUROPE CAMPAIGN *Lt Col F.

It is typically used as a substitute for orthogonality arguments which only apply to Lp functions when p = 2\\\\. One implementation involves studying a function by decomposing it in terms of functions with localized frequencies, and using the Littlewood‚ÄìPaley g-function to compare it with its Poisson integral. The 1-variable case was originated by and developed further by Polish mathematicians A. Zygmund and J. Marcinkiewicz in the 1930s using complex function theory . E. M. Stein later extended the theory to higher dimensions using real variable techniques. The dyadic decomposition of a function Littlewood‚ÄìPaley theory uses a decomposition of a function f into a sum of functions fœÅ with localized frequencies. There are several ways to construct such a decomposition; a typical method is as follows. If f(x) is a function on R, and œÅ is a measurable set (in the frequency space) with characteristic function \\\\chi_\\\\rho(\\\\xi), then fœÅ is defined via its Fourier transform :\\\\hat f_\\\\rho := \\\\chi_\\\\rho\\\\hat f. Informally, fœÅ is the piece of f whose frequencies lie in œÅ. If Œî is a collection of measurable sets which (up to measure 0) are disjoint and have union on the real line, then a well behaved function f can be written as a sum of functions fœÅ for œÅ ‚àà Œî. When Œî consists of the sets of the form : \\\\rho = [-2^{k+1},-2^k] \\\\cup [2^k,2^{k+1}]. for k an integer, this gives a so- called \\"dyadic decomposition\\" of f : Œ£œÅ fœÅ. There are many variations of this construction; for example, the characteristic function of a set used in the definition of fœÅ can be replaced by a smoother function. A key estimate of Littlewood‚ÄìPaley theory is the Littlewood‚ÄìPaley theorem, which bounds the size of the functions fœÅ in terms of the size of f. There are many versions of this theorem corresponding to the different ways of decomposing f. A typical estimate is to bound the Lp norm of (Œ£œÅ |fœÅ|2)1/2 by a multiple of the Lp norm of f. In higher dimensions it is possible to generalize this construction by replacing intervals with rectangles with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Unfortunately these are rather special sets, which limits the applications to higher dimensions. The Littlewood‚ÄìPaley g function The g function is a non-linear operator on Lp(Rn) that can be used to control the Lp norm of a function f in terms of its Poisson integral. The Poisson integral u(x,y) of f is defined for y > 0 by :u(x,y) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R^n} P_y(t)f(x-t) \\\\, dt where the Poisson kernel P is given by :P_y(x) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R^n} e^{-2\\\\pi i tx-2\\\\pi |t|y} \\\\, dt = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma((n+1)/2)}{\\\\pi^{(n+1)/2}}\\\\frac{y}{(|x|^2+y^2)^{(n+1)/2}}. The Littlewood‚ÄìPaley g function g(f) is defined by :g(f)(x) = \\\\left(\\\\int_0^\\\\inftyabla u(x,y)|^2y \\\\, dy\\\\right)^{1/2} A basic property of g is that it approximately preserves norms. More precisely, for 1 < p < ‚àû, the ratio of the Lp norms of f and g(f) is bounded above and below by fixed positive constants depending on n and p but not on f. Applications One early application of Littlewood‚ÄìPaley theory was the proof that if Sn are the partial sums of the Fourier series of a periodic Lp function (p > 1) and nj is a sequence satisfying nj+1/nj > q for some fixed q > 1, then the sequence Snj converges almost everywhere. This was later superseded by the Carleson‚ÄìHunt theorem showing that Sn itself converges almost everywhere. Littlewood‚ÄìPaley theory can also be used to prove the Marcinkiewicz multiplier theorem.

Dise√±o del Rancho Sespe History Carlos Antonio Carrillo (17831852), the son of Jos√© Raimundo Carrillo of the prominent Santa Barbara family, had been elected to the assembly and was later Governor of Alta California from 1837-1838.

Complicating the dispute, More‚Äôs attorney, Hinchman, agreed to the government‚Äôs much smaller description of Rancho Sespe without the More‚Äôs approval. By 1860, the More brothers were the largest landowner in Santa Barbara County (which at the time included all of present-day Ventura County). Besides Rancho Sespe, the More brothers owned the neighboring Rancho Santa Paula y Saticoy, and also owned Santa Rosa Island, Rancho Lompoc and Rancho Mission Vieja de la Purisma.

Rancho Santa Paula y Saticoy to the west was subdivided in 1867, and many settlers purchased land in the area west of Santa Paula. Settlers hoping to avail themselves of free land offered by the Homestead Act had to locate available public lands. It was often difficult for homesteaders to know if they were settling on public or private lands.Martha Menchaca, 1995,The Mexican Outsiders: A Community History of Marginalization and Discrimination in California, University of Texas Press, T.W. More continued to fight for the rest of his six square leagues, angering the Sespe Settlers League, who had banded together to protect their homesteads. More filed an application in 1875 to buy the remaining four square leagues from the government under the \\"pre- emption\\" laws of 1866. This application was denied by the U.S. Land Office in 1875. When, during the drought of 1876-1877, More began to trench an irrigation ditch on his land, the settlers believed that More was seeking to deprive them of water rights from the Sespe Creek and Santa Clara River, further angering the settlers.

History During the colonial era, the British established an oil mill in Okwuohia to take advantage of the abundant local water resources in order to harvest palm extract. Due to the huge demand for palm oil, the mill generated significant profits. Palm oil was exported to Europe and around the world for the production of finished goods, such as soap and candles, which helped the local economy. The British also introduced the customary-court system, with warrant chiefs who dispensed tribal justice.  Culture  The community's traditional celebrations include the Iwa Akwa Festival (Initiation Into Manhood) and the African Folk Music Festival Mbom-Uzo.

Sant Joan de Foix√† is a twelfth-century Romanesque church located in the municipality of Foix√†, Spain. History The church of Sant Joan de Foix√† (Catalan for Saint John) was restored in 1058 by the countess Ermesinde of Barcelona to Berengar, bishop of Girona. This is the first document in which the church is mentioned by the name of Sancti Johannis Fusxano. The current church dates mostly from the 16th century, however some vestiges of the church that existed in the mid 12th century still remain. Most likely during the War of the Remences the church served as a fortress because in the upper left wall were two corbels which could have supported a machicolation. Curiously, a car garage at the north end, constructed in 1958 for the priest, has recently been demolished. Architecture The devouring monsters. Snake-shaped lock. The late Gothic church is complete with nave, semicircular apse and lateral chapels. The entrance features a pointed frontispiece with four sloping archivolts supported by fluted columns with original capitals, a lintel and a pediment. The capital on the left features a floral pattern while the right, two devouring monsters, a type of winged lion that swallow a person whole. The lintel at the center features a small rhomboid emblem in bas-relief depicting tools of the trade of the master of the house. In the leaf of the door the lock is in the shape of a snake, found in many churches in the country. The shape, rooted in the Romanesque period, lasted well until into the Baroque period. The interior boasts adorned archways depicting fantastic animals, the comic and caricaturesque faces of people and floral ornaments, a remarkably popular decoration. At the center of the fa√ßade is a simple rose window. The flooring is tiled throughout. In 1624 priest Andrew Madiona was interred inside the church. In the 18th century two members of two important families were also laid to rest there: Joan Perich and Tomas Torres.

Foulkes (10 July 1872 ‚Äì 22 June 1948), also known as Captain Foulkes, was an early star of Canadian tennis. Foulkes may have been a three-time winner of the Canadian national championship, today known as the Rogers Cup. He was also a member of the only Canadian team to reach the finals of the Davis Cup. Early life and family Foulkes was born in Middlesex, England, the second of six children born to Rev. Augustine Lempriere Foulkes and Francesca Forster (n√©e Godfrey). His father, who had been a cricket player, earned a doctorate at Queen's College, Oxford and was the vicar of Steventon. He had three brothers (Godfrey, Louis and Leonard) and two sisters (Francesca and Catherine). On 2 December 1899 he married Margaret May Thomas (born 1 July 1879) and they had two children, Fortescue Lempriere Foulkes (born 28 September 1900) and Francesca May Foulkes (born 3 December 1902). Tennis career He moved to Canada as a teenager in 1891, and quickly began winning tournaments. A member of the Victoria Lawn Tennis Club, Foulkes may have captured the Canadian national championship in singles 1907, 1909, and 1910 - at least one source says otherwise however. His 1907 win, if it did occur, broke a string of 13 consecutive wins by an American player and only the second for a Canadian in 18 years. The source that disputes that Foulkes won his titles claims he was, instead, runner-up in 1907 and again in 1908. He competed in the men's singles and doubles events at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Foulkes along with fellow Victoria natives B. P. Schwengers, R. B. Powell and Victoria-based Henry Mayes reached the final of the 1913 Davis Cup in the country's first attempt. (All four players were members of the Victoria LTC.) With the entire tournament played at Wimbledon in June‚ÄìJuly, the upstart Canadians, with Powell and Schwengers playing each match, beat South Africa, 4 wins to 1 and then Belgium, 4-0, to reach the final. In the final, however, they were overwhelmed by the Americans losing each set of three matches they contested. Foulkes was also a British Columbia, five-time Pacific Northwest champion, and two-time Washington State champion. He was ranked No. 1 singles in the USTA Pacific Northwest in 1914.Hall-of-Fame-and-Historical - USTA Pacific Northwest Foulkes has been elected to both the Greater Victoria Sports Hall of Fame as a member of the 1913 Davis Cup team. He was also elected to USTA Pacific Northwest Tennis Hall of Fame in 2008. Captain Foulkes Foulkes served in the Canadian Army during the Boer War, earning the Queen's Medal with four clasps. From then on he was frequently referred to as \\"Captain\\" Foulkes. He served again during the First World War in the 4th Canadian Division in the Canadian Service Corps.

The initial class composition of the troops was 50% Sikhs and 50% Dogras, Rajputs and Mussulmans (Muslims) from the Punjab and the North-West Frontier. It is said that he went through the villages challenging men to wrestle with him on the condition that they had to join up.

After sterling service in Bihar, Bengal and Assam, and during the 1857 Mutiny, the cavalry portion was eventually disbanded in 1864 and the infantry section was taken into the line of Bengal Native Infantry as the '45th (Rattray's Sikh) Native Regiment of Infantry'.Omer Tarin and SD Najmuddin, \\"Risaldar Sardar Habib Khan, 1st Bengal Military Police Battalion\\" in Durbar: Journal of the Indian Military Historical Society, Vol 27, No 2, Summer 2010, pp. 67‚Äì74 After World War I the Indian government reformed the army moving from single battalion regiments to multi battalion regiments.Sumner p.15 In 1922, the 45th Rattray's Sikhs became the 3rd Battalion, 11th Sikh Regiment.

Biography Joseph Rademacher was born in Westphalia, Michigan, to Bernard and Theresia (n√©e Platte) Rademacher, who were German immigrants. In 1855, he began his classical and philosophical studies under the Benedictines at St. Vincent's College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. He completed his theological studies at St. Michael's Seminary in Pittsburgh. Attached to the Diocese of Fort Wayne, Indiana, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop John Henry Luers on August 2, 1863. He then served as the first resident pastor in Attica, also attending to the nearby missions, until 1870, when he was transferred to Columbia City. In 1872 he became chancellor of the diocese and pastor of St. Mary's Church in Fort Wayne. He served as pastor of St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception Church in Lafayette from 1880 to 1883. On April 3, 1883, Rademacher was appointed the fourth Bishop of Nashville, Tennessee, by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 24 from Archbishop Patrick Feehan, with Bishops Joseph Gregory Dwenger and John Ambrose Watterson serving as co-consecrators. Following the death of Bishop Dwenger in January 1893, Rademacher returned to Indiana and was named the third Bishop of Fort Wayne on July 15, 1893. Unlike his predecessor, he was known as a mild and approachable leader. He was disabled by a stroke in early 1899, and was admitted to St. Joseph Hospital in Fort Wayne and afterwards, St. Elizabeth Hospital in Chicago. Rademacher later died at St. Elizabeth's, aged 59.

John was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton and had passed the entrance to Kings College in 1938 and was told he could travel abroad until term started. John instead chose to return to the School for a term to model a statue for an empty niche in the School tower. He finally chose the Christ in Blessing and Eric Gill, then a master at the School, said of the clay model that \\"No finer piece of work has been done by anyone in this country this year\\". The original statue remains in place. He came from an Armenian merchant family that had migrated from New Julfa, Persia to settle in Calcutta, India. John enlisted in the RAF, preferring to fly with friends as a Navigator Sergeant rather than seeking a commission. He undertook a long series of night flights over Germany and died from injuries sustained on a mission. Neville Gorton, then Bishop of Coventry, wrote to the Times on 29 December 1943 to propose that John's statue be recast as an Air Force Memorial, commenting on the statue that \\"It is a moving work of faith and tenderness, and of the quality in its faith and its art Eric Gill‚Äôs judgement stands\\".

John on the monorail Kundala Valley Railway was built in 1902 and operated between Munnar and Top Station in the Kannan Devan Hills of Kerala . This railway was built to transport tea and other goods. Initially a cart road was cut in 1902, then later replaced by a monorail goods carriage system along the road leading from Munnar to Top Station for the purpose of transporting tea and other products from Munnar and Madupatty to Top Station. This monorail was based on the Ewing System and had a small wheel placed on the track while a larger wheel rested on the road to balance the monorail. This was similar to the Patiala State Monorail Trainways. The monorail was pulled by bullocks. Top Station was a transshipment point for delivery of tea from Munnar to Bodinayakkanur. Tea chests arriving at Top Station were then transported by an aerial ropeway from Top Station down hill to the south to Kottagudi, Tamil Nadu, which popularly became known as \\"Bottom Station\\".

His only clear attestation is in the Coptos Decree, which deprives him of his office and its stipend for some act of sacrilege. The exact nature of this crime is debated, largely due to the idiomatic or euphemistic language used in the text. Some have identified him as the same Teti who opposed Kamose several pharaohs later, which would indicate the pharaohs between Nubkheperre Intef and Kamose had very short reigns, but this identification remains problematic.  Rank  Teti's position in Coptos has been identified variously as a haty-a or as merely a temple official. James Henry Breasted argued that the Coptos Decree must be read as ordering the demotion of a count and installing his replacement.Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, vol. 1, p 339. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1906. Alternatively, Katja Goebs argues that Teti probably had never been the haty-a, since the titles the Coptos Decree stripped him of were purely temple offices.Goebs, Katja, \\"Hftj Ntr as Euphemism,\\" The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology. vol. 89 (2003), p. 35.  Crime  The common presumption has been that Teti committed some form of revolt.Breasted, p 339 Harry Hall argued that a reference to \\"enemies\\" indicated that Teti had invited a Hyksos delegation into the temple.Hall, Harry. The Ancient History of the Near East, from Earliest Times to the Battle of Salamis. p 220. The Macmillan Company, New York, 1913 However, a study by Georges Posener has led to a reevaluation of this view. In his argument, Posener demonstrated that the Egyptian word for enemies, khefetiu, may be used as a euphemism to avoid writing about taboo subjects.Goebs, p 27 Accordingly, when the text reads \\"the enemy was stolen,\\" Posener believed it meant that the god, the temple idol, was stolen. On the basis of this use, scholars of the Hebrew Bible began to argue that a similar construction occurs in the Second Book of Samuel, explaining why the text reads \\"you have spurned the enemies of the Lord\\" where the offence is clearly against Yahweh.Perry, Donald W. \\"The 'Word' or the 'Enemies' of the Lord?

While such a use may be established in later texts, Katja Goebs argued in a 2003 article that it is impossible for the crime of stealing the temple idol to be punished merely by stripping the offender of his titles. The typical punishment for such sacrilege was death by burning.Goebs, p 30 Rather, Goebs argued that \\"enemy\\" also indicates a sacrifice, because in Egyptian ritual, the slaughtered animal symbolizes Set, the enemy of the Pharonic god Horus, being slaughtered. Teti therefore would have stolen some of the herd for providing sacrificial animals, a crime more in keeping with what he received.Goebs, p 33 Chronological synchronism A rebel during the reign of Kamose, Teti son of Pepi, has been identified by Vandersleyen as the same person as Teti son of Minhotep, by arguing that Pepi is a diminutive of Minhotep. If these two persons were the same person, it would require that the reign of Nubkheperre Intef and Kamose could not be separated by too many years. However, Wolfgang Helck has argued that the frequency of these names is due instead to a large family in the area of Coptos with ties to the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt, since Teti and Pepy were names of important Sixth Dynasty pharaohs.Bennett, Chris. \\"A Genealogical Chronology of the Seventeenth Dynasty,\\" Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt.

Career  Donald Burmister served as faculty member at Columbia University for 34 years, beginning in 1929. He was a consultant on the foundation design for many notable construction projects including the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Verazanno-Narrows Bridge, Tappan Zee Bridge, first New York World's Fair at Flushing Meadows, and reconstruction of the White House in 1950. Burmister authored over 35 research papers, particularly influential on the subjects of pavement design and soil classification. He developed a solution to calculate stresses and displacements in a two layer pavement system in 1943, and went on solve the problem for a three layer system in 1945. Prior to his solutions, engineers relied on equations by Joseph Valentin Boussinesq to calculate stresses and displacements in pavement, but these equation proved to be inaccurate in layered pavement systems. Tests have shown that for most pavements, the Boussinesq equations result in stresses larger than those measured and displacements larger than those measured. Burmister's layered solutions were a significant advancement in the practice of pavement design. Burmister developed a soil classification system in 1950 that is still widely used today. The Modified Burmister classification system is based on grain size and plasticity, but differs from the Unified Soil Classification System in that it includes nomenclature to describe the soil's texture, color, mineralogy, and geological origin. Legacy In honor of his legacy, the Burmister Lecture has been held annually since 1999 at Columbia University to showcase recent advancements in geotechnical engineering.

It is a wooden house built in 1792, one of the oldest in the village, but modified since then. It was originally used as an inn for visitors to the spring waters that gave the village its name, very near its location. The inn had several famous guests; for example, James Fenimore Cooper is said to have written some of The Last of the Mohicans during his stay. The building has been a boys' school, a private residence, a boarding house, a sanatorium, and apartments. In 1970, the Saratoga County Historical Society purchased the building and opened it as a museum. In 1975 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the first of four properties in the village to be listed. Building It is located on the triangular lot where Front Street splits into Charlton and Fairground avenues. The land to the west is wooded, with a small creek flowing north‚Äìsouth across the land. There are some other residences in the area. Downtown Ballston Spa is to the east along Front Street. There is a small dirt parking area on the south side. The house itself is a two-and-a-half‚Äìstory, five-by-nine-bay building constructed in stages. The main block in front accounts for three of the lengthwise bays. On the rear is a long extension half the width of the front block, with a two-story shed-roofed section on its own rear. It is a frame building on a fieldstone foundation sided in clapboard. The steeply pitched gabled roof is covered in cedar shingles pierced by three dormer windows and two brick chimneys at the ends. The two rear sections are covered in asphalt shingles. Four square pillars support the full-height front porch. Inside, there is little original hardware or woodwork. The staircase, which has simple brackets and a railing with narrow balusters and turned newels, dates to 1860. The framing here is hand-hewn, and the ceilings are low. History Local Indian tribes had long known of the benefits of the spring and its naturally carbonated waters. In 1767, they shared it with Sir William Johnson, the British general who had led troops in the region during King George's War and later the French and Indian War. At the time the nearest European settlement was at Ballston Lake. Later visitors included a team surveying the Kayaderosseras Patent, George Washington and Elkanah Watson. They all spoke and wrote of the curative powers of the spring. After the Revolutionary War, Benajah Douglas, grandfather of Stephen A. Douglas, bought a hundred acres (40 ha) on the west side of the creek opposite the spring to take advantage of the growing tourist trade. He built a rudimentary log cabin on the site of the present house, the only dry clearing in an otherwise swampy area, where visitors had been camping since Indian times. Later a separate cottage was built for housekeeping. In 1791, another entrepreneur, Micajah Benedict, built a more luxurious guest house a mile (1.6 km) away. Douglas responded by building the main block of the current structure two years later. It had a columned piazza, though not the current one. He was so successful that others built in the vicinity, beginning the development of Ballston Spa. Johnson reaped the benefits of his investment and sold to a Joseph Wescot two years later. He, in turn, sold to Josiah Aldridge in 1798. During nearly four decades of ownership, Aldridge would change not only the house but the growing village, which incorporated in 1807. On the house, he built the rear wing and a north wing (since removed and rebuilt as a residence) with a ballroom. He replaced the piazza with the current colonnade, adding a Greek Revival touch to a mostly Georgian-Federal building. He reworked the inside heavily. And as a trustee of the new village, he worked to improve the area around the spring. Later in his life, in 1835, the spring finally failed, probably because of the many new ones that had been dug in the area. The next year, Aldridge's family sold the house. Ten years later, in 1846, its owners began to use it as a full-time residence exclusively, ending its days as a hotel. The next year, a new spring was dug just north of the house. It was called the Old Iron Spring, and continues to flow today. By that time Saratoga Springs, a short distance to the north, had begun to become a bigger attraction for bathers, offering other recreational facilities and thoroughbred horse racing. Ballston Spa's economy switched to industry, with a number of small textile mills opening up in the area. In 1859, with the Civil War looming, Brookside became a military academy. In 1864, with peace in the offing, it reverted to residential use, first as a single-family residence and later as an apartment house. It was eventually acquired by the Saratoga County Historical Society for use both as a historic house museum and its own headquarters.

The song was co-written by Cyrus with producer Jeffrey Steele. It was released to Radio Disney as promotion for the 2008 Disney animated film Bolt, in which Cyrus and Travolta provide the voices of Penny and Bolt. \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" was made after filmmakers requested Cyrus to write a song for the film. The lyrics speak of getting lost and getting found. \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" was nominated for Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Song and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, but lost both to Bruce Springsteen's \\"The Wrestler\\" from The Wrestler (2008). The song's accompanying music video has Cyrus and Travolta performing the song in a recording studio and features clips from Bolt. \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" was promoted by few live performances by Cyrus. Background Cyrus performed \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" at the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Cyrus became involved with Bolt once she was cast as Penny, Bolt's owner. Filmmakers asked Cyrus to write a song for herself and John Travolta, who stars as Bolt. She co-wrote the song with the aid of Jeffrey Steele, who also produced the track, in a short period of time as they had a due date. The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. \\"Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, but we could add a little country twang to it,\\" she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing \\"Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is.\\" After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. \\"She's really gifted at writing, and she really wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, and I really think they pulled it off\\", Travolta told MTV News. John Lasseter, executive producer of Bolt, decided to make \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" the theme for Bolt, since it lyrically summarized the film's plot. He said, \\"[The song] so sums up the theme of this film. You know, a dog and its owner and they both were separated, but they love each other so much ‚Äî there's such an emotional payoff when these characters get reunited, and I think that's what this song's about.\\" Lasseter thought that solely the song worked, but it worked better for the film. \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" is one of two songs on the Bolt soundtrack and was released to Radio Disney to promote Bolt and its accompanying soundtrack. Composition \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" is a pop rock song and lasts three minutes and thirty-six seconds. Its instrumentation includes electric guitar and piano. The song is set in common time at a moderate rock tempo of 103 beats per minute. The song is sung in the key of E‚ô≠ major and Cyrus' vocals span two octaves, from G3 to A‚ô≠5. \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" follows the chord progression of E‚ô≠--A‚ô≠sus2. The song's lyrics speak of \\"getting lost and getting found, with an overarching theme of loyalty.\\" Critical reception The song received mixed reception from contemporary critics. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote, \\"The album begins with a pop/rock song, 'I Thought I Lost You,' which oddly sounds like a love duet between John Travolta, a man in his mid-fifties, and the teenage TV and pop star Miley Cyrus, until it is remembered that Travolta voices the movie's title character, a dog.\\" \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" was nominated for the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Song at the 14th Broadcast Film Critics Association Award, but lost to Bruce Springsteen's \\"The Wrestler\\" from The Wrestler (2008). The song was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song at the 66th Golden Globe Awards, but also lost to \\"The Wrestler\\". An uncredited reviewer from the Los Angeles Times thought the song could have been nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at 81st Academy Awards. However, the reviewer stated that the probability of the event was shattered by \\"a serious obstacle [solely being used in Bolts ending credits] and lots of Disney competition.\\" Live performances Cyrus and Travolta performing in a recording studio in the \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" music video. The music video for \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" premiered on November 3, 2008 on Disney Channel. The video commences with a clip from Bolt in which one of the film's characters, Rhino, shouts \\"Let it begin!\\" Then several clips from the film play rapidly until Cyrus and Travolta are shown performing in a recording studio. Throughout the rest of the video, scenes alternate between Cyrus and Travolta performing to clips from Bolt. It ends with Rhino performing a brief dance move. Cyrus first performed \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" live on November 12, 2008 at an outdoor concert televised by Good Morning America.

They were formed in Washington, DC in the early 1970s and recorded four albums before disbanding in 1981. In 1998 the group reformed and recorded a further five albums and a DVD. The Muffins played at Symphony Space on Broadway in NYC with Marion Brown in 1979, and also performed at a number of festivals, starting with the ZU Manifestival in New York City in 1978, The Villa Celimontana festival in Rome, Italy in 2000, two appearances at Progday in 2001 and 2002, NEARfest in 2005, and the \\"Rock in Opposition\\" festival in France in 2009. In 2010, The Muffins headlined at Progday, making a third appearance at this long running festival. The Muffins are largely an instrumental band inspired and influenced by avant-garde jazz, progressive rock, 20th-century music, and the English Canterbury scene. They work in an \\"underground genre\\" Perfect Sound Forever called \\"the avant-garde side of latter-day US progressive jazz-rock\\", and place \\"the joy of creation over commercial concerns\\". The Rolling Stone Record Guide called them the \\"spiritual American cousins of Henry Cow and Soft Machine\\", and AllMusic described their music as a \\"unique blend of Canterbury progressive, fusion, improvisation and much more.\\" History In 1973, keyboardist and saxophonist Dave Newhouse, guitarist Michael Zentner and bassist Billy Swann, disillusioned with the state of American rock music at the time, decided to form their own group. They moved into a large farmhouse in Gaithersburg, Maryland they called the Buba Flirf house, and turned for inspiration to a new \\"Canterbury\\" style of music (Soft Machine, Caravan and others) that was coming out of England at the time. In 1974, saxophonist Thomas Scott joined the group. Although Scott came from a classical and big-band jazz background, he also had an affinity for Soft Machine and other British progressive rock groups like Gentle Giant. After a succession of drummers, Stuart Abramowitz joined on drums in 1975, but left in July 1976, along with guitarist Zentner. The remaining trio decided to continue without a guitarist and drummer, and started exploring improvisation. In late 1976 they found an \\"adventurous\\" drummer Paul Sears, who not only relieved the other members from shared percussion duties, but also, according to Scott, \\"open[ed] the Muffins up.\\" With its membership now stable, The Muffins as a quartet began exploring \\"a unique sound in an instrumental setting\\", mixing improvisation with composed pieces. They drew on several styles, including the Canterbury scene and the experimental sound of the English avant-rock group Henry Cow. Henry Cow had a big impact on the band ‚Äì Newhouse said that \\"Living in the Heart of the Beast\\" from their album In Praise of Learning \\"had a tremendous influence on me.\\" During late 1975 and early 1976 the Muffins made a number of studio and home demos, but did not release them. Many, however, were later released on an album Chronometers by Cuneiform Records in 1993. But the price for putting \\"the joy of creation over commercial concerns\\" made it difficult for the band to fit into the local Maryland/Virginia/D.C. music scene. Reaction to their performances was often indifferent, but they did slowly start to build up a \\"small-but-rabid cult following\\". In 1977 The Muffins moved to a new house in Rockville, Maryland, which they converted into a recording studio. They also established their own independent record label, Random Radar Records to release their own music and that of other \\"like-minded locals\\". In 1978 The Muffins released their first official album, Manna/Mirage, which received college radio airplay and generally \\"positive press\\". The New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock called the album an American approach to the style of Henry Cow, and Chris Cutler and Fred Frith of Henry Cow apparently \\"liked it a lot\\". After Henry Cow disbanded in August 1978, Frith moved to New York City and later performed with The Muffins in Washington, D.C.. In November 1979 Frith recorded with them as his backing band in Tom Scott's Rockville studio for his 1980 solo album, Gravity. He also produced and played on their next album, <185> in September 1980, which, Scott said, \\"[gave] us some new and interesting sounds, [and] a bit of credibility and international recognition that we were missing.\\" But after the lukewarm reaction <185> received, The Muffins decided to split up and go their own ways. Swann went on to play with the D.C.-based new wave band Urban Verbs, and Sears formed a progressive rock band, Chainsaw Jazz. Newhouse went on a European tour with Frith's new band Skeleton Crew as well as begin a second career as a school teacher, and Scott ran a recording studio. Reunion In the early 1990s The Muffins got back together briefly to play at a private party, and a recorded extract from their performance appeared on a 1995 Cuneiform Records compilation, Unsettled Scores. In 1998, realising that there was still a demand for their music, Newhouse, Swann, Scott and Sears decided to officially reform The Muffins. Cuneiform Records had already re-issued all their old albums on CDs, and released a collection of unreleased tracks on Open City, and their early studio and home demos on Chronometers. The band assembled at Sears's house and jammed and recorded a track for a new Cuneiform Records sampler, Unsettled Scores, where Cuneiform artists performed each other's music. Newhouse said \\"The chemistry was unbelievable. It was as if we had never stopped playing.\\" They went on to record a new album, Bandwidth, followed two years later by another album, Double Negative. In 2002 The Muffins played at a progressive rock showcase at Orion Sound Studios in Baltimore, and the event was filmed and later released by the band on DVD as Live at Orion in 2003. The Muffins also returned to performing live, including at the Villa Celimontana Jazz Festival in Rome in 2000, the Knitting Factory in New York City in 2001, Progday in North Carolina in 2001, and 2002 (introduced by legendary music impresario Giorgio Gomelsky), NEARfest in Pennsylvania in 2005, and the \\"Rock in Opposition\\" festival in France in 2009.  2016 Break up In April 2016, Sears announced that \\"The Muffins are no more\\". However, he indicated that the four members will continue to work in various duo and trio combos for the foreseeable future. Additionally he stated that both recent and archival material will continue to see release by the quartet. Name In 1973, soon after the band, at the time unnamed, had moved into the large farmhouse in Gaithersburg, Maryland, a friend arrived with a tray of blueberry muffins as a housewarming gift and shouted \\"The muffins are here!\\" Sounding like they were being introduced, the band adopted the name \\"The Muffins\\".

The average Proxim drug store is , similar to typical size of a Brunet or Unipharm location. All Proxim stores are owned by independent pharmacists that comply with Proxim's business rules and practices. Proxim's private brand is called \\"Atoma\\" and the company also has its loyalty card program. There are close to 270 drug stores in Eastern Canada that carry the Proxim name. History On August 2004, two companies - Groupe Essaim and Gestion Sant√© Services Obonsoins Inc - regrouped to form Groupe PharmEssor. The three pharmacy chains affected by this merger - Essaim, Obonsoins and Sant√© Services - were initially kept separate and intact by PharmEssor. However on February 2006, PharmEssor consolidated all of its operations under a single banner, Proxim, hence eliminating the previous banners. The name \\"Proxim\\" was inspired from the word \\"proximity\\" to describe the group's great accessibility to pharmaceutical cares. One year after the creation of Proxim, the Proximed banner was created on February 2007. Thus, an estimate of 31 selected locations operate today under the name Proximed. On July 1, 2008, McKesson Canada acquired Proxim. On September 2017, McKesson Canada completed its acquisition of Uniprix which would be headed by the same president who oversees the Proxim chain. Proxim and Uniprix have since remained separate chains of McKesson, much the same way that competitors Jean Coutu and Brunet both live on within the ownership of Metro Inc..

Other local names given to Paederus dermatitis include spider-lick, whiplash dermatitis, and Nairobi fly dermatitis. Rove beetles do not bite or sting but cause skin irritations and blisters when accidentally brushed or crushed against the skin provoking them to release their coelemic fluid which contains a strong blistering chemical. The active agent in the coelemic fluid is commonly referred to as pederin, although depending on the beetle species it may be one of several similar molecules including pederone and pseudopederin. \\"Blister beetle dermatitis,\\" a term more properly used for the different dermatitis caused by cantharidin from blister beetles, is also sometimes used to describe paederus dermatitis caused by rove beetles. Diagnosis and treatment Paederus rove beetles, showing size Once pederin is on the skin from the initial beetle contact, it may also be spread elsewhere on the skin. \\"Kissing\\" or \\"mirror-image\\" lesions where two skin areas come in contact (for example, the elbow flexure) are often seen. Washing the hands and skin with soap and water is strongly recommended, if contact with a rove beetle has occurred. Initial skin contact with pederin shows no immediate result. Within 12‚Äì36 hours, however, a reddish rash (erythema) appears, which develops into blisters. Irritation, including crusting and scaling, may last from two to three weeks. The pederin may unconsciously be transmitted to other parts of the body such as the eye and genitals after the initial contact. Conjunctivitis which is commonly known as Nairobi eye in eastern Africa occurs when the eyes are affected. One study reported best results with a treatment regimen that combined topical steroids with oral antihistamines(first day) and antibiotics. The authors hypothesized that antibiotics were helpful because of the possible contamination of skin by pederin-producing bacteria. Location and species Three different genera of rove beetles, all members of the same subtribe Paederina, can cause paederus dermatitis: Paederus, Paederidus, and Megalopaederus. This irritant is called pederin and is highly toxic, more potent than cobra venom. In different parts of the world, different species of rove beetle cause Paederus dermatitis: * Paederus melampus, also known as the Manipal bug or MIT Police, occurs in the Indian state of Karnataka. (Manipal is the name of a university town.) In a 2007 article titled 'Paederus Dermatitis', two dermatologists from Sri Devaraj Medical College in Karnataka identified the Manipal bug as Paederus melampus. They are also sometimes called \\"blister beetle\\", although rove beetles such as P. melampus are in a different family (Staphylinidae) than the blister beetle family Meloidae. * Paederus brasilensis, also called \\"El podo,\\" causes dermatitis in South America. There is also a Venezuelan species, Paederus columbinus. * Paederus fuscipes is probably the major agent that causes linear dermatitis in northern Iran. Whereas this disease is a rural difficulty in the south, mainly in villages or small towns, it is an urban problem in northern provinces along the Caspian Sea shore. *Paederus australis is responsible for outbreaks of dermatitis in Queensland and the Northern Territory, and Paederus cruenticollis for outbreaks in southern New South Wales. * Nairobi fly: Paederus crebrepunctatus and Paederus sabaeus both cause dermatitis in Central and East Africa. Paederus dermatitis has also been reported from Nigeria, France, Okinawa, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, India (Perumbavoor, Kerala), Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka and Ethiopia .

In 1901, it was redesignated as the 46th Punjab Infantry. Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was again changed to 46th Punjabis.

Later that year, it moved to Egypt but was not engaged in any fighting. In 1922, the 46th Punjabis were grouped with the 30th, 31st and 33rd Punjabis, and the 9th Bhopal Infantry to form the 16th Punjab Regiment.

Driving to the site of the new natural park through a lonely wilderness, Rebecca asks Tommy to stop the car so that she can relieve herself at the side of the road. Meantime, Tommy leaves the car and is struck and killed suddenly by a passing vehicle. Rebecca and Tommy's parents are stricken with grief. Rebecca wants to use new scientific advancements to have Tommy cloned and thereby bring him back to life. She offers to be impregnated using Tommy's DNA. Though Tommy's mother objects, his father agrees to give Rebecca Tommy's cell material, but urges her to think through her decision carefully before proceeding. Rebecca, however, continues and conceives Tommy's clone in her womb. She visits original Tommy's grave while pregnant with his clone before giving birth by Caesarean section. Tommy is now raised as Rebecca's son, and the two have a close relationship. Rebecca presents to him a pleo, an artificial living animal created using new biotechnology. Tommy and his playmates observe a neighbourhood girl and try to determine if she has a \\"copy smell\\" as the girl is a clone. The neighbourhood mothers display prejudice against \\"copies\\", expecting Rebecca to not let Tommy associate with them. Rebecca, though horrified, agrees in order not to isolate her son. Eventually rumours about Tommy spread, and Tommy is forced to celebrate his birthday alone with his mother, his playmates all being barred from attending by their mothers. Rebecca moves to a more remote location with Tommy. Tommy begins to ask questions about his father, wanting to know how his father died. He buries the pleo his mother gave him for his birthday while out playing with his friend. His mother finds out and gives him back the pleo, which is now no longer working. Years later, Tommy has grown as old as his original was when he died. As a result, he starts to manifest certain personality traits and interests of the original Tommy (such as his interests in biology). He is now the adult son of still-youthful Rebecca. When Tommy brings a girlfriend, Monica, home to stay with them Rebecca behaves jealously, to both Tommy's and Monica's bewilderment. Tommy struggles with what appears to be sexual tension between himself and his mother. The original Tommy's mother, now an old woman, arrives unexpectedly and stares silently at Tommy, who feels he recognizes the stranger. Frightened and frustrated by Rebecca's lack of explanation, Tommy lashes out at Rebecca, ignoring Monica, who quickly departs. An angry Tommy demands answers from his mother, Rebecca, who gives him original Tommy's old laptop with pictures of himself and his real mother and father (the former he met earlier). Tommy, out of confusion and sexual tension, initiates sex with Rebecca. From the blood on her hand, it is implied he took her virginity in the process. The next day Tommy packs his things, then addresses Rebecca by her first name (and not as \\"Mom\\") and thanks her for the life he's had and then leaves. The pregnant Rebecca, from the film's first scene, is carrying Tommy's(the clone Tommy's) child.

It is the South Korean version of American Nickelodeon. The channel is currently owned by SBS ViacomCBS, a joint venture of SBS Medianet and ViacomCBS Networks EMEAA. History Background Nickelodeon originals on generalist channels In South Korea, some of original series from Nickelodeon, like Rugrats, Rocket Power, The Wild Thornberrys, SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer, were shown on what is now EBS1 (operated by public-service broadcaster EBS). Jimmy Neutron was broadcast on MBC. A localisation of Nick Jr.'s Blue's Clues was shown on KBS2 (of public-sector broadcaster KBS). The Korean version of those series were produced by (or for) the broadcasters themselves, but none of them had a Nickelodeon-branded block. Nickelodeon block on JEI TV JEI TV (a specialty TV channel owned by JEI Corporation), after making a deal with Viacom, ran a Nickelodeon programming block for years. It started with TV programmes that were not shown on the generalist terrestrial channels. But later, they aired their own Korean dub of what were shown on EBS. Those alternative dubs were produced by Arirang TV Media (a subsidiary of Arirang TV). SkyLife carries Nickelodeon Southeast Asia DTH satellite television provider SkyLife carried the Southeast Asian version of Nickelodeon from 2003 to 2006. A negotiation between SkyLife and On-Media to extend carriage deal was failed, so SkyLife choose Nickelodeon Southeast Asia to replace Tooniverse (then owned by On- Media) on the platform. Test transmission began in January that year, before the formal launch in March.https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD‚à£=sec&sid1;=105&oid;=029&aid;=0000012440 In 2005, as SkyLife and Sony Pictures Television International reached a deal to launch a South Korean version of Animax, it was announced that Nickelodeon Southeast Asia would be removed from the platform in 2006.https://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD‚à£=sec&sid1;=105&oid;=029&aid;=0000123288 SkyLife did not carry the new South Korean version of Nickelodeon until 2014. Launch and afterwards Test broadcasts of a dedicated South Korean version of Nickelodeon began on August 1, 2005, before the formal launch in late 2005. This was a result of a deal between On-Media (then owned by Orion Group) and MTV Networks Asia. The channel was initially branded as Nick, and was exclusively available on cable TV providers. A Nickelodeon-branded programming block was also launched on On-Media's Tooniverse around that time. In November 2008, the channel became a subsidiary of C&M; Communication, along with MTV, when On-Media sold a percentage of its shares in On Music Network (which later became MTV Networks Korea). But a Nickelodeon block on Tooniverse continued to go. The channel was officially renamed Nickelodeon in 2010, using the new logo that unveiled months ago in the United States. In September 2011, SBS, a commercial broadcaster, became the official South Korean partner of VIMN, acquiring shares in MTV Networks Korea from previous South Korean owners and renaming the joint venture SBS Viacom. With this, Nickelodeon became a part of SBS. Programming Currently, Nickelodeon South Korea doesn't program live-action, and preschool series, it was replaced by Korean Variety shows, and more acquired animated series.

This exclusive grant of jurisdiction was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in Lockerty v. Philips (1943). . From March 2, 1942 to May 27, 1943, the chief judge of the Emergency Court of Appeals was Frederick M. Vinson, who was also serving as a judge of the District of Columbia Circuit, and who would eventually serve as Chief Justice of the United States.Harold M. Stephens, \\"The Chief Justice\\", 32 ABA Journal 387 (1946). The Court consisted of three or more judges designated by the Chief Justice from the judges of the United States district courts and Courts of Appeals. The Court was vested with jurisdiction and powers of a district court to hear appeals filed within thirty days against denials of protests by the Price Administrator and with exclusive jurisdiction to set aside regulations, orders, or price schedules, in whole or in part, or to remand the proceeding, but the court was tightly constrained in its treatment of regulations. Decisions of the Court could be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.

Plot An epidemic begins to spread throughout the globe, causing humankind to lose their sensory perceptions one by one. The story focuses on two people: Susan, one of a team of epidemiologists who are trying to find the causes of the disease, and Michael, a chef who works at a busy restaurant located next to Susan's flat. The two meet and get to know each other as the epidemic progresses, a relationship which soon turns to love. Humans begin to lose their senses one at a time. Each loss is preceded by an outburst of an intense feeling or urge. First, people begin suffering uncontrollable bouts of crying and this is soon followed by the loss of their sense of smell. An outbreak of irrational panic and anxiety, closely followed by a bout of frenzied gluttony, precedes the loss of the sense of taste. The film depicts people trying to adapt to each loss and trying to carry on living as best they can, rediscovering their remaining senses as they do so. Michael and his co-workers do their best to cook food for people who cannot smell nor taste. The loss of hearing comes next and is accompanied by an outbreak of extreme anger and rage. Michael experiences it first and is verbally abusive at Susan who flees in fear, losing her own hearing shortly afterwards. Despite her knowledge that it was the disease that caused the outburst, Susan cannot face Michael again. People struggle to adjust and to go on living. One day, every person on Earth suddenly experiences a feeling of joyful euphoria. Susan realizes she both forgives and still loves Michael and rushes to his job. The two find each other and embrace just as they, and the rest of the world, become blind.

Scenes were shot in various locations around Glasgow, Mexico City and Kenya. The film premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Reception Reviews for Perfect Sense have been mixed. Rotten Tomatoes has the film ranked at 57%. Tirdad Derakhshani of the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote in his review, \\"The film loses its charm with annoying sequences that have a narrator explain to us 'The Meaning of it All' and then tell us \\"What Really Matters\\" in life: Love. Love. Love.\\"; and Stephen Holden of The New York Times defined it as \\"a solemn sci-fi parable set in present-day Glasgow, whose deepening sense of foreboding is sustained by the enigmatic, pseudo-biblical reflections of an unseen narrator.\\" Mark Holcomb of The Village Voice said the film \\"beautifully captures the ache and counterintuitive thrill of 'the days as we know them, the world as we imagine the world' fading away by degrees‚Äîjust don't be surprised if you find yourself longing for a contagion-spawned zombie bloodbath to counter the shambling lyricism.\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Alison Willmore gave a more positive appraisal: \\"Each deprivation is preceded by a flurry of emotion that leads to the film's most vivid sequences\\". The film opened at 59 cinemas on its domestic release grossing ¬£21,675 for the weekend 7‚Äì9 October 2011.

As a Jaeger, he was stationed on the Eastern Front. He was commissioned as an officer and transferred regiments during May 1916. In August 1916, he transferred to aviation duty to begin pilot training. In January 1917, he was posted as a pilot to Flieger-Abteilung (Artillerie)280 for artillery direction duties. He requested transfer to a fighter squadron, and was sent to Jagdstaffel 26 on 18 March. On 22 April, he moved to Jagdstaffel 16.

Life He belonged to a clerical family living in the neighbourhood of Kettering and Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. He was educated first at Strixton in Northamptonshire, and was admitted a sizar of Clare Hall, Cambridge, on 16 May 1661, graduated B.A. in 1664, and M.A. in 1668. After acting as curate at Isham in Northamptonshire, he was presented on 21 October 1668 to become vicar of the village of Stantonbury in Buckinghamshire (then virtually deserted, having no vicarage, and he may really have been chaplain to Sir John Wittewronge); he left for the rectory of Water Stratford in the same county on 28 January 1674, presented by Viscountess Baltinglass, the daughter by his first marriage of Sir Peter Temple, 2nd Baronet. Under the influence of James Wrexham, a puritan preacher at Haversham, formerly vicar of Kimble Magna and of Woburn, Mason's thoughts turned to the prospect of the millennium, and he constantly suffered from pains in the head. He was sensitive to noise, and retired to an empty house, where even the sound of his own footsteps and his low voice when he prayed caused him pain. He was liable to vivid and terrifying dreams, and subject to visual hallucination. His wife died in February 1687; in 1690 he preached a sermon on the parable of the ten virgins, an attempt to interpret apocalyptic passages of scripture in the light of recent events. The sermon, repeated in other places, made some stir, and was published in the following year. About the same time he ceased to administer the sacrament in his church, and preached on no other subject than that of the personal reign of Christ on earth, which he announced as about to begin in Water Stratford. His teaching attracted some believers, to whom he expounded an extreme form of predestination doctrine. An encampment of his followers was formed on the plot of ground south of the village, called the 'Holy Ground,' where a rough life in common was lived. Noisy meetings took place in barns and cottages, and dancing and singing was kept up day and night in the parsonage. Mason described to a crowd from a window in his house on Sunday, 22 April 1694, a vision of the Saviour, which he had experienced, he said, on Easter Monday, 16 April. From that time he used no more prayers, with the exception of the last clause of the Lord's Prayer, but announced that his work was accomplished, as the reign on earth had already begun. He died of a quinsy in the following month, and was buried in the church of Water Stratford on 22 May 1694. The belief in the coming millennium, and in the immortality of their prophet, was firmly rooted in the minds of his followers; and some refused to credit his death. The succeeding rector, Isaac Rushworth, had the body exhumed, and exhibited to the crowd, but many remained unconvinced, and had finally to be ejected from the 'Holy Ground.' Meetings in a house in the village continued for sixteen years afterwards. Works Mason was one of the earliest writers of hymns (instead of metrical psalms) used in congregational worship, influenced in style by George Herbert. Some of his lines were known to Alexander Pope and John Wesley, and Isaac Watts borrowed freely from them. Mason wrote more than 30 hymns, several of which are found in early 18th- century collections, and some of which were later adapted. Ralph Vaughan Williams adapted an English folk tune for Mason's How shall I sing that majesty for the English Hymnal, and in this form Mason's hymn remains in use in Anglican church music, though now usually sung to the modern tune Coe Fen. His published works include: * 'Funeral Sermon for Mrs. Clare Wittewronge,' London, 1671. * 'Spiritual Songs, or Songs of Praise,' London, 1683, 1685 (with a sacred poem on Dives and Lazarus), 1692, 1701, 1704 (8th edit.), 1708 (10th edit.), 1718 (11th edit.), 1725, 1750 (14th edit.); Booking, 1760 (?); London, 1760 (15th edit.); London, 1761 (16th edit.), 1859.

Family The parish register of Water Stratford records the baptisms of four sons and one daughter of John Mason and Mary his wife between 1677 and 1684. John (born 1677) became a dissenting minister at Daventry, Northamptonshire, at Dunmow, Essex, and at Spaldwick, Huntingdonshire, successively. He died at Spaldwick in 1723, and was father of clergyman John Mason (1706‚Äì63). William (born October 1681) was B.A. of King's College, Cambridge, in 1704, instituted to the vicarage of Mentmore-with-Ledburn, Buckinghamshire, on 23 December 1706, and was also rector of Bonsall, Derbyshire, 1736‚Äì39. He died on 29 March 1744, and was buried at Mentmore. An eldest daughter, Martha, was born at Stantonbury. The Victorian clergyman and hymn-writer John Mason Neale (1818‚Äì66) was a distant descendant and was named after his forefather.

At the start of World War I, he was already an experienced combat pilot. Early life On 23 September 1886 in Napoli,Franks 2000, p. 159. Giovanni Sabelli was born into a wealthy family. He studied engineering in New York. Sabelli was a pilot even before World War I, having learned to fly at Brooklands, England in 1912. He was awarded his pilot's certificate by the Royal Aero Club on 30 January 1912. During the First Balkan War, he volunteered to fly combat for the Bulgarians against the Turks.Varriale 2009, pp. 92-93. Indeed, he was reputed to be one of the organizers of the air effort versus the Ottoman Empire. Flying career Sabelli volunteered for military service when Italy finally entered World War I. He was a reserve sotto-tenente in the Engineering Corps. Although already a licensed pilot and a combat veteran, he had to pass new flying examinations to fly for his country; he passed both basic and advanced military licenses for Aviatiks in August 1915. After being assigned on 30 August, he flew familiarization flights with the Adriatic Defense Flight before being sent to France to train on Nieuport 11s in mid-October 1915. He returned to Italy to fly combat for a while, being posted on 1 February 1916 to 2a Squadriglia Caccia, but without scoring any aerial victories, but winning a Silver Medal of Military Valor. While assigned here, he also served temporary duty as a Nieuport test pilot at Malpensa between 29 May and 2 July 1915. On 9 September 1916, he was promoted to tenente. He was also transferred in September. His next assignment was command of a Nieuport Defence Section (later to become 85a Squadriglia) in Albania.Franks 2000, pp. 80-81. Being eager to score victories, he wished to return to the fighting in Italy; he mentioned this to Francesco Baracca. On 23 March 1917, Baracca alerted Sabelli that his return to Italy was imminent. When the orders came through in April, Sabelli managed a return surface journey from Albania to Italy in only 22 hours. He rejoined his old unit, now denoted as 71a Squadriglia. He would spend only a few days there. On 9 May 1917, he was assigned to 91a Squadriglia at the request of Baracca, who was amassing a squadron of the best Italian fighter pilots, although he did not physically join it until 23 June. Sabelli had an insignia of a ladder painted on his Spad. In company with Michele Allasia, Sabelli scored his first victory on 10 August 1917, shooting down a Hansa-Brandenburg C.I trailing leader's streamers. On 6 September, Sabelli launched such an impetuous attack on a Hansa-Brandenburg C.I that he nearly collided with Barraca; the Austro-Hungarian plane crashlanded with the observer dead and the pilot wounded, for Sabelli's second triumph. On 17 September, he singlehandedly shot down another C.I. On 23 September, his best friend Ferruccio Ranza joined him in killing an Austro-Hungarian crew from Flik 35. On 29 September, he finished his string of five, joining Giorgio Pessi and Cosimo Rizzotto in killing another Austro-Hungarian air crew. He was awarded another Silver Medal. Death in action On 25 October 1917, he was flying as a wingman to Pier Piccio near the Battle of Caporetto when Piccio attacked an enemy two-seater. Piccio's guns jammed, and Sabelli took his place as the shooter. An enemy patrol surprised Sabelli from behind and shot him down trailing smoke. Sabelli's body was never found. Ferruccio Ranza adopted Sabelli's ladder insignia, having it painted on his own Spad VII in remembrance of his friend.

Early life and family background Sanday was born in Woolton, Lancashire, the third and youngest son of Samuel Sanday, a corn merchant, and his first wife Annie Gertrude (n√©e Stock). His uncle was the theologian the Reverend William Sanday (1843‚Äì1920), who was the Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at Christ Church, Oxford. On 26 February 1902 Sanday was commissioned as a second lieutenant in The Duke of Edinburgh's Own Edinburgh Royal Garrison Artillery, a unit of the Militia. He was promoted to lieutenant on 7 February 1903, but resigned his commission a year later, on 2 February 1904. In 1905 he married Mary Brodrick. World War I Following the outbreak of the First World War Sanday learned to fly, being granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 1295 on 2 June 1915 after soloing a Maurice Farman biplane at the Military School at Brooklands. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on probation in the Royal Flying Corps the same day at the relatively advanced age of 32, and following further training was confirmed in his rank, and then appointed a flying officer on 7 August. He was then posted to No. 2 Squadron to fly the B.E.2c two-seater. He gained his first aerial victory on 11 October when, in conjunction with two other aircraft, he and his observer Second Lieutenant Ellison, forced down a German Albatros two-seater at Noyelles-l√®s-Vermelles and captured the crew. On 8 December he was appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain, and following an artillery spotting mission on 1 January 1916 was awarded the Military Cross. His citation read: :Second Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) William Douglas Stock Sanday, Royal Flying Corps, Special Reserve. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and skill near Hulluch on 1 January 1916. He went out in a very high wind to observe the fire of a battery, and, owing to the clouds, was forced to fly at a height of between . Although continually subjected to very heavy rifle fire from the German trenches, he enabled our battery to obtain several direct hits.\\" He was promoted to lieutenant on 7 January 1916, backdated to 1 December 1915, but was badly injured in a crash two days later on 9 January, finally returning to duty later in the year to serve as a flight commander in No. 70 Squadron, flying a Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter two-seater. During July 1916 No. 70 Squadron carried out long-distance reconnaissance missions, and also acted as escort to the Martinsyde G.100 bombers of No. 27 Squadron, with which they shared the airfield at Fienvillers. Sanday was promoted to captain on 1 August, and on the evening on 6 August, he led a patrol which encountered a formation of ten German bomber aircraft near Bapaume. The British attacked, and fought the Germans all the way back to their own aerodrome, compelling them to land with their bombs still loaded. Sanday also shared in the forcing down of two Albatros Type C reconnaissance aircraft at Gouzeaucourt the same evening. A month later, on 6 September, Sanday was leading three aircraft in a reconnaissance of Cambrai and Busigny when they were attacked by enemy aircraft from Kampfstaffel 1. Sanday and Lieutenant Bernard Beanlands shared in the destruction of one aircraft, a Roland C.II over √âlincourt, killing the pilot Wilhelm Fahlbusch and observer Hans Rosencrantz, and the others were driven off. On 20 October 1916 Sanday was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in recognition of his service with No. 70 Squadron. His citation read: :Captain William Douglas Stock Sanday, MC. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and skill. He has led over 35 patrols with great gallantry. On one occasion a machine of his formation was attacked, but he charged and brought down the enemy machine in flames. He has destroyed at least four enemy machines.\\" The next day, 21 October, Sanday was appointed a squadron commander with the acting rank of major, and following the death in action of Major D. H. Harvey- Kelly, Officer Commanding No. 19 Squadron, on 29 April 1917, Sanday was appointed to command. Flying a Spad VII single-seat fighter, he gained his fifth and final victory on 13 July, destroying a German reconnaissance aircraft over Lille. He finally left No. 19 Squadron on 19 March 1918, and on 21 March was appointed a wing commander with the acting rank of lieutenant colonel. He was again appointed an acting-lieutenant colonel when appointed an air attach√© and posted to the British Embassy at Madrid on 2 May 1919. On 1 August Sanday was granted a permanent commission in the RAF with the rank of major, but this was cancelled on 23 September, and he relinquished his commission owing to \\"ill-health contracted on active service\\" on 30 December 1919, but was granted the rank of lieutenant colonel. Post-war career Sanday then joined his father and brothers as partners in the family firm of Sanday and Company, which his father had founded in the 1880s. During World War I it had become the largest grain export company operating in the United States, and served as the purchasing agent for the British government. By the end of 1923, when the partnership was dissolved, it had offices in London, Liverpool and Hull in England, Antwerp in Belgium, Karachi and Bombay in India, Buenos Aires and Rosario in Argentina, and New York, USA. Soon afterwards, in February 1924, Sanday, then resident in Sloane Street, London, was declared bankrupt.

Early and family life Harvey was born in Elgin County, Ontario on October 1, 1863, to William Harvey, Liberal Member of Parliament for Elgin East from 1872‚Äì1874, and Sophronia (n√©e) Mack. A Quaker, he married Nora Lousie Palmerin in Ontario in 1893 . Together they had one son, Alan Burnside Harvey, on April 22, 1899. Alan became a Rhodes Scholar, a lawyer, Queen's Counsel, Registrar of the Supreme Court of Canada, and editor of Tremeear's Annotated Criminal Code, Canada.https://openlibrary.org/b/OL6478047M/Tremeear%27s_Annotated_Criminal_code__Canada.http://www.scc- csc.gc.ca/court-cour/administration/index-eng.asp Career Early career He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1886 and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Toronto in 1888. He was admitted to the Ontario Bar the following year and to the Northwest Territories Bar, the predecessor to the Law Society of Alberta, in 1893.http://www.albertasource.ca/lawcases/criminal/conscriptionstandoff/conscriptionstandoff_people_harvey.htm Harvey began his career in Calgary, Alberta, at the firm of Harvey and McCarthy. In 1896 he was Registrar of Land Titles for Southern Alberta before his appointment as the Deputy Attorney General of the Northwest Territories in 1900, requiring him to move to Regina, Assiniboia. His first judicial appointment came on June 27, 1904, when he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories and stationed in Macleod, Alberta, where a new courthouse had been built that year. With the creation of the province in 1905, he moved back to Calgary, and with the creation of the Supreme Court of Alberta in 1907 to which Harvey was appointed on September 16, 1907, he moved to Edmonton.http://www.albertacourts.ab.ca/ca/publication/mcclung/index.htm Chief Justice of Alberta Alongside Harvey, two other judges from the Northwest Territories Court made the transition to the Alberta Court: David Lynch Scott and Arthur Sifton. The latter was appointed the first Chief Justice of Alberta. When Sifton became the Premier of the province in 1910, Harvey was elevated to the position of Chief Justice of Alberta by letters patent issued October 12, 1910. It is important to recognize that when the new Supreme Court of Alberta was formed, it comprised a trial division and an appellate division (essentially, brother justices of the Supreme Court sitting en banc with a quorum of three). Harvey supported an independent appellate court designed only to hear appeals. The Judicature Act enacted these changes in 1919, and it was proclaimed in 1921. The proper way to have done this would have been to abolish the old Supreme Court and create two new courts: one for trials, another solely for appeals. However, due to \\"slipshod and inartistic\\" drafting, the enacting statute merely created an independent appeal court without abolishing the old Supreme Court of Alberta. Although Harvey expected to become the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division and thus Chief Justice of Alberta, his judicial appointments had all been made by a Liberal Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier who had been in office from 1896-1911. By the time the two courts were separated in 1919, Conservative Prime Minister Arthur Meighen was in office. Instead of Harvey, Meighen appointed the conservative Scott by federal letters patent dated September 15, 1921. Much to Harvey's dismay, he became the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Trial Division. Harvey applied via reference to the Supreme Court of Canada in the case cited as Reference re Chief Justice of Alberta1922, 64 S.C.R. 135 for a declaration that he, not Scott, was the Chief Justice of Alberta. By a four to two majority, the Supreme Court agreed with Harvey that he held the highest judicial office in Alberta. Although Scott had declined to make an appearance before the Supreme Court, he appealed the decision to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.[1923] 4 D.L.R. 647 Lord Atkinson delivered the decision for the Committee in 1923, overturning the Supreme Court and finding in favour of Scott. Harvey continued to hold ill will, to the extent that at the first hearing convened by the appeal division, Harvey walked into the courtroom with Scott, told everyone he was the true Chief Justice, and then left Scott to preside. Scott's victory was nevertheless short lived as Scott died less than a year after the Judicial Committee's decision. Harvey was then appointed to Scott's position as Chief Justice of Alberta on August 27, 1924, by Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. He held this position until his death on September 9, 1949. Conscription Crisis Harvey played a key role in the Conscription Stand Off of 1918, part of the larger Conscription Crisis of 1917 during World War I. The federal government passed the Military Service Act in 1917, introducing conscription in Canada. However, it contained many exceptions for classes of people such as farmers. In 1918, the shortage of men was dire, and the Canadian Cabinet issued an order-in-council rescinding those exemptions. Norman Earl Lewis was conscripted and hired lawyer and future Prime Minister R. B. Bennett to apply for a writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of Alberta. The hearing before the Court was presided by then Chief Justice Harvey along with four justices on June 21 and 22, 1918. The Court held that since the exemptions had been passed by Parliament, it was not constitutional for a mere order-in-council to remove those exemptions. Harvey was the lone dissenting voice.Re Lewis (1918), 41 D.L.R. 1 (Alta. S.C.A.D.). This was quite problematic for the government as within two weeks, over 20 other applications for habeas corpus had been made. However, rather than produce the conscripts before the Court, the Canadian military was ordered by the highest-ranking military official in Canada and supported by the federal government to ignore the ruling. The Court issued a writ of attachment against Lieutenant-Colonel Moore, the commanding officer at Sarcee Barracks in Calgary, for failure to comply with the order to produce the conscripts. However, the sheriff on his way to arrest the officer was met by military resistance, specifically newly set up machine guns around the headquarters. Harvey viewed these circumstances as being an affront to the jurisdiction of the Courts to declare laws unconstitutional as he wrote: \\"This seems to me that the military authorities and the executive government of Canada have set at defiance the highest Court in this province.\\" Indeed, military officers produced in court an order in council that ordered the conscripts in question to \\"be dealt with in all respects as provided by the [earlier] orders in council notwithstanding the judgment and notwithstanding any judgment or any order that may be made by any Court.\\" On July 12, 1918, Harvey issued an order to have the military explain its actions before the Court or the Court would employ the sheriff and all the able bodied men in the jurisdiction to seize the conscripts by force.Re Norton, [1918] 2 W.W.R. 865. Eventually, a compromise was reached at Calgary City Hall whereby the military command in Alberta would notify the sheriff within 24 hours before the men were required to leave Alberta for eastern Canada.http://www.albertasource.ca/lawcases/criminal/conscriptionstandoff/conscriptionstandoff.htm A similar Ontario case reached the Supreme Court of Canada the following week, which upheld the order-in-council as being constitutionally valid on July 19, 1918.Re Grey (1918), 57 S.C.R. 150, 42 D.L.R. 1.

Place in history House converted to Official Residence Harvey purchased three lots in the Glenora district of Edmonton in 1914 which he kept until 1946. He cleared and fenced the land and built a tea house on it. In the morning, he would walk from his nearby house to the land to work in his garden, where he had prized gladioli. This land would later house the official residence for Alberta's Lieutenant Governors from 1966 until 2000. The current official residence remains in the area.

The manor house Buildings near the manor house Panorama of Rothamsted Research, Rothamsted Manor The Centenary building at Rothamsted Research, Rothamsted Manor, finished in 2003  History  The first recorded mention of Rothamsted is in 1212, when Richard de Merston owned lands there. In 1221, a house with a chapel and garden are referred to in a land grant. By 1292 Rothamsted had passed to the Nowell family, passing to the Cresseys by 1355, and to the Bardolphs by 1525. By this time there was a substantial manor house, with at least 16 rooms. In 1623 Edmund Bardolph sold Rothamsted to Anne Wittewronge. The Wittewronges were calvinists who had fled religious persecution in Ghent in 1564, and had founded a brewery in London. In the 17th century, Sir John Wittewronge, Anne's son, gave the house its Dutch style. The manor remained with the Wittewronge family until 1763, when Thomas Wittewronge died and the manor passed to his cousin John Bennet. He in turn left the manor to John Bennet Lawes, the son of his sister. In 1843, Sir John Bennet Lawes, the son of the earlier John Bennet Lawes, founded the Rothamsted Experimental Station, an agricultural research station, on the grounds of the manor. In 1931, his descendants decided to sell the estate, and after a successful public appeal, the Experimental Station was able to finance the purchase of the estate in 1934. In 1938 the Harpenden Urban District Council purchased the portion of the estate now known as Rothamsted Park from the Experimental Station, in order to provide playing fields and to preserve an important open space. The remainder of the estate is still used by Rothamsted Research, as the Rothamsted Experimental Station is now known. The manor house used to serve as accommodation for staff, but now functions predominately as a function venue.

They were united by a common language, strong ties of kinship and survived as skilled hunter‚Äìfisher‚Äìgatherers in family groups as a clan of the Worimi people. Country The Gringai lived round the Williams River, Barrington tops, Dungog, Barrington and Gloucester area and traded with the Paterson River Aboriginals The centre of their territory is on the land where the modern town of Dungog (perhaps \\"clear hills\\" in the Gringai dialect). Lies. History Two people of the Gringai are known by that name as a result of their arrest and subsequent trials. Wong-ko-bi-kan (Jackey) and Charley were both arrested within a year or so of each other in the 1830s. He was judged guilty nonetheless and sentenced to be transported to Tasmania for manslaughter after spearing a John Flynn on 3 April 1834. Flynn died soon after. Flynn had been a member of an armed troop of 9 settlers who went to the aborigines' camp at the Williams River at dawn to arrest some of them for culling sheep on their land. Wong-ko-bi-kan could, in another perspective, be said to have been defending the native camp from armed intruders. Wong-ko-bi-kan's case elicited some sympathy among the presiding judge and several observers, for the way in which the settlers had provocatively approached the native camp. Wong-ko-bi-kan died in his Tasmanian prison soon after, in October of that year. Another Gringai, known only as Charley, in May 1835, soon after the incident with Wong-ko-bi- kan, was arrested and, in August of that year, deemed responsible for the death of 5 convict shepherds working for Robert Mackenzie, later premier of Queensland, at rawden Vale 26 miles west of Gloucester. Though generally understood by Europeans as an act of warfare, the trial interpreter, Lancelot Threlkeld, in whom he had confided stated that Charley had acted after an Englishman had stolen a tribal talisman, called a muramai, and that the victims cohabited with a native woman, to whom the sacred object was shown. For this reason he implemented tribal law after a decision had been taken to that end by the elders. After his sentence he was brought back to Dungog and hung publicly as a warning to other Gringai. Local historian Michael Williams comments that, \\"Charley, ... was both an enforcer of one law and the victim of the enforcement of another set of laws.\\" One late story, recounted in 1922 in the Wingham Chronicle, suggests that a raiding party set out to enforce the verdict by hunting other Gringai, managing to round some up and push them all over a cliff at Barrington. Syphilis contracted from convicts, and other introduced diseases, took their toll. In 1847 alone, 30 Gringai children died of measles. Ceremonial life Key rites in the ceremonial life of the Gringai and related tribes, such as the keeparra, were described by Walter John Enright and R.H. Mathews in the late 19th century who managed to obtain permission to view and records them from the last remnants of the tribe. One of the Gringai Bora rings used in the initiation is reported to have been at Gresford A karabari was reported as having been performed on the occasion of the appearance of a comet in the sky in 1845/1846.

Kungoni is located in Mua, a village in the Dedza district, about 60 km from Salima. Kungoni is both easily accessible, being about two hours drive on bitumen from Lilongwe and three from Blantyre. Kungoni sits a little above the lake plain, with views to the lake in one direction and the African Rift Valley escarpment in the other. The site is landscaped and planted as a botanic garden with a variety of tropical trees and shrubs. Overview The Kungoni Centre was established by the White Father Claude Boucher Chisale with the intention of giving the local carvers training in a variety of artistic forms with the intention of improving local incomes. Besides the carvings, the Kungoni Centre has also developed a culture sector which includes the Chamare Museum, the research centre, local traditional dancing troupe and cultural courses. The centre employs over 120 carvers and is just setting up a new project called Kumbewu (The Seed). Kumbewu will offer skill training for women and serve as a site for various information sessions including Aids education, agricultural diversification, money management and more. The Mua Mission Mua Mission. The Mua Mission was founded by the White Fathers in 1902 when the buildings of the first big mission house were built and which still stand today. The first church was finished in 1905 and opened at Christmas. The church which is used today was established in 1971 on the same ground and a lot of things of the old church have been adopted. The Kungoni Centre has been created by Father Claude Boucher Chisale in 1976, after Father Boucher already worked with artists in Nsipe. Originally it was just set up as a project of helping the local artists but the cultural part developed. Carving Centre The Carving Centre. The Carvings are the essential and the core activity of the Kungoni Centre. In the beginning Father Boucher founded the Carving Centre to teach the local artists new techniques. Today the Carving Centre is used by the experienced, established carvers to teach the young and emerging artist. The artworks are sold to tourists or shops everywhere in the country with a special view on a fair price for the carvers so they can support their families. In 2009 the art gallery was opened to give carvers and the public a better sense of the carving history. The gallery documents, the thirty years of work performed in the community and the advancement of the themes and craftsmanship of the pieces. The Kungoni carvings are that popular, that it is even possible to find some in the Vatican museum and in the Buckingham Palace and in Churches and private collections in Africa, Europe, and North America. Cultural offerings Chamare Museum The Chamare Museum provides the visitor with an introduction to the richness of the Chewa, Ngoni and Yao cultures of central and southern Malawi, as well as a little on the Batwa people, the original and now vanished inhabitants of Malawi. The Museum has three rooms containing photographs, text panels, and displays of objects from the three cultures. There is also some coverage of the early history of missions in the Mua area. The museum also displays Nyau masks. Nyau or Gule wamkulu is the ‚Äògreat dance‚Äô of the Nyau secret societies of the Chewa. Gule wamkulu was declared a ‚ÄòMasterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity‚Äô by UNESCO in 2005. Kungoni provides one of the best places in Malawi to learn some of the stories of Gule wamkulu. Chamare Museum also provides detailed information on the rituals and rights of passage for the Chewa, Ngoni, and Yao people. It also chronicles, the history of the White Fathers mission work in Malawi dating back to 1902. Included in the collection are the many years of field work and the gathering of cultural material and is the most extensive display for explaining to Malawians and visitors the cultural history of the three main tribal groups. Courses The Centre offers cultural courses. This courses combine the knowledge of Father Boucher, who has been a resident of Malawi for forty years, and his European view on the things. The cultural course offers Ngo's and faith based aid workers an orientation and inside into Malawian priorities and local realities. The course hopes to focus outsiders sensitively and effectively deliver their programs. Kafukufuku, the Research Centre The Kungoni Centre includes its own research centre, which archives huge amounts of information about the tribes, such as photographs, videos, books, and notices. There is general access to the Kafukufuku. Dances One thing that is difficult to be seen for tourists in Malawi are the traditional dances even though they are an important part of the country's culture. The Kungoni Centre records, describes and performs these dances and it is even possible to take part. Kumbewu The Project Kumbewu supports local women and helps them in gaining financial independence. They create decorative jewelry and useful accessories made out of natural materials (seeds, plants) which are sold at the Centre. The money they earn represents important additional income for the family and leads to an improved life situation. Above this the Kumbewu site offers courses dealing with topics of local concerns (Health, food, and agriculture). Most important Kumbewu is a place for solidarity and exchanging of the ideas between women.

Biography He was born in Castellamonte (in what is now the province of Turin, then in the Duchy of Savoy). His father Carlo became chief architect of Duke Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy in 1615. After graduating in law in the University of Turin and continuing his studies in Rome, Amedeo begun to work alongside his father, whose works later he continued thanks to his significant talent in urban planning and architecture. In 1646 he continued works at the Ducal (now Royal) Palace in Turin, finishing (1658) the facade and the central body flanked by two raised ones, and the relative connection with the castle square. Later Amedeo was commissioned to create a new plan of for the city's expansions, after the one led by his father in 1620. As in the latter's, he kept the original Roman's centuriation, but also kept the oblique course of the \\"Borgo Po\\" (modern Via Po) leading to the then only existing bridge on the Po River to Chieri. In the same streets, he added porticoes and terraces forming an uninterrupted, 1,250 m-long path from the Royal Palace to the Po. The new street was opened in 1674. He also designed the Piazza Carlo Emanuele II, connected to Via Po by a new street, what is now Via Accademia Albertina. However, as works dragged on most of Castellamonte's designs were not followed exactly, like in the Piazza Carlo Emanuele II which did not receive an octagonal plan as in his design. Castellamonte was also entrusted the works of the Reggia di Venaria (Charles Emmanuel's II new large hunting residence, begun in 1658) and the Cavallerizza Reale (Royal Stables), built from the late 17th century and continued, among the others, by Filippo Juvarra and Benedetto Alfieri. He also continued and completed his father's works at the Castello del Valentino and intervened in the churches of San Salvario and San Francesco di Paola, the Castle of Rivoli and (according to some sources) the Villa della Regina. In 1646 he designed the church of Sant'Elena at Villafranca d'Asti followed in 1654 by the church of Santi Bernardino e Brigida at Lucenta and, finally, the Chapel of the Shroud in Turin, which later was totally modified by Guarino Guarini. He also built numerous fortifications and stage-settings for court celebrations, and worked in private noble palaces such as Palazzo Lascaris. He did various works for Princess Luisa Cristina of Savoy, sister of Charles Emmanuel II.

Early history The regiment was raised on 22 December 1846 at Kangra as the 2nd Regiment of Infantry The Frontier Brigade by Major JWV Stephen. It was composed mostly of Dogras, with some Pathans and Gurkhas, which prompted its title of 'Hill Corps'. In 1847, it was designated 2nd (or Hill) Regiment of Sikh Local Infantry, becoming the 2nd (or Hill) Regiment of Sikh Infantry in 1857. In 1851, the regiment became part of the Punjab Irregular Force, which later became famous as the Punjab Frontier Force or The Piffers. The Piffers consisted of five regiments of cavalry, eleven regiments of infantry and five batteries of artillery besides the Corps of Guides. Their mission was to maintain order on the Punjab Frontier; a task they performed with great aplomb. The 2nd Sikh Infantry took part in numerous frontier operations besides the Second Sikh War of 1848-49 and the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857-58, when it served in Hazara and Murree Hills. During the Second Afghan War of 1878-80, the regiment fought in the Battles of Ahmad Khel and Kandahar. In 1902, it went to British Somaliland to suppress the resistance movement led by the Somali religious leader Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan of the Dervish State. 52nd Sikhs (Frontier Force) Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 52nd Sikhs (Frontier Force). In 1914, the regiment's class composition was three companies of Dogras, two each of Pathans and Sikhs, and one of Punjabi Muslims. During First World War, the regiment joined the 18th Indian Division in Mesopotamia in 1917 and fought in the Battle of Sharqat. It moved to Kurdistan in 1919 and took part in suppressing the Iraqi Revolt of 1920. Indian Officers, 52nd Sikhs (Frontier Force), Kohat, 1905. With regimental flags, Kohat, 1905. Subsequent History After the First World War, the 52nd Sikhs were grouped with the 51st, 53rd and 54th Sikhs, and the two battalions of Guides Infantry to form the 12th Frontier Force Regiment in 1922. The 52nd Sikhs became 2nd Battalion (Sikhs) of the new regiment. During the Second World War, 2 FF fought with distinction in the Malayan Campaign, where its Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Edward Cumming, was awarded the Victoria Cross for outstanding valour. The battalion was captured by the Japanese after the British surrender at Singapore in February 1942. It was re-raised in 1946. In 1947, the Frontier Force Regiment was allotted to Pakistan Army. 2 FF was back in action in 1948, when it fought in the Kashmir War against India. In 1956, the Frontier Force Rifles and the Pathan Regiment were merged with the Frontier Force Regiment, and 2 FF was redesignated as 4 FF. During the Indo- Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion fought in the Sialkot Sector, while during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971, it fought with great courage in the Battle of Hilli in East Pakistan. For exceptional valour, Major Muhammad Akram and Major Shabbir Sharif were awarded the Nishan-i-Haider, Pakistan's highest gallantry award.Attiqur Rahman, Lt Gen M. (1980).

They are found throughout the Philippines and were used largely as trading ships up until the colonial era. The oldest known balangay are the Butuan boats, which have been carbon-dated to 320 AD and were recovered from several sites in Butuan, Agusan del Norte. Balangay were the first wooden watercraft excavated in Southeast Asia. Balangay are celebrated annually in the Balanghai Festival of Butuan City.BALANGHAI FESTIVAL - Commemorating the coming of the early settlers from Borneo and Celebes Names Balangay was one of the first native words the Europeans learned in the Philippines. When Antonio Pigafetta went ashore to parley with the ruler of Mazua, they sat together in a boat drawn up on shore which Pigafetta called a balangai or balanghai. This word appears as either balangay or barangay, with the same meaning, in all the major languages of the Philippines. Early colonial Spanish dictionaries make it clear that balangay and barangay were originally pronounced \\"ba-la-ngay\\" and \\"ba-ra-ngay\\", but due to centuries of Spanish influence, the modern barangay is pronounced \\"ba-rang- gay\\" in Filipino today (, instead of precolonial ). Pigafetta's alternate spelling with an H, balanghai, later gave rise to the neologism balanghay in the 1970s (with a new, slightly different pronunciation which Pigafetta did not intend). The term was also used by the Tagalog people to refer to the smallest discrete political units, which came to be the term used for native villages under the Spanish colonial period. citing The name of the boat was usually Hispanicized in Spanish and American records as barangayan (plural: barangayanes) to distinguish them from the political unit. Among the Ibanag people of Northern Luzon, balangay were known as barangay, a term sometimes extended to the crew. Large vessels were called biray or biwong. In the Visayas and Mindanao, there are multiple names for balangay-type boats, including bidok, biroko, baloto (not to be confused with the balutu), baroto, biray, or lapid. History Ibanag balangay (barangayanes) from the Cagayan River in Northern Luzon (c.1917) Illustration of an armed merchant biroko with tanja sails by Rafael Monle√≥n (1890) In the province of Cagayan in Northern Luzon, balangay were mainly used as cargo and fishing ships by the Ibanag people. They were predominantly used within the Cagayan River system, but were also sometimes used as coastal trade ships, reaching as far as the Ilocos Region. In Tagalog regions, the balangay or barangay differs from Visayan balangay in that it is constructed through the sewn-plank technique, rather than through dowels. In the Visayas and Mindanao islands, balangay were primarily inter-island trading ships, cargo transports, and warships. Large balangay (especially warships), including the Butuan boats, are commonly equipped with large double-outriggers which support paddling and fighting platforms, in which case, they can be generically referred to as paraw. Balangay warships, along with the larger karakoa, were regularly used for raiding (mangayaw) by Visayan warriors. It is believed that they may have been the \\"Pi-sho-ye\\" raiders described as regularly attacking Chinese settlements in the coast of Fujian in the 12th century AD. Marina Sutil Balangay boats viewed from the air. During the 18th to 19th centuries, balangay were also often used as warships for defending coastal villages from Moro and Dutch raiders during the Moro Wars, in conjunction with watchtowers (castillo, baluarte, or bantay) and other fortifications. The raiders were regularly attacking coastal settlements in Spanish-controlled areas and carrying off inhabitants to be sold as slaves in markets as far as Batavia and the Sultanate of Gowa. Defense fleets of balangay and vinta (known as the Marina Sutil, \\"Light Navy\\" or \\"Defense Navy\\") were first organized under Governor- General Jos√© Basco y Vargas in 1778. They were lightly armed but fast, which made them ideal for responding quickly to raider sightings and attacks. Notable leaders of these defense squadrons include Don Pedro Estevan, a principal of Tabaco, Albay; and Julian Bermejo, an Augustinian friar who commanded ten balangay and established an alarm system using a line of small forts in southern Cebu. They were responsible for several major naval victories against Moro raiders from the late 18th to the early 19th centuries. The most significant was the Battle of Tabogon Bay (modern Tabgon, Caramoan) in 1818, where the combined fleets of Estevan and Don Jose Blanco defeated around forty Moro warships led by Prince Nune, the son of a sultan from Mindanao. Nune escaped, but hundreds of Moro raiders died in the sea battle and around a thousand more were stranded and hunted down in the mountains of Caramoan. The 1818 victory led to increased usage of defense fleets and the reduction of Moro raids to only sporadic attacks on isolated fishermen or smaller villages until their eventual suppression in 1896.  Construction  Balangay were the first wooden watercraft excavated in Southeast Asia.Hontiveros, G. 2014. Balangay: Re-launching an Ancient Discovery Balangay were basically lashed-lug plank boats put together by joining the carved out planks edge to edge, using pins or dowels. The planks, which were made from a hardwood called doongon in the Philippines (Heritiera littoralis), were fastened together every 12 centimetres, also by hardwood pin measuring some 19 centimetres long, which were driven into holes on the edge of each plank. On the inner side of the boat the planks were provided, at regular intervals, with raised rectangular lugs, carved from the same plank, through which holes were bored diagonally from the sides to the surface.Hontiveros, G. 2004 Butuan of a Thousand Years. Rib like structures made of lengths of wood were then lashed against these lugs to provide a flexible bulkhead, to reinforce and literally sew the boat together. Cordage known as cabo negro (Arenga pinnata) was used for the purpose. The hull, measuring about 15 meters long and 4 meters wide, was ordinarily semicircular in cross section and with no marked keel. Provided with huge outriggers, the boat was propelled either by a sail or by paddling. The boats were finely manufactured without any blueprints and were taught to be made from one generation to another and uses a technique still used by boat makers of Sibutu Island in the Southern Philippines. Butuan boats Planks from one of the Butuan boats in the Butuan National Museum showing the holes on the edges where dowels were inserted Since the 10th century, Butuan appeared to have been in good relations with the Srivijaya. Being located on the coast of Mindanao, balangays were often docking at Butuan bay keeping good business between the local people of Butuan and traders from the neighboring empire and neighboring islands. Various goods, extending to the statue of Avalokite≈õvara and the Golden Tara of Butuan, were traded across Maritime Southeast Asia. The balangay boats were discovered in the late 1970s in Butuan City, Agusan del Norte. A total of nine wooden boats were accidentally found by locals searching for alluvial gold on land near the Masao River. The site was in Sitio Ambangan, Barrio Libertad within an older dried-up river channel, perhaps a former tributary of the Masao River.\\"Butuan: The First Kingdom.\\" Butuan City Historical and Cultural Foundation, 1990. Three of the nine balangays discovered have been excavated by the National Museum and are currently preserved. The first balangay or Butuan Boat One, was discovered in 1976 and is now displayed in Balangay Shrine Museum in Libertad, Butuan City. It was radiocarbon tested and was dated to 320 CE. The Butuan Boat Two was dated to 1250 CE, and is now located at the Maritime Hall of the National Museum in Manila. The Butuan Boat Five, excavated at Bancasi, Libertad in 1986, has been dated to 1215 CE and was transferred to the Butuan Regional Museum and is undergoing preservation. The six other boats, which are yet to be excavated, remain in their original waterlogged condition which is proven to be the best way to preserve the said artifacts. In 2012, National Museum archaeologists discovered what seems to be a massive balangay \\"mother boat\\", estimated to be 25 meters long, versus the average 15-meter length of the other balangays at the excavation site. The leader of the research team, Dr. Mary Jane Louise A. Bolunia, reported the treenails or wooden pegs that were used in the construction of the mother boat to be around 5 centimeters in diameter. As of June 2013, excavations of the find are still ongoing. The first wooden watercraft excavated in Southeast Asia, the balangay is only found in the Philippines where a flotilla of such prehistoric wooden boats exists. Nine specimens were discovered in 1976 in Butuan, Agusan Del Norte, Mindanao, and 3 have already been excavated. Declarations Balangays are among the many vessels present in Philippine mythology. The most famous vessels in mythology include Matan-ayon's sturdy Hulinday,Change Me Into A Chieftain: Resistance and Persistence in Upland Panay Island, Philippines, D. Gowey, Arizona State University Silungan Baltapa's expeditious ship, Agyu's flying Sarimbar, and Cacao's marketing psychopomp ship.  National Cultural Treasures  The balangays of Butuan was declared by President Corazon Aquino as National Cultural Treasures by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 86 on 9 March 1987 and the vicinity of excavation as archaeological reserves.  National Boat  In November 2015, the Balangay was declared as the National Boat of the Philippines by the House Committee on Revisions of Laws. The Balangay was chosen so that the \\"future generations of Filipinos will recognize the invaluable contribution of their forefathers in shaping the country's maritime tradition and in passing on the values of solidarity, harmony, determination, courage and bravery. House Bill 6366 declares the Balangay as the National Boat of the Philippines. The Balangay Voyage In 2009, the Kaya ng Pinoy Inc. that conquered Mount Everest in 2006 announced plans to re-construct a balangay boat, with the help of Sama-Bajau (Sama Dilaya) and other tribal members who retained the lashed-lug boat-building techniques which were mostly lost in other islands. The balangay's voyage traced the routes of the Filipino Ancestors during the waves of Austronesian settlement through Maritime Southeast Asia and the Pacific.The Balangay: Maritime Connectivity and Migration The special wood for construction came from the established traditional source in southern Philippines, specifically Tawi-Tawi. The team have pinpointed Sama-Bajau master boat builders, whose predecessors actually built such boats, and used traditional tools during the construction. The balangay was constructed at Manila Bay, at the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex. The Balangays, named Diwata ng Lahi, Masawa Hong Butuan, and Sama Tawi-Tawi,\\"'DIWATA NG LAHI' Finally Arrives in Butuan.\\" City Government of Butuan. www.butuan.gov.ph. n.d. Web. 13 Dec. 2014. navigated without the use of modern instruments, and only through the skills and traditional methods of the Filipino Sama people. They Journeyed from Manila Bay to the southern tip of Sulu, stopping off at numerous Philippine cities along the way to promote the project. The journey around the Philippine islands covered a distance of 2,108 nautical miles or 3,908 kilometers. The second leg of the voyage (2010-2011) saw the balangay boats navigate around South East Asia - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Thailand and up to the territorial waters of Vietnam before heading back to the Philippines. Balangay boat with gaff rigs in Manila Bay at sunset The balangay was navigated by the old method used by the ancient mariners ‚Äì steering by the Sun, the stars, the wind, cloud formations, wave patterns and bird migrations. Valdez and his team relied on the natural navigational instincts of the Badjao. Apart from the Badjao, Ivatan are also experts in using the boat. The organisers say that the voyage \\"aims to bring us back to the greatness of our ancestors and how colonialism robbed these away from us and produced the Filipino today\\". In 2019, the Balangay Voyage team announced two more balangay (Lahi ng Maharlika and Sultan sin Sulu) will set sail in 14 December 2019 from Palawan to Butuan, then to Mactan to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Mactan. The two boats will be temporarily renamed Raya Kolambu and Raya Siyagu.  Balangay Site Museum  The Balangay Site Museum also known as \\"Balanghai Shrine Museum\\" houses the balangays excavated on 320 AD. It is located at Sitio Ambangan, Barangay Libertad, Butuan City. It also displays the cultural materials such as human and animal remains, hunting goods, jewelries, coffins, pots and other items associated to the boat. The establishment of the shrine in 1979 was made possible by the donation of land from Felix A. Luna, a resident of the area. Balanghai Festival In Butuan, Agusan del Norte, the annual Balanghai Festival celebrates the settlement of Butuan via the balangay ships.

Thus, if we are considering a single random variable in isolation, its precision is the inverse of its variance: p=1/œÉ¬≤. Some particular statistical models define the term precision differently. One particular use of the precision matrix is in the context of Bayesian analysis of the multivariate normal distribution: for example, Bernardo & Smith prefer to parameterise the multivariate normal distribution in terms of the precision matrix, rather than the covariance matrix, because of certain simplifications that then arise.Bernardo, J. M. & Smith, A.F.M. (2000) Bayesian Theory, Wiley For instance, if both the prior and the likelihood have Gaussian form, and the precision matrix of both of these exist (because their covariance matrix is full rank and thus invertible), then the precision matrix of the posterior will simply be the sum of the precision matrices of the prior and the likelihood. As the inverse of a Hermitian matrix, the precision matrix of real-valued random variables, if it exists, is positive definite and symmetrical. Another reason the precision matrix may be useful is that if two dimensions i and j of a multivariate normal are conditionally independent, then the ij and ji elements of the precision matrix are 0. This means that precision matrices tend to be sparse when many of the dimensions are conditionally independent, which can lead to computational efficiencies when working with them. It also means that precision matrices are closely related to the idea of partial correlation. History The term precision in this sense (‚Äúmensura praecisionis observationum‚Äù) first appeared in the works of Gauss (1809) ‚ÄúTheoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientium‚Äù (page 212). Gauss's definition differs from the modern one by a factor of \\\\scriptstyle\\\\sqrt2. He writes, for the density function of a normal random variable with precision h, : \\\\varphi\\\\Delta = \\\\frac h {\\\\sqrt \\\\pi}\\\\, e^{-hh\\\\Delta\\\\Delta} .

He is the author of three self-published books on the Catholic community in Mangalore, India. Early life and education Michael Lobo was born in Mangalore, India to Maisie Lobo (n√©e Fernandes) and Camillo Lobo, both of Mangalorean Catholic descent. He belongs to the Bejai branch of the Lobo- Prabhu clan, that has its roots in the Makhale suburb of Kulshekar, Mangalore. Lobo's father was a British army soldier who served during World War II. He studied at Montfort High School in Yercaud, Tamil Nadu, and graduated from St. Aloysius College. In 1975, he was one of the \\"National-A\\" level chess players in the country, which put him among India's top 20 chess players. In 1982, he obtained a PhD from IISc Bangalore, with a degree in Applied Mathematics. His doctoral thesis on Transonic Aerodynamics earned him the \\"Young Scientist Award\\" from the Indian National Science Academy (INSA). In 1982, he earned a PhD in aerodynamics mathematics from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, receiving the 1983 Young Scientist Award from Indian National Science Academy. Career Academics (1984‚Äì1993) In 1984, Lobo moved to England where he entered the Cranfield Institute of Technology on a Commonwealth Scholarship, eventually becoming a faculty member. While employed there, Lobo authored papers on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), including Time Marching ‚Äì A Step-by-step Guide to a Flow Solver (Ashgate Press, 1997). In his spare time he compiled a 1000-page dictionary of English words derived from Classical Greek and wrote a book on the origins of popular Rock'n'roll songs, but neither was published. He returned to Mangalore in 1993, because of \\"personal crises\\". Genealogy (from 1994 onwards) Lobo's interest in genealogy began in 1992, upon his discovery of an antique baptismal register belonging to the period 1810‚Äì80 at Milagres Church. While browsing through this register, he discovered the birth record of his great-grandfather, Anthony Peter Lobo. The record traced his parentage to Lawrence Lobo (a Munsiff and eminent member of the 19th century Mangalorean Catholic community) and Ignatia Tellis. He then subsequently scoured the register to locate the birth records of the other children of Lawrence and Ignatia. This register became the nucleus of his first genealogical project‚Äîa biographical compilation of all the descendants of Lawrence Lobo (through both male and female lines of descent). From late 1992 to late 1993, Lobo began working during his spare time on this project, and by the end of 1993, had completed the first draft of his genealogical work on the Lobo-Prabhus of Makhale and their related families. After the end of his contract at the Cranfield Institute of Technology, rather than renew his contract or pursue a contract elsewhere, Lobo decided to give up his mathematical career and pursue a personal project to write the history and genealogy of the Mangalorean Catholic families. He moved to Mangalore in 1994, and settled down in his family manor \\"Camelot Residency\\" on Bijai church road. During 1994‚Äì95, Lobo was involved, on a full-time basis, on a research project on the history and genealogy of the Catholic community of Mangalore. He copied almost every 19th century baptismal, marriage and death record he could locate at Rosario Cathedral and Milagres Church, cataloguing them according to surnames. Lobo initially experienced difficulties in the project since only the baptismal registers were maintained in reasonably good condition, while large sections of the marriage and death registers were missing, and it was not feasible to build the genealogy of any family on the basis of baptismal records alone. However, he had access to other sources of information on the major families, such as the Vas-Naiks of Falnir (the first published work on the genealogy of a Mangalorean Catholic family), Mascarenhas-Prabhus of Falnir, and the Fernandes-Prabhus of Tonse. There were also unpublished genealogies of various other families, most of them written by Mangalorean genealogists Rao Saheb Francis Xavier Lobo and Marian Saldanha. The project took shape as A Genealogical Encyclopaedia of Mangalorean Catholic Families. Lobo also conducted and still conducts personal interviews with many Mangalorean Catholics, who have settled in Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and various other parts of India and abroad. This work is expected to be about 8 to 10 volumes and as of March 2011, had already crossed 7000 pages. Although his work is unfinished, Lobo has self-published three offshoots on the subject: Mangaloreans Worldwide ‚Äì An International Directory (1999), Distinguished Mangalorean Catholics 1800‚Äì2000 ‚Äì A Historico-Biographical Survey of the Mangalorean Catholic Community (2000), and The Mangalorean Catholic Community ‚Äì A Professional History / Directory (2002). His encyclopaedia covers more than a thousand families and is being continually updated with names and records of new families. He claims that the Mangalorean Catholic community has the distinction of being the only community in the world to possess its own genealogical encyclopaedia. Lobo has also authored two books on music entitled A Hundred Pages of Classics, Opera and Popular Instrumental Pieces ‚Äì A Thousand Pages of Songs with Historical Notes and its companion edition Popular Music ‚Äì A Historical and Thematic Analysis, both of which were released in 2011.

Tuel, Illustrated history of the war in Italy with its seat at Ceva, in what is now a part of Piedmont. Establishment The marquisate was created in 1125 at the death of Boniface del Vasto, of the Aleramici family, his son Anselmo becoming the first marquis of the newly formed state. He subsequently acquired a part of the province Clavesana from his brother Ugo, but at Anselmo's death Ceva (assigned to his son Guglielmo) was again divided from Clavesana, which went to the other son Bonifacio. Borders of the Marquisate of Ceva in 1499 The marquisate was partitioned in several petty states between Guglielmos, and its fortunes began to decline. Marquis Giorgio Nano had thus to submit to the increasingly powerful commune of Asti, which had previously helped marquis Guglielmo II in extending his territories during the 12th century. Further weakened by internal strife, the marquisate submitted to Amadeus V of Savoy on 22 February 1313. During the wars between the marquisates of Saluzzo, Monteferrat and the Angevines, Ceva swore loyalty to John II of Montferrat. In 1352 it was conquered by the Visconti of Milan, who were pushed back by the marquis in 1356. The fragmented marquisate was eventually acquired by the French Duke of Orleans, and ultimately Savoy in 1531.Thomas Wright, A Comprehensive Dictionary of the World See also *Ceva Grimaldi family References Category:Former countries on the Italian Peninsula Category:States and territories established in 1125 Category:Marquisates of Italy ","title":"Marquisate of Ceva"},{"id":"24467488","text":"Achaea orthogramma is a species of moth of the family Erebidae.

Although the name suggests it contains squab (young domestic pigeon), in fact it contains mutton and apples. The pie was eaten around the world in the 1900s, though outside South West England it generally did contain pigeon. Origins Although it is not known exactly where squab pie was first made, it is clear that it was somewhere in South West England. There are references to it originating in Gloucestershire, Devon and Cornwall. Although it appears that squab pie did originally contain pigeons, mutton and apples have been used as a substitute since at least 1737 using a recipe that has remained in cookbooks for years afterwards. This misnaming has meant that the pie is considered to be a surprise. Squab is described as tender with a mild berry flavour, and so it is possible that the combination of mutton and apples created a similar flavour. There is also a theory that the name squab pie is short for \\"squabble pie\\", as it stems from a disagreement over whether to have a meat or apple pie. There are many variations to the squab pie in England, although it traditionally includes mutton, it has come to mean a pie with many ingredients or a \\"scraps pie\\". Squab pie in Devon can be served with clotted cream. Alternatively, in America, it is cooked with squab, and is synonymous with pigeon pie. Recipe Squab pie is a mutton pie with a shortcrust pastry lid. It should be made with at least one layer of onions, followed by alternating layers of sliced apples and mutton chops. The mixture should be covered with water, though less than in some pies, covered with pastry and baked in the oven for about two hours. Variations Within the UK, the most common variation is to use lamb instead of mutton. Gloucester Squab pie did not require lamb and suggests any leftover meat could be used. Other ingredients can be included, for example Agatha Christie produced a variant which included hard-boiled eggs and another recipe took the concept of serving with clotted cream and adds cream to thicken. Outside of England, the concept of squab pie does exist, but in a more literal form actually containing squab. Known as Piccioni All'Inglese, one Italian chef explains that he is aware that the recipe does not match the traditional English version, but he \\"[does] not care a fig\\". In America, squab pie still uses squab. It was included in a \\"Cooking for profit\\" book in San Francisco, to make a pie using 18 squabs in a gravy. Reaction In 2009, less than 3% of British teenagers had tried the dish and it has been listed amongst the \\"at risk\\" British Classics. A prominent critic of squab pie was Charles Dickens' journal All the Year Round: Using its many ingredients definition, squab pie was used by Gallynipper as an analogy for New York City. This is a positive comparison, explaining that New York does \\"not smell bad... nor look uninviting\\" and that it is \\"a wonder and a success\\". Poetry Squab pie has been the subject of poetry. In \\"The Squab-Pie. A Devonshire Tale\\" published in 1827, John Taylor uses verse to tell of the captain of a ship in Plymouth who forgot to get meat for his trip. A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you. The ingredients are given in verse by a Cornishman from Bodmin, during William Sandys' 1846 tour around Cornwall. Sandys also includes a story of Christmas-time in Cornwall which includes the pie served with mashed potatoes and pilchards. In \\"Verses Occasioned by Ben Tyrrell's Mutton Pies\\", published in 1772, Thomas Warton also confirmed that the squab pie was mutton based and came from Cornwall. The Devon author, William Crossing, writing in 1911, discusses a short folk rhyme about squab pie: \\"Mutton, onions, apples and dough, Make a good pie as any I know.\\" He does not say, however, from where he heard it. In the song \\"Glorious Devon\\" written by Sir Edward German in 1905, several Devonshire dishes receive praise: \\"Squab pie, junket and cider brew, Richest cream of the cow, What 'ud Old England without 'em do?\\" Devil in Cornwall Another legend surrounding squab pie, along with the other unusual pies of Cornwall, is that they were the reason that the Devil never came to Cornwall. In his book Popular Romances of the West of England; or, The drolls, traditions, and superstitions of old Cornwall, a collection of Cornish traditions, Robert Hunt explains that the Devil crossed the River Tamar to Torpoint. The chapter, entitled \\"The Devil's Coits, etc.\\", reasons that the Devil discovered the Cornish would put anything in a pie and decided to leave before they took a fancy to a \\"devilly\\" pie, returning to Devon.

Early history The regiment was raised on 1 January 1847 at Ferozepur as the 3rd Regiment of Infantry The Frontier Brigade by Captain DF Winter. It was composed of Sikhs, Punjabi Muslims, Pathans, Dogras and Hindustanis. In 1847, it was designated 3rd Regiment of Sikh Local Infantry, becoming the 3rd Regiment of Sikh Infantry in 1857. In 1851, it became part of the Punjab Irregular Force, which later became famous as the Punjab Frontier Force or The Piffers. The Piffers consisted of five regiments of cavalry, eleven regiments of infantry and five batteries of artillery besides the Corps of Guides. Their mission was to maintain order on the Punjab Frontier; a task they performed with great aplomb. On the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny in 1857, the Hindustani Company was disbanded. In 1858 the 3rd Sikh Infantry took part in mopping up operations in North India. During the Second Afghan War of 1878-80, the regiment took part in the defence of Sherpur Cantonment and the Battle of Kandahar, while in 1897, it served in the Tirah Campaign.350px 53rd Sikhs (Frontier Force) Subsequent to the reforms brought about in the Indian Army by Lord Kitchener in 1903, the regiment's designation was changed to 53rd Sikhs (Frontier Force). In 1914, the regiment's class composition was four companies of Sikhs, two of Pathans, and one each of Punjabi Muslims and Dogras. During the First World War, the regiment served throughout with the 28th Indian Brigade. In 1915, it served in Egypt and Aden (Yemen), moving to Mesopotamia in December. Here, it fought with great gallantry in the bloody battles for the Relief of Kut al Amara on the Tigris Front in 1916-17, the capture of Baghdad and in operations north of Baghdad at Istabulat, Daur and Tikrit. In 1918, the regiment moved to Palestine and took part in the Battle of Megiddo, which led to the annihilation of Turkish Army in Palestine. It returned to India in 1920. Subsequent History After the First World War, the 53rd Sikhs were grouped with the 51st, 52nd and 54th Sikhs, and the two battalions of Guides Infantry to form the 12th Frontier Force Regiment in 1922. The 53rd Sikhs became 3rd Battalion (Sikhs) of the new regiment. For their excellent performance during the First World War, they were made a 'Royal' battalion in 1935. During the Second World War, 3/12 FF served with great distinction in the Italian East Africa, Sicily, Italy and Greece. In 1947, the Frontier Force Regiment was allotted to the Pakistan Army. In 1948, 3/12 FF fought in the Kashmir War against India. In 1956, the Frontier Force Rifles and the Pathan Regiment were merged with the Frontier Force Regiment, and 3/12 FF was redesignated as 5 FF. During the Indo-Pakistan War of 1965, the battalion greatly distinguished itself in the Battle of Khem Karan, while during the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 it served in Kashmir.Attiqur Rahman, Lt Gen M.

It is a theoretical alternative to the black hole concept from general relativity. The theoretical construct was created through the use of semiclassical gravity theory. A similar structure should also exist for the Einstein‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìDirac equations system, which is the (super) classical limit of quantum electrodynamics, and for the Einstein‚ÄìYang‚ÄìMills‚ÄìDirac system, which is the (super) classical limit of the standard model. A black star doesn't need to have an event horizon, and may or may not be a transitional phase between a collapsing star and a singularity. A black star is created when matter compresses at a rate significantly less than the free fall velocity of a hypothetical particle falling to the center of its star, because quantum processes create vacuum polarization, which creates a form of degeneracy pressure, preventing spacetime (and the particles held within it) from occupying the same space at the same time. This vacuum energy is theoretically unlimited, and if built up quickly enough, will stop gravitational collapse from creating a singularity. This may entail an ever-decreasing rate of collapse, leading to an infinite collapse time, or asymptotically approaching a radius bigger than zero. A black star with a radius slightly greater than the predicted event horizon for an equivalent-mass black hole will appear very dark, because almost all light produced will be drawn back to the star, and any escaping light will be severely gravitationally redshifted. It will appear almost exactly like a black hole. It will feature Hawking radiation, as virtual particle pairs created in its vicinity may still be split, with one particle escaping and the other being trapped. Additionally, it will create thermal Planckian radiation that will closely resemble the expected Hawking radiation of an equivalent black hole. The predicted interior of a black star will be composed of this strange state of spacetime, with each length in depth heading inward appearing the same as a black star of equivalent mass and radius with the overlayment stripped off. Temperatures increase with depth towards the center.

Both were historically part of Catton Park and together with Catton Hall form part of the Old Catton conservation area.  History Catton Hall By the 1770s, land had been purchased and developed as an estate for occasional residence with the building of Catton Hall by Charles Buckle, High Steward of Norwich in c1780.The building of Catton Hall Retrieved 10 November 2009 In 1788 the Catton Hall estate passed into the hands of Jeremiah Ives (1754-1820) - twice Mayor of Norwich. Shortly after acquiring the estate, Ives consulted Repton who accepted the commission to landscape the park. Despite further alterations over the next 150 years, it remained a country park until the outbreak of World War II. Open areas of the park were given over to arable farming and ploughed up. After the war much of the park was broken up and mostly sold for residential development. Subsequent years of farming left just the 'bare bones' of Repton's original design. However, in 2005 the local community began an ambitious plan for the restoration and regeneration of the park with the aid of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. This was achieved along with support from Natural England and the local councils. In October, 2007 the park was formally opened to the public by the Duke of Kent.Catton Park Retrieved 25 September 2009 Today, the park is managed by the Catton Park Trust with support from Broadland District Council, Norfolk County Council and the parish council.

Jeremiah Ives consulted him when he acquired the estate in 1788 and again in 1790. The main work was probably additional planting and landscaping. Other proposed alterations included a Ha- ha and a new entrance. Two of Repton's watercolours survive which show his improvements. At this stage he had not developed his 'before and after' technique found in his Red Books. Other work included the removal of trees to the south of the park to provide a view of the spire of Norwich Cathedral.Humphry Repton Retrieved 6 October 2009  Description  Wellingtonia Much of the park is open grassland sown with a mixture of grasses and wildflowers. There are notable specimen wellingtonia, cedar and ancient oaks scattered throughout the park. Mixed woodland containing oak, sweet chestnut, and yew make up much of the boundaries. Improvements in the early 21st century include new footpaths, fencing, pedestrian gates and tree planting.  Catton Hall  Catton hall is located on higher ground adjacent to the northern boundary. It was built by Charles Buckle as a country residence in c1780 and is listed with Historic England. It remained in private hands until 1948 when owner Desmond Buxton sold the hall and land to Norfolk County Council. The hall was used as a home for the elderly and was later sold and converted into apartments and remains closed to the public.  Location  Today, the park is surrounded by housing estates and roads.

He was the creator of the first animated films of the sub-Saharan Africa, also directing documentaries and fiction films. He was Head of Cinema Department at the Niamey University for 15 years. Moustapha Alassane directed, in 1962, two shorts inspired in traditional tales: Aoure and La Bague du roi Koda. Representing African culture (e.g. in Deela ou el Barka le conteur, 1969 and Shaki, 1973), Alassane also employed moral satire (F.V.V.A., femme, villa, voiture, argent, 1972), denouncing the thirst for power for ‚Äúnew wealth‚Äù in Africa. Social criticism and black humour are in almost all of his films. The frog was his favourite animal and protagonist of most of his animated films, because Alassane believed it is funnier to animate frogs rather than humans. His workshop was based in Tahoua. To work, Alassane used several materials, such as wood, metal or wire, glue, fabric or sponge. Numerous retrospectives of Alassane‚Äôs career have been made in several international film festivals. Moustapha Alassane was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007.

He was the last Head of State of the Khmer Republic, the regime overthrown by the Khmer Rouge in 1975. Sak Sutsakhan formed a pro-US force known as the \\"Khmer S√¢\\" (White Khmer).Haas, Cambodia, Pol Pot, and the United States: the Faustian pact (1991), page unknown. Early life Sutsakhan was born in Battambang. He was the cousin of Nuon Chea, who would later go on to be a prominent member of the Khmer Rouge. He studied at the Royal Military Academy and the French General Staff School in Paris; his subsequent career with the small Cambodian army, the Forces Arm√©es Royales Khmeres (FARK) resulted in his rapid promotion, and under the Sangkum regime of Prince Norodom Sihanouk he became the world's youngest Minister of Defence in 1957 at the age of 29. The Khmer Republic Following the Cambodian coup of 1970, in which Prince Norodom Sihanouk was deposed by General Lon Nol, Sutsakhan continued his career within the army, now renamed the Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK), and oversaw its substantial expansion in 1971‚Äì72. He served as Minister of Defence several times, was the commander of the FANK Special Forces, and had a good reputation amongst U.S. diplomats and military advisors as a competent senior officer, as well as a capable and non-corrupt politician.Shawcross, Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia (1979), p. 232. After the U.S. embassy staff and acting President Saukam Khoy departed Phnom Penh on April 12 during Operation Eagle Pull, a seven-member Supreme Committee, headed by Lieutenant-General Sak Sutsakhan, assumed the authority over the collapsing Republic. Sutsakhan took over the post of Head of State and chaired the Governing Council that attempted to negotiate a conditional ceasefire with the Khmer Rouge, who were besieging Phnom Penh. Sutsakhan remained in the capital until the communist forces entered it on April 17, escaping with his family on one of the last Khmer Air Force helicopters to leave the Olympic Stadium.Sutsakhan, Lt. Gen. S. The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse Washington DC: U.S. Army Center of Military History, 1987, p. 168. See also Part 1Part 2Part 3. Sutsakhan was married and had four children. Exile and the KPNLF Sutsakhan settled in the United States, and became an American citizen. After the Khmer Rouge had been expelled by Vietnamese forces in 1979, politician Son Sann and former FANK General Dien Del set up the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF), a non-communist and largely republican movement dedicated to expelling the regime installed by the Vietnamese (the People's Republic of Kampuchea). The KPNLF was initially a coalition of various disparate 'resistance' and even semi-bandit groups based in the refugee camps along the Thai-Cambodian border; however the recruitment of Sutsakhan, who arrived from the US in 1981, helped to lend considerable legitimacy to the cause.Corfield, J. A History of the Cambodian Non-Communist Resistance 1975-1983, Monash University, 1991 Sutsakhan became commander of the KPNLF's armed wing, the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF), and attempted to impose a centralized structure on its armed factions. In 1982 a formal political alliance, the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, was formed between the KPNLF, the FUNCINPEC royalists headed by Sihanouk and the remaining forces of the Khmer Rouge. After 1985 Sutsakhan was to meet with Son Sen of the Khmer Rouge and Prince Norodom Ranarridh, Sihanouk's son, who commanded FUNCINPEC's military arm, the Arm√©e Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS), to arrange military cooperation between the three movements. By 1985, Sutsakhan and Sann began to disagree on the conduct of the war, especially on the issue of cooperation with the royalist (ANS), which Sutsakhan favoured. The resulting split in the KPNLF hampered the operations of its armed forces: despite some initial successes in the northwest of Cambodia, the KPNLAF was shattered by a Vietnamese offensive in 1984-1985 and was largely restricted to guerrilla warfare after this point. After the Paris Peace Accords of 1991, Sutsakhan was to split from Son Sann and the KPNLF, and formed the Liberal Democratic Party. He died in Detroit on April 29, 1994. His corpse was cremated and his ashes were scattered in Lake Michigan. Publications In 1980, Sutsakhan published The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse, which remains a major source of information on the Cambodian Civil War. Available online at .

History  In the mid 1980s, VEB Mikromat in Dresden developed a program for DOS to design controlled feed axis systems and to perform hydraulic calculations. In 1993, ITI GmbH, founded by former Mikromat employees in 1990, introduced a simulation tool for Microsoft Windows designed for dynamic calculations of drive systems: ITI-SIM 1. With the release of ITI- SIM 2 in 1995, the software also allowed for fluid simulations. In 2002, the newly developed application SimulationX, based on the object-oriented description language Modelica, was introduced to the market. By the year 2007, ITI-SIM (then in version 3.8) had been completely replaced by SimulationX. Since the beginning of 2016, ITI belongs to the ESI Group https://www.esi- group.com/company/investors/news/acquisition-iti-gmbh-global-leader-realistic- simulation-mechatronic-and-multi-domain-systems and now operates under the name ESI ITI GmbH.  Modeling and Functionality  Simulation models are created on the basis of a discrete network approach. That means the system is broken down into logical parts which are linked through specific connections. These sub-systems are represented by preconfigured or custom model elements organized in domain-specific and custom model libraries. The sub-models are then parameterized and connected with each other. Models can be created either through the graphical user interface or by using Modelica command lines.  Libraries  alt= Model libraries can be obtained as modular packages from the software producer. There are various libraries available with basic models for the corresponding physical domains as well as libraries with advanced models for specific applications and industries. Depending on the objective, the user can choose from 1D, 2D and 3D model elements with respect to the modeling, simulation and parameterization requirements. Modelica-based third-party and custom-built libraries can also be integrated into SimulationX. SimulationX libraries include: *Signal blocks: General Signal Blocks, Signal Sources, Linear Signal Blocks, Non-Linear Signal Blocks, Time-Discrete Signal Blocks, Special Signal Blocks, Switches *Mechanics: Mechanics 1D (rotary, linear), Planar Mechanics, Multibody systems, CAD Import via STL *Power Transmission: Motors and Engines, Couplings and Clutches, Transmission Elements, Planetary Structures *Electrical Engineering and Electronics: Electronics (Analog), Magnetics, Electric Motors, Stepping Motors *Fluid Power and Thermodynamics: Hydraulics (pressure source, tank, volume, differential cylinder, throttle, valves, plunger cylinder, constant and variable), pneumatics (gases and mixtures), Thermal-Fluid (single phase with liquids and gases, two-phase with coolants, refrigerants, NIST, water, wet air, gas mixtures) *Torsional Vibration Analysis: Inertia, Torques, Dampers, Couplings, Gears, Sensors *Special: Subsea Library: Subsea Hydraulics, Subsea Electrics, Offshore Handling  Modelica  SimulationX supports the Modelica modeling language to simulate individually created, realistic (sub-)models.Modelica Newsletter 01/2013 Models of the Modelica Standard Library or the ones purely based on the Modelica language definition can be executed.  Interfaces  SimulationX provides open, comprehensive CAx-interfaces to external programs for different purposes and applications, e.g. CAE (VehicleSim (CarSim, BikeSim, TruckSim)), CAD (Solid Edge, Unigraphics / NX, SolidWorks, Creo Elements/Pro, Autodesk Inventor, CATIA V5), CAM, Computer-aided optimization (e.g. Isight, modeFRONTIER, Optimus, optiSLang, OptiY), FEA/FEM (Abaqus, Ansys, COMSOL Multiphysics, MSC Nastran), CFD. Co-Simulation provides a general interface which can be used to link SimulationX to CAE tools with predefined setups for particular realizations (MSC.Adams, SIMPACK, MATLAB/Simulink, Fluent, Cadmould etc.). The coupling ensures the data exchange between the tools and the simulation software. Tools for a holistic structural and system analysis (equilibrium computation, natural frequencies, vibration modes, input-output analysis) and for linking a simulation model to the databases are available. A COM interface allows communication between SimulationX and other Windows applications for user-defined batch runs, embedded simulation, parameter studies, or optimizations. Code-Export features support the generation of C source code for seamless model integration, Hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) applications and Rapid Control Prototyping, Functional Mock-up Virtual Machine. Throughout all stages of modern system design processes, engineers and scientists can work with a variety of seamlessly integrated tools. The connection of SimulationX to real-time testing and simulation platforms such as LabVIEW, NI VeriStand, dSPACE, ETAS LABCAR, and SCALE-RT heavily increases the productivity in the design cycle and shortens time-to-market of new products. SimulationX supports the creation and import of Functional Mock-up Units defined by the Functional Mock-up Interface standard (development started by the MODELISAR project). Standardized interfaces facilitate the platform-independent exchange of simulation models and increase the flexibility in the connection of external simulation tools and models. Industry usage SimulationX is used for designing, modeling and analyzing the dynamic behavior of complex mechatronic systems as well as for virtual tests in many industries, research and education including the automotive sector, railway and shipbuilding, heavy machinery and mining, power generation and building technology, aerospace and defense, mechanical engineering, medical engineering, oil and gas, precision instruments and home appliances as well as consumer electronics.

The play explores the link between author and viewer, one of Potter's major themes, and is referenced several times in his later work. The play's title is taken from the 1938 Al Bowlly song \\"I Double Dare You\\", which is featured in both the opening and closing credits. Synopsis Martin Ellis (Dobie) is a blocked screenwriter who invites Helen, an actress (Markham), to a hotel in central London to discuss an idea for a play he is writing with her in mind. As he waits for her to arrive he picks up the telephone in his room and considers calling an escort agency. Thinking better of it, he decides to call his wife instead. He goes to meet Helen at the hotel bar and they start discussing his project. He explains that the play he intends to write involves a meeting between a businessman and a call girl at a hotel; Martin's intention is to explore the tension this scenario would create by talking to Helen about how far she would go for the sake of her profession. As they discuss the play, Martin discovers that a businessman and an escort named Carol are sat at a nearby table and appear to be speaking lines from the as yet unwritten piece. Martin becomes anxious at what will eventually become of the girl, already knowing that the play will not have a happy resolution. As Helen becomes uncomfortable and is about to leave, Martin's agent Benn (Melia) arrives to make sure that the meeting is going as planned. Angry at having been set up for Martin to seduce her, Helen calls Ben a pimp, which leads him to reveal that Martin is actually in love with her. After Ben leaves, Helen informs Martin that there is no possibility of a romantic attachment happening between them and asks to collect her belongings from his room; all the while Martin remains fixated on the businessman and the call girl on the other table. When they head up to Martin's room, so do the characters who appear to have escaped from Martin's play. As Helen bids Martin goodnight he claims to hear shouting from next door: the businessman is in there with the escort girl and has become violent at her sexual taunting. Martin stands against the wall and describes the businessman raping and murdering her. When it is over he turns to face Helen on the bed, only to find that she has been sexually assaulted and strangled -- seemingly at his hand. There is a knock at the door. Martin answers it only to be confronted by the businessman, who it is revealed is actually a mild- mannered and married man concerned by the noise coming from Martin's room. Martin tells him to mind his own business and slams the door. He walks over to the bedside table, picks up the telephone and calls the escort agency. When there is no reply, he lies back on the bed next to Helen's body and weeps. Principal cast *Alan Dobie as Martin Ellis *Kika Markham as Helen/Carol *Malcolm Terris as Businessman *Joe Melia as Ben *John Hamill as Peter *Linda Beckett as the businessman's wife Production In 1974, Potter's father died, and this, coupled with a severe bout of psoriatic arthropathy, led to him developing writer's block. Having the bare bones of an idea about a meeting between a businessman and a prostitute for his next piece, Potter contacted producer Kenith Trodd to arrange a meeting with actress Kika Markham, hoping to cast her in one of his own television productions. The two met in a hotel at The Strand and began discussing their relative professions. Markham claims that much of the dialogue featured in the play was a faithful transcript of their meeting. According to Markham, early rehearsals were spent trying to \\"wring the giggles\\" out of the material; Potter's very specific stage directions appearing overwrought compared to the 'clipped-down' style of other writers. Having broken this barrier, the performers were able to explore the darker context of the play through close reading of the text and various theatrical exercises. As the production would be shot on location, director John Mackenzie was granted the opportunity of using film stock rather than video. Themes Double Dare explores the relationship between fact and fiction, as well as the connection between author and viewer. The doubling up of Helen and the call girl, and to a lesser extent the comparisons between Martin and the businessman, are \\"Potteresque\\" tropes that serve to challenge the audience's perspective on what they are seeing. Dialogue between Martin and Helen is often repeated verbatim in the fictional world of the businessman and the call girl (most notably the exchange about the automatic shoe polisher in the hallway outside Martin's room, which bookends Helen's arrival at the hotel and the escort heading to her client's room). Although containing very few of the non-naturalistic flourishes of his other plays, Double Dare does, however, contain one sequence where Potter deliberately breaks the artificial naturalism of the drama by having Martin question Helen if she would sleep with him if they were characters in a play before turning direct to camera and indicating an audience \\"somewhere out there\\". This question, and others like it, forms the basis of one of Potter's other major themes ‚Äì individual choice in the face of an omniscient author. While Martin assumes responsibility for the eventual fate of the call girl, even going so far as attempting to warn her of the danger she faces, he ultimately resigns himself to the view that the act of writing is nothing more than a form of precognition. Martin recites Dante Gabriel Rossetti's poem \\"Sudden Light\\" (c.1853-4) to Helen in an attempt to woo her, but emphasises the subtext that all things, even human relationships, are mapped out in advance by unseen forces. Broadcast and reception The play was originally intended to be part of a trilogy exploring an individual's choices (or rather, lack of them) in the face of an omniscient narrator; Double Dare was to form the first part, followed by Brimstone and Treacle, also produced for the Play for Today slot, and Where Adam Stood ‚Äî a free adaptation of Edmund Gosse's autobiographical book Father and Son (1907). The BBC's decision not to broadcast Brimstone caused some surprise from both Potter and Trodd, the latter assuming that if any of the trilogy would cause offence it would be Double Dare, citing its \\"ferocious\\" attitude towards women as a potential problem. When the play went out on BBC1 on 6 April 1976, it attracted very positive reviews stating that Potter was maturing as a playwright. Reviewing the play for The Guardian, Martin Amis praised the drama's build-up of tension, its Russian doll effect and commented that it forced him to \\"increase [my] nicotene intake.\\" The sex scenes between Markham and John Hamill, included as a flashback from another play, intended to show the lengths to which Helen will go in the pursuit of her craft, were considered to be among the strongest shown on British television up to that point. The play would not be repeated until 2005, when it was shown on BBC Four amongst a season of programming intended to mark the tenth anniversary of Potter's death. Proposed film adaptation When director Herbert Ross was preparing a film version of Pennies from Heaven for MGM, producer Rick McCallum drew his attention to Double Dare as a potential project to adapt for the cinema. Potter told editor Graham Fuller in Potter on Potter that he had written a movie adaptation that transferred the action to Los Angeles, and featured an English screenwriter whose experiences in Hollywood are 'doubled up' with those back home in England. Potter described this new version of the play as \\"more sexually disturbing\\" than the original, but after the box office failure of the movie version of Pennies from Heaven the project was shelved. Ross claims, however, that he held a read-through with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Intertextuality The central premise of Double Dare would be revisited in the serial Karaoke (1996), the first part of Potter's two last television works. Karaoke features a writer called Daniel Feeld (Albert Finney) who starts to hear lines from his latest screenplay coming from the mouths of total strangers and those closest to him. The centrepiece of the serial involves a sequence in a brasserie where Feeld, meeting with his producer (Anna Chancellor), overhears a young woman on the next table arguing with her boyfriend. Their conversation appears to consist of Daniel's dialogue and the young girl (\\"Sandra\\", played by Saffron Burrows) is being asked to have sex with one of her gangster boyfriend's business associates to broker a favour. The intercutting of the scene between Daniel and the girl's perspectives is largely identical to Double Dare, as is the suggestion that the girl will meet a horrible fate if Daniel does not intervene. A minor reference to Double Dare is the fact that Daniel's literary agent (Roy Hudd) is also called Ben. Double Dare is also a follow-on from an earlier Potter play, Follow the Yellow Brick Road (1972), which features an embittered, cuckolded actor ('Jack Black', played by Denholm Elliott) who believes himself to be an actor trapped in a television play. Unlike Double Dare, however, the central protagonist is able to subvert the narrative by challenging its anonymous author.

The 5th however had the distinction of black facings, while the remaining BLC regiments all had orange. A high turban was worn by the sowers of the regiment from 1825 until it was replaced by a peakless shako. At the time of the 1857 Rebellion the Indian troopers were wearing round forage caps, with white covers in hot weather. Disbandment In the course of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 all the eight Bengal Light Cavalry regiments were lost to mutiny or disbandment. The 5th BLC, numbering at the time 500 sowars (Indian troopers), was stationed at Peshwar when the rebellion broke out. Together with three regiments of Bengal Native Infantry, the 5th BLC were disarmed and disbanded on 15 May 1857 on suspicion that they were no longer to be trusted. The sowers laid down their weapons without resistance. Their British officers had retained confidence in the loyalty of their men and some threw their own swords on the pile of weapons.Surendra Nath Sen, page 332 \\"1857\\", Ministry of Information, Government of India Notes  References  *Kempton, C (1996).

Following the resignation of Sue Bradford, Clendon became a member of the House of Representatives on 2 November 2009. Personal life Clendon is of NgƒÅpuhi, Te Roroa and PƒÅkehƒÅ descent. He is a descendant of James Reddy Clendon, the United States Consul in New Zealand. He has a partner, Lindis, and one daughter Kaya. Political career Clendon joined the Green Party in 1990. In both the 1999 and 2005 elections, Clendon polled third in the seat of Waitakere, ranked 19th and 12th on the party list, respectively. Clendon was the co-convenor of the Green Party from 2001 to 2004. He did not contest the 2002 general election because the party's constitution bars co-convenors from standing for parliament. Along with MPs Russel Norman and N√°ndor T√°nczos, and former MP Mike Ward, Clendon contested the Green's male leadership role in 2005 after the unexpected death of co- leader Rod Donald, saying that it made sense to \\"appoint an out-of-Parliament leader, rather than stretch the sitting MPs even further.\\" Russel Norman won the leadership after a vote at a party AGM in June 2006. Clendon was elected as a Councillor for the Far North District in 2019. Member of Parliament In the 2008 general election Clendon was ranked tenth on the Green list and stood as a candidate in the Helensville electorate, coming third with 5.96% of the electorate vote. Following the resignation of list MP Sue Bradford, Clendon entered Parliament as he was next on the Green party list. He became a Member of Parliament on 2 November 2009 and delivered his maiden speech to Parliament on 17 November. A private member's bill in Clendon's name was drawn from the ballot in February 2010. The Smart Meters (Consumer Choice) Bill would require that domestic power users be advised on the options available for the use of smart meters in their homes. It was voted down by the Government later that year. In the , Clendon unsuccessfully contested the electorate but was re-elected as a list MP ranked eighth. In the , he stood in the electorate and was re-elected as a list MP ranked eleventh. He did not contest the 2015 Northland by-election, but was planning to stand in the seat again in the . On 7 August 2017, Clendon and fellow Green Party MP Kennedy Graham announced that they were planning to resign as Green Party candidates for the 2017 election, after revelations that Party co-leader Metiria Turei committed benefit and electoral fraud. Graham and Clendon stated that their resignations were due to the public positions she had taken regarding her offending, and her subsequent refusal to step down from her leadership role. The next day, both Clendon and Graham resigned from the Party caucus, after there were moves to remove them involuntarily. On 9 August 2017, Turei resigned as Co-Leader of the Party and as a list candidate for the 2017 election. Spokesperson roles Clendon was the Green Party's spokesperson on the Auckland Supercity, Commerce, Consumer Affairs, Corrections, ICT, Resource Management Act, Small Business, Tertiary Education, Tourism, Maori Affairs and Research Science and Technology.

He made his first appearance on 10 September 2009. The character of Romeo is Mitchell's third acting job and he began filming his scenes in May 2009. Romeo is described as being cheeky, funny and confident. His storylines have included his relationships with Annie Campbell and Indi Walker and the introduction of his sister and mother. Romeo and Mitchell have proven popular and Mitchell won \\"Most Popular New Male Talent\\" at the 2010 Logie Awards. On 4 November 2012, it was revealed that Mitchell had decided to leave Home and Away. Romeo made his last appearance on 3 April 2013, but made a brief cameo appearance in Indigo's dream on 23 October 2013. Casting The role of Romeo is Mitchell's third acting job, having previously appeared in Neighbours and H2O: Just Add Water. Mitchell was given the part after he moved to Sydney with no work. He said \\"I was applying for regular jobs and had a trial in the local bowling alley when my agent called me about the role, I went to the bathroom to take the call and he told me I had the job\\". Mitchell began filming his first scenes in May 2009. On 4 November 2012, it was reported that Mitchell had left Home and Away, along with Axle Whitehead (Liam Murphy). The actors had already filmed their final scenes, while their characters remained on-screen until 3 April 2013 but made a brief cameo appearance on 23 October 2013. Character development Characterisation Romeo is described as good looking and \\"cheeky, funny and gentlemanly\\". He knows how to \\"turn on the charm\\" and flirts with every woman he meets. Romeo is also \\"sharp as a tack\\" and can bite back. Mitchell describes his character as being \\"very good with the girls, but not in a sleazy way\\". \\"He gets a kick out of seeing a girl smile rather than getting her phone number\\". Mitchell also added that his character is different to him, he said \\"He's so confident and I can be quite shy, so it's liberating\\". Family In January 2010, Romeo's sister, Mink Carpenter (Matylda Buczko), was introduced. Mink, who was called Romeo's \\"mysterious sister\\", arrives in the Bay to see her brother after she is released from a youth detention center for an unknown crime. Mink is a surfer, like her brother, and is described as being \\"stroppy\\" and having \\"plenty of sass and street smarts\\". Despite the siblings being apart for several years, Mink is quick to defend her brother and she punches John Palmer (Shane Withington), when he insults Romeo. It is later revealed that Mink killed her and Romeo's abusive stepfather. Mink and Romeo have a heart-to-heart and she later decides to leave the bay. A few months later, Romeo's mother Jill Carpenter (Josephine Mitchell), arrives in the Bay. Jill is an alcoholic and even though Romeo loves her, he is humiliated by her actions and wants his mother to be normal. Romeo has turned into the adult in their relationship. Jill has used the life insurance money she received after the death of her husband to buy drink. Of her arrival, Mitchell said \\"She comes back to the Bay to try to re-establish her relationship with her son Romeo\\". The storyline between Romeo and Jill was character-driven, of this Mitchell said \\"Even though the underlying issue is the alcoholism it was very much the relationship between Romeo and his mother and how her relationship with others filters through the community\\". Relationship with Indi Walker Romeo begins dating Indi Walker (Samara Weaving) following his split from Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best). Mitchell hinted at a romance between the pair before Weaving returned to the screen again in June 2010. Mitchell said \\"They meet at school. There's an attraction, because Indi's a beautiful girl, but Romeo isn't looking for a girlfriend. He's still heartbroken over Annie\\". He added that Romeo and Indigo have a lot in common and that she goes out of her way to see that he is okay. The character's friendship begins to develop into something more and Weaving admitted that Indigo and Romeo were likely to face a \\"rocky road\\" before they eventually got together. Their first kiss comes as a surprise and Weaving said \\"It's quite funny because Indi is yelling at Romeo for reading into their friendship too much, and then he decides to just kiss her as she's half-way through telling him off!\\" Weaving said that the kiss is what Indigo has \\"always wanted ever since she saw him\\", so she forgets that she is angry with Romeo. However, Weaving explained that the pair would not get together quickly, saying \\"Indi responds well to the kiss, but there's definitely still some speed bumps pending in them getting together. Indi definitely thinks that this is going to be a relationship, whereas Romeo has his doubts about it.\\" In October 2010, Weaving revealed that Indi would confess a secret to Romeo. Indi is reluctant to take their relationship to the next level because of an unresolved issue from a previous relationship. She starts ignoring Romeo in a bid to avoid the problem, but she eventually tells him that her ex-boyfriend started dating her mother. Weaving said that Indi avoids Romeo because she has not got closure over her past relationship. She added \\"[Indi] didn't realise until she got close to Romeo that she still has unresolved feelings about her past\\". Romeo encourages Indi to talk to her mother and attempt to sort things out. Mitchell revealed in January 2011 that Romeo and Indi's relationship would come under strain. Mitchell said \\"There are a lot of interesting times ahead for Romeo. A lot of relationship stuff, a lot of ups and downs. He goes through a really torturous time. It's a very rocky path.\\" Indi and Romeo start drifting apart after she goes to university and Romeo remains at high school. Mitchell also commented on a teaser clip, which showed Romeo kissing Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds), he said \\"I saw the teaser and was like, 'Wow, that's certainly going to raise some eyebrows!'. She decides that Romeo is the guy for her, but time will tell if this is actually the case.\\" Executive producer Cameron Welsh promised viewers that the storyline would play a big part of the serial in 2011. He also stated: \\"Fans will definitely take sides on this one. Luke Mitchell, Rebecca Breeds and Samara Weaving are having a great time with this storyline, and we'll see a new side to all of them as they face the consequences of their actions.\\" After Romeo has sex with Ruby, Mitchell said his character immediately regrets it and realises that Indi is the right girl for him. Ruby reveals the truth to Indi. Weaving said her \\"knight in shining armour has been shattered\\" as she thought Romeo was the one person who wouldn't cheat; Indi cannot \\"understand the circumstances\\" which have led to Romeo's infidelity. She said that they could repair their relationship; \\"she just needs time to grieve\\" and that viewers expected them to part ways. Romeo and Indi get back together and while on a trip to Hawaii, Romeo proposes. The Hawaii shoot was announced in February 2011 by Cameron Welsh. He revealed that it would be a big story, while The Sunday Telegraph reported that Weaving was one of four cast members who had travelled to Hawaii for a \\"powerful storyline\\". It was later announced that Mitchell, along with Georgie Parker and Robert Mammone, had also travelled to Hawaii to film the storyline. The storyline sees Roo Stewart (Parker) and Romeo travel to Hawaii to attend a tourism exhibition. Parker explained \\"I think Roo has just championed Romeo's cause a bit - she sees a young man who has some drive and wants to encourage him to do his best.\\" Roo is not happy when she learns that Romeo traded in his business class ticket for two economy seats so Indi can join them. However, Indi helps win over Roo and Romeo's business acquaintance, Marty. Marty makes Indi a job offer, which leads to Romeo proposing. Mitchell told TV Week: \\"The fact that Indi's been offered a job brings up the prospect of being separated from her again. And Romeo doesn't deal with that well. He's finally got the girl of his dreams, and she might be going away.\\" Weaving described the proposal as \\"beautiful\\" and said her character is \\"shocked, but also just overwhelmed with happiness.\\" The Herald Sun reported that Romeo and Indi \\"get caught up in the romance of Hawaii\\" and marry. In a July 2011 interview Welsh explained that the newlyweds will face challenges when they discover marriage is hard work and their relationship will be put under strain. Storylines Romeo arrives in town looking for Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues), his old friend from foster care. He is taken in by Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart), Jai's foster father. Gina Austin (Sonia Todd) persuades Romeo to go back to school. It is later revealed that Romeo's family broke down when his mother killed his abusive stepfather to protect him and his sister took the blame. His sister, Mink, arrives in town and a few months later, his alcoholic mother, Jill (Josephine Mitchell), arrives too. Romeo and Mink part on good terms, but he and Jill do not. He dates Annie Campbell for a while until she chooses to return to Japan. Romeo then starts dating Indigo Walker and they enjoy spending time with each other. Romeo is put to work in the kitchen at the Diner as his presence starts to interfere with Indi's work. Romeo later decides that he is ready to lose his virginity, but Indi leaves the house crying and without explaining to Romeo why. He tries calling her, but she does not answer. He then talks to Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) about what happened and she tells him that she will speak to Indi. Romeo snaps at Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) for moving on too quickly from her relationship with his friend, Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead). Indi finds Romeo and tells him that they need to take things more slowly. Romeo is angry when Indi confesses that she took and read a letter from Annie to him. Indi believes that Romeo is still in love with Annie and Romeo proves to her that she is the only one for him. Indi then apologises for how she has been acting. Romeo reveals to Indi that he deliberately failed his HSC because he loves her and wants to be with her. Indi passes her HSC and begins university, while Romeo repeats Year 12. Romeo starts to question his relationship with Indi and he becomes frustrated with being back in school. Romeo becomes friends with Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes) after they end up in detention together. Indi leaves Romeo some cryptic clues for a special night she has planned for him, but he believes Indi is going to end their relationship. Ruby Buckton tells Romeo that she likes him and they have sex. Romeo is shocked when he learns that Indi was not going to break up with him. He tells Ruby that he and Indi are still together and that nothing will ever happen between them. Ruby tells Indi that she and Romeo had sex, devastating both Indi and Romeo. Romeo tries to apologise, but Sid (Robert Mammone) refuses to let him into the house. Romeo invites Indi out on a picnic and she goes, but tells Romeo that they are over. Romeo drops out of school, which Miles and Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) disapprove of. Romeo meets Emily Logan (Madison Kerry) and they have sex. Romeo loses interest in her and tells her that she meant nothing to him, appalling Indi. Romeo spends time working at the shelter and decides to stop wallowing and take action. He starts a Surf School business. Romeo does not like Indi's new admirer, Kieran Monroe (Andrew Hazzard), and warns Indi not to go out with him, but she refuses to listen. Kieran turns nasty one night and Indi calls Romeo, who rescues her. After getting approval from Morag and advice from Roo, Romeo starts a chartering business with Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) boat, the Blaxland. Sid warns Romeo off of Indi and he agrees, which annoys Indi. However, he decides to profess his feelings for her and they get back together. Sid is not happy and expresses his distrust of Romeo at a dinner. Romeo discovers that he has Chlamydia and tries to contact Ruby. When Casey finds out, he punches Romeo. The Blaxland breaks and Romeo attempts to fix it himself. Romeo gets distracted trying to stop a River Boy fight and neglects his lifesaving duty. When a man nearly drowns, John Palmer (Shane Withington) sacks Romeo. Romeo becomes desperate to fix the boat and agrees to take two River Boys out on a charter. He then becomes caught up in a drugs bust. Morag tells Romeo that he cannot use the Blaxland for his business, but Roo decides to be his mentor and Morag changes her mind. Roo invites Romeo to Hawaii after he is chosen to represent Summer Bay Tourism. Romeo exchanges his business class ticket for two economy ones and invites Indi to go with him. During their trip, Romeo proposes to Indi and she accepts. They decide to get married straight away. Sid arrives in Hawaii, but gives Romeo and Indi his blessing. They marry and on their return home, they move in with Roo. When they start to struggle financially, Romeo and Indi move into the Farmhouse. Romeo starts giving surfing lessons and later lends a large amount of money to his sister, which upsets Indi. She urges him to get a job with the new resort, which he does. However, Romeo quits shortly after to start surfing in competitions. Ruby decides to join Romeo on the circuit. When Indi catches Romeo and Ruby sharing a motel room she jumps to the wrong conclusion and later goes out with Logan Meyer (David Berry). Romeo pleads with Indi to make their marriage work and she agrees. They go on a holiday and when they return, Indi vows to trust Ruby and support Romeo with his surfing. However, the couple soon realise that they got married too young. Indi reveals that she had sex with Logan, while Romeo admits to kissing Ruby. Indi continues to see Logan and Romeo insinuates that she is a gold-digger. Romeo admits to Ruby that he has feelings for her and they start dating. Romeo wins a surfing competition, but when he is nearly hit by a car, he badly injures his knee. Sid tells Romeo that he will probably not be able to surf again. Ruby suggests that she and Romeo go into business together using the money she inherited from Charlie's death. She transfers some money to Romeo, but when Indi tells Romeo that she is in debt and thinking of dropping out of university, he lends her Ruby's money. When Romeo learns that Ruby has warned Indi off, he confronts her about her manipulation. When Romeo goes to break up with Ruby, she tells him she is pregnant. Romeo does not take the news well, but vows to stick by Ruby and the baby. However, Ruby later confesses she made the pregnancy up and Romeo breaks up with her, confessing that he still loves Indi. Ruby tampers with the breaks to Indi's car, which results in Dexter Walker (Charles Cottier) being in a near-fatal accident, leaving him with brain damage. During this time, Indi has a brief relationship with Liam, leaving Romeo hurt, but determined to win her back. The pair eventually reunite following Dex's accident and they remarry in an intimate ceremony with their family and friends. They also embark on a new business venture, opening the Summer Bay Body and Soul gym. Not long after, Romeo begins experiencing pain in his upper back. After consulting with Sid Walker (Robert Mammone), he learns he has stage four melanoma and begins chemotherapy. Romeo asks Sid not to tell Indi and Sid reluctantly agrees. Realising that he is going to die and unwilling to put Indi through anymore heartache, Romeo plans a romantic getaway for the two of them as a way to say goodbye. He leaves a letter for her, still not divulging his cancer diagnosis, and goes to meet Liam, who has also decided to leave the Bay. The two ride off on Liam's motorcycle. Not long after, Romeo signs over the gym to Indi. A few months later, Indi receives news from Liam that Romeo has died. His ashes were returned to the Bay and sprinkled across the cliff where the couple had spent their last night together. Romeo later appears to Indi in a dream.

The firm was established in 1868, and was wound up as a company in around 1990. However, the name and business continue to be used as Reid Brothers UK to this current day. History Reid Brothers expanded from their Glasgow bases, establishing branches all over the world, including Johannesburg, South Africa, Rhodesia, Zambia. The company was very well known and respected through the 19th and 20th centuries, trading worldwide. Some business activities of Reid Brothers or their shareholders included the Clyde Nail Co.

There are records showing the supply of locomotives to customers abroad. Over time the branches were sold off until only the original Glasgow office was left. Branches were sold to Dowson & Dobson, and in 1969, AFROX purchased Reid Brothers (South Africa). Current business The trading name continued as part of Barnbury Enterprises Ltd who purchased the business in 1988 from a Mr Reid, who was a descendant of the Reids who established the business in 1868, until 2015. The business, along with three members of staff, established themselves in premises in Govan. As of 2015, the business was no longer a part of the Barnbury Enterprises group following a management buyout lead by long term manager Danny Rooney.

Sen collaborated with Ranjan Ghosh to write both the story and the screenplay. The film was produced by Shrikant Mohta and Mahendra Soni of Shree Venkatesh Films Pvt Ltd. Some critics consider it to be among her best work, ranking with Mr. and Mrs. Iyer and 36 Chowringhee Lane. This was the first Bengali film Sen directed after a gap of more than a decade. Her previous film was Paromitar Ek Din, in 2000. Iti Mrinalini is viewed as the director's first mainstream venture. It focuses on the life of an aging Bengali star actress of yesteryear (Mrinalini), who looks back at her life. Aparna Sen plays the current-day Mrinalini while her daughter Konkona Sen Sharma portrays Mrinalini's earlier self. The film also stars Rajat Kapoor, Priyanshu Chatterjee, Kaushik Sen, Locket Chatterjee and German actor Suzanne Bernert in supporting roles. The entire cast, except for Konkona, is new to Aparna Sen films. This was the first time Sen had collaborated with a scriptwriter, and the first film by Sen to be nationally released in Hindi simultaneously with the Bengali version. It is also the first time Sen and her daughter have played the same character. Theme The film examines the randomness of life, suggesting that nothing is under our control no matter how hard we try. The film also explores different forms of love: first love, domestic happiness, an emotion that falls somewhere between friendship and love, and love that results from loneliness and seclusion. Plot Mrinalini, an ageing actress, writes a suicide note. As a performer, the first lesson she learned was timing ‚Äì the perfect moment for making an entrance or an exit on stage. On the stage of life, her entrance was outside her control, but she plans to choose her exit. Before taking the sleeping pills she has ready, she decides to destroy her memorabilia ‚Äì letters, photographs, newspaper cuttings, knick-knacks ‚Äì in case they fall into the hands of the press. She was a focus of media attention all her life and wishes to be spared this, as much as possible, at her death. As she looks through the relics from her past, she remembers incidents that she had forgotten or had suppressed. Through these memories, she relives her love life, friendships and betrayals, successes and failures, accidents and awards. As Mrinalini relives her past, night gradually turns to dawn. An azaan (Islamic call to prayer) starts up in the distance. Slowly, early morning light fills the room. The moment has passed and the death she had wished for so intensely no longer seems a priority. Her German Shepherd comes and rubs its head on its mistress's feet and asks to be let out. Mrinalini tears up the suicide note and takes her dog out for a walk. On the street, she meets morning walkers, joggers, and a group of school children. A young man runs past her. He seems to be escaping from something. Mrinalini thinks that she recognizes him; he resembles her first boyfriend, from her college days. Maybe he's a thief, or a gangster. Then a gunshot is heard. Everyone on the street is startled. Mrinalini stands still, shocked. The young man who resembled her first love checks himself. He is safe, but Mrinalini has been hit in the back. He runs off as she collapses on the ground.

Pre-production started in the second week of April 2009 with ideation. Scripting started by the end of April. The screenplay of Iti Mrinalini was an assignment in the screenwriting syllabus at the Mumbai-based film school Whistling Woods International. This marked the first time that a screenplay emerging from an Indian film institute had actually been filmed. In a Master Class on Cinema held on Fox History and Entertainment Channel, Sen commented that she had never collaborated with any film writer before the screenplay for Iti Mrinalini. First-time screenwriter Ranjan Ghosh, an alumnus of Whistling Woods International, wrote the story and the screenplay along with Sen, based on an original story idea Sen gave him. Ghosh was Sen's first co-author since she began her prolific directing career with 36 Chowringhee Lane in 1981. The first draft of the screenplay of Iti Mrinalini was ready by the end of July 2009. The second and third drafts were completed by August and September, respectively Somak Mukherjee acted as cinematographer, in place of Shirsha Roy who was unable to participate due to scheduling problems. Location scouting was carried out in Calcutta and Konark in the month of August. As she did for her earlier films, Sen arranged a grueling acting workshop for the cast, conducted by Sohag Sen. The Calcutta chapter of the workshop lasted for three weeks, with Konkona Sen Sharma. The Mumbai chapter ran for another ten days, with Rajat Kapoor and Priyanshu Chatterjee. Extensive pre-production meets were held regularly at Sen's home throughout the months of August and September. Production design of this film was by Sen and her directorial assistants. Scriptwriter Ranjan Ghosh acted as Assistant Director, and took on the task of creating Mrinalini's memorabilia with help from the art department. Sabarni Das, Sen's longtime junior colleague at the Bengali-language women's magazine Sananda, designed the costumes. Das also helped in the art direction. Production/Principal photography The production of the film started on 6 October 2009. One of the cult poems by Bengali writer Sunil Gangopadhyay, Smritir Shohor, was turned into a song for the film. This is the first time a poem by Gangopadhyay's poems has been in a film. Music director Debojyoti Mishra wrote the score. Iti Mrinalini was shot in 38 locations in just 33 days. The shoot covered areas around Calcutta including the Vidyasagar Setu, the Howrah Bridge, Baghbazar Ghat, College Street, Favourite Cabin, Calcutta Greens, Science City, Alipore Zoo, New Market, Priya Cinema, Ganga Kutir, and a Silver Spring apartment. The outdoor scenes were shot in Konark in a week, in the latter half of October. The Calcutta Movieton studio at Tollygunge‚Äôs 28A Chandi Ghosh Road reopened after 25 years for Iti Mrinalini. The studio was once owned by ex-star Kanan Devi, who sold it to businessman Jagdish Bagri in 1985. Bagri commented \\"I had no intention to run a studio back then but now Tollywood is big\\". Producer Shree Venkatesh Films hired two floors for the shoot. Post-production The first two cuts of the film were completed by the end of November 2009 and by mid December 2009 respectively. The final cut, with a duration of 128 minutes, was completed in January 2010. Dubbing was held in Calcutta in December and in Mumbai from January to March 2010. Sound design and the final mix-down was completed in 'Maximum City' in September. Release Iti Mrinalini's domestic premiere was in the 'Indian Frame' section at the 12th MAMI International Film Festival 2010, held in Mumbai on 27 October 2010. Its world premiere was at the Cairo International Film Festival on 30 November 2010. The film opened the River to River. Florence Indian Film Festival on 3 December 2010, which was also its European premiere. It played to sold-out audiences at the Dubai International Film Festival, and was given a standing ovation at the 8th Edition of the Chennai International Film Festival on 23 December 2010. The prestigious Slamdance Film Festival presented Iti Mrinalini at the 9th Annual Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles, on 14 April 2011, the film's USA premiere. It was selected as the Centerpiece Film at the 11th Annual edition of the IAAC's New York Indian Film Festival in May 2011 in Manhattan, and was shown at the Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival in May 2011 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the 14th Shanghai International Film Festival in June 2011. The film's commercial release in India was on 29 July 2011, followed by a worldwide release on 31 July 2011. Reception The Hollywood Reporter called Iti Mrinalini \\"[a]n addicting shot of melodrama\\" with \\"anxious beautiful women\\" and \\"a sense that society, an entirely alien force outside those nighttime windows, is conspiring to ruin lives and despoil love\\". The Telegraph (Calcutta) commented that \\"[t]he film transcends its regional mould and presents Bengalis as part of a bigger global existence... This is a new-generation film which doesn‚Äôt need a hip youngster to make it contemporary\\". The Indian Express wrote that \\"The film ends abruptly on a tragic, pessimistic, almost melodramatic note that is unlike Aparna Sen. Sen's minute eye for detail is scattered through the film, as are myriad characters of different colours who dot her life from her youth in the 1970s to the present time\\". Anandabazar Patrika rated the film 8.5 / 10 , calling it \\"Aparna's most mature outing till date, and a marked departure from her usual style of film-making\\". Soundtrack The soundtrack has music composed by Debojyoti Mishra, with lyrics by Sunil Gangopadhyay, Srijit Mukherjee and Rabindranath Tagore. The music was released on 28 March 2011.

This regulation is vastly important to the cellular response to stressors, growth cues, and differentiation. In comparison to transcriptional regulation, it results in much more immediate cellular adjustment through direct regulation of protein concentration. The corresponding mechanisms are primarily targeted on the control of ribosome recruitment on the initiation codon, but can also involve modulation of peptide elongation, termination of protein synthesis, or ribosome biogenesis. While these general concepts are widely conserved, some of the finer details in this sort of regulation have been proven to differ between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.  In prokaryotes   Initiation  Initiation of translation is regulated by the accessibility of ribosomes to the Shine- Dalgarno sequence. This stretch of four to nine purine residues are located upstream the initiation codon and hybridize to a pyrimidine-rich sequence near the 3' end of the 16S RNA within the 30S bacterial ribosomal subunit.Nelson, David L.; Cox, Michael M. (2008). Lehnniger: Principles of Biochemistry(Fifth ed.). W.H. Freeman and Company. p. 243. . Polymorphism in this particular sequence has both positive and negative effects on the efficiency of base- pairing and subsequent protein expression.Johnson G (1991). \\"Interference with phage lambda development by the small subunit of the phage 21 terminase, gp1\\". Journal of Bacteriology. 173 (9): 2733‚Äì2738. PMC 207852 . PMID 1826903. Initiation is also regulated by proteins known as initiation factors which provide kinetic assistance to the binding between the initiation codon and tRNAfMet, which supplies the 3'-UAC-5' anticodon. IF1 binds the 30S subunit first, instigating a conformational changeCarter, A. P.; Clemons, W. M.; Brodersen, D. E.; Morgan-Warren, R. J.; Hartsch, T.; Wimberly, B. T.; Ramakrishnan, V.

Real-time assembly landscape of bacterial 30S translation initiation complex. Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2012;19:609‚Äì615. IF2 ensures that tRNAfMet remains in the correct position while IF3 proofreads initiation codon base-pairing to prevent non- canonical initiation at codons such as AUU and AUC.Hartz D, McPheeters DS, Gold L. Selection of the initiator tRNA by Escherichia coli initiation factors. Genes Dev. 1989;3:1899‚Äì1912. doi: 10.1101/gad.3.12a.1899. Generally, these initiation factors are expressed in equal proportion to ribosomes, however experiments using cold-shock conditions have shown to create stoichiometric imbalances between these translational machinery. In this case, two to three fold changes in expression of initiation factors coincide with increased favorability towards translation of specific cold-shock mRNAs.Giuliodori A. M., Brandi A., Gualerzi C. O., Pon C. L., 2004. Preferential translation of cold-shock mRNAs during cold adaptation. RNA 10(2): 265‚Äì276. 10.1261/rna.5164904  Elongation  Due to the fact that translation elongation is an irreversible process, there are few known mechanisms of its regulation. However, it has been shown that translational efficiency is reduced via diminished tRNA pools, which are required for the elongation of polypeptides. In fact, the richness of these tRNA pools are susceptible to change through cellular oxygen supply.Taylor, R. C., Webb Robertson, B.-J. M., Markille, L. M., Serres, M. H., Linggi, B. E., Aldrich, J. T., ‚Ä¶ Wiley, S. (2013). Changes in Translational Efficiency is a Dominant Regulatory Mechanism in the Environmental Response of Bacteria. Integrative Biology : Quantitative Biosciences from Nano to Macro, 5(11), 1393‚Äì1406. http://doi.org/10.1039/c3ib40120k  Termination  The termination of translation requires coordination between release factor proteins, the mRNA sequence, and ribosomes. Once a termination codon is read, release factors RF-1, RF-2, and RF-3 contribute to the hydrolysis of the growing polypeptide, which terminates the chain. Bases downstream the stop codon affect the activity of these release factors. In fact, some bases proximal to the stop codon suppress the efficiency of translation termination by reducing the enzymatic activity of the release factors. For instance, the termination efficiency of a UAAU stop codon is near 80% while the efficiency of UGAC as a termination signal is only 7%.Poole, E. S., Brown, C. M., & Tate, W. P. (1995). The identity of the base following the stop codon determines the efficiency of in vivo translational termination in Escherichia coli. The EMBO Journal, 14(1), 151‚Äì158.  In eukaryotes   Initiation  When comparing initiation in eukaryotes to prokaryotes, perhaps one of the first noticeable differences is the use of a larger 80S ribosome. Regulation of this process begins with the supply of methionine by a tRNA anticodon that basepairs AUG. This base pairing comes about by the scanning mechanism that ensues once the small 40S ribosomal subunit binds the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA. The usage of this scanning mechanism, in opposition to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence that was referenced in prokaryotes, is the ability to regulate translation through upstream RNA secondary structures. This inhibition of initiation through complex RNA structures may be circumvented in some cases by way of internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) that localize pre-initiation complexes (PIC) to the start site.L√≥pez-Lastra, M; Rivas, A; Barr√≠a, MI (2005). \\"Protein synthesis in eukaryotes: the growing biological relevance of cap-independent translation initiation\\". Biological research. 38 (2‚Äì3): 121‚Äì46. doi:10.4067/s0716-97602005000200003. PMID 16238092. In addition to this, the guidance of the PIC to the 5' UTR is coordinated by subunits of the PIC, known as eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). When some of these proteins are down-regulated through stresses, translation initiation is reduced by inhibiting cap dependent initiation, the activation of translation by binding eIF4E to the 5' 7-methylguanylate cap. eIF2 is responsible for coordinating the interaction between the Met-tRNAiMet and the P-site of the ribosome. Regulation by phosphorylation of eIF2 is largely associated with the termination of translation initiation.Kimball S.R. Eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999;31:25‚Äì29. Serine kinases, GCN2, PERK, PKR, and HRI are examples of detection mechanisms for differing cellular stresses that respond by slowing translation through eIF2 phosphorylation.  Elongation  The hallmark difference of elongation in eukaryotes in comparison to prokaryotes is its separation from transcription. While prokaryotes are able to undergo both cellular processes simultaneously, the spatial separation that is provided by the nuclear membrane prevents this coupling in eukaryotes. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) is a regulateable GTP-dependent translocase that moves nascent polypeptide chains from the A-site to the P-site in the ribosome. Phosphorylation of threonine 56 is inhibitory to the binding of eEF2 to the ribosome.Ovchinnikov LP, Motuz LP, Natapov PG, Averbuch LJ, Wettenhall RE, Szyszka R, Kramer G, Hardesty B. 1990. Three phosphorylation sites in elongation factor 2. FEBS Lett. 275: 209‚Äì 212 Cellular stressors, such as anoxia have proven to induce translational inhibition through this biochemical interaction.Horman S, Browne G, Krause U, Patel J, Vertommen D, Bertrand L, Lavoinne A, Hue L, Proud C, Rider M. 2002. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase leads to the phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 and an inhibition of protein synthesis. Curr. Biol. 12: 1419‚Äì 1423  Termination  Mechanistically, eukaryotic translation termination matches its prokaryotic counterpart. In this case, termination of the polypeptide chain is achieved through the hydrolytic action of a heterodimer consisting of release factors, eRF1 and eRF3. Translation termination is said to be leaky in some cases as noncoding-tRNAs may compete with release factors to bind stop codons. This is possible due to the matching of 2 out 3 bases within the stop codon by tRNAs that may occasionally outcompete release factor base pairing. Dabrowski M, Bukowy-Bieryllo Z, Zietkiewicz E. Translational readthrough potential of natural termination codons in eucaryotes - the impact of RNA sequence. RNA Biol. 2015;12:950‚Äì8. An example of regulation at the level of termination is functional translational readthrough of the lactate dehydrogenase gene LDHB. This readthrough provides a peroxisomal targeting signal that localizes the distinct LDHBx to the peroxisome.Schueren F, Lingner T, George R, Hofhuis J, Gartner J, Thoms S (2014). \\"Peroxisomal lactate dehydrogenase is generated by translational readthrough in mammals\\". eLife. 3: e03640. doi:10.7554/eLife.03640.  In plants  Translation in plants is tightly regulated as in animals, however, it is not as well understood as transcriptional regulation. There are several levels of regulation including translation initiation, mRNA turnover and ribosome loading. Recent studies have shown that translation is also under the control of the circadian clock. Like transcription, the translation state of numerous mRNAs changes over the diel cycle (day night period).Missra, Anamika; Ernest, Ben; Lohoff, Tim; Jia, Qidong; Satterlee, James; Ke, Kenneth; Arnim, Albrecht G. von. \\"The Circadian Clock Modulates Global Daily Cycles of mRNA Ribosome Loading\\".

Gorodets painting sprang from carved Gorodets distaffs that were manufactured in villages nearby Gorodets town in the Nizhni Novgorod Region. Initially Gorodets craftsmen used the incrustation technique to ornament the distaffs. The mid 19th century saw the transition from incrustation to painting of Distaff. Gorodets artists traditionally paint genre scenes (merrymaking, tea drinking, the famous Gorodets horse with a horseman, and folk festivities), decorative images of birds and animals (roosters, horses, lions, leopards, etc.) and flower patterns. Nowadays Gorodets craftsmen use similar imagery and motifs in their works. These are decorative panels, caskets, boxes, various sets of kitchen stuff, such as hardboards, bread bins, saltcellars, etc., as well as children furniture and toys, including the most popular painted rocking horse. The factory 'Gorodets Painting' existing from 1965 has got an experimental laboratory, where new genre compositions are devised. Along with preserving the artistic tradition and stylistic, dating to the 19th century, modern Gorodets painting keeps developing.

He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and the infamous Shankill Butchers gang, led by Lenny Murphy.\\"From killer to victim: Basher's death sums up the futility of the Troubles\\" The Independent, 12 June 1997, retrieved 26 September 2009 Shankill Butchers Bates was born into an Ulster Protestant family and grew up in the Shankill Road area of Belfast. He had a criminal record dating back to 1966,Martin Dillon, The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder, p.10 and later became a member of the Ulster loyalist paramilitary organisation, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Bates, employed as a barman at the Long Bar, was recruited into the Shankill Butchers gang in 1975 by its notorious ringleader, Lenny Murphy. The gang used The Brown Bear pub, a Shankill Road drinking haunt frequented by the UVF, as its headquarters. Bates, a \\"sergeant\\" in the gang's hierarchy, was an avid participant in the brutal torture and savage killings perpetrated against innocent Catholics after they were abducted from nationalist streets and driven away in a black taxi owned by fellow Shankill Butcher, William Moore. The killings typically involved grisly-throat slashings preceded by lengthy beatings and torture. Bates was said to have been personally responsible for beating James Moorhead, a member of the Ulster Defence Association, to death on 30 January 1977 and to have played a central role in the kidnapping and murder of Catholic Joseph Morrisey three days later.Cusack & McDonald, p. 181 He also killed Thomas Quinn, a derelict, on 8 February 1976 and the following day was involved in shooting dead Archibald Hanna and Raymond Carlisle, two Protestant workmen that Bates and Murphy mistook for Catholics. Martin Dillon revealed that Bates was also one of the four UVF gunmen who carried out a mass shooting in the Chlorane Bar attack in Belfast city centre on 5 June 1976. Five people (three Catholics and two Protestants) were shot dead. The UVF unit had burst into the pub in Gresham Street and ordered the Catholics and Protestants to line up on opposite ends of the bar before they opened fire. He later recounted his role in the attack to police; however, he had claimed that he never fired any shots due to his revolver having malfunctioned. Forensics evidence contradicted him as it proved that his revolver had been fired inside the Chlorane Bar that night.Dillon, pp.125-135 Lenny Murphy was in police custody at the time the shooting attack against the Chlorane Bar took place. Bates was arrested in 1977, along with Moore and other \\"Shankill Butcher\\" accomplices.Taylor, p.154 His arrest followed a sustained attack by Moore and Sam McAllister on Catholic Gerard McLaverty, after which they dumped his body, presuming him dead. However McLaverty survived and identified Moore and McAllister to the Royal Ulster Constabulary who drove him up and down the Shankill Road during a loyalist parade until he saw his attackers. During questioning both men implicated Bates, and other gang members, leading to their arrests.Cusack & McDonald, p. 181-183 Following a long period spent on remand, he was convicted in February 1979 of murder related to the Shankill Butcher killings and given ten life sentences, with a recommendation by the trial judge, Mr Justice O'Donnell, that he should never be released. In prison At the start of his sentence, Bates was involved in a series of violent incidents involving other inmates. Bates later claimed that he had perpetrated these acts in order to live up to his \\"Basher\\" nickname. He served as company commander of the UVF inmates and became noted as a stern disciplinarian.McKittirck et al, Lost Lives, p. 1411 However while in the Maze Prison, he was said to have \\"found God\\", and as a result became a born-again Christian.An Phoblacht Republican News, 13 June 1997, retrieved on 9 October 2009 He produced a prison testimony, which was later reprinted in The Burning Bush, and, after publicly advocating an end to violence, was transferred to HMP Maghaberry. In prison, Bates formed a friendship with Provisional IRA member and fellow detainee Brendan Hughes. Bates foiled a UVF assassination plot on Hughes.Moloney, Ed (2010).

He was rehoused in the Taughmonagh area where he quickly became an important figure in the local UDA as a part of Jackie McDonald's South Belfast Brigade.Cusack & McDonald, pp. 389-390 Bates' name was subsequently included on the banner of a prominent Orange Lodge on the Shankill Road, called Old Boyne Island Heroes.Taylor, pp. 150-52 Relatives of Shankill butchers victims Cornelius Neeson condemned the banner, stating that \\"it hurts the memory of those the butchers killed\\".McKittirck et al, Lost Lives, p. 1412 A fellow Lodge member and former friend of Bates defended the inclusion of his name to journalist Peter Taylor: \\"I knew him very well and he'd been a personal friend for twenty or thirty years and to me he was a gentleman\\".Taylor, p.152 He went on to describe him as having been \\"an easy-going, decent fellow, and as far as the Lodge is concerned, a man of good-standing\\".Taylor, p.152 He was a buried in a Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster ceremony by Reverend Alan Smylie.Steve Bruce, Paisley: Religion and Politics in Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 221 Bates' funeral was attended by a large representation from local Orange Lodges.Taylor, p.152 Peace activist Mairead Maguire was also amongst the mourners, arguing that Bates had \\"repented, asked for forgiveness and showed great remorse for what he had done\\", whilst a memorial service held at the spot of his killing two days after the funeral was attended by Father Gerry Reynolds of Clonard Monastery.

The RG-35 was introduced in 2009 as a 6x6 vehicle, and a 4x4 version is also under development with the designers intending to make it a new family of vehicles. Described by BAE Systems as a \\"new class of vehicle\\" combining the capabilities of a 4x4 mine protected vehicle and a 8x8 combat vehicle, the RG-35 can be utilized in a variety of roles, including command, ambulance or recovery vehicle. Its large payload capability allows additional armour to be added to the RG-35, which can offer protection of up to STANAG 4569 level 4. It is powered by a Cummins diesel engine, although it can also accommodate hybrid electric drive. The vehicle can be fitted with light or medium gun turrets, allowing it to be equipped with a wide range of weapons. History Land Systems OMC, a subdivision of BAE Systems in South Africa, began development of the RG-35 in early 2008 as a private venture. Based on BAE Systems' existing RG range including the RG-31 Nyala, RG-32 Scout and the RG-33, it was intended to be a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle (MRAP) that could offer a high level of protection, high payload capability as well as a high level of cross- country mobility. Development of the vehicle was completed in a year, and it was unveiled to the public in September 2009 at the Defence Systems and Equipment International (DSEi) exhibition in London. BAE systems described it as a combination of a 4x4 mine protected vehicle and a 8x8 combat vehicle, calling it a groundbreaking new class of vehicle. The RG-35 displayed at the DSEi was the standard 6x6 version. However, BAE Systems are also developing a 4x4 version, intending to make the RG-35 into a new family of vehicles. The 4x4 version is expected to become operational by late 2010. The company has expressed confidence in obtaining orders for the RG-35, and it has been speculated that it may be submitted to the British Army's Light Protected Patrol Vehicle project as well as for the South African Army's Project Sepula, which seeks to replace their Casspir and Mamba Armoured Personnel Carriers. Features The 6x6 version of the vehicle can accommodate 16 personnel, including the driver. It has a length of , a width of and a height of , with a ground clearance of . The gross vehicle mass of the RG-35 is . The vehicle has a range of and a top speed of , powered by a Cummins diesel engine coupled to a ZF 6HP automatic transmission. This power pack is mounted on the side of the vehicle rather than the traditional front or rear mounting. It can be replaced in 30 minutes, and this positioning of the power pack allows more internal space as well. All main systems of the vehicle are armour protected, and it also contains a dual air-conditioning system. It can be configured for use in a variety of combat roles such as a command post vehicle, an engineering vehicle, a mortar vehicle, an anti-aircraft vehicle, a recovery vehicle or even an ambulance. The RG-35 is also designed to easily accommodate hybrid electric drive. The RG-35 can be equipped with light or medium gun turrets as well as indirect fire weapons. This allows a wide range of weapons to be used, including 12.7 mm machine guns and up to 20 mm calibre weapons. The RG-35 can offer STANAG 4569 level 4 protection due to its V-shaped hull and of under- armour, and is equipped with armoured glass windows that can provide all-round situational awareness to the personnel inside. Its payload capability is , which also allows extra armour to be added without reducing performance. Additional thick armour can be added to the V-hull, while thick additional armour can be added to the sides. The RG-35 can be transported in an Airbus A400M or larger aircraft.
