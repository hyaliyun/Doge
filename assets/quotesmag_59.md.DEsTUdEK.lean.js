Its range is quite large, and it is found throughout much of North and Central America. M. celer are sit-and-wait predators who hide out on the flowers and upper stalks of plants, waiting for prey to pass by. As a variety of crab spider, they have characteristically long first two pairs of legs which they use to grab prey. M. celer do not spin and use webs for hunting, but only for creating egg sacs and as part of mating. The spider is a notable example of a species that displays sexual size dimorphism (SSD), a phenomenon in which one sex is significantly larger than the other. In the case of M. celer, females are dramatically larger than males, sometimes over twice his size, making the species a case of extreme sexual size dimorphism. M. celer also displays sexual cannibalism, as the females have been observed to eat their male mates if the males are still in proximity of the females after copulation. Like other spiders within the Thomisidae family, M. celer are an important pest control species for agriculture, since they hunt at the upper parts of crop plants where the grains or other harvested products grow. They thereby prey upon and protect agricultural products from potential pests like aphids. This species was formerly a member of the genus Misumenops, and was recently moved to Mecaphesa. Several older website and journal entries about the spider can still be found under the species name Misumenops celer, as with several of the references used in this article.  Description  Like many members of the Thomisidae family, M. celer have the characteristic long front two pairs of legs and short back two pairs. Adults show sexual dimorphism not only in size but in color, and mature males are often darker than females and have distinctive red bands on their legs. Males also tend to have whiter abdomens with four or more pairs of brown spots that form a V-shape, starting from the mid-abdomen and terminating at end of the abdomen. The male body is also covered in noticeable dark hairs (setae). There can be difficulty in identifying M. celer from a male alone; males of M. celer appear quite similar to males of Mecaphesa dubia and Mecaphesa rothi, and due to natural variation in physical traits that can occur within a single species, distinguishing between these three species can be quite uncertain. Female M. celer, meanwhile, are more distinct from other species. They tend to be yellow in color and have large, round abdomens much larger than their heads, unlike the male, whose abdomen and head are roughly equal in size. Females can actually vary in their coloration, with one variant being a bright, solid yellow with barely any brown spotting, another variant being yellow with reddish-brown streaking on the abdomen, and a third variant being completely white with dull brown streaking on the abdomen.

The spider is often seen on shrubs, bushes, and small trees, as well as on crop plants, such as sorghum, cotton, and alfalfa. One study of an Eastern Texas cotton field found that M. celer comprised 5.3% of all spiders collected in the field, indicating its abundance in agricultural fields. = Geographic distribution = M. celer is a nearctic spider species distributed widely across the North American continent.  Diet  = Spiderling = * i. Non-predatory feeding * ii. Predatory feeding * iii. Non-reproductive cannibalism b) Adult: * i. Non- predatory feeding * ii. Predatory feeding * iii. Non-reproductive cannibalism * iv. Prey stealing  Sexual Size Dimorphism  M. celer exhibits strong female-biased sexual size dimorphism (SSD), with males being roughly half the size of females and having a mass that is often less than 1/10th the average mass of a female. The exact selection pressures that have resulted in such dramatic size difference between the sexes in this species are still not well- known, and according to research, it does not appear that female-biased SSD in M. celer has evolved for any commonly acknowledged pre- or post-copulatory survival benefits to the male or female.  Mating  = Female/male interactions =  Mate choice  Virgin M. celer females appear to exercise no mate choice. Experiments have shown that virgin females will almost always accept the first male mate that comes along, showing no preference for smaller size or any other particular trait. Only after females have mated once do they appear to then become choosy, and many seem to reject mating attempts by subsequent males who come along, even attacking or killing male suitors.  Number of mates  It seems that M. celer males mate multiply more more often than females do. Two studies have shown that males are capable of multiple matings over their lifetimes, but the same two studies are at odds about a female's ability to have multiple mates. The earlier study observed that its females mated only once and that after copulation, a waxy coating was present over the female's epigyne, which the researchers claimed probably prevented successive matings. The more recent study found, however, that while a large fraction of its females refused to mate a second time, 15% still mated a second time, showing that second matings are not impossible in M. celer, even if they are not a preferred behavior.  Courting  M. celer individuals engage in courtship behavior to indicate receptiveness and willingness to copulate to one another. When recognizing a potential female mate, males vibrate their abdomens and slowly approach the female, gesturing with the front two pairs of legs and the pedipalps. Then, the male touches the female with the same front two pairs of legs, and if the female is receptive, she raises her legs and suspends herself in silk threads to indicate her receptivity to the male. After the female has accepted the male in this manner, the male climbs over the back (dorsal side) of the female and positions his head and thorax, collectively the prosoma, near the female's epigyne so that his pedipalps are close to it. A few different premating behaviors have been observed among mating pairs of M. celer in a laboratory setting. In some pairs, there was no premating behavior and copulation began immediately. In others, the male would rub the epigyne with his chelicerae before inserting the pedipalps, or the male would wait and rest with his chelicerae hovering over the epigyne.  Copulation  Copulation occurs in M. celer as it does in many other spider species, with the male inserting the pedipalps into the female's epigyne and pumping seminal fluid into the female. Hence, fertilization occurs internally within the female. During copulation, the hairs on the male's front two pairs of legs have been observed to flicker in sync with the pumping actions in the pedipalps, and occasionally the male may lubricate the embolus, the tip of the pedipalp which penetrates the epigyne, with his chelicerae. After copulation, which usually lasts between roughly 3 and 10 minutes, the male remains on the female until she becomes active again.  Sexual cannibalism  It appears that M. celer females exhibit sexual cannibalistic behavior. Laboratory study has observed that when a male mate is kept in proximity of the female after copulation is complete, the female eventually kills and eats him.  Interactions with humans and livestock  = Agricultural impact = Because M. celer feeds on insects visiting the flowering parts of plants, it can act as a valuable biological agent of insect control in crops. Members of the Thomisidae, as well as Salticidae, Argiopidae, and Oxiopidae spider families, have been shown to feed mainly in the upper part or head of the sorghum crop, where the grain is produced. Because sorghum is grown for the grain it produces, M. celer and other Thomisids provide important protection for farmers against the destruction of the crop's value. = Citizen science = = Beauty, art, and culture = References External links * Category:Thomisidae Category:Articles created by Qbugbot Category:Spiders described in 1847 Category:Spiders of North America ","title":"Mecaphesa celer"},{"id":"57345481","text":"Hamotus opimus is a species of ant-loving beetle in the family Staphylinidae.

He has been featured and known by both national and international media and publications like Forbes, BBC, The Wall Street Journal, and The Express Tribune. He has been listed among the \\"Top 5 Ethical Hackers of 2014\\" by CheckMarx . Subsequently he was listed as one of \\"The 15 Most Successful Ethical Hackers WorldWide\\" and among \\"Top 25 Threat Seekers\\" by SCmagazine. Baloch has also been added in TechJuice 25 under 25 list for the year 2016 and got 13th rank in the list of high achievers . Personal life Rafay Baloch attended Bahria University Karachi Campus from which he obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Baloch is currently placed in Hall of Fame of Bahria University.International Recognition of BU Students Career Baloch began his hacking career while he was still doing his bachelor's. He then wrote a book called \\"Ethical Hacking Penetration Testing Guide\\". He is the first Pakistani security researcher to be acknowledged by Google, Facebook, PayPal, Apple, Microsoft and many other international organizations. He has also written several papers on information security, namely \\"HTML5 Modern Day Attack Vectors\\", \\"Web Application Firewall Bypass\\", and \\"Bypassing Browser Security Policies For Fun And Profit\\". Rafay Baloch is currently working as a Cyber Security Advisor at Pakistan Telecommunication Authority. Bug bounty programs Baloch has been active into bug bounty programs and has reported several critical vulnerabilities in several open source web applications as well as in bug bounty programs. Baloch found critical vulnerabilities in PayPal in 2012: he hacked into PayPal servers by exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability. He was rewarded $10,000 and a job offer to work for them as a Security Researcher that he refused as he was still doing his bachelor's at that time. HackRead, a news platform on InfoSec, listed him among ‚Äú10 Famous Bug Bounty Hunters of All Time‚Äù. Baloch has also been awarded $5000 by Google and Firefox for baring the vulnerability in their browsers. Browser security research Baloch has actively reported several critical vulnerabilities in browsers. He started by finding Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass in Android Stock browser which was initially rejected by Google; however, this was later verified by Google after researchers from Rapid7 verified it. This was coined as . Baloch followed by reporting several other SOP bypasses. Researchers at Trend Micro found this bug to be more widespread. It was later reported that hackers had been actively using Baloch's SOP bypass exploits for hacking into Facebook accounts. The SOP bypass bug was elevated by Rapid7 researcher Joe Vennix for conducting a remote code execution. Baloch also found several vulnerabilities affecting Webview which allowed an attacker to read local files as well as steal cookies from the user device.  Apple Safari address bar spoofing controversy  In 2018, Baloch unveiled a crack in both Safari and Microsoft's Edge browser that paved the way for the URL of a safe website to be shown in the address bar while users were actually being taken to a different, and possibly malicious, website. Rafay Baloch identified the security issue and informed Apple and Microsoft in early June. Microsoft fixed the issue within two months but Apple didn‚Äôt respond to Baloch's report despite of the deadline given of 90 days grace period so he made the details public. Rafay Baloch wrote in his article that an address bar can be used to easily breach someone‚Äôs privacy without them noticing it. The reason this is possible is because an address bar is the only reliable indicator for security in new browsers, as it displays the site‚Äôs URL and other details related to the webpage one is on.  Google no-patch policy discovery  In 2014, after Rafay Baloch and Joe Vennix reported Google about a bug that could allow hackers to dodge the Android Open Source Platform (AOSP) browser‚Äôs Same-Origin Policy (SOP), they discovered that Google had already terminated its support for WebView on Android devices running Android 4.3 or older versions, while putting the onus on OEMs and the open source security community to provide patches to users at the same time. Whereas Google‚Äôs official stance on WebView for older pre-Android 4.4 devices was as follows: ‚ÄúIf the affected version [of WebView] is before 4.4, we generally do not develop the patches ourselves, but welcome patches with the report for consideration. Other than notifying OEMs, we will not be able to take action on any report that is affecting versions before 4.4 that are not accompanied with a patch.‚Äù Unfortunately, older versions of Android having unpatched WebView bugs were mainly due to their poor upgraded path, leaving users exposed. Google then released WebView as a stand-alone application that could be updated separately from the Android version of a device. Simply put, the re-architecting of the WebView would benefit the latest versions of Android, Lollipop 5.0 and Marshmallow 6.0. But this option remains unavailable to anyone on an older version of the operating system. On Google‚Äôs no-patch policy, Baloch shared his views with Zimperium, stating that ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs decision to not patch critical security bugs (pre- KitKat) anymore would certainly impact the vast majority of users. Security firms are already seeing attacks in the wild where users are abusing Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass bug to target Facebook users.‚Äù The Metasploit Framework, owned by Rapid7, contained 11 such WebView exploits that were need to be patched, most of which were contributions from Rafay Baloch and Joe Vennix.

Career Woodworth's initial training was in particle physics and early in his career he spent some time based at CERN. He has been associated with the National Oceanography Centre (formerly the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory) since 1983. From 1987 to 2007 Woodworth was the Director of the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level - the global data bank for recording sea- level change. His role involved working with the Environment Agency to provide tidal analysis for UK coastal waters. He has worked closely with the IPCC, and was the lead author on the sea-level chapter for the second and third assessment reports. In 2005 he challenged the view of Nils-Axel M√∂rner and argued that rising sea levels do threaten the future existence of The Maldives. In 2010 he completed research in the Falkland Islands that concluded the sea-level of the islands had risen significantly since the mid-19th century and accelerated in recent decades.

At age seven, she played Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 and, at nine, she entered the Conservatoire de Paris.. There, her teachers were Marguerite Long, Mrs. Marcou and √âlie-Miriam Delaborde.

For many years considered to be one of the best and most modern hospitals in Poland. The whole complex consisted of 8 separate hospital pavilions with surgical, ophthalmic and gynecological wards, skin and venereal diseases, pulmonary, throat and ear diseases, infectious, internal and nervous diseases, mental diseases and a midwifery with a research laboratory. The hospital also included an administration building, a synagogue, a pre-burial house, kitchens, laundries, freezers, a boiler room, a coach house, stables, a disinfection chamber, a food warehouse, a convalescent home and other smaller buildings. In total, there were 17 buildings for different purposes.  History  = Construction and opening = The idea of building a new Jewish hospital was born in the 80s of the 19th century, among doctors of the Old Jewish Hospital, headed by Dr. J√≥zef Kinderfreund. On June 25, 1883, Dr. Zygmunt Kramsztyk published in the \\"Kurier Warszawski\\" an article entitled \\"The New Hospital\\", in which he presented the construction assumptions and postulates in this matter. It gained the support of Warsaw physicians, a broad public opinion and the Warsaw Jewish community, with its president Ludwik Natanson at the forefront. In April 1887 the Hospital Building Committee was established, headed by Ludwik Natanson and then Micha≈Ç Berson after his death. The Committee was divided into general, medical, financial, technical and legal sections. In July 1887, the committee held its inaugural meeting and since then funds have been raised for the construction of the hospital. Among the donors were famous citizens of the city, Jewish intelligentsia and ordinary people. The committee decided on June 26, 1890 that the hospital would be built on the land of the estates of Wielka Wola and Czyste, repurchased from the owners: Biernacki, Rodkiewicz and Pie≈Ñkowski. The entire plot had an area of 6.7 hectares. The plan was approved by the Warsaw City Council for Public Charity in April 1893. The construction of the hospital was ceremonially started in May 1894. A cornerstone was laid in the foundation of the future hospital synagogue and a parchment box was laid, where a short history of the hospital's construction was written in Polish and Hebrew, as well as several Warsaw magazines. Artur Goebel, in cooperation with Czes≈Çaw Domaniewski, was the author of the hospital's project. It was based on the most modern medical facilities in Western Europe. The first hospital ward was opened in January 1898 - a pavilion for the insane, equipped with bed linen, underwear and clothes provided by the so-called Women's Committee, which in the future also took care of supply of the other wards. In December 1898, in order to speed up the process of obtaining funds for the finishing and furnishing of other buildings, the board of the Jewish community granted a loan in bonds in the amount of 400,000 roubles. The first patients were admitted to the hospital in April 1902. The ceremonial opening of the hospital took place on June 22 of the same year and started with a service in the hospital's synagogue. Speeches were delivered by Micha≈Ç Berson, President of the Building Committee, and Dr. Zygmunt Kramsztyk, the hospital's chief physician. The construction cost of the hospital was over 1,200,000 roubles. At that time, the hospital was the most modern and best equipped medical facility in Warsaw. For the first time in Poland, a low-pressure steam central heating system was used, along with gas and electric lighting, a power generating unit, ventilation, sewerage and water supply systems, and its own well. On November 1, 1907, in connection with a new law, the hospital was placed under the administration of the magistrate of the city of Warsaw. In 1909-1911, a new two-store pavilion was built for the needs of the internal and neurological wards, followed by the opening of a physiotherapy workshop. Doctor cabinet in Szpital na Czystem = Interwar period = In the interwar period, a new wing was built in the psychiatric pavilion, whose patients were moved to Choroszcza near Bia≈Çystok, and a ward for tuberculosis patients was opened. A famous nursing school was also established. At the beginning of 1922, the first issue of the \\"Clinical Quarterly of The Jewish Hospital\\" was published, which contained materials from scientific meetings. In the second half of the 1930s, the Jewish Hospital became the largest closed-circuit medical centre in the capital. There were 1100 beds in 1937. Before the outbreak of World War II, the hospital already had 1500 beds and employed 147 doctors, 119 nurses and 6 pharmacists. = Doctor Flatau Institute of Pathology = The construction of the Pathological Institute began in 1923 according to the plans of the builder Stifelman. The Pathological Institute was to be an institution providing access to modern ambiguous and therapeutic techniques and was to follow the rapid scientific development of medicine at that time. Initially, $6,000 from J.D.C. was obtained for the construction of the building and additional $28,000 raised among the Warsaw Jews. That money allowed to build a skeleton of the new building in 1926. It was to include a pathological anatomy department, a biology and therapy department, a chemistry and bacteriology department, an auditorium for 100 people and a reading room. One of the founders of the Pathological Institute was Edward Flatau. The Institute was opened in 1933, one year after Flatau‚Äôs death, and was named the \\"Dr. Flatau Pathological Institute\\". In August 1933, \\"Nasz PrzeglƒÖd Ilustrowany\\" published on its first page a photo entitled \\"Before the opening of the most important Jewish research institution in Warsaw\\", however, the institution had to struggle with a lack of funds for a long time. = World War II = Immediately after the outbreak of World War II, most of the medical personnel were conscripted into the army, which resulted in a shortage of personnel in the hospital. During the air raids, the surgical pavilion and all operating rooms were destroyed. Other hospital wards and the kitchen were also damaged. At the same time, due to its location, the hospital became a front post again. At the time of Warsaw's capitulation the hospital cared for 5000 wounded soldiers and civilians. By order of the German occupation authorities, the hospital, which was under the responsibility of the city magistrate, was transferred to the management of the Jewish community and thus was intended exclusively for Jews. As a result, all non-Jewish patients and staff had to leave the hospital and hundreds of sick and injured Jews from other hospitals were brought to this place. It resulted in a huge overcrowding of the hospital. The patients were placed in corridors, attics and on floors. In the late autumn of 1939, due to worsening sanitary conditions, a typhus epidemic broke out and the hospital was completely isolated for six weeks. In February 1941, by the decision of the German occupation authorities, the Jewish Hospital was moved to its new headquarters in the Warsaw Ghetto and operated there until 1943. From September 1939 to February 1941 was the most tragic period in the history of the hospital. It was cold in the wards, there was a shortage of food, medicine and personnel. From time to time, there was no electricity, water or gas supply. The hospital was constantly overpopulated. During the ghetto's operation, a team of Jewish doctors working in the hospital conducted research on hunger, some of the results were published in 1946 in the book Hunger Disease. Clinical research on hunger carried out in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942Emil Apfelbaum (red.): Choroba g≈Çodowa. Badania kliniczne nad g≈Çodem wykonane w getcie warszawskim z roku 1942. Warszawa: American Joint Distribution Committee, 1946, s. 16.. The Holy Spirit Hospital and the Treasury Hospital were moved to the abandoned pavilions of the Jewish Hospital. In June 1941, when the German-Soviet war broke out, both hospitals were evicted and a German military hospital was established in their place. = Post-war period = After the end of the war, the Holy Spirit Hospital was moved back into the abandoned pavilions and later renamed the Municipal Hospital No. 1. In the 1950s, the Wola Hospital was moved to the pavilions and is still here today. = Doctors associated with the Hospital = * Adam Wizel, assistant at the department of neurology (from 1890) * Samuel Goldflam, volunteer physician at the neurological department (1922-1932) * Edward Flatau, Head of the neurology department since 1904 * Zygmunt Kramsztyk, chief physician from 1898 to 1904, head of the ophthalmic ward from 1879. * Teofil Simchowicz, volunteer physician (from 1904 to 1911) and assistant (from 1911) at the neurological department * Julian Rotstadt, head of the physical and mechanical therapy unit, director of the Hospital in 1939 * Maurycy Bornsztajn, head of the psychiatric ward (since 1908) * Orko So≈Çowiejczyk, assistant physician at the surgical ward (from 1898) * Juliusz Mutermilch. head of the ophthalmic ward * Gerszon Lewin, head of the internal ward (from ca. 1918) * Wilhelm Rubin, assistant physician * Stanis≈Çaw Klajn, head of internal branch * Leon Lipszowicz, volunteer physician at the neurological ward * Ignacy Sznajderman, assistant physician at the neurological ward * Ludwik Eliasz Bregman, head of the neurological department * Bronis≈Çaw Berek Karbowski, head of the otolaryngological department (1933-1939) * W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sterling, head of the neurological department after 1932 * Adam Zamenhof, head of the ophthalmology department, director of the hospital (since 1939) * Natan Mesz, head of the X-ray department (since 1918) * J√≥zef Stefan Szper, head of the surgical ward (since 1934) * Wiktor Arkin, doctor in the ophthalmological ward from 1923 to 1940 * Stanis≈Çaw Leopold Lubliner, laryngologist and physiatrist until 1937Czy wiesz kto to jest, pod red.

Production  Starewicz created Lucanus Cervus in 1910 while he was director of the Museum of Natural History in Kaunas, Lithuania. He had been commissioned to produce four nature documentaries. Starewicz had originally intended to film live stag beetles rutting over a mate, but the stage lighting in use at the time would quickly kill the nocturnal insects. Instead, Starewicz experimented with making articulated puppets out of dried stag beetle specimens. He fitted them with wires glued to their abdomens by sealing wax, replacing their legs. Starewicz animated these puppets with stop-motion to recreate their fighting behavior as accurately as possible. The result was not only the first recorded use of puppetry in film, but the first use of dead insects as stop-motion puppets. Starewicz would make widespread use of stop-motion throughout his career as a filmmaker and animator. The unusual idea was reportedly inspired by the short film Les allumettes Anim√©es (The Animated Matches) (1908) by French animator √âmile Cohl.

The protocol was first outlined by Annika Monari and Alan Vey in a 2016 white paper. The two met in 2015 while studying for their master's degrees at Imperial College, London. They are co-founders and directors of the Aventus Protocol Foundation which oversees Aventus Systems, the only company running the protocol. The Aventus Protocol is based on Ethereum blockchain technology and its crypto token is the Aventus Token (AVT). The project was funded in two rounds. First by a private pre-sale and then, in September 2017, in an initial coin offering. The initial funding was reportedly ¬£26 million, including 60,000 Ether raised. The Aventus Protocol is intended to make purchasing tickets more transparent and selling them more profitable for an artist or venue. The protocol creates a unique identity for each ticket that is then stored on a public blockchain. Each transaction involving the ticket is likewise recorded publicly. Monari and Vey stated in their white paper that the protocol is a tool to combat counterfeit tickets, uncontrolled resale, and opaque pricing. The Aventus Protocol was used for some of the tickets sold for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. In 2018, Monari and Vey founded a second company, Artos, based in London. The company partners with ticketing companies to use blockchain technology to more efficiently control and gain visibility to a company's ticketing inventory as it moves through the supply chain.

The film completed a run of more than 100 days in Kerala theaters.https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/events/kochi/team-btech- make-a-stunning-entrance/articleshow/64449558.cms Plot The film is set in Bangalore, the third-most populous city in India, and a magnet for engineering students from Kerala. The story is about around half-dozen young men from Kerala whose lives and perceptions change as their friend, Azaad Mohammed, is killed in a terrorist attack. The group of men are led by Anand, a carefree B. Tech student, from a very affluent family. The Karnataka State Police proclaims that the incident was a suicide attack, committed by Azaad, and tries to close the investigation. The police even arrests several Muslim members of the group. Knowing that Nizar was not an Islamic terrorist, Anand and his friends do not accept the police explanation. With help of advocate Viswanath Iyyer, the group subsequently tries to prove the police version of the events wrong before the court.

He has led the Labour group on Plymouth City Council since 1998, including serving as leader of the council from 1998 to 2000, from 2003 to 2007 and from 2012 to 2016. Early life Evans was born in Ebbw Vale in Wales. He moved to Plymouth as an undergraduate, studying Environmental Science. He was a director of a co-operative printing company for thirteen years, and works as a local government consultant. Political career Evans first stood for election to Plymouth City Council in 1987 in Sutton and Mount Gould ward, losing to SDP‚ÄìLiberal Alliance candidates.http://www.electionscentre.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/06/Plymouth-1973-1995.pdf He was subsequently elected as a councillor to Ham ward in 1988, a seat he has held ever since. After the 1998 local election, Labour group leader John Ingham stood down, having led the council for seven years. Evans was subsequently elected leader of the Labour group, saying he wanted to prioritise investment, jobs and the tourism industry. He led the council until 2000, when the Conservatives won a majority of seats on the council. Evans became council leader again in 2003, crediting his victory to Conservative plans to close old people's homes. When Labour lost its majority in 2007, he said he was \\"proud of what [his] council has achieved\\", but \\"puzzled\\" at having lost control. Labour again took control of the council in 2012, with defeated Conservative council leader Vivien Pengelly blaming a cut in the top rate of income tax and the proposed pasty tax. Evans again returned as council leader on a platform including job creation, webcasting council meetings, and trying to stop the construction of an incinerator. In 2014, he was a signatory to an open letter to The Observer calling for an end to cuts to local government. The party lost control after the 2015 election, which left the council under no control, though Evans remained council leader. He was removed as council leader after the 2016 local elections, with local UK Independence Party councillors forming a coalition with the Conservatives. During this time, Evans supported a cross-party campaign for Plymouth to retain its warships. After Labour restored its majority in the 2018 council election, Evans returned as council leader with a manifesto including pledges to create a thousand new parking spaces and to construct new low-cost homes. Evans opposed plans to merge Devon and Cornwall Police with Dorset Police.  Honours and awards  Evans was named Council Leader of the Year in 2015. Evans was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to politics and local government in January 2016.

It is the leading media organization in the Oromia Region and broadcast on Eutelsat via the Ethiosat platform.  History  The channel is run by the Oromia Radio and Television Organization (ORTO), founded on July 12, 2006 by Proclamation number 113/2006 of the Regional Government, as Oromia mass media organization (OMMO). The organization was renamed by the regional government to Oromia Radio and TV Organization by the Proclamation No. 164/2011 in 2011. Notably Abiy Ahmed was a board member of the organization that runs OBN before assuming the office of Prime Minister. In February 2018 the president of the Oromia regional state, Lemma Megersa, pledged to defend the independence and impartiality of the state-run Oromia Broadcasting Network (OBN), among others. He stated this after a central committee meeting in Adama by the OPDO, the Oromo faction of the ruling EPRDF party that controls the Oromia region.  Programming  Content is mostly focused on news from the Oromia regional state, but also covers news from the national and international levels. The majority of broadcasts are in Afaan Oromo (the native language of the Oromo people) with some programs in Amharic (the federal language of Ethiopia) and English.  Political significance  Many prominent Oromo leaders in the government of Ethiopia use OBN as a platform to reach the majority of the Afaan Oromo speaking population such as when leading OPDO figure Abadula Gemeda announced his displeasure with the government's mistreatment of internally displaced Oromo people in 2017. In March 2018 OBN was the first to confirm a deadly incident in the border town of Moyale via an interview with the town's mayor. Controversy The Oromia Media Networks along with two broadcasters, Tigray TV and Dimtse Woyane were alleged to disseminate media propaganda by Ethiopian government following the death of Hachalu Hundessa on June 29, 2020. These three networks considered operated by two political parties, Oromo Liberation Front and Tigray People's Liberation Front, the oppressive ultranationalist parties whose ultimate goals are to take over the sovereignty powers. The two parties were labeled as \\"terrorist agent\\" by the government and responsible for inciting violence after Hachalu Hundessa death. The Federal Attorney-General launched an investigation on three broadcasters in connection with alleged roles in inciting ethnic violence in Ethiopia. The channels has been breaching the broadcasting laws and warned to lift off-air in Ethiopia and ordered to shut down proclamation as of July 6. However the channels guarantee for broadcast via international networks, primarily using North American networks.

Ferro had served twice as the Bishop of Bova while managing his archdiocese, first from 1950 to 1960 and again from 1973 until 1977. Ferro commenced his ecclesial studies in his late childhood and studied in Milan and Turin before completing his education in Rome. He began teaching and serving as a pastor before ascending to some leadership positions within the Somascans. This continued until he was appointed as an archbishop where he became renowned for his charitable outreach to the poor and downtrodden and for his consistent efforts in evangelization; these efforts increased following the Second Vatican Council when he sought to introduce renewal into his episcopal see. Ferro likewise tended to victims of flooding on at least two occasions in 1951 and in 1953 and opened his episcopal residence to those who lost their homes. He opened new schools and sporting facilities in addition to helping rebuild a chapel within the archdiocesan cathedral. His work earned him praise in 1971 from both Pope Paul VI and the Italian President Giuseppe Saragat who awarded him with a silver goblet dating back to the 1700s as a sign of his esteem for the prelate. The beatification process launched in 2008 and he has become titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue and titled him as Venerable in mid-2019. Life Giovanni Ferro was born on 13 November 1901 to the shoemaker Giovanni Battista Ferro and Carlotta Borio. He was baptized on 24 November in the local parish church. His priest cousin Tagliaferri served as a model for Ferro in his childhood as did the local parish priest and the nun Matilde. Ferro soon came to the decision to enter the priesthood and commenced his studies under the Somascan order on 5 August 1912, while he obtained a licentiate in 1917 in Milan after he had completed his high school education. On 7 October 1919 he commenced his novitiate with the order, which ended on 8 October 1920 at Sant'Alessio all'Aventino in Rome where he made his initial profession. The novice master Luigi Zambarelli held Ferro in high esteem and noted that he was \\"a little saint\\". Ferro made his solemn profession into the order on 14 March 1924 at the Santa Maria Maddalena parish church in Genoa. On 11 April 1925 he received his ordination to the priesthood in Chiavari from the local bishop Amedeo Casabona. In 1925 he obtained excellent grades while at the Pontifical Gregorian University and obtained his licentiate in philosophical studies. He later received his doctorate cum laude in theological studies in Turin on 27 May 1931. In 1931 he was made the rector for the Collegio Trevisio in Casale Monferrato, until 1938 when he was transferred to become the rector for the Collegio Gallio in Como. During World War II he helped those in need and tended to the poor and displaced. Ferro also risked himself in hiding the Jew Roberto Furcht from the S.S. and offered him free lodging. Following Benito Mussolini's death he kept hidden the late dictator's son Vittorio and the son-in-law of the late dictator's brother Arnaldo. The pair remained with Ferro until 12 November 1945 and had lodged with him since that April in fear of retribution and partisan attacks. On 1 October 1945 he was transferred to Genoa as the pastor for the Santa Maria Maddalena parish where he remained until 1950. In the meantime on 18 August 1948 he was elected as the provincial superior for the Liguria region of his order and held that position until his episcopal appointment. Ferro was appointed in 1950 as the Archbishop of Reggio Calabria in addition to being named as the Bishop of Bova. He received his episcopal consecration from Giuseppe Siri in the Genoa Cathedral on 29 October 1950 before being enthroned in his new archdiocese on 2 December and then in Bova on 8 December. In his see he constructed new parishes and in 1951 and 1953 tended to the victims of rampant floods, opening his episcopal residence to the victims. Ferro likewise oversaw the repair of the Sacramento chapel in the archdiocesan cathedral and helped in the construction of new schools and sporting facilities. From 1963 until 1965 he attended all sessions of the Second Vatican Council and sought to institute a similar program of renewal in his archdiocese following the Council's closure. In 1962 he issued his pastoral letter Ut Unum sint. Pope John XXIII named him as an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne. He served consecutive terms from 1950 until 1977 as the President of the Calabrian Episcopal Conference. Ferro at one point led a diocesan pilgrimage to Rome to visit Pope Paul VI and another to Jerusalem. In 1968 he presided over another pilgrimage designed to follow in the footsteps of Saint Peter and Saint Paul and he took this time to visit the Patriarch of Constantinople Athenagoras. In 1971 the President Giuseppe Saragat awarded him with a silver chalice dating back to the 1700s in recognition for all Ferro had done in his archdiocese and as a token of his esteem. In 1950 he made his first pastoral visit and announced his second on 30 December 1958. He announced the third on 7 March 1965 and the final one on 2 December 1972. On 13 November 1976 he forwarded his letter of resignation to the pope who approved it on 14 June 1977; it was at 12:00 pm on 14 June that he announced that his resignation had been accepted. The municipal council in Reggio Calabria made him a citizen on 11 August in a unanimous decision in recognition and praise for Ferro's works and for his efforts in the archdiocese. His last Mass and departure was celebrated on 27 August in which he was hoisted up on a chair and carried at the celebration's conclusion on the shoulders of some men. He left for Rome where he lived at Sant'Alessio all'Aventino and later returned to Reggio Calabria on 11 November 1978. Pope John Paul II visited Ferro twice, in 1984 and 1988. Ferro suffered from disease in the 1980s that took its toll on his health and led to his death during the morning on 18 April 1992 which happened to be Holy Saturday. His remains were interred in the side chapel in the archdiocesan cathedral where there was later installed a bronze monument dedicated to him. Beatification process The beatification process commenced on 8 April 2008 under Pope Benedict XVI after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled Ferro as a Servant of God and issued the nihil obstat (no objections) edict that opened the cause. The diocesan process was launched in the Reggio Calabria-Bova archdiocese on 21 May 2008 and concluded on 29 September 2011, after having collected documentation and witness testimonies in regards to Ferro's life and reputation for holiness. The C.C.S. validated the diocesan process on 7 December 2012. Ferro became titled as Venerable on 5 July 2019 after Pope Francis confirmed that Ferro had lived a life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for the cause is the Somascan priest Giovanni Gariglio.

The exact number of medals struck is disputed, with sources citing numbers between 450 and 3000. The medal was the only one of its kind, Ceylon being the only British crown colony to issue a medal of its own for its citizens' service in the war. Those awarded the medal were servicemen of either the Ceylon Defence Force (including the all-European Ceylon Planters' Rifle Corps) or the Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. Design The medal was cast in bronze, having dimensions of 45 x 52 x 3 mm. The obverse depicts the personification of Ceylon- a seated, right-facing robed and laureate female figure placing, with her right hand, a laurel wreath crown on the bowed head of a left-facing soldier kneeling on his left knee. The soldier rests his cap on the ground with his right hand, while the background depicts a multi- rayed sun setting into the sea behind them. An inscription above the scene reads: Above the words is a short piece of laurel wreath, bound. The reverse depicts a front-facing illustration of Victory- a winged, robed and laureate female figure seated on a throne. Her right hand is raised aloft, holding a laurel wreath, while her left holds a shield emblazoned with the coat of arms of Ceylon.

A few months later, 8 voucher specimens were brought to Europe. The holotype specimen is ZFMK 46500, a subadult. Distribution The Yemen monitor inhabits mainly the Tihama, which is the southwest coast of the Arabian Peninsula from Ta'izz and Khobar to the south of Wadi Maraba and the foothills of the southwestern Arabian mountain range. It occurs at altitudes from 300 to 1800 meters and is not found in the coastal lowlands. The animals live mainly in savannah-like areas or lighter forests, of which the soil mostly consists of sand and stones. Description Yemen monitors are stoutly built and grow up to 115 cm long. The nasal, temporal and parietal area is swollen, the oblique and slit-like nostril sits right in front of the eyes. Yemen monitor are dark brown and striped with lines that are more or less pronounced depending on the individual. The tail also has dark lines, is strongly laterally compressed and has a median crest. A characteristic feature of Yemen's Waran is the striking yellow lines over the snout. The lines are black for specimens from the highlands near Ta'izz. Habitat The Yemen monitor often lives close to shallow water or in dry river beds. During the driest season of the year in the months from January to March its activity may be reduced or even suspended.  Behaviour  Deep burrows are excavated under rocks and tree stumps. They are relatively docile in captivity for a monitor. Its diet mostly consists of invertebrates such as snails and insects, especially beetles. Large vertebrate prey are presumably taken as well when given the chance to. References * Wolfgang B√∂hme: Varanus yemensis.

According to the legends, Giraldo was from Garganta la Olla, a few leagues from Plasencia. During the time of the Catholic Monarchs, Don Lucas de Carvajal, captain of arms, came to the place to look for soldiers. He asked for accommodation in Giraldo's house. Gila refused and chased him through town with his gun. Don Lucas swore to return and avenge himself with Gila's deceit, which he fulfilled by outwitting her and earning her honor. Discovering the deception, Gila retaliated by in turn by throwing Don Lucas down a ravine. He fled to the mountains, where he survived in a cave and took care of cattle. When a traveler was lost, he was welcomed by her into the cave, and after a copious amount of meal, drinks and sexual acts so that he the victim would tire and go to sleep, he would be beheaded. Many bones could be found inside the cave. Up to here, the legend according to the version of Luis V√©lez de Guevara and the romances, it historically can represent a real woman ‚Äì Isabel de Carvajal. The real historical facts were probably mixed with the legends and Extremadura myths of the mountain people, for some women who lived in the mountains led a life of elemental rusticity. Gila was captured and executed in the Plaza de Plasencia. The character starts in no less than twenty-one versions of romances and is later treated in different theatrical pieces by Luis V√©lez de Guevara (1613), Lope de Vega (1617) and a 'a lo divino' version by Jos√© de Valdivielso.
