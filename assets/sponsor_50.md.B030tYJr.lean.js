The origin of this type of cheese is associated with the Alps located in Germany/Austria. Emmental in nature like its cousin the Swiss cheese, it is featured with tiny holes known as 'teardrops\\". Similar to the majority of hard/semi-hard cheese, the more it is matured, the more flavour it develops. The alpk√§se cheese from Trentino Alto Adige is made from cow milk. Some of those cheese varieties, exceeding 60 products, native to that place include Asiago Antico Maso Rosso, Arunda, Asiago d'allevo, Asiago Mezzano cheese and Asiago Pressato Trentino cheese.  Austria  In Austria, Alpk√§se refers to a hard cheese that resembles Bergk√§se in taste and texture. The difference between these cheeses lies in the period and place of production. Bergk√§se is produced in the low mountain range (between 600 and 1500 m) and year-round, so even in winter, when the animals are in the stables and fed with hay. Alpk√§se, on the other hand, is only produced in the summer between May and September on high mountain meadows above 1500 m (Alpine pastures or alps), where the animals graze Alpine herbs. Therefore, Alpk√§se is a seasonal product. An example of Austrian Alpk√§se is the Vorarlberger Alpk√§se or Tiroler Alpk√§se both of which have been registered as PDO. The production of Alpk√§se is closely tied to the traditional farming practice of Alpine transhumance.

Epigenome editing or Epigenome engineering is a type of genetic engineering in which the epigenome is modified at specific sites using engineered molecules targeted to those sites (as opposed to whole-genome modifications). Whereas gene editing involves changing the actual DNA sequence itself, epigenetic editing involves modifying and presenting DNA sequences to proteins and other DNA binding factors that influence DNA function. By \\"editing‚Äù epigenomic features in this manner, researchers can determine the exact biological role of an epigenetic modification at the site in question. The engineered proteins used for epigenome editing are composed of a DNA binding domain that target specific sequences and an effector domain that modifies epigenomic features. Currently, three major groups of DNA binding proteins have been predominantly used for epigenome editing: Zinc finger proteins, Transcription Activator-Like Effectors (TALEs) and nuclease deficient Cas9 fusions (CRISPR).  General concept  Comparing genome-wide epigenetic maps with gene expression has allowed researchers to assign either activating or repressing roles to specific modifications. The importance of DNA sequence in regulating the epigenome has been demonstrated by using DNA motifs to predict epigenomic modification. Further insights into mechanisms behind epigenetics have come from in vitro biochemical and structural analyses. Using model organisms, researchers have been able to describe the role of many chromatin factors through knockout studies. However knocking out an entire chromatin modifier has massive effects on the entire genome, which may not be an accurate representation of its function in a specific context. As one example of this, DNA methylation occurs at repeat regions, promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies. Although DNA methylation at gene promoters typically correlates with gene repression, methylation at gene bodies is correlated with gene activation, and DNA methylation may also play a role in gene splicing. The ability to directly target and edit individual methylation sites is critical to determining the exact function of DNA methylation at a specific site. Epigenome editing is a powerful tool that allows this type of analysis. For site-specific DNA methylation editing as well as for histone editing, genome editing systems have been adapted into epigene editing systems. In short, genome homing proteins with engineered or naturally occurring nuclease functions for gene editing, can be mutated and adapted into purely delivery systems. An epigenetic modifying enzyme or domain can be fused to the homing protein and local epigenetic modifications can be altered upon protein recruitment. = Targeting proteins =  TALE  The Transcription Activator-Like Effector (TALE) protein recognizes specific DNA sequences based on the composition of its DNA binding domain. This allows the researcher to construct different TALE proteins to recognize a target DNA sequence by editing the TALE's primary protein structure. The binding specificity of this protein is then typically confirmed using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Sanger sequencing of the resulting DNA fragment. This confirmation is still required on all TALE sequence recognition research. When used for epigenome editing, these DNA binding proteins are attached to an effector protein. Effector proteins that have been used for this purpose include Ten- eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1), Lysine (K)-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1) and Calcium and integrin binding protein 1 (CIB1).  Zinc finger proteins  The use of zinc finger-fusion proteins to recognize sites for epigenome editing has been explored as well. Maeder et al. has constructed a ZF-TET1 protein for use in DNA demethylation. These zinc finger proteins work similarly to TALE proteins in that they are able to bind to sequence specific sites in on the DNA based on their protein structure which can be modified. Chen et al. have successfully used a zinc finger DNA binding domain coupled with the TET1 protein to induce demethylation of several previously silenced genes.  CRISPR-Cas  The Clustered Regulatory Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-Cas system functions as a DNA site-specific nuclease. In the well-studied type II CRISPR system, the Cas9 nuclease associates with a chimera composed of tracRNA and crRNA. This chimera is frequently referred to as a guide RNA (gRNA). When the Cas9 protein associates with a DNA region-specific gRNA, the Cas9 cleaves DNA at targeted DNA loci. However, when the D10A and H840A point mutations are introduced, a catalytically-dead Cas9 (dCas9) is generated that can bind DNA but will not cleave. The dCas9 system has been utilized for targeted epigenetic reprogramming in order to introduce site-specific DNA methylation. By fusing the DNMT3a catalytic domain with the dCas9 protein, dCas9-DNMT3a is capable of achieving targeted DNA methylation of a targeted region as specified by the present guide RNA. Similarly, dCas9 has been fused with the catalytic core of the human acetyltransferase p300. dCas9-p300 successfully catalyzes targeted acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27. A variant in CRISPR epigenome editing (called FIRE-Cas9) allows to reverse the changes made, in case something went wrong.Rapid and reversible epigenome editing by endogenous chromatin regulators = Commonly used effector proteins = TET1 induces demethylation of cytosine at CpG sites. This protein has been used to activate genes that are repressed by CpG methylation and to determine the role of individual CpG methylation sites. LSD1 induces the demethylation of H3K4me1/2, which also causes an indirect effect of deacetylation on H3K27. This effector can be used on histones in enhancer regions, which can changes the expression of neighboring genes. CIB1 is a light sensitive cryptochrome, this cryptochrome is fused to the TALE protein. A second protein contains an interaction partner (CRY2) fused with a chromatin/DNA modifier (ex. SID4X). CRY2 is able to interact with CIB1 when the cryptochrome has been activated by illumination with blue light. The interaction allows the chromatin modifier to act on the desired location. This means that the modification can be performed in an inducible and reversible manner, which reduces long-term secondary effects that would be caused by constitutive epigenetic modification.  Applications  = Studying enhancer function and activity = Editing of gene enhancer regions in the genome through targeted epigenetic modification has been demonstrated by Mendenhall et al. (2013). This study utilized a TALE-LSD1 effector fusion protein in order to target enhancers of genes, to induce enhancer silencing in order to deduce enhancer activity and gene control. Targeting specific enhancers followed by locus specific RT-qPCR allows for the genes affected by the silenced enhancer to be determined. Alternatively, inducing enhancer silencing in regions upstream of genes allows for gene expression to be altered. RT-qPCR can then be utilized to study effects of this on gene expression. This allows for enhancer function and activity to be studied in detail. = Determining the function of specific methylation sites = It is important to understand the role specific methylation sites play regulating in gene expression. To study this, one research group used a TALE- TET1 fusion protein to demethylate a single CpG methylation site. Although this approach requires many controls to ensure specific binding to target loci, a properly performed study using this approach can determine the biological function of a specific CpG methylation site. = Determining the role of epigenetic modifications directly = Epigenetic editing using an inducible mechanism offers a wide array of potential use to study epigenetic effects in various states. One research group employed an optogenetic two- hybrid system which integrated the sequence specific TALE DNA-binding domain with a light-sensitive cryptochrome 2 protein (CIB1). Once expressed in the cells, the system was able to inducibly edit histone modifications and determine their function in a specific context.  Limitations  Sequence specificity is critically important in epigenome editing and must be carefully verified (this can be done using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by Sanger sequencing to verify the targeted sequence). It is unknown if the TALE fusion may cause effects on the catalytic activity of the epigenome modifier. This could be especially important in effector proteins that require multiple subunits and complexes such as the Polycomb repressive complex. Proteins used for epigenome editing may obstruct ligands and substrates at the target site. The TALE protein itself may even compete with transcription factors if they are targeted to the same sequence. In addition, DNA repair systems could reverse the alterations on the chromatin and prevent the desired changes from being made. It is therefore necessary for fusion constructs and targeting mechanisms to be optimized for reliable and repeatable epigenome editing.

He began shooting on an iPhone in 2008, shortly after it first came out, and began using the Hipstamatic app around the time it launched in 2010. His first use of the iPhone while on assignment was in 2010, documenting the abandoned town of Uravan, Colorado, for The New Yorker.‚ÄúVideo: Uravan Ghost Town,‚Äù The New Yorker, September 6, 2010. After shooting in Libya using iPhone, DSLR and Holga cameras, Lowy suggested to Hipstamatic that the company create a new lens and filter combination better suited for photojournalism, that would be more acceptable for Hipstamatic critics in photojournalism. He collaborated with the company on the new filter, which has minimal processing, was released in 2012 and named The Lowy Lens.

He also feels the anonymity, ease of use and light weight of an iPhone is helpful when reporting in conflict zones. He appreciates that the resulting photos have a unique aesthetic, which helps bring attention for the war or social issues the images are documenting.

Malaysia's former Prime Minister, Najib Razak, stated that the aircraft's flight ended somewhere in the Indian Ocean, but no further explanation had been given. Despite searches finding debris considered with strong certainty to originate from the crash, official announcements were questioned by many critics, and several theories about the disappearance were proposed. Some of these theories were described as conspiracy theories. Background Victims' relatives questioned the veracity of the Malaysian government's statements about the demise of the aircraft, and organized a protest at the Malaysian embassy in Beijing with the goal of forcing the Malaysian government to reveal any withheld information about Flight 370's whereabouts. Rob Brotherton, a lecturer in psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, wrote that conspiracy theories emerge immediately after any catastrophe occurs and conclusive information about why they do so remains unavailable. Andrew Leonard wrote that conspiracy theorists were bolstered by the revelation of new satellite data two weeks after the flight disappeared that had been hidden from the public. Other factors involve the lack of a distress signal from the plane. According to Barbara Demick of the Los Angeles Times, critics of the Malaysian government's statements also found support in the Joint Agency Coordination Centre's announcement on 29 May 2014 that the plane was not in the search area authorities had been combing since April 2014. Searches discovered debris considered to originate from the crash with strong certainty. =Criticism and response= Conspiracy-focused internet sites claim that the official statement that the plane crashed into the Indian Ocean is \\"a blatant cover-up.\\" They note that a Boeing 777 does not have the structural integrity to survive crashing into the ocean, and that it would be comparable to hitting a concrete wall at terminal velocity. If Flight 370 hit the ocean, they say, it would have been broken into tens of thousands of pieces, many of which float on water (such as the seat cushions) and would be seen washing up on regional shores or easily spotted by search teams. Those criticisms diminished after several pieces of the aircraft were positively identified in the years after its disappearance. Harvard professor Cass Sunstein noted that the conflicting information initially released by the Malaysian government explains the interest in alternative theories. Sunstein, who has written on the topic, argued in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on 20 March 2014 that conspiracy theories in general often are born out of horrific and disastrous situations because such events make people angry, fearful and looking for a \\"target\\". David Soucie, a former FAA inspector, has said that the theories that have been put forth in this matter are important when there is a lack of knowledge, as the theories and notions help us to consider various possibilities. On 26 March 2014, he stated on CNN: > In an accident investigation, it's a critical part to come up with theories. > Especially right now when we don't have anything. We don't have anything > tangible. We don't have something to say, hey, yes ‚Äì because we don't know > where that airplane is and we need to find out why. If you take one theory, > the airplane would be where we're looking at right now. If you take another > theory, where there was nefarious intent, they're trying to avoid radars, > the airplane could be somewhere else. If you say it was ‚Äì whatever it is, > you've got to use these theories, weigh them against the facts so you know > which one to go to.CNN Transcripts ‚Äì Piers Morgan Live ‚Äì 26 March 2014. > Retrieved 28 March 2014. Tim Black, deputy editor of Spiked, wrote: \\"...it's in this darkness, this near absence of knowledge [about MH370], that speculation has flourished,\\" and an editorial in the Chicago Sun-Times, not only stated that \\"conspiracy theories fill a vacuum when facts are scarce,\\" but also urged governments to search for the plane to debunk these theories and give victims' family members peace of mind. The common hypothesis, cited also here, that MH370 avoided Indonesian radar is based only on a statement that the plane was not observed by Indonesia. It is easy for radar observers to visually miss an unexpected object. Hijacking The possibility of a simple hijacking has been brought up by various news outlets, including ABC News and the Los Angeles Times. Speculation has mounted about the possibility that hijackers took the plane to a remote island, although no group has claimed responsibility; however, unofficial researchers have identified more than 600 possible runways at which the plane was capable of landing. No confirmation has been received from Malaysian officials. The credibility of several hijacking theories have become further marginalized following the discovery of the first definitive fragments of MH370 wreckage in July 2015. French air traffic specialists Jean-Marc Garot, Michel Delarche and Jean-Luc Marchand launched a website with their hypothesis concerning a possible hijacking, with a subsequent location of the aircraft (following an emergency ditching due to fuel exhaustion) estimated at around , in the Indian Ocean near Christmas Island.MH370: An Operational study of a start to end Piloted Trajectory - A new search area, by Jean-Luc Marchand, Philippe Gasser, Michel Delarche and Jean-Marc Garot - Air Traffic Management (ATM) Experts However, the final report from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), released in 2017, examined the possibility of controlled glide/ditching and found it very unlikely. Also their hypothesis concerning a location of the crashed plane different from the searched locations is not the only one that exists. =Electronic hijacking= Electronic hijacking uses systems and programming already factory-installed within the B777 flight management system. This is different from hacking or cyber-attack in that it requires access to the B777's security system through access purposefully programmed into the software. Notable proponents of this theory include former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. In 2014, he said: \\"Clearly Boeing and certain agencies have the capacity to take over uninterruptible control of commercial airliners of which MH370 B777 is one\\". In this statement he was referring to off-board hijackers with access to MH370's Flight Management System via the 2003 patented Uninterruptible Autopilot. In 2018, he became prime minister of Malaysia again. Another proponent of this theory is the historian Norman Davies.https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid;=12191656 =\\"Spoofed\\" satellite data= Technology writer Jeff Wise has developed a theory in which the aircraft's controls were taken over by hijackers from the electronics and equipment bay, accessible through a hatch in the first-class cabin floor. Wise theorizes that the Inmarsat satellite pings were a deliberately laid false trail created by feeding the plane's satellite communications system false data which in turn caused the system to make false frequency corrections. These would, when later scrutinized, lead investigators to conclude the plane was headed south, when according to Wise's theory it actually flew north and possibly landed at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. () =Terrorist attack= Shortly after the aircraft disappeared, some news agencies reported that it may have been an act of terrorism, possibly a jihadist attack. Between 9 and 14 March 2014, media mogul Rupert Murdoch tweeted that Flight 370's disappearance \\"confirms jihadists turning to make trouble for China .\\" He later suggested the flight might have been hidden in northern Pakistan, \\"like Bin Laden\\". These remarks have not been confirmed, and were characterized as conspiracy theories by Shiv Malik in The Guardian. The following month, the Russian newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets endorsed a similar theory, claiming that \\"unknown terrorists\\" had hijacked the plane, flown it to Afghanistan, and then held the crew and passengers hostage. =North Korea= A story circulated on Reddit that MH370 had sufficient fuel to be hijacked to North Korea as was done in 1969 with a Korean Air Lines YS-11. In late July 2015, in an article about MH370 \\"conspiracy theories\\", The Independent briefly mentioned that it had received an email claiming the U.S. had authorized the plane to be shot down because it was allegedly carrying a nuclear warhead to North Korea, though The Independent immediately added the joke \\"Or it could still be aliens.\\" =Acquisition of Freescale staff= A variety of social media posts and email chain letters claim that a patent (#8671381) was approved days after the disappearance of the MH370, and the right to the patent was split five ways ‚Äì 20% to Freescale Semiconductor and 20% each to four employees, all of whom were passengers on the plane. The patent deals with fabrication of integrated circuits on a semiconductor wafer. The urban myth website snopes.com suggests that there is no evidence that the four inventors listed on the patent application were on the aircraft passenger list, nor that they were entitled to a 20% share of the patent, and it says it is unlikely that their share would revert to Freescale on their death as presented in the email. Retired Delta Air Lines Captain Field McConnell claimed that the aircraft was seized to obtain stealth knowledge of classified patents from 22 Chinese employees of US-based Freescale. McConnell also claimed that the company has developed a classified technology that uses paint and electronics to enable traditional aircraft to be overhauled into stealthy jets. =Diego Garcia= Conspiracy theorists have suggested that MH370 was either captured by the United States and then flown to the United States' military base on the atoll of Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory or that the plane landed at the base directly after being instructed to travel there. The latter theory was raised at a White House daily briefing on 18 March, whereupon press secretary Jay Carney responded, \\"I'll rule that one out.\\" Underpinning the Diego Garcia theory were several elements, one of which was the co-pilot's mobile phone contact and the plane's westward turn, both of which were consistent with a flight path toward the island. In that vein, it was reported by the Daily Mirror, without giving a concrete source, that the captain had trained in landing on an Indian Ocean island with a short runway, using a flight simulator in his home computer.Flight MH370: Missing jet pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah is prime suspect because he cleared his diary (Daily Mirror, 23 June 2014) Several mass media sources reported that the captain had trained using his aviasimulator to land on five runways (at least 1,000 meters long) in the Indian Ocean region, namely Diego Garcia and Male International Airport (MLE) and other airstrips in India and Sri Lanka. These allegations were disputed by the FBI, which reported that after analyzing the impounded flight simulator, it had found \\"nothing suspicious whatsoever\\" and said that the Mirrors reports about the simulator's contents were \\"unsubstantiated and unsourced\\". Giving a new twist to the MH370 missing story, a former French airline boss has claimed that the Malaysia Airlines flight was shot down by the U.S. military near their base on Diego Garcia. In an article published on 18 March 2014, journalists Farah Ahmed and Ahmed Naif of the Maldivian newspaper Haveeru wrote: \\"...several residents of Kuda Huvadhoo told Haveeru on Tuesday that they saw a 'low flying jumbo jet' at around 06:15 on March 8. They said that it was a white aircraft, with red stripes across it ‚Äì which is what the Malaysia Airlines flights typically look like. Eyewitnesses from the Kuda Huvadhoo concurred that the jet was traveling North to South-East, towards the Southern tip of the Maldives ‚Äì Addu. They also noted the incredibly loud noise that the flight made when it flew over the island. 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly.' said an eyewitness. 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' Mohamed Zaheem, the Island Councilor of Kuda Huvadhoo, said that the residents of the island had spoken about the incident.\\" The discovery in late July 2015 of debris from a Boeing 777, on a beach in the island of La R√©union, east of Madagascar, suspected (and later confirmedShahrestani, Vin \\"MH370: Malaysian government confirms debris is from a Boeing 777\\" The Telegraph (UK), 5 August 2015) to be from MH370, quickly led to renewed Internet speculation that the plane had been shot down near Diego Garcia (which is 1,475 miles away from La R√©union) out of fears of a terrorist attack, although oceanographers such as Professor Charitha Pattiaratchi, from the University of Western Australia, said that \\"the arrival of MH370 debris in R√©union would conform to the expected path of ocean currents from the point in its flight path where it was believed to have crashed\\". Many people, including some of those who believed the plane had landed safely on Diego Garcia (or elsewhere), quickly dismissed the debris as a fake. =Phantom cellphone hypothesis= Some had speculated that the passengers were still alive but could not answer their cellphones‚Äîsometimes known as the \\"phantom cellphone theory\\". This was based on early reports that family members of Flight 370 passengers heard ringing (as opposed to a busy/off signal) while calling the passengers' phones, though this was after the plane disappeared. However, this was later challenged by Jeff Kagan, a wireless analyst, who in an email to NBC News explained that the network may still produce \\"ringbacks\\" as it searches for a connection, even if the cellphone has been destroyed. =Crew suicide/hijacking= The cockpit had the mandated anti-hijacker fortified doors that could prevent locked-out crew or passengers from interfering with a suicide or hijacking into the Southern Ocean. This can be compared to SilkAir Flight 185 (a posited pilot suicide incident in 1997), EgyptAir Flight 990 (1999), LAM Mozambique Airlines Flight 470 (2013), as well as the later Germanwings Flight 9525 (2015). On 17 February 2014, less than three weeks before Flight 370 disappeared, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 702 had been hijacked when the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cabin and diverted the aircraft to seek asylum in Switzerland. Shortly after Flight 370's disappearance, media reports revealed that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah's wife and three children moved out of his house the day before the disappearance; and a friend claimed that Captain Shah was seeing another woman and Shah's relationship with her was also in trouble. Claims of domestic problems have been denied by Shah's family. A fellow pilot and long-time associate of Shah stated the Captain was \\"terribly upset\\" that his marriage was falling apart. Police were also investigating reports that Shah received a two-minute phone call prior to the flight's departure from an unidentified woman using a mobile phone number obtained with a false identity. Furthermore, Captain Shah was also a supporter of Malaysian opposition politician Anwar Ibrahim, who was sentenced to jail on 7 March after an earlier acquittal on sodomy charges was overturned in a move viewed as politically motivated. Investigators noted strange behaviour by Shah from conducting 170 interviews‚Äînamely, that the Captain had made no social or professional plans for after 8 March, when Flight 370 disappeared. However, according to the French journalist Florence de Changy who wrote a book about the flight, dismissing \\"100 per cent of the official narrative\\", Shah made an appointment with his dentist to get back his tooth crown when the dentist phoned him a few days before 8 March. News reports about the Captain's lack of social plans and flight simulator exercises cite results of the police enquiry into the pilots, which have been shared with some of the investigation team but have not been released publicly. However, news reports on 23 July 2014 stated that the police considered the possible culpability of all those onboard the plane, and identified the captain as the prime suspect‚Äîif it is proven human intervention was involved. The United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation reconstructed the deleted data from Captain Shah's home flight simulator; a Malaysian government spokesman indicated that \\"nothing sinister\\" had been found on it. However, The Sunday Times later reported that among deleted flight paths performed on the flight simulator, investigators found a flight path into the Southern Ocean where a simulated landing was made on an island with a small runway. In 2016, a leaked American document stated that a route on the pilot's home flight simulator closely matching the projected flight over the Indian Ocean was found during the FBI analysis of the hard drive of the computer used for the flight simulator. This was later confirmed by the ATSB, although it stressed that this did not prove the pilot's involvement, and by the Malaysian government. A book, Goodnight Malaysian 370, was published in August 2014 by New Zealanders Geoff Taylor and Ewan Wilson; the authors blamed a deliberate act of the pilot for the aircraft's disappearance, but admitted they were not able to \\"provide any conclusive evidence to support his theory\\" nor any motive. Ewan Wilson had previously dismissed the fire emergency theory as unlikely. New Zealand aviation expert Peter Clark stated that to take over the aircraft took \\"immense knowledge\\" and that even the co-pilot would not have been sufficiently skilled to disable the communications system and reprogramme a seven-hour flight off-course. However, Clark admitted the theory would be difficult to prove even if the data recorders were found, because the voice recorders would likely have been overwritten; and because, if the pilot was in control of the aircraft, then instrument data would report no anomalies. Shah's family vehemently denied the possibility of pilot suicide. Former British Airways senior Boeing 777 pilot Simon Hardy told BBC News that the plane's route was \\"probably very accurate flying rather than just a coincidence\\", and noted that the aircraft's turn toward the north-west over the Malacca Strait allowed a clear view of the captain's home island of Penang: In May 2018, Simon Hardy also claimed on 60 Minutes Australia that the captain used the flight as a murder-suicide and had deliberately flown the plane over his hometown of Penang before turning right and ditching the plane over the Indian Ocean. He said they found these results by reconstructing the captain's flight plan from the military radar and that the captain had avoided detection of the plane by military radar by flying along the border of Malaysia and Thailand, crossing in and out of each country's airspaces. Fire A number of theories suggest that the disappearance may have been the result of a fire in the cockpit, cargo compartment, landing gear, or another part of the plane. In an earlier incident involving a Boeing 777, on 29 July 2011, EgyptAir Flight 667 suffered an intense oxygen-fed cockpit fire while still on the ground which destroyed the flight controls, the instruments and burnt a hole through the hull of the aircraft. Despite the arrival of firefighters within three minutes, the fire took 90 minutes to extinguish. Malaysia Air's maintenance records for the 777 aircraft are required to include information on whether the FAA-mandated fix to the wiring near the co- pilot's oxygen hose and replacement of the oxygen hose with one with no metallic components was performed. Another suggestion is that the pilots had turned back and were attempting an emergency landing at the nearest suitable airport in Northern Malaysia, perhaps Penang International Airport or Langkawi International Airport (Langkawi Island), a 13,000-foot airstrip with an approach over water with no obstacles. The emergency may have been due to an incident similar to the 11 July 1991 accident involving a Douglas DC-8, Nigeria Airways Flight 2120, where a tire caught fire on takeoff, and the later spreading of the fire led to the destruction of the aircraft with the loss of 261 lives. In another accident, involving a fire on a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 on 2 September 1998, Swissair Flight 111 from New York to Geneva developed a cockpit fire in the electrical wiring that spread rapidly, leading to a loss of flight instruments and control. The aircraft crashed into the Atlantic Ocean with the loss of 229 lives, 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from shore, southwest of Halifax International Airport, Nova Scotia, where the plane was attempting an emergency landing. In the Swissair case the transponders and communications were shut off as the crew pulled the busses in an attempt to control the fire. Shoot-down hypothesis American political commentator Rush Limbaugh, according to CNN, speculated that the aircraft may have been shot down. Supporters of this theory have noted that civilian aircraft have been shot down by military forces in the past, with Iran Air Flight 655 by the United States in 1988 and KAL 007 by the Soviet Union in 1983 being two frequently cited examples. On 19 March 2014, news agency reporter Scott Mayerowitz of Associated Press described \\"Accidental Shootdown\\" as one of seven \\"leading, plausible theories\\", but added that there was \\"no evidence that Flight 370 was brought down by a government entity\\". A Malaysian defense official, Ackbal bin Haji Abdul Samad, said it was \\"highly not possible\\" that his country's air force had shot down the plane. According to The Financial Express, the Malaysian Air Force detected the plane on radar while it was in flight, but took no action because it was believed to be a \\"friendly\\" aircraft. In May 2014, author Nigel Cawthorne's book Flight MH370: The Mystery was published. Cawthorne alleged that after the jet was shot down during a U.S.-Thai Joint Strike Fighter jet training exercise, searchers intentionally were sent astray as part of a sophisticated cover-up. The book received considerable criticism, especially from The Australian where it was characterised thus: \\"Cawthorne undoes everybody's good work by retrieving every obsolete and discredited non-fact from the trash, slapping the whole lot between covers.\\" Relatives of those aboard Flight 370 criticised the book as \\"premature and insensitive\\". In a CNN interview on 24 April 2014, the Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak, stated only that the radar \\"tracked an aircraft which did a turn back, but they were not exactly sure whether it was MH370. What they were sure of was that the aircraft was not deemed to be hostile.\\" On 22 December 2014 the former head of Proteus Airlines, Marc Dugain, claimed that the plane may have been shot down by U.S. military personnel out of fear of an attack similar to the September 11 attacks on their Navy Base in Diego Garcia. The claims were described by the source article as \\"wild\\". Incidentally, later that same year a different Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was shot down over Ukraine by a surface-to-air missile. Cyberattack The hypothesis that a cyberattack may have been carried out on Flight 370 has been raised, primarily based on statements made by Sally Leivesley, a former scientific advisor to the UK government. Whether existing security on commercial flights is sufficient to prevent such an attack is also a matter of debate, although Boeing has dismissed the possibility. A spokeswoman for the company, Gayla Keller, said that they were \\"confident in the robust protection of all flight critical systems and inability for a hacker to gain access by either external or internal means on the 777 and all Boeing airplanes.\\" While supporters of this theory have cited Hugo Teso's app which hacked into pilot-training software, which Teso presented at a conference in April 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration and other major governmental bodies dismissed the significance of the app. They stated that the software on an actual plane would be different from the software on which Teso had tested his app.  Vertical entry into the sea  A mathematics professor from Texas A&M; University has argued that the plane must have entered the sea vertically; any other angle of entry would have splintered the airplane to many pieces, which would have necessarily been found already. MH17 and QZ8501 connections On 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine. Because it, like Flight 370, was also a Boeing 777, some conspiracy theorists have suggested that the plane that crashed in Ukraine was actually Flight 370. This is based in part on photographs of the crash scene, which conspiracy theorists claim show that the plane that crashed in Ukraine had structural differences from MH17. Experts have dismissed this theory and argued that it is merely coincidental that both planes involved belonged to the same airline. When Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed on 28 December 2014, various similarities with MH370 were noted, including that both airlines were Malaysian-owned, and that both planes lost contact with air traffic control. There was also a reported conspiracy theory involving an alleged prediction on 15 December 2014 on Chinese news sites cite the user's name as \\"ËÄÅÁôæÂßìÊúâËá™Â∑±ÁöÑ‰πê\\", which can be translated as 'the common people have their own pleasures'. The Chinese term \\"Ê•º‰∏ª\\" could be hyper-literally read as 'master of a building', but this would be non-idiomatic, and in the context of Internet forums it invariably refers to the opener of a forum thread, referred to in English Internet slang as the 'original poster' or OP.}}). The user's post warned Chinese people to stay away from AirAsia as it would be attacked, as MH370 and MH17 allegedly had been (according to the user), as part of a conspiracy by a \\"black hand\\" or \\"despicable international bully\\" to harm Malaysian-owned airlines. Other online posters suggested that the user was either a Chinese intelligence official or a hacker who had come across secret information. Physically improbable theories The theory that MH370 may have been consumed by a black hole received considerable attention when Don Lemon asked, on CNN, whether it was \\"preposterous\\" that it could have happened. Lemon was criticised for this by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, and by former U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General Mary Schiavo, who, while appearing on CNN, said that \\"...a small black hole would suck in our entire universe so we know it's not that.\\" TheWire.com (which \\"wasn't satisfied\\" with Schiavo's answer) obtained detailed reasons why a black hole couldn't swallow a plane from Columbia University astronomy professor David J. Helfand and Peter Michelson, a professor of physics at Stanford University. It is possible that Schiavo was expressing herself humorously, and did not expect to be taken literally. Another hypothesis is that a meteor might have struck the plane; however, the statistical probability for this is extremely low. A poll posted on CNN's website reported that 9% of respondents thought it was either very or somewhat likely that the plane was abducted by aliens, \\"time travelers or beings from another dimension\\".  Claims of responsibility  On 9 March 2014, members of the Chinese news media received an open letter that claimed to be from the leader of the Chinese Martyrs Brigade, a previously unknown group. The letter claimed that the loss of Flight 370 was in retaliation for the Chinese government's response to the knife attacks at Kunming railway station on 1 March 2014 and part of the wider separatist campaign against Chinese control over Xinjiang province. The letter also listed unspecified grievances against the Malaysian government. The letter's claim was dismissed as fraudulent based on its lack of detail regarding the fate of Flight 370 and the fact that the name \\"Chinese Martyrs Brigade\\" appeared inconsistent with Uyghur separatist groups which describe themselves as \\"East Turkestan\\" and \\"Islamic\\" rather than \\"Chinese\\".

It is chambered in .380 ACP. Design The Model CF-380 is a compact, single stack magazine, derivative of Hi-Point's 9√ó19mm handgun line. It consists of a polymer frame, zinc-alloy slide and bolt (with steel reinforcing inserts, and a steel breech, chamber and barrel. Its low price and small and compact design prompted many to purchase it for concealed carry. Some decline to carry the CF-380 in Condition One (\\"cocked and locked\\" - generally considered to be the preferable condition for defensive carry) because its striker-fired design lacks a firing pin block. Hi-point's handguns use a blowback design similar to that used in the Walther PPK and Russian Makarov PM. In blowback firearms the mass of the slide and bolt absorbs the rearward force generated by the propulsion of the bullet. As the pressure drops to a safe level, the slide moves back (along with the bolt), an extractor hooks the empty casing and pulls it out of the chamber, after which the case is ejected from the firearm by the ejector. When the slide has completed its rearward travel, the recoil spring moves the slide forward, chambering another round. Many, if not most, modern handguns use a locked-breech design and therefore do not require the amount of slide mass that the blowback design requires in order to remain comfortable to shoot, safe to fire, and easy to control during the firing process. Criticisms Hi-Point CF-380 in two-tone finish. The firing pin in this design also acts as the ejector. It is possible to have a 'out of battery detonation' while hand cycling live ammo through the gun due to this. This means that it is not safe to hand cycle live ammo through the gun and great care should be taken while unloading.

Domestic violence in Kenya reflects worldwide statistics in that women are the overwhelming majority of victims. Over 40% of married women in Kenya have reported being victims of either domestic violence or sexual abuse. Worldwide, over 30% of \\"ever-partnered women\\" aged 15 and older have experienced physical or sexual partner violence. The distinct factors and causes of this high percentage have often not been studied due to lack of data. Factors such as low levels of education, religion, and socioeconomic status all are relevant when looking at the causes of domestic violence in Kenya. Sexual coercion is prevalent in Kenya and often leads to abuse as well. Pregnant women are more likely to be victims of domestic abuse because they are more likely to be in a relationship. Pregnant women are often also economically or socially vulnerable, putting them at a higher risk for domestic violence due to the patriarchal dominance. Unwanted pregnancies are often seen as the fault of the woman, leading to more abuse. The gender roles in Kenya contribute to the acceptance of domestic abuse. Domestic violence also contributes to negative mental and physical health effects. Negative outcomes of domestic violence include pregnancy loss and complications, hypertension, physical injuries, and stress. In addition, victims of domestic violence are more likely to contract HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Responses to domestic violence in Kenya include legal mandates and programs set in place by social organizations. Underreporting of domestic violence in developing countries is due to many reasons, including shame, financial barriers, lack of awareness and access to services, and distrust of healthcare workers.  Causes  = Sexual coercion = In Kenya, along with in other parts of Africa, sexual coercion among adolescents is common. Sexual coercion is defined as any experience in which a person is \\"compelled to have sex against his or her will.\\" In a research survey in Kenya in 2004, 11% of men and 21% of women aged 10‚Äì24 had experienced sexual coercion in their lifetime. Women reported that intimate partner coercion was the most common form, with coercion by acquaintances following. Only 23% of these women and 22% of these men told a close family member or friend about the experience. In 2014, the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey issued a report stating about 44 per cent of Kenyan women had encountered physical abuse by men since they were a Juvenile.Families of victims of macabre killings still cling to hope = Gender inequality = Women with low levels of education are also often of low socioeconomic status and must depend financially on a male partner, often leading to abuse. Poor women also depend on men for household maintenance. In some relationships, men prevent their wives from being employed, keeping them trapped within both their physical home and within the man's control. These women remain silent in the face of abuse. Women transgressing gender norms often also leads to abuse. If a woman does not act with respect and obedience, or does not complete her chores, she is \\"disciplined\\" by her partner. In addition, men are also threatened by women making independent decisions. If a couple has agreed upon a decision and the woman goes against it, it is cause for violence. If a woman questions the financial choices of a man, or makes him feel as if he is not providing for the family well, the man often uses violence in his anger. In a study with a focus group of male and female nurses in Africa showed that male infidelity is a commonly accepted situation, and is even encouraged, whereas female infidelity is seen as behavior that merits physical abuse. In addition, because a man's right to infidelity is accepted so widely, a female's refusal to allow this behavior also was seen as warranting abuse. In the men's focus group, domestic violence against women was also viewed as a way to forgive a woman's \\"transgressions.\\" The studies also found that when surveyed alone, women claimed that the violence was a form of love. It is widely accepted that after a husband's \\"punishment\\" or the abuse, the woman regains dignity in the household and is the receiver of love from her partner. = Education = Lack of Education in Kenya also contributes to the prevalence of abuse. In the 2003 \\"Demographic & Health Surveys\\", a clear link was made between the respondent's level of education and the percentage of people who believe that \\"it is justified for a man to hit his wife, if she argues with him.\\" The survey was done with both men and women, and the general trend for both showed that as years in education of the respondent increased, fewer people felt domestic violence was justified. Another trend was shown when the respondent's education was plotted against the percentage of people who agreed that \\"a man is justified in hitting his wife if she goes out without telling him.\\" As the level of education increased, the mean percentage who felt the above claim was justified, decreased. In a similar survey, the average education of both the respondent and her mother were taken into account. The evidence showed that as the respondent's mother's education increased, the percentage of respondents who felt that domestic violence was justified in certain situations decreased almost linearly. The article that explains these surveys concludes that this link may be because mothers who are more educated raise their children to reject domestic violence.  Mental and physical health  Domestic violence also affects mental health. A study by the World Health Organization in 2008 found that women who have reported being a victim of partner violence also reported a higher likelihood of having feelings of distress, suicidal thoughts, and suicidal attempts than women who had not experienced violence. Additionally, drug and alcohol abuse, depression and anxiety are all increased in domestic violence victims. Specifically among women, domestic violence decreases self worth, security, and dignity. An interview based study in 1998 showed that women who had reported experiencing violence had \\"significantly more diagnosis of phobias than women who reported no abuse.\\" Out of the women in the study who tested positive for lifetime PTSD related to any stressful event in their life, 30.6% reported adult abuse. A study showed that the strongest risk factor for domestic violence was being physically abused as a child. Many victims of domestic violence may also be perpetrators. This study also found a correlation between intimate partner violence (IPV) and the development of chronic illnesses (both mental and physical) in both men and women. Other physical outcomes of domestic violence include a higher likelihood of developing irritable bowel syndrome, gastrointestinal disorders, and chronic pelvic pain. Complications of pregnancy, risk of sexually transmitted infections, and risk of unwanted pregnancies also increase as a result of domestic violence. Coker's study also found that if intimate partner violence is exposed early, interventions can be put into place to minimize the long term negative health effects.  Responses  = Government = The scholar Patricia Kameri-Mbote wrote that the Constitution of Kenya states that men women and children have the right to \\"life, liberty, and security of the person and his/her protection from the law.\\" While the constitution provides both men and women protection from \\"inhuman treatment or torture,\\" it does not explicitly provide protection from violence against women and girls. The Kenyan Penal Code also has provisions that are used to protect against domestic violence. Under a section called \\"Sexual Offenses,\\" three kinds of \\"rape\\" are prohibited against. However, the language used in this provision has lent itself to many loopholes. Under another section labeled \\"Defilement,\\" it is written that extreme punishment will be used for men who rape women under the age of 14 or a girl that \\"was an idiot or imbecile.\\" For married women, protection from rape is almost nonexistent, especially if the marriage is considered valid under the law. Due to the fact that Kenya does not have a minimum age for marriage, the issue of age for consent of sexual relationship is often unclear. In many countries, the law enforcement does not act in cases of domestic violence because the severity of the violence is undermined and seen as a \\"domestic quarrel.\\" As Lenore E. Walker writes in \\"Psychology and Domestic Violence Around the World,\\" many believe that \\"an arrest and incarceration\\" is the most successful way to end the violence. However, others are of the opinion that in situations where the man does not have good community relations or many social ties, intervention by law enforcement can actually increase violence. = Social responses = Social efforts to reduce the domestic violence prevalence in Kenya include programs to increase gender based violence recovery programs. In 2012, Rebecca Njuki et al. discussed how aid voucher programs are increasing with the goal of providing vouchers to victims for a specific health purpose. In this system, vouchers are given to victims of abuse that can be used for medical examinations, counseling services, and links to support groups which often provide legal assistance and referrals to shelters. Women waiting for health services in the Great Rift Valley, Kenya In 2002, a study showed that the healthcare system is the most efficient way to find victims of domestic violence. However, research has shown that many healthcare professionals are not trained to identify signs of domestic violence. In a study using focus groups of both male and female nurses and asked them what they deemed as domestic violence. The males frequently described occurrences of violence as \\"discipline\\" or \\"punishment.\\" When victims are identified, they \\"have often been treated insensitively and had their abuse minimized or ignored, with healthcare workers tending to focus on physical injuries while subtly blaming women for their abuse.\\" A program was implemented in 2013 to decrease domestic violence towards pregnant women. This program was started in rural Kenya and provided clinical assistance, referrals, and emotional support to victims of domestic abuse. A 40 hour training session was mandated for all clinicians, and community partners (religious, social, traditional) were educated on domestic violence and its effects. Women were tested for HIV, educated in mother-to-child transmission interventions, and provided with transportation in case a referral was needed. 134 women were studied during a 5 month period. Results of this study showed that the community benefited greatly from this program, as victims knew where to go for medical assistance, perpetrators knew they would be held liable for their actions, and health workers became empowered and confident in their abilities to help victims. A study by Ann L. Coker also concluded that specific screening for domestic violence should be implemented for all women, and that special attention should be given to screening for physical and sexual abuse.

Unlike line ministries and other government agencies, the CoG does not deliver services directly to the citizens, and it does not focus on a specific policy area. On the contrary, the CoG performs cross-government functions. A similar concept is \\"Core Executive\\".  Definition  Two types of CoG definition exist: by structure or by function. In the first type, the defining criterion is the position in the structure of the Executive branch. It only includes institutions and units that directly and exclusively support the head of the government. For example, it refers to Ministries or General-Secretariats of the Presidency, Offices of the President or Prime Minister, and Cabinet Offices. In the functional definitions, the defining criterion is that the institution performs whole-of- government functions, especially in terms of planning, coordination, monitoring, political management, and communications. Therefore, in addition to the previously mentioned institutions (such as Ministries of the Presidency), other institutions performing these tasks are also included, even if they are not part of the structure of the Presidency. For example, Ministries or Offices of Planning, Delivery Units, Inter-Ministerial Committees, and even Budget Offices are considered part of the CoG. A number of authors favor functional definitions, for considering them more applicable to countries with different forms of government and institutional frameworks.  Relevance  Chief Executives (Presidents and Prime Ministers) have had supporting institutions for a long time. In the United Kingdom, the Cabinet Office dates to 1916, when the war demanded a stronger central coordination for the government. In the United States, the Executive Office of the President was established in 1939, after the Brownlow Committee stated that \\"the President needs help.\\" Offices, Ministries or General Secretariats of the Presidency have also existed in Latin American for several decades now. However, a number of factors lead to a greater importance of the CoG. The following factors have been highlighted: the cross-cutting nature of several current public problems, the need to lead with a unified orientation governments that have decentralized authority to autonomous agencies, and the growing interesting for achieving results for the citizens, beyond a purely fiscal coordination. These factors explain the interest that several governments and international organizations have on the topic, including projects by the Organisation for Cooperation and Economic Development and the Inter-American Development Bank. Moreover, new institutional developments have generated increased interest in the CoG. The Prime Minister's Delivery Unit in the United Kingdom was established to ensure that the government's priorities were being implemented, through an intensive monitoring by the CoG. Several countries have replicated this model, including Malaysia and Chile. Paraguay has established a \\"Center of Government\\" within the General-Secretariat of the Presidency, in charge of coordinating and monitoring the government action.  The center of government in different countries  In OECD countries, the CoG institutions lead the functions of coordinating the preparation of Cabinet meetings, coordinating the formulation and implementation of policy, monitoring delivery, strategic planning for the whole-of-government, and communicating the government's messages. Regarding the characteristics of the CoG, there are important variations in terms of organization and staff. For example, in countries like the United Kingdom and Sweden most of the CoG staff belongs to the civil service, while in Canada, Australia and New Zealand political appointees have a larger presence. Important variations have also been identified in Latin America, not only in terms of organization but also in the capacity of CoGs to perform their functions: while some countries have more developed CoGs, others present more serious weaknesses.

The founding members are Thorne Davis on drums; Shaun Johnston on bass guitar; Jo Loewenthal on lead vocals, guitar, and samples; Jai Piccone on vocals and guitar; and Tobias Tunis-Plant on vocals and synthesizer. The band now operate as a four piece since Tunis-Plant left. A group of multi-instrumentalists, songwriters and producers with a wide musical palette, fusing unique and graceful vocals with smoothly layered production and instrumentation reminiscent of Radiohead and James Blake, their catalogue now boasts over 100m streams and 1.1m listeners a month on Spotify alone (2019). They have undertaken Australian and international tours. Their tracks have received high rotation on national radio station, Triple J's playlist. History =2006-2012: Early Career= All future Tora band members: Jai Piccone, Jo Loewenthal, Shaun Johnston, Thorne Davis and Tobias Tunis-Plant attended Shearwater Steiner School in Mullumbimby, a small New South Wales town. In 2006 while still at high school, they formed an indie-rock band with Loewenthal on lead guitar and vocals, Tunis on drums and Johnston on bass guitar; it was later named, Alice Blu. In 2010 the three left Shearwater to attain a diploma in contemporary music served by Northern Rivers Conservatorium Arts Centre (NRCAC). While completing the course they continued to perform as Alice Blu, including supporting gigs by the Beautiful Girls and by Daryl Braithwaite. According to Loewenthal \\"The business classes helped us a lot with negotiating gigs and money and knowing how to promote ourselves.\\" =2012-2013: Formation= In mid-2012 Loewenthal began experimenting in Melbourne with electronic music using Reason software and still working full- time in call centre. He reconnected with Davis. Tunis-Plant was travelling Europe and developing new song ideas while Johnston was undertaking a Bachelor of Audio Engineering at John Martin Cass Academy. At the end of that year, Davis and Loewenthal moved back to Byron Bay; \\"After moving back up from Melbourne, we decided to make a more electronic-fused band and incorporate electronic production.\\" From October Loewenthal and Tunis-Plant rekindled their songwriting partnership for electronic-infused music. In January of the following year, Loewenthal began teaching music to Piccone, which developed into a songwriting partnership. When Johnston returned from Melbourne in May 2013, Tora officially formed as a five piece band. The group's name is from the Greek word œÑœéœÅŒ± t·πìra meaning \\"now\\". They released their first single, \\"Unobtainable\\", co-written by Loewenthal and Tunis-Plant. Loewenthal later recalled, \\"we just started making music in our bedroom, which was like a big granny flat sort of thing. The first Tora track we made in four days ‚Äì 'Unobtainable' ‚Äì it just came together and we were like 'wow'. Electronic music is so much more fun to play and make... So we made that track then stewed on it, then made heaps of tracks ‚Äì then after a while we just decided to put them up and see what people thought. We got a much better reaction than we'd ever had for Alice Blu ‚Äì so we were a bit excited about that.\\" According to Byron Bay Festival's correspondent, they played a \\"blend of ambient harmonies, layered rhythms and pulsing soundscapes.\\" Aside from electronica they perform in the new-age genre, chillwave. =2013: Debut extended play= Tora released their debut self-titled seven-track extended play in October 2013, which had \\"swirling, electronica influenced pop, drawing from the likes of SOHN & James Blake\\". Crack in the Road reviewer, Josh, opined that the group were \\"rather bizarre in a way, in that they‚Äôre seemingly the opposite of the 'make a shit load of noise' model, keeping it somber yet beautiful, opting to rely on minimal, sparse beats and haunting vocals.\\" The band received high rotation on national radio as the single, \\"Calming Her\\", was entered in the Triple J Unearthed competition. It received 100,000+ plays in its first three months of release. The band was invited to play their first large scale performance, at Falls Festival Byron Bay, on NYE. =2014: Eat the Sun= March 2014 Tora released their single, \\"These Eyes\\", which received 120,000+ plays within the first three weeks with support from blogs. It was written by Loewenthal and Tunis-Plant. Amrap's AirIts reviewer described the track, \\"The vocal soothes our soul, and reminds us we still have one. We're not left waiting for a drop or a climax because all we want is for the chill wave to continue indefinitely. Vocal cutting, lush synths and xylophone attach to your psyche, leaving you nothing but residual warmth.\\" The release was followed up with a tour across some of the state capital cities (Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne) in April 2014. Over the next few months Tunis began working with female vocalist Merryn Jeann from fellow band, Potato Potato. According to Loewenthal, \\"most of the song was created in our bedrooms.\\" Soon after her vocals were developed into a track titled 'Overcome ft. Merryn Jeann' which was released early July 2014 and marked as the most successful release the band had made at this point, receiving huge blog action from channels like 'TheSoundYouNeed'. A month earlier Tora won the regional leg of the Unearthed competition; consequently they opened the main stage at Splendour in the Grass, Byron Bay. September 2014 Tora accepted a support slot with Miami Horror on their \\"Wild Motion (Set it Free)\\" tour again playing Australia's major cities. On return Tora released their second EP, Eat the Sun, in November 2014 with tracks \\"from candle-lit R&B; jams, to soothing, electronically laced ballads.\\" They embarked on a national tour with their Sydney and Port Macquarie performances completely sold-out. The year finished up with a run of shows at 'The Falls Arts & Music Festival 2014' in Byron Bay with Tora on the line-up along with bands such as Alt-J, Jamie XX, BadBadNotGood & Glass Animals. Their tracks, \\"Overcome\\" (featuring Potato Potato), \\"Admire\\", \\"Jaigantic\\" and \\"High Enough\\", have received high rotation on national radio station, Triple J's playlist.Tora's tracks on Triple J's playlists: * \\"Overcome\\" (featuring Potato Potato), \\"These Days\\" (July 2014): * \\"Admire\\" ‚Äì Eat the Sun (EP) (October 2014): * \\"Jigantic\\" (January 2015): * \\"High Enough\\" (June 2015): * \\"High Enough\\" (July 2015): Jaigantic‚Äô was remixed by heralded LA-based producer Galimatias, which has now clocked up 16M streams (2019). =2015: International Tour= Attracting worldwide attention with over 2 million streams on SoundCloud alone Tora embarked on an international tour in April 2015. In June they were at the Canadian Music Week after having performed in Los Angeles, New York, Montreal, Quebec and Sherbrooke. Starting with the 'High Enough' tour in Canada the band continued through to Europe for the summer playing internationally acclaimed festivals, such as The Great Escape Festival in Brighton, Fusion Festival in Germany, and Glastonbury Music Festival in UK alongside acts such as Pharrell Williams, The Who, Glass Animals, Jon Hopkins, & Jack Garratt. 25 August the quintet release an original work titled \\"LATP\\" Early October the band returned to Canada for another run of shows before finishing up in America with CMJ Festival in New York City and a North American tour with fellow Australian band SAFIA. The European leg of their tour, from July to September, was filmed by Carlos Walters for his Vimeo documentary, Tora European Tour Diary 2015. As summarised by Loewenthal on the band's return home \\"193 days, almost 80 shows and over 50,000km of driving.\\" = 2017-2018: Take A Rest = In 2017 Tora released their debut album, 'Take A Rest', which was added to high rotation on triple j and received acclaim from Elton John (Beats 1), Annie Mac (BBC Radio 1), BBC 6 Music, rotation on Germany's Flux FM and Radio Eins, as well as being a favourite amongst global tastemakers such as Line of Best Fit, Indie Shuffle and Pigeons & Planes. Alongside spins from LA's premiere radio outlet KCRW, the album united fans and tastemakers, and connected with all corners of the planet. After playing atGlastonbury, Splendour In The Grass, The Great Escape, Canadian Music Week, and also supporting artists like R√úF√úS DO SOL, SAFIA and Miami Horror, the release of ‚ÄôTake A Rest‚Äô saw Tora return to touring the world, supporting the likes of Oh Wonder (UK), as well as showcasing the album live in extensive jaunts through the UK, Europe and Australia and performing their own sold-out shows in London, Amsterdam, Paris, Melbourne and at home in Byron Bay. Much of this time was also spent working on new material, spending focused time in London, LA, Berlin and Amsterdam writing, collaborating, learning and growing. The fruits of this quiet dedication are clear, with now around 1 million monthly listeners on Spotify alone (2019). In 2018 Tora released ‚ÄòWouldn‚Äôt Be The Same‚Äô featuring Brisbane artist Keelan Mak. The track has now clocked over 2 million streams. = 2019: Can't Buy The Mood = On March 1, Tora released ‚ÄòDeviate‚Äô, which was Co- written and co-produced in London at the iconic RAK Studios with Roy Kerr (London Grammar, Lana Del Rey). This laid the foundations for the announcement of sophomore album ‚ÄòCan‚Äôt Buy The Mood‚Äô (9 August 2019 via LUSTRE) a body of work deeply inspired by themes of human connection, and which also displays an equally intriguing array of beautifully crafted songs that morph and transport to another world. Whilst Can't Buy The Mood was primarily made in the region of Byron Bay, the band also ventured into iconic studio spaces in LA, London and Amsterdam to work on the album. Completely written and produced by the band themselves, they also did all the design and artwork, completing an artistic vision which was key to the holistic experience of the album. With field recordings once again a key feature, the album is 13 tracks full of lush grooves and intricate moments. Musical style With their sounds having been compared to the likes of SOHN, Toro Y Moi and James Blake. Tora's music is a blend of ambient harmonies, layered rhythms and pulsing soundscapes characteristic of the Chillwave genre.

It was last assigned to the 24th School Wing, and was demobilized on 30 April 1931 at March Field, California. The unit was an early United States Army Air Corps flying training group, and the first major unit assigned to March Field after its re-opening in 1927. History During World War I, March Field was a major primary pilot training base for the Air Service,Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces, p. 954 with its graduates being sent to advanced training schools before being deployed to the American Expeditionary Force in France. The school was closed after the armistice in February 1919. In July 1919, Congress authorized resumption of enlistment of flying cadets on a limited basis, and the school at March Field was re-opened which offered a combined ground school and primary flight training using surplus Curtiss JN-4 Jennies. A shortage of money and failure of the training program to become as large as planned, prompted the closing of the primary school at March Field in 1921, and March became a storage depot. In 1922 it was decided to centralize all flying training in San Antonio, Texas.Maurer, Manning, The decision by the Coolidge Administration in 1926 to expand the Air Corps found the facilities in San Antonio insufficient to accommodate the expanded number of cadets entering primary training. As a result, March Field was re-opened as a primary pilot training school in July 1927, and the 13th School Group was designated to perform duties as the headquarters for the new Air Corps Primary Flying School. Flight training was conducted in Consolidated PT-1 and PT-3s, which had taken over from the Curtiss Jennies. There were three school squadrons assigned, along with support squadrons. Even before the school at March opened, it was known it was a temporary unit, as plans were ongoing to expand the facilities in San Antonio. With the opening of Randolph Field in 1931, the primary pilot training at March ended in April 1931 and March Field became the home of the new 1st Bombardment Wing. The group was activated again in 1943, but Standard military units, based on relatively inflexible tables of organization were proving not well adapted to the training mission. Accordingly, a more functional system was adopted in which each base was organized into a separate numbered unit.Goss, p. 75 The 13th Technical School Group was disbanded a year later when all units at Chanute Field were replaced by the 3502d Army Air Forces Base Unit.Mueller, p. 82 (showing station and dates active at Chanute) Lineage * Constituted as the 13th Group (School) on 6 February 1923 : Redesignated 8 March 1929 as 13th School Group : Activated on 31 July 1927 : Disbanded on 30 April 1931Clay, * Reconstituted and redesignated 13th Technical School Group : Activated on 28 February 1943 : Disbanded on 30 April 1944 =Assignments= * 24th School Wing, 8 July 1927 ‚Äì 30 April 1931 * Central Technical Training Command, 28 February 1943 - 30 April 1944 =Components= ;; Flying Training Squadrons * 47th School Squadron, 31 July 1927 ‚Äì 30 April 1931 * 53d School Squadron, 31 July 1927 ‚Äì 30 April 1931 * 54th School Squadron, 31 July 1927 ‚Äì 30 April 1931 ;; Support Squadrons * 69th Service Squadron, 31 July 1927 ‚Äì 30 April 1931 * 70th Service Squadron, 31 July 1927 ‚Äì 30 April 1931 * 23d Photo Section, 31 July 1927 ‚Äì 30 April 1931 =Stations= * March Field, California, 31 July 1927 ‚Äì 30 April 1931 * Chanute Field.

According to local police, 45 survivors were rescued. Officially, 251 people died in the accident. Accident Early on March 22, 2014, two boats carrying people from the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement refugee settlement left the Ugandan shore of Lake Albert en route to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). On the way, one of the boats capsized. Its passengers had been returning home after United Nations and Congolese forces won major victories over the Allied Democratic Forces and M23 rebel groups in recent months. There was no evidence that the boat's passengers had left Uganda due to conditions at the refugee camp. Reports indicated that the accident occurred due to overcrowding, a common cause of boating casualties in the region due to lax enforcement of safety rules. The boat's listed capacity was 80, but approximately 300 people were on board at the time of the accident. The lack of life vests and inability of most passengers to swim also contributed to the high death toll. Additionally, the boat was in poor condition mechanically. Death toll and response Initial efforts led to the rescue of 45 survivors and recovery of 19 bodies on March 22. Survivors were taken to the Bundibugyo District of Uganda, where they received care from the Ugandan government and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. By March 24, 109 bodies were recovered. Of those, 88 were accepted for burial in DRC. The remainder were rejected due to cultural concerns over burying people more than 72 hours after death and were buried at the Bundibugyo hospital cemetery. On March 27, the official death toll was revised to 251. Most of the dead were children. The boat's skipper recalled counting 96 adults on board, but he did not count the children. Police said they believed nearly all passengers had been accounted for. In a statement, the United Nations said it was \\"shocked and saddened\\" by the tragedy. Three days of national mourning were declared in DRC. The government also helped arrange funerals and offered support for the dead. On April 7, DRC announced plans to repatriate about 21,000 refugees living in Uganda. DRC envoy to Uganda Jean Okoto Lolakombe remarked \\"It is sad that we lost our people, but we have learnt a lesson from the incident.\\" There are 175,000 registered Congolese refugees living in Uganda as of March 2014.

In his opposition to slavery, Hyatt organized the efforts of abolitionists in Kansas to have the territory admitted to the Union as a free- state and campaigned for the federal government to aid Kansans afflicted by drought. Hyatt befriended John Brown and provided Brown with financial support; following the raid on Harpers Ferry, Hyatt was investigated by a committee of the United States Senate. When Hyatt refused to comply with a Congressional subpoena and cooperate with the Senate investigation, the Senate voted to jail the recalcitrant abolitionist. As an inventor, Hyatt was a wealthy man, profiting from his invention of iron-and-glass vault covers for admitting sunlight to spaces below sidewalks and pavements. Hyatt also innovated and patented several designs for reinforced concrete floors. Abolitionist Born in Rahway, New Jersey, Thaddeus Hyatt became actively involved in the abolitionist movement after Congress passed the Kansas- Nebraska Act in 1854. The law, which mandated that the question of legalizing slavery in Kansas be settled by the territory's voters, sparked a race between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions to move to Kansas and tip the ballot boxes. Opposing settlers violently clashed in what became known as Bleeding Kansas. In 1854, several state-level committees were formed to provide aid to anti-slavery settlers in Kansas, including the New York Kansas League, of which Thaddeus Hyatt was president. Along with well-known abolitionists such as Andrew Reeder, Gerrit Smith, and Eli Thayer, Hyatt organized the National Kansas Committee in July 1856 and was elected president of the organization. The National Kansas Committee purportedly collected around 100,000 dollars to sponsor two thousand new settlers. Of this amount, around ten thousand dollars was spent on weaponry. Although the organization was active from July 1856 onward, the entire committee formally convened only once, in January 1857. Among the items delivered to settlers were one hundred tons of seeds, the cost of which Hyatt underwrote. By mid-1857, the National Committee had dispersed its supplies and depleted its funds, and the activities of the organization wound down. Hyatt led the settlement of Hyattville, Kansas by 84 men, hoping to keep the unemployed militiamen from stirring up trouble in Lawrence. Hyattville was located on the South fork of Pottawattamie creek in Anderson County. Thaddeus Hyatt, along with William Arny, the general agent of the National Kansas Committee, were accused of using Hyatt's namesake town as a scheme to turn a profit for themselves. Hyatt and Arny persuaded the Kansas State Central Committee to allow them to change how funds from the National Committee were dispersed by the State Central Committee, redirecting the funds and resources to the Hyattville venture. William Hutchinson, who was tasked with reporting the incident to the National Committee, placed the majority of the blame on Arny for influencing Hyatt, and wrote that the scandal caused \\"an open rupture\\" between the State and National Committee. For his part, Hyatt maintained that the claims were perpetrated by a \\"slanderer\\", and believed that the dispute was a subterfuge to \\"crush the National Committee\\". Despite this, Hyattville appears to have succeeded, at least temporarily. In the present day, the town no longer exists. The National Kansas Committee came well short of its own expectations. Originally, the Committee intended for similar organizations to be set up at the state, county, and town level in each and every locality in the Union to direct efforts to fill Kansas with anti-slavery voters. The National Committee failed to unify even the patchwork of local Kansas Committees that were already operating, in part because of a lack of communication between the different groups and people. For example, Thaddeus Hyatt and William Barnes both embarked on simultaneous, but separate efforts to organize counties in New York State. Hyatt came under suspicion after John Brown's unsuccessful raid on Harpers Ferry. Hyatt supported Brown's ideology of militant abolitionism, providing Brown with financial support, and Brown often visited Hyatt's house in New York. The National Committee had met Brown early in 1857 and indirectly provided him with two hundred Sharps rifles, which Brown took to Harpers Ferry, but the Committee largely reneged on its promise of five thousand dollars to Brown as the organization had run out of money. A Senate committee tasked with probing the causes of the Harpers Ferry raid discovered that Hyatt was mentioned several times in Brown's personal papers and subpoenaed him on January 24, 1860, to testify before the committee. Hyatt equivocated as to whether or not he would testify for a month. Senator Mason, the chair of the Harper's Ferry Committee, finally lost patience and Hyatt was arrested by the Senate Sergeant at Arms and brought before the Senate on March 6. The Senate demanded to know why Hyatt had ignored the subpoena and whether Hyatt would now submit to the Senate Committee. Three days later, Hyatt submitted a twenty-page document in which his lawyers contended that the Senate investigation of Hyatt constituted a judicial trial; therefore, the Senate had overstepped its powers under the Constitution, as the Senate only had judicial power in the cases of evaluating the qualifications of its members, expelling Senators, and conducting impeachment trials. The document argued that \\"to compel witnesses to attend before a committee to give information in regard to proposed legislation, is not a power given by the Constitution.\\" The New York Times reported that the sheer length of the document, which was read aloud on the Senate floor, physically exhausted two Senate clerks and most of the Senators refused to stay during the reading. Unimpressed by his argument, the Senate voted to confine Thaddeus Hyatt to the District of Columbia jail until he agreed to testify. Hyatt declined to petition the Supreme Court for habeas corpus. After three months of unsuccessful attempts to interrogate the key witnesses behind Harpers Ferry, the Senate investigative committee was dissolved and Hyatt was released on June 15. Even after the violence in Kansas died down, Hyatt continued to be a major figure supporting the state. 1860 marked the culmination of a devastating drought in Kansas, and Hyatt traveled to Kansas to view the damage and direct his newly formed Kansas Relief Committee's aid to starving settlers. Hyatt was outraged by the inattention of both national newspapers and the federal government; in response, he petitioned outgoing President James Buchanan in a seventy-page pamphlet to provide more federal aid and halt foreclosures, as many Kansan farmers had been impoverished by the drought and could not meet the payments needed to keep their land. Buchanan did little to help the state aside from a monetary donation‚Äîthe President vetoed the Homestead Act of 1860, which would have delayed the foreclosures. Thaddeus Hyatt was at Rose Hill, Falmouth, England when his wife gave birth to a son on 28 August 1869. Lake's Falmouth Packet and Cornwall Advertiser - Saturday 4th September 1869 He moved to London and rented a warehouse at 9 Farringdon Road next door to that of Christopher Dresser at number 7. His pavement lights can be seen in both US and UK cities. Hyatt died in 1901 at the age of 85 in his summer residence, at Sandown, on the Isle of Wight.

The central part of the main span suffered from general deterioration, but damage caused by two ship collisions made it necessary to substitute a new center part. On 6 November 2006 the long span was removed and carefully passed between the 120-meter gap of the two existing support points. Once removed, the steel structure was lowered onto a transport barge. The new structure that arrived the night before on another transport barge was lifted into place. While lowering and lifting work was going on, this section of the canal was closed and a large number of ships were waiting to pass; the alternative was to navigate around the northern tip of Denmark. The new central span was also raised by to a height of above the canal, the same height as other bridges on the canal.

F. Goodrich noted for first synthesizing cis-1,4-polyisoprene, the main polymer contained in natural tree rubber, using Ziegler catalysis. Earlier attempts to produce synthetic rubber from isoprene had been unsuccessful, but in 1955, Horne prepared 98 percent cis-1,4-polyisoprene via the stereospecific polymerization of isoprene. The product of this reaction differs from natural rubber only slightly. It contains a small amount of cis-1,2-polyisoprene, but it is indistinguishable from natural rubber in its physical properties. The importance of Horne's development of synthetic polyisoprene and polybutadiene is readily seen in the production of these polymers. In 2008, global production of polybutadiene was 2,042,000 metric tons (exceeded only by SBR in capacity and production). Production of polyisoprene was 611,000 metric tons (Russia, 415,000; Asia, 78,000; US, 90,000; Europe, 25,000). In 1980, the ACS Rubber Division honored Horne with the Charles Goodyear Medal. In 1982, he received an honorary doctorate from Emory University. Personal Horne was born July 26, 1924, in Jacksonville, Florida He grew up in Tampa, Florida. He married Sue Ross in 1949. They had four children. He showed interest in chemistry at a young age. When he was five or six years old, he and a friend played with a chemistry set. Although the experiments sometimes led to unpleasant odors and other problems, his parents nevertheless encouraged the young Horne to pursue his interest in chemistry. Horne died on February 4, 2006, in Columbus, Ohio. Education and career Horne graduated from Tampa's Henry B. Plant High School in 1942. He enrolled at Emory University, but his university studies were interrupted by World War II. He joined the U.S. Navy in July 1943 and served until 1946. He was released to inactive status with the rank of Lieutenant (JG). He returned to Emory University, where he obtained his A.B. degree in 1947, his M.A. degree in 1948, and his Ph.D. degree in 1950. While at Emory University, he taught organic chemistry from 1947 to 1950. He also had a research fellowship from 1946 to 1950. Horne's intention was to enter the teaching profession after completing his Ph.D. degree. He received advice to obtain industrial research experience before entering the academia. Taking that advice, he obtained a position at the B. F. Goodrich Company's Research and Development Center in Brecksville, Ohio in 1950. He was promoted in 1953, promoted again to Research Associate in 1960, and to Senior Research Associate in 1968. In 1982, B. F. Goodrich changed its strategic direction and sold its synthetic rubber operations to Polysar, Ltd. Goodrich was deemphasizing rubber research. As Horne's main interest was in rubber research, he made the decision to join Polysar. He retired from Polysar in 1987. Research =Synthetic polyisoprene= In 1954, immediately following the formation of the joint venture Goodrich-Gulf Chemicals, Inc., an option agreement was obtained from Professor Karl Ziegler to examine his new catalyst system for the polymerization of ethylene. Horne was called back from vacation to the Research Center to begin work immediately. He was given the assignment of translating into practice the information that B. F. Goodrich would receive from Karl Ziegler. After verifying the claims for the polymerization of ethylene, and also for other alpha-olefins, Horne copolymerized ethylene with other olefins as a means of controlling the polyethylene density. With the success of the copolymerizations, he decided to try to copolymerize ethylene with isoprene, with the thought of getting a copolymer that could be vulcanized with sulfur in a typical rubber recipe. While Professor Ziegler did not report the polymerization of dienes with his catalyst, Horne saw no reason why a copolymer or a homopolymer could not be made from a pure hydrocarbon diene. Actually, Karl Ziegler had said that they were unsuccessful in polymerizing dienes. With Horne's inquisitive nature and determination, he tried the copolymerization of ethylene and isoprene. Horne submitted the ethylene/isoprene copolymer for infrared examination. When Jim Shipman, who was responsible for the analysis, examined the infrared spectrum, he immediately called Horne and said, \\"Are you trying to fool us? We know natural rubber when we see it!\\" Fractionation of the sample then showed a mixture of cis-1,4-polyisoprene and polyethylene. The fact that isoprene had polymerized was not unexpected, but the high degree of stereo control was unexpected. They immediately recognized the importance of this discovery and began an intense program to elucidate the chemistry and variables associated with diene polymerizations. The successful duplication of natural rubber was a goal that had been sought by many scientists for nearly one hundred years. An extensive synthetic rubber program was carried out during World War II, one of the objectives being to accomplish this synthesis. The supply of natural rubber was limited for the military during World War II, because natural rubber plantations were not available to the allied forces due to the Japanese occupation of many of the world's rubber plantations. With the process well defined, the scale-up of the process from 50-gram laboratory batches to ton- size production was started. In less than six months, they scaled the process to production-size quantities, made bus and truck tires, and ran them under service conditions on the highways. The test results showed conclusively that the synthetic cis-1,4-polyisoprene was essentially equivalent to natural rubber. During the factory trials, the research team was delighted when they heard the factory personnel comment during the rubber mixing trials that the experimental rubber was nothing new ‚Äì it mixed just like natural rubber. =Polybutadiene= After he discovered the stereo control of polyisoprene, he discovered the polymerization and stereo control of butadiene as well as many other alkylbutadienes. The polymerization of butadiene can lead to three basic structures: the cis-1,4- and the trans-1,4-polybutadienes, and the 1,2-polybutadiene with a vinyl side group. From these three basic structures, there are five structurally different polymers: the cis and trans 1,4-polybutadienes, and the isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic 1,2-polybutadienes. All of these polymers have been isolated in pure form. Horne studied the Ziegler catalyst variables as well as other process variables and their effect on polybutadiene structures. He demonstrated that a wide variety of mixed cis and trans structures could be obtained by the proper choice of ratios of titanium tetrachloride to organo-aluminum. By replacing the titanium tetrachloride with titanium tetraiodide, he obtained polybutadiene with 90-95% cis-1,4-structures. Catalysts based on cobalt salts were very useful for preparation of cis-1,4-polybutadienes. Although many cobalt salts were suitable, Horne used cobalt octoate. He showed that cobalt can function under heterogeneous or homogeneous conditions. He prepared at -78 ¬∞C a polybutadiene with 99.8% cis-1,4 structure, which was the highest percentage of cis-1,4 structure he had ever seen. He defined the effect of temperature, solvent, and other additives to the catalyst to produce the highest percentage of cis-1,4 polymer. He studied many other alkylbutadienes. He polymerized 2-ethyl, 2-propyl, 2-amyl, 2-t-butyl and 2,3-dimethyl butadiene as well as others. Awards In 1969, he was chairman of the Gordon Conference on Hydrocarbon Chemistry. In 1974, he received the Pioneer Award from the American Institute of Chemists. In 1978, he received the Midgley Medal from the Detroit Section of the American Chemical Society. In 1980, he received the Charles Goodyear Medal. And in 1982, he received an Honorary Doctor of Science from Emory University.

She was named for Preston, Ontario, however due to possible confusion with , her name was altered. In 1956 she began service with the Royal Norwegian Navy as Troll. Prestonian was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943‚Äì1944 River-class building program. She was laid down as Beauharnois on 20 July 1943 by Davie Shipbuilding and Repairing Co. Ltd. at Lauzon, Quebec and launched 22 June 1944. Her name was changed to Prestonian and she was commissioned on 13 September 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named after towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history Due to her late entry into the Second World War, Prestonian did not see much action. Upon arriving at Halifax, she underwent major repairs and it was not until January 1945 that she began working up at Bermuda. After she returned she was assigned to EG 28, a local convoy escort group working out of Halifax. She remained with this unit until the end of the war in Europe. In preparation for service in the Pacific Ocean, Prestonian began a tropicalization refit at Halifax completing on 20 August 1945. However the plans to send her to the Pacific had been cancelled and she was paid off 9 November and sold to Marine Industries Ltd. Prestonian was reacquired by the RCN to undergo conversion to a Prestonian-class ocean escort as part of the need to expand the anti- submarine force within the navy. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti- submarine mortars. As the first ship to complete the conversion, she gave her name to the new class. In August 1953, Prestonian underwent builder's sea trials, testing the conversion before being recommissioned on 22 August 1953 with pennant 307. The frigate was made a part of the First Canadian Escort Squadron in November 1953. In April 1954, the First Canadian Escort Squadron deployed to Caribbean Sea for a training cruise, making several port visits. In September, the First Canadian Escort Squadron took part in the NATO naval exercise \\"New Broom II\\" and in October, the exercise \\"Morning Mist\\" before performing a two-month training cruise in the Mediterranean Sea, making several port visits. The squadron returned to Canada on 10 December 1954. =Royal Norwegian Navy= It was announced in November 1955 that three Prestonian-class frigates would be loaned to Norway; Prestonian, and . The frigate was paid off on 24 April 1956 and transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy and renamed HNoMS Troll. She was employed primarily for fishery protection duties. In 1965 she was reclassified as a submarine depot ship and renamed HNoMS Horten. She served in this capacity until 1972 when the ship was discarded.

During the July Monarchy (1830‚Äì1848) he was several times Minister of Finance. Early years Jean-Georges Humann was born in Strasbourg, Bas- Rhin, on 6 August 1780. His parents were Jacques Humann and Anne-Marie Schmitz. His family was German in origin. His father was a bourgeois of Strasbourg, but his family was not wealthy and his education was limited. By nature he was reserved, taciturn and laconic. When he was fourteen Humann was apprenticed to a tobacco merchant. By the age of eighteen he and an associate were running a small trading company. In 1799 he married Louise Philippine Antoinette Breck in Strasbourg. She died two years later. On 24 August 1802 he married Madeleine Heiligenthal (1778-1836). They had four sons and two daughters. Entrepreneur and deputy At a very young age, between 1800 and 1810, Humann acquired a considerable fortune and became a celebrity in Alsace. His wealth came from smuggling at the time of the Continental Blockade, when trade in goods of British origin was prohibited. He became in turn a member of the Strasbourg Chamber of Commerce, a judge at the commerce court in 1812, and a member of the Administrative Committee of Civil Hospices in 1816. During the famines of 1812 and 1816-17 Humann played an important role in supplying grain. In 1818 Humann led a deputation charged with presenting the grievances and demands of the Strasbourg business community to the government, with great success. In 1820 Humann was elected a Deputy for Bas-Rhin. He soon became one of the leading supporters of economic and political liberalism, and a defender of the interests of Alsace. In January 1821 he and his associates offered to lend the money needed to complete the Rh√¥ne-Rhine canal. His maiden speech in the chamber of deputies was on 3 July 1821 in support of this project. He was involved in the debates about tobacco, speaking against a monopoly and in favor of a consumption tax. In February 1823 Humann spoke against the planned invasion of Spain, which he felt was against the interests of the Bourbons. From the middle of the 1820s he was involved in various large or technically advanced industrial projects as a manager, organizer or source of funding. On 31 October 1825 Humann and associates obtained a salt mining concession, which proved profitable. He was appointed a member of the general council of commerce, chaired by Jean-Baptiste de Vill√®le, the Minister of the Interior. In November 1827 Humann failed to be reelected for Bas-Rhin. With the support of √âlie, duc Decazes, a former minister of Louis XVIII, he was elected deputy for Villefranche on 30 May 1828. July monarchy Humann's tomb in Sainte- H√©l√®ne cemetery in Strasbourg Humann's reputation as a financial expert grew. He was made a member of the Budget Committee, and in 1830 was the rapporteur of the budget. He was reelected deputy in 1830 and 1831. The king formed the \\"ministry of all talents\\" headed by Marshall Soult on 11 October 1832, with Humann as Minister of Finance. He held this position in successive cabinets until January 1836. Issues in the first session included the budget, loans for Haiti, spoils from the Algiers expedition and taxes on colonial and domestically produced sugar. Later sessions dealt with the guarantee of Greek debt following recognition of the independence of Greece, compensation to the United States for losses resulting from the Continental Blockade, laws related to the Bank of France and savings banks, the tobacco monopoly and pensions for civil servants. On 14 January 1836 Humann presented the draft budget for 1837 to the Chamber of Deputies. This included a proposal for conversion of debt that had not been discussed with his cabinet colleagues. The proposal caused an unexpected storm of controversy, and Humann was forced to resign on 18 January 1836. The issue led to a public debate, followed by the collective resignation of the cabinet in February 1836. Humann returned to Strasbourg to recuperate his health and find some peace. In October 1837 he was made a peer of France, and returned to Paris and the political scene. On 29 October 1840 he was appointed Minister of Finance in a new ministry headed by Soult. Humann was reluctant to create or raise taxes, but preferred to collect existing taxes more efficiently. The most important measure was to undertake a new census to determine wealth and property taxes owing, which resulting in virulent attacks from the opposition but was carried through to completion. Humann died of a stroke at the Finance ministry in Paris on 25 April 1842. Antoine Maurice Apollinaire d'Argout delivered a eulogy on Humann in the Chamber of Peers on 4 July 1843.

For other uses, see Avana (disambiguation) Avan√† is a red Italian wine grape variety that is grown in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. Historically, the grape has also been grown in the Dauphin√© and Savoie wine region of eastern France where it was known as Hibou noir and in the Valais region of Switzerland. The grape is most often used as a blending variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) zones of Pinerolese, with Barbera, Persan, Freisa and Neretta Cuneese, and Valsusa, with Barbera, Dolcetto, Neretta Cuneese and other local red Piemontese varieties.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 69 Allen Lane 2012 History The Susa Valley, where Avan√† has a long history of production. Ampelographers believe that the first written mention of Avan√† was under the synonym Avanato in the 1606 work of Italian agronomist Giovanni Battista Croce on the grapes of the Piedmont region. In the early 21st century, DNA analysis revealed that the Hibou noir grape was historically grown in what is today the Savoie region of France and Valais region of Switzerland was, in fact, the same Avan√† grape that is still grown in the Susa Valley of Piedmont. From 1418 to 1713, Piedmont, Savoie and Valais were all part of the Duchy of Savoy and it is likely during this time that Avan√† was introduced to each region though today the grape is mostly only found in Piedmont. DNA analysis also revealed that Avan√† has a close parent-offspring relationship with the Savoie wine grape Cacabou√©. The Swiss wine grape Amigne also appears to be closely related to Avan√† though the exact nature of the relationship (which can be anything from half-sibling to niece/nephew to grandparent/grandchild) is not yet known. Viticulture Avan√† is an early to mid-ripening grape variety that is known for given very highly irregular harvest yields from vintage to vintage. Among the viticultural hazards that the grape is most susceptible to is the fungal infection of powdery mildew. Wine regions Location of the Susa Valley within Piedmont. Today, Avan√† is found almost exclusively in the Susa Valley region of Piedmont that links the city of Turin to the French wine region Savoie across the Alps. In 2000, there were of the grape variety in cultivation where it has been a permitted grape variety in the red blends of the Pinerolese (since 1996) and Valsusa (since 1997) DOCs. =DOC regulations= In the red wine only DOC of Pinerolese located in the provinces of Cuneo and Turin, Avan√† grapes destined for DOC wine production must be limited to a harvest yield of 10 tonnes/hectare with the finished wines needing to attain minimum alcohol level of at least 10.5%. Wines labeled as just Pinerolese must contain a minimum of 50% of Barbera, Bonarda Piemontese, Nebbiolo and Neretta Cuneese with Avan√† and other local red Piemontese varieties permitted to fill in the remainder of the blend.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pgs 191 & 212 Firefly Books 2004 Barbera (pictured) is a common blending partner with Avan√†. For Pinerolese Ramie, Avan√† must make up a minimum of 30% of the blend with Avarengo and Neretta Cuneese required to make up an additional minimum of 15% and 20% of the blend, respectively, with other red wine grapes permitted to account up to a maximum of 35%. Additionally, a varietal style of Avan√† can be produced within the of the DOC provided that the grape makes up at least 85% of the wine. The red wine only Valsusa DOC covers Avan√† grown within 19 small rural communities between the villages of Almese and Exilles in the Susa Valley in the province of Turin. In 2000, there were only of grapes in production within the DOC. Here grapes are limited to a maximum harvest yield of 9 tonnes/ha with the finished wines needing to attain a minimum alcohol level of at least 11%. The blend for the DOC wines must contain a 60% minimum collectively of Avan√†, Barbera, Dolcetto and/or Nebbiolo with other local red grape varieties permitted to fill in the remainder. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, as a varietal, Avan√† tends to produce light-bodied wines with moderate acidity levels and low tannins that are meant to be consumed young rather than cellared. Synonyms Over the years, Avan√† has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Alvana di Susa, Avana, Avana de Susa, Avana di Susa, Avana nero, Avanale, Avanas, Avanato, Avan√®, Avane, Aven√†, Avena, Avenai, Bibou, Davana, Eyholzer Roter, Guibou, Havana, Hibou, Hibou noir (in the Is√®re and Hautes-Alpes departments of France), Hivernais, Hyvernais, Luisant, Palofrais, Polafrais, Polofrais, Pometre, Promeche, Promere Raisin Cerise, Ribou and Vermaglio (in the town of Saluzzo in Piedmont).Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Avan√† Accessed: March 24th, 2014 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Avan√†"},{"id":"42300842","text":"Stefan Bal≈°iƒá (; fl. 1419-40), known as Stefan Maramonte, was a Zetan nobleman.

Since Maria was married to Phillip Maramonte, the Venetians and Ragusans often referred to Stefan Bal≈°iƒá with the name Maramonte.

He previously played 57 matches with Richmond over five years at the club. Lloyd plays as a midfielder and small forward and is renowned for his goal-sense and ability to win forward line one-on-one contests. He was recruited from state-league football as a mature-age player in 2013. While senior listed at Richmond in 2017, he won the Norm Goss Memorial Medal as best on ground during the club's reserves grand final in the VFL. Early life, junior football and state- league football Lloyd grew up on a farm outside Deniliquin, in the Riverina region of New South Wales. A talented junior sportsman, he played both football and soccer. Given the long trips to and from the local towns sports facilities, his parents asked Sam and brother Jack to choose a single sport. Jack's preference won out by a tie-breaking coin toss and Sam never played a soccer match thereafter. Following his first year of high-school Lloyd moved to Corio, Victoria to attend Geelong Grammar School. He played 23 top level matches in his final three years at the school. He was the school's leading goalkicker in his Year 11 and captained the team in his final year. Outside of school Lloyd was also a member of the Geelong Falcons squad but did not manage to play a match due to injury concerns. He went on to play country league football and in 2010 while playing with Deniliquin in the Murray Football League, he kicked more than 100 goals for the season. Included in the total were individual match hauls of 12, 11 and 10 goals against Echuca, Congupna and Rumbalara. He remained with the club the following season and was a member of the premiership winning side. In 2012 Lloyd played club football at Mt Eliza, then VFL football at the Bendigo Football Club. In 2013 he relocated again, to take up a role at Frankston Football Club in the VFL. He kicked 38 goals from 17 games at Frankston in 2013. AFL career =Richmond (2014-2018)= Lloyd was drafted by with the club's third pick and the 66th selection overall in the 2013 AFL National Draft. He made his AFL debut in round 4, 2014 against at the MCG. He was among Richmond's best in the match, kicking three goals and recording 22 disposals. Lloyd played the next four consecutive matches at AFL level, recording an average of one goal and 12 disposals per match. He was dropped ahead of the club's round 10 clash with however and would not return to the club's senior side until round 17. Lloyd was again omitted for a final time late in the season after three consecutive matches at AFL level. He finished the year having played eight matches and kicking a total of 10 goals, including three bags of three in a match. A strong pre-season ahead of 2015 saw Lloyd join Richmond's round 1 side to take on . He kicked three goals in the victory, and ensured he would remain in the selection mix for some time. Lloyd was ultimately dropped in round 6 however, after playing five straight matches in the club's AFL side. He played reserves football in the VFL for much of the year before reutnring to AFL football in round 17 where he played in each of the club's final seven games of the home- and-away season. Despite his string of form, Lloyd was unceremoniously dropped from the club's side to play in a first round elimination final. At the time coach Damien Hardwick cited the \\"upside\\" of replacement players Ben Griffiths and Reece Conca. He finished 2015 having managed 13 goals from 12 games played at AFL level. Lloyd was again selected to play in the club's round 1 opener against Carlton in 2016. He was a major player in the side early that year, kicking 12 goals in the opening seven matches of the season. In round 8 Lloyd kicked his eighth career three-goal haul. One of these goals he kicked after the final siren, winning the Tigers the match against by one point. He went on to play in every one of the remaining games that season, finishing with a total of 35 goals from 22 games. He finished equal twelfth in the club's best and fairest and second in the club's leading goalkicker award. Lloyd with Richmond's VFL team in July 2017 In 2017 Lloyd would begin the season in Richmond's best-22, before a ten disposal outing saw him dropped from the club's round 2 side. It had been his 30th consecutive match at senior level. After two months of reserves football in the VFL, Lloyd returned to AFL action in round 9. He remained in the side for the next seven matches, recording goals on five occasions. He was again dropped in round 17, this time following his 50th career AFL match played the previous week against at Etihad Stadium. He did not return to senior football in 2017 instead playing with the reserves team through to their finals campaign. He transitioned to a midfield role at that level, playing in each of the club's three finals three victories as well as in their losing grand final against Port Melbourne. He recorded 35 disposals, 10 tackles, nine clearances and a goal and received the Norm Goss Memorial Medal as the best on ground despite his side losing the match. He was the first person in the 35-year history of the award to win the medal from a losing side. Contract speculation surrounded Lloyd in the off-season that followed, with his manager confirming he had attracted some interest from other clubs. While media reports linked Lloyd to a move to Geelong, these ultimately went unfounded and Lloyd remained with Richmond at the end of the trade period. Lloyd finished the 2017 season having played eight matches and kicked six goals at senior level. He also played 12 matches in the reserves and kicked 28 goals, good for the third most at the club. Following a strong showing in the midfield at the end of the VFL season previous, Lloyd spent the 2016-2017 off-season undergoing a permanent positional change, training exclusively with the club's midfielder group. Llyod was one of a select group of senior players to participate in Richmond's AFLX team in February, before playing in the second of the club's two pre-season matches. He was in contention to replace the injured Dion Prestia in round 1's side, but lost out, instead playing his first AFL match of the season in round 3. Lloyd was dropped after just one match however, replaced by Prestia and premiership teammate Josh Caddy. He returned again for a single match in round 5, dropped again despite a two-goal performance. Luck favoured him in round 7, named as a last-minute injury replacement for captain Trent Cotchin and earning a second straight match for the first time in 2018 on the back of that performance. In his next match, round 8 against , Lloyd was named among Richmond's best while recording career-highs in disposals (24), contested possessions (13) and clearances (4). Just one more match at senior level followed, with Lloyd dropped for a third time that season ahead of round 10's match against St Kilda. He was immediately prodigious at that level, kicking four goals and gathering 33 disposals in his first match back along with two goals and 31 disposals the following week. In early June Lloyd was charged with and accepted a one-match suspension from the VFL's match review panel after engaging in rough conduct against player Lachlan Schultz. By mid-July he was back to his best at VFL-level, recording 38 disposals and two goals in a win over the North Melbourne reserves side. Lloyd did not earn an AFL recall that week and would instead have to wait until round 20 to play again at the top level. Though he recorded 17 disposals and kicked a goal in that win over Geelong he could not hold his spot, omitted from the club's side to face Gold Coast the following week. Lloyd returned to senior football in round 22, recalled as a replacement for injured captain Trent Cotchin. He was unable to hold his spot into the finals series however, with Cotchin returning after just one match. At VFL level he helped the club secure the league's minor premiership, before sitting out the finals series' first match as a carryover emergency for the club's forthcoming AFL qualifying final against . Richmond football manager Neil Balme publicly spoke out against the scheduling issue that forced both Lloyd and teammate Ryan Garthwaite to miss the match, blaming a lack of cooperation between officials at the AFL and VFL. Lloyd would ultimately go unselected in that AFL final, but would be available for the following VFL semi-final against Essendon. Despite his return, the club would endure a second straight VFL finals loss that saw them knocked out of the finals series and ending their season. Lloyd finished the year having played seven matches at AFL level, while playing a further 11 with the club's reserves side in the VFL. In early September, and while Richmond's senior side remained in the AFL finals series, a Seven Network report suggested Lloyd had been the subject of trade interest from competing AFL clubs including the Western Bulldogs. A Herald Sun report two weeks later claimed Lloyd was more likely to stay at Richmond than move to another club. Six days out from the beginning of the trade period however, Lloyd's manager announced publicly that he had agreed to a contract with the Bulldogs for 2019 and was certain to be traded there during the forthcoming player exchange period. =Western Bulldogs (2019-present)= Lloyd was traded to the in the second week of the trade period in exchange for the club's fourth round draft selection. He enjoyed his best season since 2016, playing all 23 games for his new club in 2019 and leading the Bulldogs' goalkicking with 38 goals.

He resigned following his conviction for extortion, conspiracy, and other related offenses. Early life and education MacKenzie was born on May 3, 1934 in Waltham, Massachusetts. He graduated from Winchester High School and went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Dartmouth College in 1956. He served as First Lieutenant in the United States Army. Prior to becoming a legislator, MacKenzie sold insurance. In 1976, MacKenzie graduated from Suffolk University Law School. Political career =Beginnings= In 1963 MacKenzie served as chairman of a signature drive for an initiative petition drive to weaken the power of the Massachusetts Governor's Council. The drive was successful and the question appeared on the ballot in 1964. It failed, 1,059,352 votes to 625,194. In 1964, MacKenzie challenged incumbent Democratic state senator James J. Long in the 7th Middlesex District. He lost 53% to 47%. In 1966, MacKenzie challenged Long again. This time, MacKenzie won with 55% of the vote. =Proposed legislation= In 1969, MacKenzie and Representative John Mella sponsored a plan to expand Fenway Park. Their bill would have granted the Boston Redevelopment Authority the power to purchase land outside Fenway Park and sell it to a private developer. The park's capacity would have been raised to 50,000 by knocking out the Green Monster and installing double- decker bleachers throughout the park. In addition to housing the Boston Red Sox, the expanded stadium would have been home to the Boston Patriots. In November of that year, MacKenzie filed legislation to select a 4,000 acre (1,600 ha) site for the construction of a planned community that could house 250,000 people. Also in 1969, MacKenzie filed a bill that would make possession of marijuana a misdemeanor rather than a felony. =Leadership positions= From 1971 to 1977, MacKenzie served as Assistant Minority Floor Leader. In 1972 he chaired a special legislative committee that studied the effect salting roads had on water sources. The committee recommended that the Department of Health control the storage of de-icing materials and ban their use if water sources become endangered. It also recommended that all levels of government be required to report how much salt they use. =MBM scandal= On August 13, 1976 a grand jury indicted MacKenzie and fellow Senator Joseph DiCarlo on charges that they extorted $40,000 from a consulting company. According to the indictment, MacKenzie and DiCarlo threatened McKee-Berger- Mansueto, Inc. (MBM), the consulting company supervising construction of the University of Massachusetts Boston campus at Columbia Point, with an unfavorable report from the legislative committee investigating their contract unless they were paid. MacKenzie and DiCarlo were charged with violating the Hobbs Act, which forbids extortion by public officials, and the Travel Act, which forbids crossing state lines for the purpose of extortion. On February 25, 1977, they were found guilty of all charges. MacKenzie was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $5,000. Three days after his conviction for extortion, on February 28, MacKenzie resigned as Assistant Minority Floor Leader. However, he refused to resign his Senate seat. The conduct of MacKenzie and DiCarlo was referred to the newly formed Senate Ethics Committee, and on March 31, 1977, the day before the committee was to issue its report, MacKenzie resigned from the Senate. Post-political career MacKenzie served ten months at the Federal Correctional Institution in Allenwood. After his release in October 1978 he did paralegal work in the offices of attorney Richard M. Riley and State Senator Michael LoPresti Jr. On August 19, 1981 the Burlington Board of Selectmen voted 3 to 2 to make MacKenzie the town's Director of Veterans' Services. In December 1983 the Massachusetts Board of Bar Examiners ruled that MacKenzie was eligible to be a lawyer in spite of his conviction. He went on to pass the bar and practice law part-time. On June 24, 1991, the Board of Selectmen voted 3 to 2 against Mackenzie's reappointment as Director of Veterans' Services on the grounds that they did not want him to practice law while serving as the town's veterans' agent. MacKenzie currently operates a law practice in Burlington.

Tackett was a lifelong activist, organizing Martin Luther King, Jr.'s visit to Wrigley Field in 1963 and participating in the Selma march in 1965. She was involved with the NAACP in Los Angeles, and in 1963 was unanimously elected as the education chair for the United Civil Rights Council (UCRC), which placed her at the forefront of education activism in Los Angeles from the 1960s to the 1980s.  Early life  Marnesba Tackett was born Marnesba Tillmon in Kansas City, Kansas on February 4, 1908 to Ivory and Elizabeth Edwards Adkins. She spent most of her early life in Kansas City, graduating from Sumner High School, where she met her husband Joseph Edgar Tackett, a minister. Tackett graduated with a degree in social sciences from Kansas City College and worked selling insurance. She participated in sit-ins and protests throughout the 1930s and 1940s, both in Kansas City and in other states. In 1952, Tackett and her husband moved to Los Angeles, where he was installed as associate minister of Second Baptist Church.  Activism in Los Angeles  = 1950s = After the Brown v. Board decision, many civil rights leaders in Los Angeles began to protest the treatment of racial minorities in the Los Angeles Unified School District. Black students were forced into overcrowded schools, many of which had double- session days to accommodate the large number of students they taught. In addition, the city's teachers were almost universally white, and majority- black schools lacked the resources that their white-dominated schools enjoyed. Many schools funneled minority students into vocational programs rather than preparing them for college, and textbooks used by the Los Angeles school system contained racist caricatures of black Americans. Concerned by the segregation in Los Angeles' schools, Tackett ran for and was elected as the chair of the local NAACP's education committee, where she won a lawsuit against the city's racist textbooks. = 1960s and 1970s = As the Civil Rights Movement gained momentum in the south during the late 1950s and early 1960s, many activists in northern and western states began to push against the de facto segregation that dominated cities in the region, especially in the school systems. During the era, Los Angeles was more segregated than many southern cities. In response to this discrimination, the NAACP, CORE, and other civil rights organizations called for a desegregation movement in Los Angeles. In 1961, Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke to a crowd of 28,000 people; two years later, he returned to speak at Wrigley Field to a crowd of 35,000, a rally which Tackett helped organize. Tackett joined the board of the Los Angeles SCLC in 1966, a post she held until 1976, eventually becoming the organization's first female executive director. In this role, she worked to desegregate Los Angeles county schools, bringing several cases to the courts while working with the ACLU. = Later life = In her later life, Tackett remained involved in SCLC West, holding leadership positions throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Tackett died on December 17, 2007 at the age of 99.

The single story H-shaped building was built in 1929 with funding support from the Rosenwald Fund, a major philanthropic effort to improve educational opportunities for African-Americans. It is similar to other schools of the period, with banks of windows providing plentiful light to its seven classrooms. Sometime in the 1940s an auditorium was added to the west side. The building was the second built for the training school with Rosenwald support; the first, a four-room building, was built in 1924 but has not survived. The school building is significant as the only surviving Rosenwald-funded school in Chicot County. Its design was based on standard plans developed by Samuel Smith, an agent for the Rosenwald Fund who developed a plan book for various configurations of school buildings, to be used in the fund's work without necessating the need for an architect for each facility built. The design incorporated an \\"industrial\\" room, in which trades could be taught, and the building was sited according to Rosenwald recommendations for the best use of natural lighting. The building served as a public school facility until 1975, after which it was sold to Morris-Booker Memorial College, which was in 2004 using it as a Head Start facility.

E., & Roberts, W. C. (1973). Quadricuspid semilunar valve. The American Journal of Cardiology, 31(5), 623‚Äì626. It is a defect that occurs during embryological development of the aortic trunk during gestation.Tutarel, O. (2004). The quadricuspid aortic valve: a comprehensive review. The Journal of Heart Valve Disease, 13(4), 534-537. There is an increased risk of developing post-natal aortic regurgitations and other heart-related diseases; therefore patients with the condition should be carefully monitored.Zhu, J., Zhang, J., Wu, S., Zhang, Y., Ding, F., & Mei, J. (2013). Congenital quadricuspid aortic valve associated with aortic insufficiency and mitral regurgitation. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery, 8(1), 87. Signs and symptoms =Complications= The most common complications of QAV are aortic regurgitations. This is caused by the inadequate closing of the four cusps at the end of systole. The fourth dysplastic cusp is incapable of fully closing the aortic annulus, which causes a backflow of blood through the aortic valve. Using transthoracic echocardiograms, 3-D TEE and ECG traces, it is also possible to find left ventricular hypertrophy, bundle branch blocks, and abnormal displacement of the ostium in the right coronary artery in association with QAV. Some research has shown increased incidences of atrial fibrillation to be associated but this relationship is not yet clearly established. Diagnosis  Previously, diagnosis was usually done through autopsy. Advances in imaging technologies allow for early detection and thus ample treatment and monitoring of the affected patient. A short-axis ultrasound of the aortic valve allows for the best view of the aortic valve, and gives a clear indication of the adduction pattern of the aortic valves. If an ‚ÄúX‚Äù shape is seen, then the patient can be diagnosed with having a quadricuspid aortic valve. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) indicates if there is an aortic regurgitation, but a 3-D transesophageal echocardiogram can give a better view of the aortic valve.Janosi, R. A., Lind, T., Buck, T., & Erbel, R. (2013). Quadricuspid Aortic Valve Revealed by Real-Time, 3-Dimensional Transesophageal Echocardiography. Texas Heart Institute Journal, 40(2), 207. Multidetector coronary CT angiography has been indicated as a single competent diagnostic imaging tool capable of delineating valvular anatomy, severity of regurgitation, and high risk coronary problems.Douglas, H., Moore, M., & Purvis, J. (2012). Comprehensive assessment of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary arteries by multidetector cardiac CT. Heart, 98(24), 1838-1838. =Classification= There have been seven described variations of the quadricuspid aortic valve. They are classified on a scale from A to G and describe the variations in size of the four cusps. The most common variation is that of B ‚Äì three equal-sized cusps and one smaller cusp. There is no correlation between the anatomy and functional status of the aortic cusps. Treatment The typical method of treatment is through surgery such as aortic valve reconstruction surgery (AVRS) and aortic valve replacement, usually with a synthetic valve.Song, M. G., Yang, H. S., Lee, D. H., Shin, J. K., Chee, H. K., & Kim, J. S. (2014). Mid-term results in patients having tricuspidization of the quadricuspid aortic valve. Journal of cardiothoracic surgery, 9(1), 29.

Originally published as I Changed Gods in 1968, it was more popularly released in 1973 as Hansi: The Girl Who Loved the Swastika, which according to her Amazon biography, sold more than 400,000 copies and was translated into several languages including Polish and Russian. Later editions are titled Hansi: The Girl who Left the Swastika. Her autobiography was also published as a comic book by Spire Christian Comics. The book chronicles Hirschmann's early childhood as an orphan and her subsequent indoctrination by the Hitler Youth after the Nazi invasion Czechoslovakia. Taught to distrust Americans, she was later rescued by US troops stationed in Europe. Hirschmann describes her disillusionment with the Nazi ideology, which she calls brainwashing. She comes to repudiate Nazism and develops a great appreciation for the American people. The book concluded with her immigration to the United States where she founded a Christian ministry. Hirschmann has led Hansi Ministries since 1974 and released several more books discussing her youth and her religious beliefs. Comic Book Adaptation In 1973, Hansi: The Girl who Loved the Swastika became one of Spire Christian Comics biographical series. Based on the autobiography, it was drawn by Al Hartley, a comic veteran whose career dated back to the 1940s, who became a born-again Christian later in life. Other Spire Comics biographies included Dutch resistance hero Corrie ten Boom and American musician Johnny Cash. Since the advent of the internet, due to its striking cover and unusual subject matter compared to the usual superhero comics, Hansi has appeared on many online lists such as \\"12 Comics That Should Never Become Live-Action Movies,\\" \\"16 Unforgettable Comic Book Cover Mistakes You Can‚Äôt Unsee,\\" \\"10 Rare Holy Grails For Comic Collectors (That You May Not Know About),\\" and others. Comic book historian Fredrik Str√∂mberg in his 2010 book Comic Art Propaganda: A Graphic History stated, \\"it‚Äôs quite a fascinating story and becomes even more so when you know that it was based on a true story. The Hansi comic book was part of a series of biographies of famous Christians in the 1970s... the Hansi comic book was based on the autobiography of Maria Anne Hirschmann, who actually lived through most of what is described in the comic.\\" = Plot = Hansi is a na√Øve young peasant girl in Sudetenland, who is mesmerized by the F√ºhrer and reading books. After the Sudetenland is transferred from Czechoslovakia to Germany in October 1938, she welcomes the Sudetenland \\"going home to the Reich\\". She wins a contest, organized by Adolf Hitler, that picks students for special training in National socialist schools in Prague. Her mother is delighted, but warns her in advance to \\"never forget Jesus Christ\\". As Hansi arrives in Prague, she is educated into antisemitism, but has doubts since Jesus himself was a Jew. Still, despite people informing her about the famine and horrors of the war she remains enthusiastic about Hitler. Hansi is also in love with a German U-boat sailor named Rudy, but his parents disapprove of the marriage because she is just a peasant. Since she doesn't want to break him and his parents apart she breaks the relationship off. By now Hansi is so brainwashed that she condemns the Bible as \\"outdated\\" and only fit for \\"cowards and weaklings\\". As the war progresses Hansi and other people have to evacuate Prague because the Russians are on their way. Despite other people around her realizing that the war is a lost cause, Hansi remains confident in the F√ºhrer. She is sent off to a Russian prisoner camp, where she and other girls have to work in slave labor and become victim of rape, except for Hansi who is too skinny to be taken advantage of by the men. Hansi and a girlfriend decide to escape to the American prisoner camps, despite her friend's objections about the USA. They manage to cross the border safely and escape Red Army soldiers trying to shoot refugees. Despite all the misery around her, Hansi still has her faith in Jesus. As Hansi reaches the American prisoner camp, she is amazed how good the American soldiers treat her. As the war is over and Germany lies in rubble Hansi decides to become a teacher. Then it turns out Rudy is still alive. They become a couple again, but after a year they feel something \\"is missing from their lives\\". Rudy re-introduces Hansi to the Bible, but she feels unsure whether she can still believe as she suffered through so much misery. Over the years she and Rudy raise a family and become good Christians. They travel to the US, where Hansi wonders whether all the materialism \\"obscured God's blessings\\" and made her students \\"troubled\\" and \\"unsure where to give their allegiance\\". As Hansi takes the flag salute, she is finally convinced about the goodness of the United States, when she hears the phrase \\"one nation under God\\", because \\"it's all right to love what God has blessed\\". Now Rudy and Hansi decide to promote the Bible to young people and explain the splendor of America's freedom.

Spring, 479 U.S. 564 (1987), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a suspect's awareness of the crimes about which he may be questioned is not relevant to his waiver of his Fifth Amendment rights.  Background  While on vacation in Colorado, a man named John Leroy Spring purportedly murdered one Donald Walker in the month of February 1979. There was supposedly an anonymous accomplice who assisted Spring, but no such person was ever apprehended in the investigation of Walker's death. An informant, whose identity was concealed, tipped off agents in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as to Spring's alleged involvement in the illegal interstate transportation of ill- gotten firearms. The agents also learned that John Spring talked with an unknown party about the Walker homicide and the role he played in it.. Working off the information provided by the informant, ATF agents planned out a sting operation to arrest Spring on the 30th of March. Their goal came to fruition, as Spring was successfully caught and arrested in Kansas City, Missouri for the crime of the illegal distribution of stolen firearms. They hoped this arrest would provide a launching pad from which to judge him as a suspect in the investigation of the Walker homicide. As required by Miranda v. Arizona, Spring was advised of his fifth amendment rights to protection against self- incrimination, an attorney, and silence when interrogated. Spring was actually reminded twice of his rights: first on the scene of the arrest, then again back at the ATF office in Kansas City. However, Spring opted to waive them through written signature. He then voluntarily made a statement and answered questions regarding the ongoing investigation surrounding his involvement in illegal interstate firearms trafficking. The ATF agents began the interrogation by asking Spring to elaborate on the firearms transactions that directly led to his arrest, so as not to give away that they planned on eventually questioning about the death of Walker. From there, the agents progressed to the topic of whether or not he had a prior a criminal record. When Spring admitted he shot his aunt at age ten, the agents saw an opportunity. Given Spring had just confessed to shooting someone as close to him as a family member, they questioned whether or not there were other victims. In response, Spring lowered his head and simply uttered the phrase, ‚ÄúI shot another guy once,‚Äù without specifically naming or describing the man who he fired upon. The agents pressed further, first asking if he ever visited the state of Colorado in the past, and if the man he claimed to have shot was named Donald Walker. They also questioned if he used a snowbank to hide Walker's corpse, in the case that he did murder the man. Spring responded to both questions with a ‚Äúno,‚Äù and the interview ended at this point. Nearly two months later, on May 26, 1979, Spring, after having once again waived his Miranda rights through written signature, verbally confessed to the Colorado murder to Colorado law enforcement officers. He then signed a formal statement which bound him to this confession, a confession that would ultimately seal his fate for better or worse.\\"FindLaw  Cases and Codes.\\" FindLaw  Cases and Codes. Web. 27 Oct. 2014. Trial When charged with first-degree murder in a Colorado state court, however, Spring and his attorney did not sit idly by. Instead, they moved quickly to nullify the statements made by Spring on May 26 and March 30; the basis of their argument was that the interrogating agents violated his due process rights as decreed by Miranda v. Arizona. Spring and his defending attorney emphasized that, as he was not notified prior to interrogation that he would be questioned about the killing of Donald Walker, the ATF agents pushed him to incriminate himself. The trial court insisted that this statement be deemed inadmissible not because of the failure by the ATF agents to notify Spring of the focus of the interrogation, but because his statement that he ‚Äúshot another guy once‚Äù was irrelevant, and that the context of the discussion did not point to his aforementioned confession being about his participation in the Walker homicide. However, the court held that the May 26th statement, as it was made freely, voluntarily, and intelligently, should be admitted as evidence, thus convicting Spring of the first-degree murder of Donald Walker. This holding was reversed by the Colorado Court of Appeals, who sided with the argument proposed by Spring's legal team that the failure on part of the ATF agents to inform Spring of the topic of questioning prior to the interrogation should invalidate the March 30th statement. The court also argued that the State of Colorado failed to substantially prove that the May 26th statement was not the illegal ‚Äúfruit‚Äù of the March 30th statement; this doctrine of ‚Äúfruit of the poisonous tree‚Äù holds that if any evidence is collected through illegal means, like entering a house without a (proper) search warrant, then such evidence must not be admitted into trial. This holds true even for an interrogation; if tactics used in an interrogation are illegal, or if the interrogation itself is illegally performed, then it, along with any physical evidence it produces, may be excluded from trial.\\"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree.\\" LII / Legal Information Institute. Cornell Law, n.d. Web. 10 Dec. 2014. The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed the holding made by the Court of Appeals, once again saying the murder confession made on May 26 was the illegal ‚Äúfruit‚Äù of the March 30th statement. The Supreme Court of the United States, in the Spring decision, reversed the rulings of both the Colorado Supreme Court and the Colorado Court of Appeals. By a vote of seven to two, the Supreme Court held that the interrogating officers‚Äô failure to notify the suspect that they would question him about the Walker murder did not impact, and thus invalidate, his waiver of his Miranda rights.\\"Validity of Waiver.\\" LexisNexis Litigation Essentials. LexisNexis, n.d. Web. 11 Dec. 2014. Delivering the majority opinion, Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. stated that the Court's only focus of inquiry was the March 30th statement, as it was the illegality of this statement that supposedly marred the May 26th statement.Spitzer, Gregory E. \\"Fifth Amendment--Validity of Waiver: A Suspect Need Not Know the Subjects of Interrogation.\\" Journal of Criminal and Criminology.

History  = 1873-1974 = The history of Peerless-Premier is closely intertwined with the metal working and foundry industry in Belleville, IL. The first stove foundry in Belleville was built in 1873. By 1915, there were 15 large foundries in Belleville of which seven were exclusively casting stoves. Over time there were new foundries built, foundries that went out of business, others that were merged, or names and assets transferred, making the history of the foundry business in Bellville rather non-linear. The history of 'Peerless-Premier' can be traced primarily to two companies: The Premier Stove Company and the Peerless Enamel Products Co. although elements of other foundries would also eventually become part of the company. The Premier Stove Company was founded in Belleville, in 1912 by Maurice G. Klemme and Arthur C. Krebs. In 1915, the Father and brother of Maurice Klemme, Gottlieb and Alvin, located the Cabirange Stove Manufacturing Company in Belleville. The Peerless Enamel Products Co. was founded in 1928. This company was exclusively a contract enameling company and did not have a foundry or produce finished stoves. During World War II, Premier had a contract for bomb casings. = 1975-present = In November, 1975, Peerless acquired all capital stock of Premier. Premier was a wholly owned subsidiary of Peerless until January 1982, when the current company was formed by combining the operating units into one company. In 1981, Peerless-Premier purchased the Eagle Product line. The Eagle name was first used in Belleville by a foundry built in 1883 by Gottlieb D. Klemme and William Schott. At one time, Eagle had an annual output of over 100,000 ranges and heaters. In 1990, the company acquired assets of Top Shelf, a manufacturer of stands that allowed a microwave oven to be stacked above a range. A fire at the Belleville plant in 1997 damaged the enameling furnace forcing the plant to shut down and furlough about 380 workers. Production resumed after making arrangements with four different porcelainizing suppliers with a planned production levels of 950 ranges per day. It was reported in 2004 that Peerless-Premier received a grant from the State of Illinois for $44,000 for employee training based on 2003 revenues of $40,000,000. In 2005 Peerless-Premier laid off 100 of it 250 workers in Belleville, IL and moved the jobs to Clinton, KY citing more favorable wages and competition from Mexico. By 2013, there were only two descendants of the numerous stove manufactures left in Belleville, Peerless-Premier and Empire Comfort Systems (formerly Empire Stove).  Current Products  The company currently manufactures a wide range of electric and gas ranges under the Premier name and manufactures a microwave accessory shelf under the Top Shelf trade name. Electric ranges are available in 20, 24 and 30\\" widths. Gas ranges are available in 20, 24, 30 and 36\\" widths. There is also a Pro-series line of gas ranges in 20 to 36\\" widths.

Aviation in the U.S. Army, 1919‚Äì1939, Office of Air Force History, Washington, D.C. With the decision to consolidate made, the Air Service Primary Flying School at Carlstrom Field, Florida, was closed and a new one opened at Brooks Field. The 11th School Group was organized to perform duties as the headquarters for the new Air Corps Primary Flying School. Three Flying Training Squadrons (46th, 47th, 48th) were assigned to the group to train the flying cadets. The Air Service revamped the course and extended it to nine months but later trimmed it to six with two classes a year. The first part consisted of ground school, stressing military training as well as classwork more directly related to the business of flying. Flying training comprised the second half of the primary course. Starting with straight-and-level flying accompanied by an instructor in a dual trainer, the student advanced step by step until he could solo, execute a variety of maneuvers, and deal with many of the situations arising in flight. If the cadet review board (Benzine Board) did not get him, he graduated with the rating of junior airplane pilot (JAP). In 1927 basic flight training moved out of the advanced phase and combined with primary. At that point, primary-basic changed to eight months in length and advanced to four months.Manning, Thomas A. (2005), History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942‚Äì2002. Office of History and Research, Headquarters, AETC, Randolph AFB, Texas When primary training got under way at Brooks field, the dual trainer was the Curtiss JN-6H Jenny. Brooks later accepted other planes, including Vought VE-7s and TA-3s, for evaluation, but Curtiss JNs were used until 1926. The beginning class in March of that year was the first without Jennies. Students now flew in the new Consolidated PT-1, with tandem seats and a Wright E engine. The decision by the Coolidge Administration in 1926 to expand the Air Corps found the facilities in San Antonio were insufficient to accommodate the expanded number of cadets entering primary training. Also the growth of the City of San Antonio created hazards for training. As a result, two additional training squadrons (51st and 52d) were authorized at Brooks, and March Field, California, was re-opened as a primary pilot training school in July 1927 as a temporary measure. Plans were put into place to expand the facilities in San Antonio with a single large field outside of the city to house all flying training. The new field, which constituted the largest construction project for the Army Corps of Engineers since the Panama Canal was named Randolph Field. By the fall of 1931, construction of Randolph was essentially completed, and the primary schools at Brooks and March were moved to the new installation. With the transfer of the school, the 11th School Group was demobilized on 31 December 1931. = Lineage= * Organized on 1 September 1922 as the 11th Group Headquarters (School) : Re-designated 25 January 1923 as 11th School Group : Demobilized on 31 December 1931Clay, Steven E.

She represented District 126 in northwestern Harris County from 2007 until 2017 with relatively little electoral opposition. In the general election held on November 6, 2018, Harless' husband, Sam Harless, won her former legislative seat and was sworn into office in January 2019. Harless was unopposed for her fifth term in the state House in the November 4, 2014 general election. Background A fourth-generation Texan, Harless attended public school in the Spring Independent School District but graduated from the private Candlestick Christian Academy. In 1995, she received a Bachelor of Science in Business Management from LeTourneau University in Longview. Harless is the chief executive officer of Fred Fincher Motors, an independent dealership at 4700 Tomball Parkway in Houston. She is active in a plethora of civic groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the American Heart Association, the 100 Club of Houston, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, and the Lone Star College System Foundation, a community college network in northwestern Harris County. In 1998, then Governor George W. Bush appointed Harless to the Texas Motor Vehicle Board; Bush's successor, Rick Perry reappointed her, and she remained in that post until 2005. Harless has also served in various Republican campaigns and party organizations, including the Northwest Forest Republican Women, and the Texas Tea Party Republican Women. She is affiliated with the Champion Forest Baptist Church, a megachurch in the Champion Forest neighborhood of northwestern Houston. Harless and her husband, Eric Sam Harless, have one son together. Sam Harless currently holds his wife's former legislative seat as of January 2019. Political life In 2006, when the incumbent Republican State Representative Peggy Hamric did not seek reelection, Harless entered the party primary to succeed her. She defeated John Devine, 3,871 (52.4 percent) to 3,538 (47.8 percent). In the 2006 general election, Harless defeated the Democratic candidate, Chad Khan, 18,112 votes (64.8 percent) to 9,114 (32.6 percent. The remaining 2.6 percent of the ballots were cast for the Libertarian nominee Oscar J. Palma Jr. In 2008, Harless again defeated Khan and Palma, 32,748 votes (59.4 percent) to 21,179 (38.4 percent), and 1,204 (2.2 percent), respectively. In 2010, Harless handily defeated Democrat Casey L. McKinney, 25,534 (68.1 percent) to 11, 938 (31.9 percent). Harless was the chairman of the House Environmental Regulation Committee and also serves on the State Affairs Committee. In 2013, Harless' husband, Sam, also a Republican, announced that he would run for the District 7 seat in the Texas State Senate vacated by Dan Patrick, a runoff candidate for lieutenant governor on May 27, 2014. Mr. Harless soon withdrew from the race due to a lawsuit against the couple from a previous employer at their used car dealership that drew in negative national attention. Additionally, party insiders had already lined up early behind Paul Bettencourt, the former Harris County assessor-collector, who won the nomination to succeed Patrick on March 4 by a wide margin. In late September 2015, it was announced in a Breitbart News exclusive that Harless had joined a Texas leadership team consisting of 25 other notable state leaders who were backing Carly Fiorina for president in the 2016 Republican primary. In 2018, Harless endorsed her outgoing successor, State Representative Kevin Roberts, for Texas' 2nd Congressional District while campaigning for her husband who was seeking and ultimately succeeded in becoming Roberts successor for Texas State Representative of House District 126. In 2019, Harless endorsed the re- election of Democratic Houston Mayor, Sylvester Turner. =Legislative voting records= Representative Harless in 2013 supported the ban on abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. She also voted for companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a move which opponents said could lead to the closure of many abortion clinics in the state. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the state Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth, who in 2014 is the Democratic nominee for governor against the Republican Greg Abbott. In 2011, Harless supported two other anti-abortion measures. One forbids state funding of agencies which perform abortions. The other requires that a woman undergo a sonogram before procuring an abortion. This legislation is based on the view that a woman could change her mind about an abortion once she witnesses the development of the unborn child through the latest technology. Despite her support for these measures, the Texas Right to Life Committee, according to Project Vote Smart, rated Harless only 36 percent favorable in 2013 and 71 percent in 2011. Harless supported legislation to provide marshals for school security as a separate law-enforcement entity. She also co- sponsored the successful bill to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain businesses. Harless voted for the adoption of the biennial state budgets in both 2013 and 2011. She voted to require testing for narcotics of those individuals receiving unemployment compensation. Harless co-sponsored the bill to prohibit the state government from engaging in the enforcement of federal regulations of firearms. She also co-sponsored the measure to allow college and university officials to carry concealed weapons in buildings and vehicles in the name of campus security. She supported the bill to reduce the time required to obtain a concealed-carry permit. She backed the redistricting bills for the state House and Senate and the United States House of Representatives. She voted for term limits for certain state officials. She co-sponsored legislation to prohibit texting while driving. In 2011, she voted against a resolution to reduce funding for state agencies. She voted to levy a sales tax on Internet transactions to match existing laws for brick and mortar stores; the measure passed the House 125-20. Harless voted to prohibit smoking in public places. She voted to establish eligibility for indigent health care. She voted for corporal punishment in public schools; the bill passed the House, 80-64. Harless voted to require colleges and universities to make student centers compatible with traditional family values. To guarantee the integrity of the election process, she supported picture identification of voters casting a ballot. The measure finally took effect in October 2013 and was used widely without incident in the primaries on March 4, 2014. In 2013, Harless supported related legislation to forbid a voter from turning in multiple ballots. =Interest group ratings= Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, managed in Texas by Cathie Adams, a former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party, rated Harless 73 percent favorable in 2013 but only 24 percent in 2011. The Young Conservatives of Texas gave her a cumulative score in 2013 of 67 percent. The interest group Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, founded by Michael Quinn Sullivan rated Harless 50 percent favorable in 2013 and 38 percent in 2011. The Texas Association of Business, which awarded her a cumulative score of 88 percent, named her a \\"Champion for Free Enterprise\\". The Texas League of Conservation Voters rated her 86 percent in 2013; the Sierra Club, 42 percent in 2011. The Libertarian Party rated her 75 percent in 2009 on combined issues of economics and personal liberties. The National Rifle Association scored Harless 92 percent in 2012 and letter-grade \\"A\\" in her previous term.

Between 2013 and 2019 abortion access was restricted due to a law passed by a conservative government in 2013. A new law was passed in 2019 liberalizing access. At its peak in 1986, the abortion rate in the Republic of Macedonia was 70.6 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15‚Äì44; the rate fell after independence, to 28.5 by 1996. , the abortion rate was 11.1 abortions per 1000 women aged 15‚Äì44. The 2013 Law on Termination of Pregnancy Between 2005‚Äì2016, Macedonia was strongly dominated by conservative political forces, which promoted traditional values.https://whogoverns.eu/1830-2/ A strong anti-abortion movement developed, which culminated with a new anti-abortion law in 2013. The government of Macedonia, backed by the Macedonian Orthodox Church, has also conducted advertising campaigns against abortion, aimed at increasing the country's birth rate. Although abortion is still permitted, access has been restricted. In 2013, the Parliament passed the law, just 20 days after it had received the first draft. Although some changes from the original harsh draft of the law were made, due to opposition from the public and NGOs, several restrictions remained ‚Äì restrictions which complicate the access to abortion.http://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/strategic_framework_macedonia.pdf https://hera.org.mk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Ana-M-Kajevska-Abortus- Ukinuvanje-na-demokratijata_ENG.pdf The new law enacted includes: mandatory filing of a written request for the termination of unwanted pregnancy by the woman to the appropriate health institution, mandatory counseling about the potential advantages of continuing the pregnancy, as well as about the health risks for the woman from undergoing an abortion, and a mandatory waiting period of three days after counseling before medical intervention is conducted to terminate the pregnancy.http://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CCPR/Shared%20Documents/MKD/INT_CCPR_ICO_MKD_17688_E.docx. The original form of the law also stipulated that the woman's partner had to be informed about the abortion ‚Äì a provision which drew severe opposition and was consequently withdrawn.http://www.criticatac.ro/lefteast/womens-rights-in- macedonia/ The law, as well as the anti-abortion campaigns, have been criticized as stigmatizing women and being contrary to women's rights.http://www.ippfen.org/news/new-abortion-law-macedonia-hurts-women-and- girls The 2019 Law on Termination of Pregnancy A new law was enacted in 2019, overturning the obstacles which made access to abortion difficult under the former law.http://www.ippfen.org/blogs/north-macedonias-abortion-care-law- signals-new-dawn-reproductive-freedom-0 References North Macedonia Category:Health in North Macedonia North Macedonia ","title":"Abortion in North Macedonia"},{"id":"42301760","text":"The Epic of American Civilization is a mural by the social realist painter Jos√© Clemente Orozco. It is located in the basement reading room of the Baker Memorial Library on the campus of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The mural, painted between 1932 and 1934, consists of a series of 24 fresco panels, whose principal themes are the impact of both indigenous Native Americans and European colonists on North America, and the impact of war (particularly the Mexican Civil War and the First World War) and rapid industrialization on the human spirit. Orozco painted the mural during the same time his fellow muralist, Diego Rivera, was working on his murals at the Rockefeller Center in New York. But while Rivera's portrait of Lenin led to his mural being painted over, Orozco was given full political freedom to paint as he chose. His images offended a group of Dartmouth parents who called themselves the Boston Mothers. \\"We would be everlastingly grateful to you,\\" the mothers wrote to college president Ernest Hopkins, \\"if the pictures could be destroyed.\\" Another letter to Hopkins was more blunt: \\"Orozco has shouted forth in paint the Communist Manifesto!\\" But Hopkins, a lifelong Republican, defended Orozco's right to paint as he chose. \\"There are 100% Americans who have objected to the fact that we employed a Mexican to do this work,\\" Hopkins wrote to the mothers, \\"but I have never believed that art could be made either racial or national.\\"Ibid. Responding to concerns that Orozco's imagery was not \\"nice\\", Hopkins wrote, \\"if that be a criterion of judgment many of the great works of the medieval masters would have to be removed from the Louvre.\\"Ibid. The mural was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2013. Background The mural was Orozco's third and last work in the United States, following Prometheus at Pomona College in Southern California and a mural cycle at The New School in Manhattan. The Coming and Departure of Quetzalcoatl The two themes of the mural are arranged in separate wings of the reading room. The west wing contains ten panels on the first theme, that of Native Americans. ;Migration This panel is located on the short western wall, to the left of the doors. It depicts the arrival of natives as a grim march, echoing the industrially-oriented panel at the far eastern end of the room. ;Snake and Spears Located over the western doors, this panel shows a rattlesnake flanked by spears. Its color palette suggests it was painted when Orozco worked on the eastern panels. ;Ancient Human Sacrifice This panel, to the right of the western doors, depicts human sacrifice as practiced by ancient Mesoamericans, in which the living heart is removed from the sacrificial victim. The panel has an analog (as the first one does) on the opposite wall of the east wing. ;Aztec Warriors This and the next four panels are on the north wall of the west wing. This one depicts Aztec warriors wearing eagle and jaguar costumes, and includes a representation of the head of the plumed serpent god Quetzalcoatl. ;Coming of Quetzalcoatl Quetzalcoatl is presented as a benevolent god in human form. He is shown granting the benefits of education and culture on his people, and driving off older gods. ;The Pre-Columbian Golden Age The benefits of agriculture, arts, and science brought by Quetzalcoatl bring a golden age. A man works crops, another creates a stone stele, and a third studies the stars. ;Departure of Quetzalcoatl Adherents of the banished gods band together to drive Quetzalcoatl away. Sorcerers massed in front of a pyramidal temple oppose the departing god. ;The Prophecy This small panel, located above a door, depicts Spanish conquistadors on horseback wielding a giant Christian cross as a weapon. ;Totem Poles This pair of vertical panels are applied to poles in the western half of the room. They are caricatures of totem poles found in the Pacific Northwest. Cortez and the Modern Era ;Machine Totems These vertical panels depict modern industrial themes in a manner similar to a totem pole. They are applied to poles in the eastern half of the room. ;Cortez and the Cross This panel and the next four are located on the south wall of the eastern half of the room. Orozco depicts Hern√°n Cort√©s as a brutal anti-hero leading the 16th century Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, fulfilling the prophecy of Quetzalcoatl. Cort√©s stands surrounded by images of destruction, accompanied by a cross-bearing Franciscan friar. ;The Machine This panel marks the transition to the 20th century, depicting a mass of machinery with no discernible function. ;Anglo-America Orozco presents a visually mixed assessment of North American society. A schoolhouse and town meeting are shown, but an overbearing schoolteacher dominates the scene, and the town meeting is presented with rigidity. ;Hispano-America A modern Mexican rebel, resembling Emilio Zapata, dominates a caricature of rich and militaristic society. ;Gods of the Modern World This panel savages the institutional church's indifference to the social upheavals of the 1930s, with flames reminiscent of the scenes from this section's first panel. ;Symbols of Nationalism This small panel is located above a door on the north wall of the east side. It depicts a junk pile of historical symbols of warfare and empire. ;Modern Human Sacrifice An analog to the \\"Ancient Human Sacrifice\\" panel on the west side, this panel shows the body of a soldier, wrapped in the trappings of patriotism, symbolizing the pointless sacrifice of the individual for the institution. This panel is to the left of the easternmost doors. ;Modern Migration of the Spirit A depiction of Jesus, sweeps away old religious and political ideologies, discarding symbols of religion, culture, and the military. This panel is to the right of the easternmost doors. ;Chain of Spirit This panel, located over doors on the south side of the eastern half, shows vultures wearing clerical collars. They hold keys to chains of bondage piled below them. ;Modern Industrial Man This is a series of five panels, centrally located by the reserve reading desk. It presents Orozco's vision for a possible new world (after the actions of Jesus in the \\"Modern Migration of the Spirit\\" panel) in which workers are free to benefit from their own labor, and the different cultures are able to coexist harmoniously.

A related technique, the western blot, is used to detect a protein of interest that involves transferring proteins that are separated by gel electrophoresis onto a nitrocellulose membrane. A colored precipitate clusters along the band on the membrane containing a particular target protein. A northern blot is a similar analytical technique that, instead of detecting a protein of interest, is used to study gene expression by detection of RNA (or isolated mRNA) on a similar membrane. The northwestern blot combines the two techniques, and specifically involves the identification of labeled RNA that interact with proteins that are immobilized on a similar nitrocellulose membrane. History Edwin Southern first created the Southern blot, an analytical technique used to detect DNA. The technique involves using gel electrophoresis, an important analytical method that involves the use of an electric field and the subsequent migration of charged DNA, RNA or proteins through that electric field based on size and charge. With a Southern Blot, the separated DNA fragments are then transferred to a filter membrane for detection. Detection occurs as bands become visible on the membrane and correlate with a particular molecule of interest. Subsequently, other similar blotting techniques were created with similar nomenclature to detect different molecules or interactions between molecules. These techniques include the western blot (protein detection), the northern blot (RNA detection), the southwestern blot (DNA-protein interaction detection), the eastern blot (post translational modification detection) and the northwestern blot (RNA-protein interaction detection).Alberts, B., Johnson, A., Lewis, J.

S., Kalogeris, T., Grisham, M. B., Alexander, J. S. (1997) An Improved, Rapid Northern Protocol. Biochem. and Biophys. Research Comm. 238:277-279. Technique specifics Running a northwestern blot involves separating the RNA binding proteins by gel electrophoresis, which will separate the RNA binding proteins based upon their size and charge. Individual samples can be loaded in to the agarose or polyacrylamide gel (usually an SDS-PAGE) in order to analyze multiple samples at the same time. Once the gel electrophoresis is complete, the gel and associated RNA binding proteins are transferred to a nitrocellulose transfer paper. The newly transferred blots are then soaked in a blocking solution; non-fat milk and bovine serum albumin are common blocking buffers. This blocking solution assists with preventing non-specific binding of the primary and/or secondary antibodies to the nitrocellulose membrane. Once the blocking solution has adequate contact time with the blot, a specific competitor RNA is applied and given time to incubate at room temperature. During this time, the competitor RNA binds to the RNA binding proteins in the samples that are on the blot. The incubation time during this process can vary depending on the concentration of the competitor RNA applied; though incubation time is typically one hour. After the incubation is complete, the blot is usually washed at least 3 times for 5 minutes each wash, in order to dilute out the RNA in the solution. Common wash buffers include Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or a 10% Tween 20 solution. Improper or inadequate washing will affect the clarity of the development of the blot. Once washing is complete the blot is then typically developed by x-ray or similar autoradiography methods. Applications After developing the blot using xray or autoradiography, the results can be analyzed and interpreted to determine the approximate size and concentration of the RNA binding protein(s) of interest to further study the protein(s). The location and concentration of the RNA binding protein on the blot can affect the results, and bands can sometimes appear after development. These bands can help researchers determine the size and concentration of the RNA binding protein of interest. When the approximate size of the protein is known, the original sample can be run on a chromatography machine to separate it by size. In addition, once the protein is isolated, it can be digested with trypsin, and Mass Spectrometry can be utilized to sequence the peptides in order to determine the identity of the specific protein. Advantages and disadvantages Advantages of northwestern blotting include the expedited detection of specific proteins that bind RNA, as well as the assessment of the approximate molecular weights of those proteins. The northwestern blot allows for detection of identified proteins in a way that is inexpensive. The blot is typically a first step in research, as it allows for the identification of the approximate molecular weights, once the molecular weight is known it allows for further research or purification through other methods like chromatography. Another advantage of the northwestern blot is that it aides in the building of expression libraries of cognate ligands. A noted disadvantage is that some RNA-Protein interactions with poor RNA binding properties may not be as detectable with this technique. Also the procedure for blotting can take from 3 to 5 hours. If the procedure is not done correctly it can result in significant background which can result in an unclear blot of the proteins identified. In addition, proteins need to renature after being separated and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. One last disadvantage is that proteins must consist of a single polypeptide or two subunits that comigrate in the gel matrix.

The municipality existed from 1885 until 1964. It was located in the southwestern part of the mainland portion of the present-day Alver Municipality in Vestland county. It originally included area on the island of Holsn√∏y as well, but that was later separated. Alversund covered upon its dissolution in 1964. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Alversund, where Alversund Church is located. Name The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Alver farm () since the first Alversund Church was built there. The meaning of the farm name is \\"all weather\\" (meaning \\"weather from all directions\\" - describing a farm with an exposed and unsheltered site). The last element is sund which means \\"sound\\" or \\"strait\\", referring to the nearby Alverstraumen strait. History View of the main church for the municipality, Alversund Church The municipality of Alversund was established on 1 January 1885 when the old municipality of Hammer was divided into two separate municipalities. The northwestern part of the old Hammer municipality became Alversund, and it also included the annex of Seim which had been a part of the municipality of Hosanger before that time. The initial population of Alversund was 2,793. On 1 January 1904, a small area near Hanevik on the island of Ask√∏y (population: 32) was transferred from the municipality of Ask√∏y to Alversund. On 15 October 1923, the western district of Alversund (population: 1716) was separated to form the new municipality of Meland. This left Alversund with 1,771 residents. On 1 January 1964, all of Alversund was merged with parts of the municipalities of Modalen, Hosanger, Hamre, S√¶b√∏, and Lind√•s to form a new, larger municipality of Lind√•s. At its dissolution, Alversund had 2,099 residents. =Municipal council= The municipal council of Alversund was made up of 17 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

She is known for inventing the CAVE automatic virtual environment. She previously worked at Iowa State University (ISU), University of Louisiana at Lafayette (UL Lafayette), University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UA Little Rock), and she is currently an Agere Chair Professor at University of Central Florida (UCF). Education Cruz-Neira graduated cum laude with a degree in systems engineering from the Universidad Metropolitana in Caracas, Venezuela in 1987. She earned a master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of Illinois, Chicago in 1991, and her PhD in 1995, working under computer graphics researcher Thomas DeFanti.  Work  = Cave automatic virtual environment = The first CAVE was invented by Carolina Cruz-Neira, Daniel J. Sandin, and Thomas A. DeFanti in 1992. For her PhD dissertation, Cruz-Neira designed and developed the CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment, its specifications, and implementation. She also designed and implemented the CAVELib software API, now a commercial product. She was the architect of the Open Source API VR Juggler, an open source virtual reality applications development framework. The CAVE is an immersive system that became the standard for rear projection-based Virtual Reality systems. The normal full system consists of projections screens along the front, side and floor axes, and a tracking system for the \\"user\\". Although they used the recursive acronym Cave Automatic Virtual Environment for the CAVE system, the name also refers to Plato's \\"Republic\\" and \\"The Allegory of the Cave\\" where he explored the concepts of reality and human perception. There have been a couple offshoots of the CAVE technology, including ImmersaDesk, Infinity Wall and Oblong Industries' G-speak system. The ImmersaDesk is a semi-immersive system, resembling a drafting table, while the Infinity Wall is designed to cater to an entire room of people, such as a conference room. Extending this concept, G-speak supports gestural input from multiple-users and multiple- devices on and expandable array of monitors. = Academia = alt=Carolina Cruz-Neira on how virtual reality will shape the world of tomorrow Cruz-Neira was the Stanley Chair professor in Interdisciplinary Engineering, and a co- founder of the Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC) at Iowa State University (ISU).

He was a founding member of the Vienna Secession and the director of the Applied Arts School in Vienna (now the University of Applied Arts Vienna), and was instrumental in the creation of the Wiener Werkst√§tte.  Life  Illustration from Jules Verne's short story Aventures de la famille Raton (1891) Myrbach's father was Franz Myrbach (1818‚Äì1882), the Administrator of Bukovina in 1865‚Äì70. His older brother Franz Xaver (1850‚Äì1919) was an economist and professor at the University of Innsbruck. He attended the Theresian Military Academy in 1868‚Äì71, graduating as a Leutnant, then at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna under August Eisenmenger. In 1875, he joined the 19th Feldj√§ger Battalion, and in 1877 became an Oberleutnant in the Military Geographic Institute, then, after campaigning in Bosnia in 1878, he taught drawing at the Infantry Cadet School in Vienna. He continued his artistic studies under C R Huber. In 1881, he went on military leave and moved to Paris, retiring totally from the military in 1884 as a Hauptmann, 2nd Class. He stayed in Paris until 1897, working as an illustrator, including illustrating the works of Alphonse Daudet, Victor Hugo and Jules Verne. Marching regiment Myrbach was a founding member of the Vienna Secession in 1897. In the same year, he became the a professor of the Applied Arts School at the Museum of Art and Industry; Arthur von Scala, another reformer Modernist, was made head of the Museum. In 1889, Myrbach became the director of the school. He brought an enthusiastic Modernist attitude and encouraged an integration between art, design and production. He added Koloman Moser and Josef Hoffmann to the staff, amongst other Secession artists. This would lead to the foundation of the Wiener Werkst√§tte in 1903. Myrbach leant more towards an aesthetic approach than von Scala, but both worked together to bring about their combined vision of successful, popular Austrian applied art. Myrbach was a voice for reform towards Modernist ideals in the School, which was started 1899 with the support of Alfred Roller, and completed by 1901. The reform of the school has been described as his \\"lasting merit\\". In his teaching capacity at the School, Myrbach taught Alfred Gerstenbrand, Hans Strohoffer, Wilhelm Schmidt, Walter Dittrich, Karl Thiemann and Walter Klemm; he also ran schools for women, including Stephanie Glax and Sophie Korner. Orientalist ideas like Japanese ise-katagami stencils were included in the curriculum. He was a pioneer of lithography in Vienna and taught it at the School, to Hermine Ostersetz among others. Cossacks, from Life of Napoleon Bonaparte (1906) Myrbach was elected to the Secession's committee in 1899, contributed mosaics for the 1902 Beethoven Exhibition, and served as the Secession's president in 1903. He was close to Gustav Klimt, and was part of the 'Klimt Group' that left the Secession in 1905. Ludwig Hevesi called Myrbach \\"probably the best [illustrator] in Vienna\\", partially for his work (with Moser) in the Secession magazine Ver Sacrum. Myrbach visited America on a state-funded study trip in 1904, part of which was to represent the Applied Arts School at the 1904 World's Fair in St Louis; from California, he submitted his resignation to the school due to ill health. He moved abroad in 1905, first returning to Paris and providing illustrations for Hachette, and then from 1914 living in Spain, mainly in Barcelona but also spent time in Bilbao. He returned to Austria in 1936. Myrbach created many scenes of military life, as well as bucolic pictures of farmers, horses and forests; as well, his work showed touches of Orientalism. Until 1898, he employed algraphy in his work; he painted in oil, watercolour and tempera.

Among other activities, the center organizes dozens of yearly events for journalists, scholars and the public, many of which take place at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum. Courses taught by Shorenstein Center professors are also an integral part of the Harvard Kennedy School's curriculum. Since its founding in 1986, the center has also emerged as a source for research on US campaigns, elections and journalism. The center hosts visiting fellows each semester, who produce research on a broad range of topics. Papers have included \\"Riptide: What Really Happened to the News Business,\\" by John Huey, Martin Nisenholtz and Paul Sagan; \\"Did Twitter Kill the Boys on the Bus?\\" by Peter Hamby of CNN and Snapchat; and \\"Digital Fuel of the 21st Century,\\" by Vivek Kundra, who was the first chief information officer of the United States from March 2009 to August 2011 under President Barack Obama. In 2016, the center produced a series of four reports analyzing media coverage of the 2016 US presidential election, authored by Thomas E. Patterson, Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press. The Shorenstein Center also awards the annual Goldsmith Awards Program, which includes the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting and the Goldsmith Book Prize. Past winners have included James Risen and Eric Lichtblau of The New York Times; Patricia Callahan, Sam Roe and Michael Hawthorne of the Chicago Tribune; and Debbie Cenziper and Sarah Cohen of The Washington Post. Other prizes and lectures given by the Shorenstein Center include the David Nyhan Prize for Political Journalism, the T.H. White Lecture on Press and Politics and the Richard S. Salant Lecture on Freedom of the Press. History The John F. Kennedy School of Government has always recognized that engagement with the media should be part of the school's focus, and initially this role was fulfilled by the Harvard Institute of Politics (IOP). In 1974 Jonathan Moore became the institute's director, and under him the IOP sponsored conferences and invited journalists to Harvard as fellows. In 1980 Moore drafted a proposal for a Harvard center on the press, politics and public policy. Kennedy School dean Graham Allison and Harvard president Derek Bok supported the concept, and an advisory board and committee were formed. Those consulted included political scientist Richard Neustadt; attorney and educator David Riesman; journalists James C. Thomson Jr., David S. Broder, J. Anthony Lukas and Dan Rather; newspaper executives Otis Chandler, Katharine Graham and William O. Taylor II; researcher Stephen H. Hess; Foreign Affairs editor James F. Hoge, Jr.; and television executive Frank Stanton . An endowment fund was created by the IOP, and other donations came from the Boston Globe, Cox Enterprises, Walter Cronkite and General Electric. In all, these efforts raised $5 million for professorships, programs and fellowships. In March 1985, Joan Shorenstein, a producer of the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather, died of cancer at age 38. Her parents, Walter H. and Phyllis J. Shorenstein, were interested in creating an initiative that would honor their daughter's passion for journalism and politics, and spoke with Edward M. Kennedy, Allison, Bok and Moore. The Shorensteins' gave an initial gift of $5 million, and the Joan Shorenstein Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy officially opened in September 1986. At the ceremony an address was given by Benjamin C. Bradlee, with remarks by Senator Kennedy, Walter H. Shorenstein and others. Two years after the Shorenstein Center's founding, veteran journalist Marvin Kalb became its director. He worked to raise the center's profile, and under his leadership the Theodore H. White Lecture on Press and Politics was established, followed by the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting. Kalb directed the center until 1999, and during that time formalized its fellowship program; developed the introductory course on press, politics and public policy; and expanded the Kennedy School's curriculum. On July 1, 2000, Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning journalist Alex S. Jones was named director of the Shorenstein Center. Since taking over, he has enhanced the fellowship program, launched initiatives to increase student engagement and broadened the advisory board. The Shorenstein Center is one of the most active programs at the Harvard Kennedy School, and has hosted more than a thousand speakers since 1986. It is currently run by Nancy Gibbs, former editor in chief of Time and former editorial director of the Time Inc. News Group. Shorenstein Center Fellows The Shorenstein Center traditionally hosts 5-6 fellows per semester. These fellows are well- established practitioners in media, politics and public policy. They serve as mentors to students and hold study groups to share their experiences with the Harvard Kennedy School community more broadly. Each fellow produces a final research paper that contributes to ideas and innovation in their respective areas of expertise. The fall 2017 fellows are Donna Brazile, Tyler Bridges, Claes H. de Vreese, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Tom Wheeler and Wael Ghonim. Past fellows have included Bob Schieffer, Richard Stengel and Judy Woodruff. Combating Fake News In September 2017, First Draft News, a non-profit that works on solutions to challenges with trust & truth in news, set up a home base at the Shorenstein Center. The network includes more than 100 organizations that help newsrooms & tech companies verify news. This announcement is part of the Shorenstein Center's broader work and research in the area of combatting fake news. In February 2017, the Shorenstein Center hosted a conference on fake news, bringing together academics and practitioners to discuss solutions to the problem. The conference was co- sponsored by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, as well as Northeastern University. Journalist's Resource Journalist‚Äôs Resource is a free reference web page based at the Shorenstein Center. It makes leading media research and insights on topical news items available to journalists, bloggers, students and professors. Peer-reviewed research is central to its mandate and day to day offerings. The resource has been recognized by the American Library Association for the quality of work made available on the site. Internship Program In the summer of 2017, the Shorenstein Center sponsored 10 interns, placing them in premiere media & tech companies. The interns were placed in New York, Washington, DC, San Francisco, and Texas. Relationship with the Media Professional Interest Council The Media Professional Interest Council is the graduate student arm of the Shorenstein Center. Founded in 2016 by Matthew Spector, Neil Thomas and Howard Cohen, the council's mission is to create opportunities for Harvard graduate students interested in media, politics and public policy. The Council sets up media networking & mentorship opportunities for students, supports the Shorenstein Center's recruitment efforts for research & jobs, and helps the Shorenstein Center engage students. The council also helps the Shorenstein Center with several aspects of the Goldsmith Awards and coordinates small seminars with the Shorenstein Fellows and high profile guest speakers. The Media Professional Interest Council works closely with the Director of the Shorenstein Center.

Gameplay Boom Beach gameplay Boom Beach is a strategy game that combines attacks on and from other players with attacks against computer-generated (NPC) bases. The game's storyline is set in a tropical archipelago with the player on an island with defenses and troops (similar to Supercell's Clash of Clans game). Boom Beach combines single-player campaign play as well as the ability to attack other players in multiplayer mode on the same world map. Featuring an expansive world map that expands as the player progresses, the game pits the player against an enemy known as \\"The Blackguard\\", a military force who is invading the archipelago and enslaving the locals for the valuable Power Stones found throughout the archipelago (which can also be used by the player to build buff-providing statues). Computer-generated Blackguard bases often appear on the map, and the player can destroy them for resources. Other notable features on the map include resource bases, which improve resource generation when seized and can be contested by multiple players, as well as dive spots where the player can send a submarine to search for treasure provided they have built it. The Blackguard is often represented by Lt. Hammerman, a commander who runs several highly fortified headquarters which serve as primary objectives, in addition to occasionally launching attacks on the player's base once they pass a certain level. He also attacks you after unlock a level 15 headquarters and the prototype lab he will attack you for coins and you must defend. Other computer-generated enemies are Dr. T and Colonel Gearheart, Blackguard members who run specialized bases that occasionally appear as events. Other players appear on the world map as Blackguard mercenaries, allowing players to attack their bases and vice versa. Player bases often offer more rewards for defeating them than CPU bases. In combat against an enemy base, the player commands a gunboat that starts off with a starting amount of \\"energy\\" (which can be improved through upgrades), along with landing crafts which house their troops. Troops can only be deployed on the island's beaches, where they will automatically seek out and attack nearby targets. By spending their gunboat's energy (which is replenished by destroying enemy buildings), the player can provide troops with support such as flares to direct their movement or artillery bombardments to cripple defenses - although the player's troops are susceptible to friendly fire. The objective of an attack is to destroy the enemy's headquarters, as that takes the whole base with it and results in an instant victory, granting the player all of the available resources. Inversely, no matter how much destruction has been caused, failing to destroy the target's headquarters results in a loss, with no resources gained. There are four primary resources (Gold, Wood, Stone, Iron) which are unlocked as the player progresses, with Diamonds being the premium currency. Gold is used to train troops, purchase upgrades for troops and gunboat abilities, and launch attacks, while the other three are used to construct and upgrade buildings. Buildings include resource generators and storage, defensive measures to defeat attackers, or supportive buildings that provide a myriad of other functions. By upgrading their headquarters, players can unlock more options for their base, more troops, and higher upgrade levels. Diamonds can be used to speed up troop training and building upgrade time. Boom Beach main base Whenever a player upgraded his/her Headquarter to level 15, Weapon Lab will be opened for them but building it requires a large amount of resources. Weapon Lab is a building that offers many choices of powerful temporary defenses and reset once a week. There are 4 main parts players have to look are: Complex Gear, Critical Fuse, Power Rod, Field Capacitor. Players can find these in Blackguard's bases, Warship's chests or just simply a chest from Trader. Till now there are 10 prototype weapons for you. Also, the longevity of prototype weapons depends on their grade: I(5 days); II(7 days); III(9 days). Apart from the main aspect of the game, there is also a cooperative form where players can form groups called Task Forces. Task Forces can gather \\"Intel\\" (by destroying troops in defenses, winning attacks, or through special rewards) which is then used to attack computer generated \\"Power Bases\\" in various Task Force Operations. These \\"Power Bases\\" are often extraordinarily well fortified and possess incredible amounts of defensive firepower, requiring careful teamwork and coordination to destroy. After an Operation has ended, all players in the Task Force will be rewarded based on how many points the Task Force got as a whole, with every building destroyed in a Power Base accounting for one point, which is called a Force Point. Even if a player did not participate in the Operation, he would still receive the same amount of resource as the other players. The amount of resource each player received also depends on the number of players in the Task Force. For example, a 5-man Task Force with 500 points will have more reward each than a 50-man Task Force with the same number of points. Warships, a secondary PvP gamemode with season and league progression, is unlocked after the player upgrades to Headquarters Level 10. In this mode, players try to destroy as many of the opponent's Engine Rooms as possible. Whoever has more Engine Room(s) left wins. If the number of Engine Room(s) left is equal, the percentage of destruction will be compared. Whoever destroyed more percentage of the opponent's base wins. If the destruction percentage is still equal, then the amount of time left will be compared. Whoever has more time left wins. If the amounts of time left are equal, then the battle is a draw. If you win, you will earn a number of Stars, depending on the rank you're in. If you lose, you will lose a number of Stars, also depending on the rank you are in. To climb up ranks, the player needs to earn more star for each tier (Wood + Stone tier 40 stars, Iron tier 60 stars, Gold tier 80 stars, Diamond tier 100 stars, Legendary tier 120 stars). Reception The iOS version of Boom Beach was released to \\"mixed\\" reviews, according to the review aggregator site Metacritic. In a review by Stephen Haberman (IGN) he noted that it seemed like a modern version of Clash of Clans, another video game by Supercell.

Founded in 1981 by socialite Irma Lazarus and Phyllis Weston, Enjoy the Arts aimed to connect young audiences with Cincinnati's arts, culture and entertainment. In 2017, Enjoy the Arts merged with ArtsWave, Greater Cincinnati's local arts agency and the nation's first and largest community campaign for the arts. About The original organization made its mark as Young Friends of the Arts in the 1960s. Inspired to introduce the University of Cincinnati's College Conservatory of Music students to the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra with Phyllis Weston and Irma Lazarus as co-founders of the organization. The two pioneering women sought to foster the next generation of arts patrons with membership costs at just a few dollars. During the 1970s and 80s, Young Friends of the Arts became known as Enjoy the Arts (ETA), and steadily grew from offering discounted symphony tickets to University of Cincinnati college students to offering multiple discounts at more and more organizations to any student in Greater Cincinnati. By 1985, Enjoy the Arts offered $10 tickets to 30 different arts organizations to any student in the Greater Cincinnati area for a $25 membership fee. This grew Irma Lazarus' legacy of encouraging young people to appreciate and attend the arts. Irma knew that there were enough \\"blue hairs\\" (in her words) in the audiences. She wanted to see more young people attending all kinds of arts events. In 1991, Enjoy the Arts grew to three full-time staff members and during this time, the program blossomed. Executive Director Lisa J. Mullins and Assistant Director Joelle Daniel, along with Membership Outreach Coordinator Laura Foy, worked together to take the organization from a fledgling, best-kept secret to a program that was city-wide and flourishing. During this time, Enjoy the Arts gathered young professionals to find out what they would like in a membership. ETA used their input to create the START program (Sample The ARTs). START was a companion membership program to Enjoy the Arts, cost $35 and offered half- price tickets to the same 30 arts organizations offering discounts to Enjoy the Arts' student members. Arts organizations in Greater Cincinnati were looking for ways to engage YPs in their programs and this was the perfect opportunity for Enjoy the Arts to capitalize on that need. The organization became known as Enjoy the Arts/START. In 1992, the staff of ETA/START started creating countless social opportunities for members to get together - happy hours before performances, backstage tours, behind-the-scenes peeks at museums, and much more. Simply offering discounts to arts events was not enough to encourage young people, unfamiliar with arts in general, to attend. One program that really took off was Art for Dummies, a monthly arts education event. Each event was unique and offered ETA/START members the chance to dive deeper into the arts than they ever had before. Accountants got ballet lessons from Cincinnati Ballet, students got backstage peeks at set design from the Playhouse, and much more. Former members of Young Friends of the Arts wanted to reinstate their beloved organization for the modern age with Young Friends of the Arts members who had aged-out of the previous program. Enjoy the Arts was founded in 1981 to make Cincinnati's arts programs more accessible to even more audiences. Members would receive an actual coupon book that granted VIP access and two free tickets to every participating arts event in the city, as well as exclusive invites to parties and happy hours on top of year-long ticket price reduction. Various price, age, and voucher structures were implemented and tested from 1981 to 2016. At one point, Enjoy the Arts offered two memberships: \\"Orange\\" for members under 35 and young professionals and \\"Noir\\" for people of all ages. Other structures included membership costs at $50 USD for a year-long membership with a discounted student rate of $35 USD. Participating arts organizations included the Cincinnati Opera, Cincinnati Ballet, Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra & Pops, and Playhouse in the Park among others. In April 2013, under manager Jennifer Foster, Enjoy the Arts partnered with Gaslight web developers, located in Blue Ash, Ohio, and Cincinnati branding agency We Have Become Vikings to modernize the organization even further. Enjoy the Arts underwent a brand repositioning and a website re- launch that features \\"an energetic new image that combines the nonprofit‚Äôs roots with attitude.\\" For example, the organization's current brand mascot is William Shakespeare \\"with his face painted √† la Kiss.\\" The mantra in the new look is that \\"everything needs to be fun.\\" Additionally, the site became more in tune with smart phone technology. Rather than providing coupon booklets, Enjoy the Arts posted hundreds of free tickets on their website for members to claim on a first-come, first-served basis, similar to deal of the day websites like Groupon and Living Social, and members can go back to organizations for half-price all year long. An unveiling party was held at the American Sign Museum. In addition to providing access to Cincinnati's premier arts organizations, Enjoy the Arts also hosted its own parties and events. Enjoy the Arts was previously in residence at the Cincinnati Museum Center and was a subsidiary of the museum. In addition, the non-profit was largely supported by the Carol Ann and Ralph V. Haile, Jr./U.S. Bank Foundation, ArtsWave and Joseph-Beth Booksellers. In December 2016, Enjoy the Arts, the Cincinnati Museum Center, and ArtsWave announced a merger between Enjoy the Arts and ArtsWave. As of January 2017 the two programs were completely merged. Sarah Ditlinger, managed the dissolution of Enjoy the Arts and merge into ArtsWave's ArtsPass program, and has since expanded the range of deals and participating businesses and arts offered to current ArtsWave donors and Enjoy the Arts members, young professional perks, and free ticket opportunities and VIP experiences. A change for Enjoy the Arts members, their new ArtsPass purchase price goes to support 100 arts organizations as part of the ArtsWave Community Campaign.

They are tall and have a foundation. A single tower cast light from six carbon arc lamps, illuminating a circle brightly enough to read a watch. In 1970 the towers were recognized as Texas State Landmarks, followed by the 15 remaining towers being listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 12, 1976. Only 6 are in their original locations as established by the Board of Public Works and City Council in 1895. History In 1894, the City of Austin purchased 31 used towers from Detroit. They were manufactured in Indiana by Fort Wayne Electric Company and assembled onsite.Texas Historical Commission Atlas Some have claimed that Austin put up moonlight towers partially in response to the actions of the Servant Girl Annihilator, but in fact the towers were not erected until 1894 and 1895, ten years after the murders took place. When first erected, the towers were connected to electric generators at the Austin Dam, completed in 1893 on the site of present-day Tom Miller Dam. In the 1920s their original carbon-arc lamps, which were exceedingly bright but time-consuming to maintain, were replaced by incandescent lamps, which gave way in turn to mercury vapor lamps in the 1930s. The mercury vapor lamps were controlled by a switch at each tower's base. During World War II, a central switch was installed, allowing citywide blackouts in case of air raids. In 1993 the city of Austin dismantled the towers and restored every bolt, turnbuckle and guy-wire as part of a $1.3 million project, the completion of which was celebrated in 1995 with a citywide festival. The City of Austin has ordinances in place to protect the towers from demolition. However, since 2004 the towers at 4th and Nueces, at 1st and Trinity, and at West 22nd St. and Nueces have all been removed to clear the way for new construction. It is unclear whether they will be dismantled or erected elsewhere.

Youth and young adults have the opportunity to come and be a part of the outdoor ministry that Luther Point offers year-round, along with approximately 45 summer staff, 5-10 full-time year-round staff, and many volunteers. Luther Point sits on a peninsula surrounded on three sides by the water of Wood Lake as well as meadows and woods on land.  History  Luther Point Bible Camp was born in the 1930s, by the shared vision of two men, Arvid Larson and Ed Dahlberg. Over the course of ten years they gathered support, land, and a concrete identity, and in 1946 the camp was officially christened under the Lutheran Bible Camp Association. By 1947, the first cabins had been built. The first campers attended Luther Point the summer of 1949, and over the course of the next several years, the dining hall, chapel, and staff accommodation facility were built. The staff accommodation building was later transformed into a retreat center for year-round retreats. They have continued to build more facilities for campers, staff, and retreaters to use during the summer camp season and the off season. In 1970, the directors began hiring paid staff to work for the summer, instead of calling volunteer counselors. The camp has seen a total of 5 directors thus far, the most recent being Rev. Craig Corbin, who resigned in 2013.  Programs  During the summer there are week-long camps for Elementary and Junior High students, as well as service opportunities for high school students- the B.U.D.D.I.E.S. program allows high schoolers to come to camp for free for two weeks and act as \\"counselors in training\\". There are weeks of Horse Camp, Guitar Camp, Fine Arts Camp, Drama Camp, Kayak and Canoe Trips, Grandparent/Grandchild Camp, and Luther Point even sends staff to area churches to run Vacation Bible School (VBS) programs on site. During the \\"off season\\", there are many retreat opportunities as well. Staff will host weekend camps for Elementary, Junior High, and High Schoolers, as well as some church run retreats. LPBC also plans some weekends around the holidays for cookie baking and quilting groups.

He is a Member of Parliament (MP), since 2014, representing Baghpat constituency, Uttar Pradesh in the 17th Lok Sabha and then retaining his seat in 2019 elections. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party. He formerly served as the Police Commissioner of Mumbai. Early life and education Singh was born on November 29, 1955 to Mr. Ramkishan and Mrs. Hukmwati, in Basauli in Baghpat district of Uttar Pradesh. He is a post- graduate in chemistry from Digambar Jain College, Baraut and has also done M Phil in Chemistry from Delhi University. He has secured an MBA from Australia and also has a MA in Public Administration and Ph.D. in Naxalism from Nagpur University. Before joining the I.P.S, Singh wanted to become a scientist. Police career Satya Pal Singh is a retired IPS officer of Maharashtra cadre and 1980 batch. Mr. Singh's first posting was as Assistant Superintendent of Police of Nasik. He then went on to become the Superintendent of Police of Buldhana. Prior to being appointed the Mumbai Police chief, Mr Singh was Maharashtra's Additional Director General of Police. He has also served as the Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) in Mumbai. During his tenure as the Crime Chief of Mumbai, he is credited for breaking the backbone of the organised crime syndicates that terrorised Mumbai in the 1990s, including the Chhota Rajan, Chhota Shakeel and Arun Gawli gangs. During the same time in the late '90s, when gangland activity was at its peak in Mumbai and the mafia in Mumbai went berserk with several high-profile killings, Singh formed special police squads and cracked down on several underworld figures. That tenure saw several encounter killings in Mumbai with specialists such as Daya Nayak, Pradeep Sharma and Vijay Salaskar given the licence to take on the underworld. It was during this stint that the 25 August 2003 Mumbai bombings at Gateway of India and Zaveri Bazaar took place; he is credited with having been the officer at the helm when the case was detected. As Police Commissioner of Nagpur, he began an outreach programme called Mission Mrityunjay. This was an anti terror initiative that aimed to enlist college students in the fight against terrorism whereby students recommended by college authorities assisted the police in intelligence gathering and reported suspicious and anti-social activities on campus and in the city. Apart from fighting terrorism, the police hoped that these Mrityunjay Clubs would help develop communal and social harmony among the youth and improve their relationship with the police. During his stint 386 such clubs were formed in the city. Identical programmes were launched in Pune as well as Mumbai during his tenure as the Police Chief of the respective cities. In Pune, the city police had reached out to 122 senior colleges and 86 junior colleges through Mission Mrityunjay. However, this programme met with some rough weather during its trial in Mumbai as its legitimacy and choice of name was questioned by the State Minorities Commission. As Nagpur police chief, Singh had also busted the 'matka' gangs there, unearthing a local politician's links to the high-profile racket. His tenure as Pune Police Commissioner was witness to the 2010 Pune bombing which occurred at the German Bakery that killed 17 people and injured at least 60 more. During this stint he famously courted controversy by taking on his own boss, the then Maharashtra Home minister Ramesh Bagwe, when he refused clearance to renew Bagwe's passport since the minister had no less than 19 cases pending against him, some allegedly criminal. When Singh refused to buckle under political pressure, he was shunted out to the Establishment Wing of Maharashtra Police. In June 2011, weeks after being appointed chairman of a special investigation team constituted by the Gujarat High Court to probe the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, Singh was replaced after requesting the court to relieve him after he cited differences of opinion between two other SIT members. Singh said there was difference of opinion between the other two members of the SIT, Mohan Jha and Satish Verma, and said it would be difficult to rely on them for investigations. On 23 August 2012, Singh was appointed as the Police Commissioner of Mumbai after his predecessor Arup Patnaik was facing flak and eventually shunted out for his handling of the Azad Maidan riots that occurred on August 11 in the city. Several policemen were injured in that melee. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, during a massive rally in Mumbai, had demanded immediate ouster of Patnaik over the violence at Azad Maidan, for allegedly failing to control the situation during a demonstration to protest alleged persecution of Muslims in Assam and Myanmar. Patnaik was also in line of fire by the Opposition for handling of the Azad Maidan mayhem. On 31 January 2014 Singh tendered his resignation and applied for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and sought to be relieved as soon as possible from his post so he could contest the upcoming national elections. Home Minister RR Patil, who belonged to the Nationalist Congress Party, announced that Dr Singh's application was accepted with immediate effect. The Democratic Front government in Maharashtra was in a hurry to process the VRS application for voluntary retirement mainly to facilitate his joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and to possibly enable him to attend a rally in Meerut and join the party in the presence of Gujarat CM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Rajnath Singh. Singh was the first serving Police Commissioner of Mumbai to resign from his post. In an interview to the Economic Times on 1 February 2014, Singh stated his reason for quitting, > \\"My inner voice is telling me that it's time to change profession. As a > police officer, I have worked for the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra for > many years, but now it's time to work for the entire country with a renewed > energy.\\" He has also been on deputation to the CBI. =Positions held= * Superintendent of Police, Gadchiroli district * Superintendent of Police, Nasik district * Superintendent of Police, Buldhana district * Inspector General of Police, Nagpur Range * Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), Mumbai * Special Inspector General, Konkan Range * Police Commissioner, Nagpur * Police Commissioner, Pune * Additional Director General of Police (ADGP Establishment and Law & Order), Maharashtra * Police Commissioner, Mumbai Political career Singh joined the BJP at a rally organised in Meerut on 2 February 2014 in the presence BJP's PM candidate Narendra Modi, party chief Rajnath Singh and UP in-charge Amit Shah. He was pitted against Civil Aviation Minister and Rashtriya Lok Dal supremo Ajit Singh from Baghpat (Lok Sabha constituency) where he won with a thumping margin of 2,09,866 votes, defeating Samajwadi Party's Ghulam Mohammed and pushing Ajit Singh to the third spot with only 1,99,516 votes. The Baghpat Lok Sabha constituency seat was the first to be declared in favour of the BJP led NDA on the day of the results. Ajit Singh, the 75 year old Jat leader suffered a massive defeat as he had never lost an election from Baghpat since 1999. In fact he had been representing Baghpat in the Lok Sabha since 1989, only losing to Sompal Shastri in the 1998 elections before being voted back in the 1999 elections. Prior to him, his father Chaudhary Charan Singh, the former Prime Minister of India represented Baghpat in the Lok Sabha from 1977 till his death. Singh's election campaign was uniquely supported by national and international-level shooters from the constituency which claims to have produced the highest number of national-level shooters in the country in the last 15 years thanks to a shooting club in Johri village, which Singh was instrumental in setting up in 1998. A patron of the club, Singh would often donate a month's salary to organise an annual tournament in the hope that drawing the youth to sports would prevent them from going astray and help in their job prospects as well. The club claims to have given over 400 shooters to the country. At least 80 of them have got jobs in the Army, ITBP, CISF, Punjab Police, IAF and Railways. PM candidate Narendra Modi and bollywood actor Sunny Deol also campaigned for him. On the day of the voting, Singh was attacked and manhandled by unidentified men at a polling station in Malakpur near Baraut where he had gone to check allegations of bogus voting. In the Parliament, Singh has been vocal about farmers issues, advocating the need to involve the farming community actively in drafting of the Union Budget. He has also been raising the problems faced by sugarcane farmers in western UP who are debt ridden in the face of non repayment of their heightening dues by sugar mills. He has actively been campaigning for Government regulation of sugar prices. Speaking about the need of greater involvement of farmers in the decision making process at a seminar organised by the Council for Social Development, he said, > \\"About 65 per cent of our population is still dependent on agriculture. > Agrarian community is most distressed and neglected even today. We are never > bothered about them. Farmers are never consulted before drafting the budget. > There has been no farmers' representation either in Planning Commission or > in Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) so far. Without > involvement and participation of farmers, we have been designing policies > for farmers. The policies are all bureaucratic driven. The existing > policies, so far, have not been able to improve farm income and encourage > youth to take it up as a profession.\\" On 2 June 2014, a prostitution racket was busted by Mumbai police being run from a flat owned by Satyapal Singh but leased out to a well known business house. He said it was leased out to a real estate firm Indiabulls for last 33 months and stated his plans to sue them for maligning his image on 7 August 2014, Singh was named as a member of a special expert committee to review security of the Parliament House complex which was targeted by terrorists in 2001. The committee constituted by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan had former Union Home Secretary R. K. Singh as its head and also included former Rajasthan DGP Harish Meena besides Singh. On 29 November 2014, under the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, he adopted Palri village in his constituency Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh. On 11 December 2014, he was appointed as the Vice President of the Bharatiya Janata Party's Uttar Pradesh (UP) Working Committee. On 4 September 2017 he was appointed as minister of state in HRD ministry under Modi government. Controversy On 19 January 2018, Satya Pal Singh publicly defied Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution and he claimed that \\"Darwin's theory is scientifically wrong. ... Nobody, including our ancestors, in written or oral, have said they saw an ape turning into a man\\". He insisted that Darwin was wrong about evolution and the idea of evolution should be removed from school and college curriculum. Many scientists later criticized Satya Pal Singh for his unscientific statement.  Personal life  Singh is a vocal proponent of holistic health, yoga and vegetarianism. Deeply passionate about Indian mythology, philosophy and sociology, he is a dedicated Arya Samaji. A scholar of Vedic studies and sanskrit, Singh regularly delivers lectures on spirituality, religious extremism, inter-religious harmony and corruption. Singh has started a campaign targeting college students to break the myths around religion and create awareness about Vedic literature which he believes is the divine order for world peace. He has been quoted as saying that but for his reading of the Satyarth Prakash, his knowledge and ability to discuss thorny issues threadbare would not have been there and perhaps he would not have made it to the high and coveted office that he is occupying today.  Books  Dr. Singh is also the author of two bestselling books: one on tackling the Naxal problem, and the other a self-help book, Talash Insaan Ki (The Search for Man) which deals with \\"mankind‚Äôs continuous quest in search of the truth\\", that has sold over a lakh copies and has been translated into several languages. The Urdu translation of this book was released by bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan along with poet-scriptwriter Javed Akhtar.and the launch was hosted by Minorities Education Foundation in Mumbai He intends to complete three more books. One will be about how to bring lasting religious harmony in society, one on challenges faced by the Indian police. The third, Timeless Time, will deal with several questions that have no answers.

It was a 200-MW LSHS (low sulphur heavy stock) fuel (processed from the residue of indigenous crude) power plant of the GMR Group. The plant was based on two-stroke diesel engine technology from MAN B&W;, Germany. It was the state's first plant commissioned by the private sector. The plant was decommissioned in 2018. History The 196-MW liquid fuel-fired power plant was commissioned in 1998 by the GMR Power Corporation on a 29-acre land leased by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation for 20 years in March 1997. The entire power generated at this plant was supplied to the Tamil Nadu State Electricity Board. It was inaugurated by the then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in March 1999. Initially diesel was used as fuel, and later the plant used low sulphur heavy stock (LSHS). The Tangedco entered into a 15-year power purchase agreement with the plant. When it expired in 2014, it continued to purchase power from the plant till February 2015. After this, the agreement was not renewed. The plant The plant was built on a 29-acre land and had four units of 49 MW each. Conservation To prevent harmful pollutants from escaping into the atmosphere, the plant incorporated reverse osmosis for the final stage of purification. It also had a water conservation plant that processes about 5 percent of Chennai's sewage to produce water that was required to operate the plant, which was said to be the first of its kind in the country. The plant treated 7,200 cubic metres of raw sewage per day from Chennai MetroWater Supply and Sewage Board to produce 5,400 cubic metres of clean water for its own use. Expansion Phase-I of the project consisting of 4 X 50 MW liquid fuel-based (diesel) power plant was in operation since February 1999. In 2010, the plant planned conversion of Phase I project to a gas-based plant, in addition to initiate Phase II, which consisted of additional 120 MV gas-based combined cycle power plant. The expansion plans required additional land requirement of 2.5 acres, which was within the existing premises. Natural gas requirement for expansion was estimated at 0.60 million cubic metre per day at standard conditions, to be obtained from Krishna-Godavari basin. Natural gas required for conversion of existing diesel-based plant was estimated at 1.1 million cubic metre per day at standard conditions. About 3.48 MLD of water required for the expansion will be obtained from treated sewage water within the plant premises. An estimated 4.8 MLD of water will be required for conversion. There was also possibility of switching over the fuel of existing units from heavy oil to pyrolysis oil obtained from bio mass or urban garbage gasification. These power generation units can be put to use for grid reserve service.Commercial Opportunities for Back-Up Generation and Load Reduction via National Grid, the National Electricity Transmission System Operator (NETSO) for England, Scotland, Wales and Offshore. Significance The power plant remained significant as it catered to the requirements of vital civic utilities such as the Madras High Court, the Government Hospital, Secretariat, Central Railway Station, Egmore Children's Hospital and many important residential areas during emergencies. Awards The plant had received ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 certifications from Det Norske Veritas. It had also received the Dr. M. S. Swaminathan Award for Environmental Protection for conserving the environment. Decommissioning In 2018, the plant was decommissioned owing to high cost, with dismantling of the plant beginning in May 2018.

Luciano is credited as an editor on 20 films directed by Aldrich; see Aldrich was a prolific and independent maker of popular films \\"who depicted corruption and evil unflinchingly, and pushed limits on violence throughout his career.\\" Their early collaboration, the film noir Kiss Me Deadly (1955), was entered into the US National Film Registry in 1999; the unusual editing of the film has been noted by several critics. Luciano's work with Aldrich was recognized by four Academy Award nominations, for Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964), The Flight of the Phoenix (1965), The Dirty Dozen (1967), and The Longest Yard (1974). The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences never recognized Aldrich himself. Early career Nothing appears to have been published about Luciano's early career and education. In the era of the Hollywood studio system and the \\"Big Five\\" studios, Luciano's credits are for films produced by smaller companies. His first credit is as the editor of The Luck of Roaring Camp, a 1937 film produced by Monogram Pictures, which was a \\"Poverty Row\\" studio. He edited Gang War (1940), which was produced by Million Dollar Productions. His last credit before the US entry into World War II was apparently for Meet the Chump (1941). Luciano's first postwar credit was for The Return of Rin Tin Tin (1947), which was the 41st feature film that starred the German shepherd dog Rin Tin Tin and his successors.. Also in 1947, Luciano was the assistant to editors Robert Parrish and Francis D. Lyon on the boxing film Body and Soul, which was directed by Robert Rossen. The film won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing. Luciano worked for Parrish again as the \\"montage editor\\" on the 1949 film, Caught, and then co-edited the 1951 documentary Of Men and Music with Parrish and two others. Parrish subsequently moved into directing, and Luciano was the editor for Parrish's 1959 western, The Wonderful Country. The Aldrich collaboration Theatrical release poster for Kiss Me Deadly (1955) Robert Aldrich was an assistant director on Body and Soul, Chase, and Of Men and Music. He asked Luciano to edit the 1954 film World for Ransom, which was the first film he produced and directed. Joseph F. Biroc was the cinematographer, and Frank De Vol composed the music. Luciano, Biroc, and De Vol became Aldrich's \\"informal repertory company\\" for the next two decades. In 1955 Luciano edited Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly, which is an important film noir that is now in the National Film Registry. Luciano edited almost all of Aldrich's films that followed Kiss Me Deadly, including three in the following year. Aldrich enjoyed particular success with the 1962 film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? and its offspring Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964). The latter film won Luciano his first major recognition with a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, which was just one of the seven \\"Oscar\\" nominations for the film. The following year, Luciano's editing of The Flight of the Phoenix was nominated both for the Oscar and for the Eddie Award of the American Cinema Editors. The American Cinema Editors does not provide an archive of Eddie awards, referring instead to the Internet Movie Database. See The film that was Aldrich's greatest commercial success was The Dirty Dozen (1967), which had the fifth largest US ticket sales in 1967. Luciano won the Eddie award for the picture, and was again nominated for the Oscar. The Longest Yard (1974), again directed by Aldrich, garnered Luciano his second Eddie Award and a fourth Oscar nomination.The winner of an Eddie award is selected by a vote of the membership of the American Cinema Editors, whereas Oscars are decided by the voting members of the entire Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, including actors, writers, producers, and practitioners of many of the other film crafts. See The final film of the long Aldrich-Luciano collaboration was Twilight's Last Gleaming (1977). For about 23 years, Luciano had been a member of Aldrich's \\"informal repertory company\\", which also included cinematographer Joseph F. Biroc and composer Frank De Vol.Alain Silver has written that \\"Like many producers and directors, Aldrich preferred working with the same group of people and considered these writers, crew members, and actors as part of his extended family.\\" See Ben Sachs has written of Aldrich's motivations in maintaining a core group of collaborators over more than two decades. He notes that Aldrich admired the studio system, which could keep teams of filmmakers together for decades. Aldrich's career saw the collapse of that system, but \\"Aldrich sought to preserve the team of collaborators ‚Äî which included cinematographer Joseph Biroc, composer Frank De Vol, editor Michael Luciano, and production designer William Glasgow ‚Äî with whom he'd regularly worked since his second feature, World for Ransom (1954). ... In interviews he presented himself as an organizer of creative talents who encouraged his casts and crews to help shape the material at hand.\\" Other works Luciano edited several more features before his retirement around 1982, including Stripes (1981), which was directed by Ivan Reitman. In addition to his editing of feature films with Aldrich and other directors, Luciano was a prolific editor of television programs in the 1950s and 1960s, with credits for episodes of Gunsmoke, Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel, The Donna Reed Show, and other series. In 1956, Luciano edited one episode of Gunsmoke that was directed by Charles Marquis Warren, and over the next two years Luciano edited three feature films directed by Warren.The films were Unknown Terror (1957), Copper Sky (1957), and Blood Arrow (1958); see Luciano was nominated for an Eddie for a 1964 episode of the television program Bewitched. Luciano's last film project was Kidnapped (1987), for which he is credited as a supervising editor and an associate producer. Luciano's legacy Luciano's editing has been noted in several books and articles. In his book, Film Noir, William Luhr notes the editing of Kiss Me Deadly as part of the film's \\"disorienting, even disturbing, formal strategies.\\" J. P. Telotte writes of this film that, \\"one of the pillars of classical narrative, continuity editing, often disappears - or to be more precise, repeatedly fails, as in a later work like Breathless, so that we see the seams in the narrative, the manipulations in our point of view, the mismatched fragments of the story constructed for us.\\" In their 2002 text, Robert Goodman and Patrick McGrath recommend study of Luciano's editing of The Dirty Dozen and of The Longest Yard. In his study of films with sports themes, Randy Williams discusses the influence of The Longest Yard (1974): \\"Aldrich uses split-screen and slow motion techniques to help convey the tension and drama as the game progresses. The real key is the pinpoint timing of Michael Luciano's editing. ... The Longest Yard is still one of the more influential movies in sports cinema.\\" Glenn Erickson has discussed the split-screen editing of Twilight's Last Gleaming, which was Luciano's final film with Aldrich, \\"In this show Aldrich and Luciano make effective use of split screens to show multiple parallel actions simultaneously. Actions that play out in real time seem more immediate, when we see all the information all at once: a pair of commandos set a nuclear device on one side of a steel door, while on the other side General Dell and his fellow gunmen begin to guess that just such a commando sneak attack might be taking place.\\" Ben Sachs notes that the clearly visible editing that characterized Kiss Me Deadly was toned down in later films by Aldrich and Luciano, \\"Intriguingly, Aldrich's style grew more modest as his content grew more provocative. Where his 50s and 60s work teems with hopped-up editing and Wellesian camera angles, his later films are comparatively straightforward. ... The filmmaking privileges content over style, pushing to the foreground the contradictions inherent in the material.\\" Luciano had been selected as a member of the American Cinema Editors.

He belonged to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He was a member of the Panel of Chairpersons of the 16th Lok Sabha, and the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Water Resources.  Life  Singh was previously elected as a Member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly for seven terms (1974‚Äì77,1980‚Äì89,1996-2014). He has also served as a Cabinet Minister in Uttar Pradesh governments under both BJP and the Congress. He died on 3 February 2018 at a private hospital in Noida, Uttar Pradesh after suffering from severe breathing difficulties for a brief period. Education and political career A law graduate from Allahabad University, he cleared PCS (J) exams in 1963. But instead of becoming a judicial officer, he joined the Indian Army as a Commissioned Officer after 1962 Indo-China war. He participated in the 1965 Pakistan war as a Captain, in the Poonch and Rajouri sectors in Kashmir. He then took voluntary retirement and started practising Law in Muzaffarnagar in 1969. He entered active politics in 1974, becoming an MLA for the first time on a Congress ticket. He went on to win Assembly elections seven times and held the post of deputy speaker of the Assembly from 1983 to 1985. He won his fourth term, as a BJP candidate, in 1996 and his first Lok Sabha elections in 2014. Controversies In September 2013, he was named in an FIR related to the Muzaffarnagar Riots because he attended the mahapanchayat which was held despite prohibitory orders. He refuted allegations of inciting communal tensions by saying that he did not make any inflammatory speech and only attempted to calm down the assembled crowd. In June 2016, he released a list of Hindu families and alleged that there had been a mass exodus of Hindus from his constituency due to the law and order situation. His claims were later partially validated by a report of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). However, later even the BJP accepted that the alleged Hindu exodus didn't take place. Another report contradicted the NHRC findings. Parliamentary performance Being the son of a farmer father, he understood and concerned himself with important issues related to farmers, education and infrastructure. He had participated in more debates than the national average and asked significant questions in the Parliament to bring attention towards problems affecting the people of his constituency. Besides being the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Water Resources, he is a Member of the Consultative Committee, Ministry of Home Affairs and also a Member of the General Purposes Committee. Apart from participating in public meetings and Jan Andolans for the cause of social justice, Singh was also very active on social media and in the Parliament.

Games & Political Behavior eJournal. Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 4 June 2019.  History  Carl von Clausewitz was the first to define war as a bargaining interaction. He wrote that war has no value itself, thus no one pursues war without having a larger goal. During the 1950s, the limited conflicts of the Cold War furthered the bargaining theory. Because wars were limited, it was determined that war usually ends with a bargain rather than a total military victory. In the 1960s, Thomas Schelling claimed that most conflicts was a bargaining interaction and defined the end of World War II in bargaining rather than military terms. Formal BMoWs were introduced in the 1980s. The formal models focused on the causes of war as well as the ends, and defined them as bargaining interactions as well.  Description  The bargaining model of war is a means of describing war as a political rather than economic or social action. The bargaining model of war (BMoW) describes war, its causes and consequences, as a bargaining disagreement over the allocation of resources. Bargaining is defined as an interaction where no one actor can benefit without another suffering a loss, which is opposite of cooperative interaction, where all involved actors enjoy a benefit. Because war is defined as a bargaining interaction it is always costly and all actors involved suffer a cost of war, outside of the fighting. Therefore, the model assumes that war is the undesired outcome for both actors, and only under the correct conditions will war occur. This is different than economic or other political models of war which propose that war can have a positive net utility, or provide benefits to the victor that are greater than the losses of the defeated. The model makes several assumptions about war. Ultimately, it defines the cause of wars as a lack of information and a high level of uncertainty between actors, the process of fighting a war as a means to reveal information, and the consequence of war as revealed information, allowing for involved actors to adjust behaviors and motivations. = Structure = The model is linear with two actors, A and B, on the left and right ends of the line, respectively. The line represents a good that A and B are willing to fight over. Point p represents the perceived potential division of the good that will result from a war. Actor A wants p to be as far right as possible, because it receives a greater division of the good, while actor B p to be as far left as possible. Points ca and cb represent the costs of war for A and B respectively. These costs are usually blood and treasure, the financial and manpower losses that result from a war. Points p-ca and p-cb represent the ultimate division of a good for A and B when the costs of war are calculated into the outcome. Both actors are willing to accept any deal that divides the good anywhere between points ca and cb. This is because a point in that range provides a better division than a war. A is willing to accept a point to the left of p because although the division is not in its favor, it is still better than if it were divided based on the costs of war. A is willing to accept a point to the right of p because this is a better division of the good than it predicted. The same reasoning stands for actor B, only in the opposite direction. * A = actor A * B = actor B * p = predicted division of a good as a result of a war * ca = the cost of fighting war for actor A * cb = the cost of fighting war for actor B * p-ca = actor A's division of the good after the costs of war are calculated * p-cb = actor B's division of the good after the costs of war are calculated = Causes of war based on the model = According to James D. Fearon, there are three conditions where war is possible under the bargaining model: # Uncertainty: An actor can overestimate his own abilities or the resolve of his opponent and start a war. This under- or overestimation is common throughout history. Hitler's march on USSR in 1941 was motivated by the correct assumption that the Soviet forces were significantly weaker and worse organized than the German ones. # Commitment Problems: an actor has a difficulty to commit to not use military strength in the future. A first-strike advantage may force an actor to begin a preemptive war, or the threat of being attacked may cause an actor to start a preventive war. # Indivisibility of a good: if actors believe that a certain good could not be divided but only controlled in its entirety they may go to war. = Outcomes of war based on the model = Because the model assumes that war is fought because of and in order to gain information, the consequence of war is the revealing of new information and thus a reformation of an actors' goods and motivations to better suit the new conditions.  Contradictions  There are three sets of ideas that disagree with the bargaining model of war: # Cognitive Psychological: actors do not change their beliefs or behaviors even if new information allows them to do so # Domestic Politics: leaders prefer to fight to solidify their position in domestic politicsA Bargaining Theory of Political Bias and War.

History The parish first started as a log cabin mission church which was served by the Vincentians from Perryville in the 1850s. The first frame church was built under Father William Vincent Moore in 1865. Father Moore, who studied at St. Mary's of the Barrens Seminary, would later serve as priest at St. Rose of Lima Mission church. In the early 1870s, Father Joseph Hellwing, who had just become pastor of St. Mary's at Biehle, also gave services here. The current stone church was constructed under the direction of Father Denis D. Leyden in 1877-79. The stone church was constructed of unique colored stone blocks, and was originally dedicated to the Holy Innocents. The brothers and students at St. Mary's of the barrens donated 30,000 shingles for the roof of the new church. The Silver Lake church was changed to St. Rose of Lima, in 1885-1886, under Father Pommer and Father E. J.

It is one of the oldest statistical associations in the world. Its first president, Juliusz Leo, was Professor of the Jagiellonian University and the President of Cracow. The main aim of PTS in the period before World War I was to prepare a statistical overview of the Polish lands from the most distant past until modern times. The work was published in Cracow in 1915 and was entitled \\"The Statistics of Poland\\". History The activity of PTS was suspended during World War I. In 1917, a similar organisation was established in Warsaw, called the Association of Polish Economists and Statisticians (TEiSP). A Statistics section was created within TEiSP, which was directed by Professor Ludwik Krzywicki. In 1937 the Statistics Section of TEiSP was transformed into a separate organisation, the Polish Statistical Association, with Professor Edward Szturm de Sztrem, the then President of the Central Statistical Office, acting as its President. PTS published its official journal, a quarterly entitled \\"Statistical Review\\". In 1939 PTS had 290 real members and about 30 so-called supporting from various institutions. Following the outbreak of World War II the activity of PTS was suspended until April 1947, when Professor Stefan Szulc became its new President and the publication of \\"Statistical Review\\" was resumed. After 1950 the activity of PTS dwindled, leading to a decision in 1953 to close it down, which was put into effect in 1955. Some members of PTS moved to the Polish Economic Society, where a Statistics section was created. Reactivation The Association was reactivated in April 1981. The General Assembly appointed a Temporary Main Council with Professor Miko≈Çaj Latuch as its President. In the following terms the office of the President was held by Professor Jan Kordos (1985‚Äì1990 and 1990‚Äì1994), dr Kazimierz Kruszka (2005‚Äì2010) and Professor Czes≈Çaw Doma≈Ñski (1994‚Äì2000, 2000‚Äì2005 and again since 2010). In 1987 the Statistical Research & Analysis Bureau (BBiAS) of the Main Council of PTS was established. At present there are three sections within the Polish Statistical Association: the Historical Section, Classification and Data Analysis Section and the Mathematical Statistics Section. From 1985 to 1994 the Association spread developing a network of regional branches with about 800 members in all. 1993 saw the launch of an international journal published by PTS entitled \\"Statistics in Transition\\". In addition, the Polish Statistical Association co-edits with the Central Statistical Office the monthly journal \\"Wiadomo≈õci Statystyczne\\". At present the Polish Statistical Association has about 750 members, organized in 17 regional branches. Since 1994 PTS has been an affiliated member of International Statistical Institute. In 2008 by virtue of a joint decision of the Main Council of PTS, The Committee on Statistics and Econometrics of the Polish Academy of Sciences and the President of the Central Statistical Office, 9 March was declared to be the Day of Polish Statistics. The day commemorates the anniversary of the first Census decreed by the Great Sejm on March 9, 1798. Centenary The celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Polish Statistical Association was inaugurated by a historic event: the Congress of Polish Statistics, which was held in Pozna≈Ñ between 18 and 20 April 2012.

Its main focus is on primary schools. The company was started by seven professional friends and adopted its first schools in Lahore in 2010. Its chief executive officer is Dr. Najeed Khan.  History  Progressive Education Network was founded by a group of seven friends, professionals, businessmen, and educators, who wanted to improve public education in Pakistan as a means of assisting people from the lower end of society. They decided to adopt existing schools rather than building their own, and studied models such as BRAC, Citizens Foundation and CARE. They incorporated the company as a non- profit with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan under Section 42 of the Companies Ordinance 1984; it has been certified by the Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy as adhering to best practices for non-profits. In 2010 the company adopted its first schools, in Lahore, with a total of more than 6,000 students. Initially the founders and their friends funded it themselves; subsequently they developed sponsorship relationships with for-profit companies, including a Good Neighbor Program through which a company sponsors assistance to schools in its locality. They have declared a goal of improving the education of 1 million children throughout Pakistan by 2025. By January 2014, it had expanded to schools totaling almost 11,000 students in a number of locations in Pakistan, including Karachi, Gujrat and Muzaffargarh. , it had adopted 89 schools with almost 23,500 students and had signed an agreement to adopt 50 schools in Punjab.  Methods  Progressive Education Network adopts state schools through a public-private partnership; it is one of several groups using this method to improve education in Pakistan. It works to improve them by improving their infrastructure, for example toilet facilities, drinking water, and classroom furniture, and monitoring teachers, hiring additional teachers to reduce class sizes, and providing teacher training during the summer and winter holidays. The company also provides staff to clean schools twice a day, organizes debate, quiz, and sporting contests, and has provided computers and funded computer classes, but it places its highest priority on hiring more teachers and improving their training.

Most of them were the ethnic Malays and Chinese. Emerging racial riots in Malaysia in 1969 prompted more students from the ethnic Chinese community to seek an education in New Zealand. Following the riots, the Malaysian Government introduced affirmative action policies to help the Bumiputera (mainly the Malays and indigenous people) to achieve a higher economic quality of life than the Chinese.

Aiken was drafted by Major League Baseball's Houston Astros with the first overall pick of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, but did not sign with the team. He enrolled at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida as a postgraduate student. The Indians then selected him 17th overall in the 2015 MLB draft. Amateur career Aiken attended Cathedral Catholic High School in San Diego, California. Aiken pitched for the 18U United States national baseball team in 2013 and helped lead the team to gold in the 2013 18U Baseball World Cup. He started the gold medal game and pitched seven innings with 10 strikeouts and giving up only one run. In February 2014, he was awarded the USA Baseball International Performance of the Year Award for his play. Aiken was considered one of the top prospects heading into the 2014 Major League Baseball draft. In March 2014, he was ranked by Keith Law as the top prospect for the draft. The Houston Astros selected Aiken with the first overall selection. After issues arose with his health, elbow inflammation in his throwing arm, and disputes over an adjusted signing bonus, Aiken was unsigned when the July 18 deadline elapsed. Soon after the draft, it appeared the two sides had agreed to a $6.5 million bonus. But after Aiken's physical, the Astros reduced their offer to $5 million. He was the first number one overall draft pick not to sign since Tim Belcher in 1983. On August 27, it was reported that the Astros could still sign Aiken, as the other 29 MLB teams agreed to allow the use of a clause in the draft which negates the deadline. It was also reported that, if he were to sign, Aiken would insist on a sign-and-trade deal. In February 2015, Aiken enrolled at IMG Academy's postgraduate baseball program, making him eligible for the 2015 Major League Baseball draft and also joining him with Jacob Nix, who was also drafted by and opted not to sign with the Astros in 2014. Aiken was removed in the first inning of his first start for IMG, citing elbow discomfort. On March 26, Aiken announced that he underwent Tommy John surgery after being told he had torn the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow. Professional career The Cleveland Indians selected Aiken with the 17th overall selection of the 2015 draft. Aiken signed with the Indians agreeing to a signing bonus of $2,513,280. Aiken made his professional debut with the Arizona League Indians in June 2016, and he was later promoted to the Mahoning Valley Scrappers. Aiken ended 2016 with a combined 2‚Äì5 record and a 5.83 ERA between both clubs. He spent the 2017 season with the Lake County Captains of the Class A Midwest League, where he posted a 5‚Äì13 record with a 4.77 ERA in 27 games. He did not pitch in 2018 and pitched in two games during the 2019 season. Aiken took some time away from the game of baseball afterwards, and the Indians were unsure of his status going forward for the 2020 season.

They are unarmored, for civilian use.  ATVs  Land Tamer amphibious 8x8 remote access vehicle Amongst the smallest non air-cushioned amphibious vehicles are amphibious ATVs (all-terrain vehicles). These saw significant popularity in North America during the 1960s and early 1970s. Typically an amphibious ATV (AATV) is a small, lightweight, off-highway vehicle, constructed from an integral hard plastic or fibreglass bodytub, fitted with six (sometimes eight) driven wheels, with low pressure, balloon tires. With no suspension (other than what the tires offer) and no steering wheels, directional control is accomplished through skid-steering ‚Äì just as on a tracked vehicle ‚Äì either by braking the wheels on the side where you want to turn, or by applying more throttle to the wheels on the opposite side. Most contemporary designs use garden tractor type engines, that will provide roughly top speed on land. Constructed this way, an AATV will float with ample freeboard and is capable of traversing swamps, ponds and streams as well as dry land. On land these units have high grip and great off-road ability, that can be further enhanced with an optional set of tracks that can be mounted directly onto the wheels. Although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water ‚Äì albeit slowly ‚Äì outboard motors can be added for extended water use. In October 2013, Gibbs Amphibians introduced the Quadski, the first amphibious vehicle capable of traveling on land or water. The Quadski was developed using Gibbs' High Speed Amphibian technology, which Gibbs originally developed for the Aquada, an amphibious car, which the company has still not produced because of regulatory issues.\\"Attorneys: New Classification Needed for High Speed Amphibians, Feb. 14, 2012, FastAmphibians.com  Cars  Amphicar Amphibious automobiles have been conceived from ca. 1900, however the Second World War significantly stimulated their development. Two of the most significant amphibious cars to date were developed during World War II. The most proliferous was the German Schwimmwagen, a small jeep-like 4x4 vehicle designed by the Porsche engineering firm in 1942 and widely used in World War II. The amphibious bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, the firm's body construction designer, using the engine and drive train of the K√ºbelwagen. An amphibious version of the Willys MB jeep, the Ford GPA or 'Seep' (short for Sea jeep) was developed during World War II as well. A specially modified GPA, called Half-Safe, was driven and sailed around the world by Australian Ben Carlin in the 1950s. One of the most capable post-war amphibious off-roaders was the German Amphi-Ranger, that featured a hull made of seawater-resistant AlMg2 aluminium alloy. Extensively engineered, this costly vehicle was proven seaworthy at a Gale force 10 storm off the North Sea coast (Pohl, 1998). Only about 100 were built ‚Äì those who own one have found it capable of crossing the English Channel almost effortlessly. Purely recreational amphibian cars include the 1960s Amphicar and the contemporary Gibbs Aquada. With almost 4,000 pieces built, the Amphicar is still the most successfully produced civilian amphibious car to date. The Gibbs Aquada stands out due to its capability of high speed planing on water. Gibbs built fifty Aquadas in the early 2000s after it was developed by a team assembled by founder Alan Gibbs before the company's engine supplier, Rover, was unable to continue providing engines. Gibbs and new partner Neil Jenkins reconstituted the company and are now seeking U.S. regulatory approval for the Aquada\\"Carboat Stalled, Gibbs to Launch Amphibious ATV\\", TheDetroitBureau.com Other amphibious cars include the US Hydra Spyder and the Spira4u.Spira4u  See also  * Amphibious aircraft * Amphibious vehicle * Amphicar * Flying car (aircraft) * Unmanned aerial vehicle * Volkswagen Schwimmwagen  External links  * FOMM Concept One.

President Truman had sent his personal aircraft, The Independence, to ferry the Pakistani prime minister from London to Washington D.C.and accorded him the highest honour by personally welcoming him at the national airport, accompanied by his entire cabinet. A photograph from that time shows Truman and his wife smiling at the camera, surrounded his Pakistani guests and their wives in \\"Gharar\\" outfits in front of Blair House, the state guest house across the street from the White House. Liaqat Ali Khan was wearing a Western Suit with a \\"Jinnah\\" Karkuli cap. Upon Prime Minister Ali Khan's arrival, there was an official parade in the New York City in his honour, he was also conferred with an honorary degree by the Columbia University. During his visit, he also spoke at the House of Representatives, the lower house of the United States Congress. At home front, Prime Minister Ali Khan's trip to the United States was highly politicised and criticised by the left‚Äìwing sphere who levelled its charges on ignoring the Soviet Union's invitation in favour of the United States. Upon returning to Pakistan, Ali Khan spoke highly of his visit to the US but survived a conspiracy hatched by the left‚Äìwing sphere in 1951. According to the English newspaper, Dawn, Ali Khan's state visit and further reliance towards the United States became a permanent fixture of the foreign policy of Pakistan during the Cold War. Background Prime minister Ali Khan shakes hands with President Harry Truman, upon his arrival. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the United States was one of the first countries to recognise the new State of Pakistan as US Department of State had rushed the US Consul-General in Morocco to Karachi to represent the US government in the Pakistan's Independence Day ceremony on 14 August 1947 with a message of warm greetings and good wishes from the White House. The independence of Pakistan in 1947 oversaw the first war over Kashmir region. During the war, Founder of Pakistan and Governor- General Muhammad Ali Jinnah unsuccessfully asked the United States for $2 billion in military and financial aid but the US followed a policy of neutrality, rebuffing any requests made by Pakistan's government. During this time, Pakistan's relations with the USSR remained to be fluctuated. In 1949, Indian Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru paid the state visit to the United States, which eventually led Pakistan's government to cement relations with the Soviet Union. Finally on 3 June 1949, Soviet Union sent an invitation to Prime Minister Ali Khan which came as a surprise to the United States. With India's strict commitment towards the Non-aligned Movement (NAM) influenced the United States to send an invitation to Ali Khan in 1950. Visit and aftermath President Truman accompanies Prime Minister Ali Khan in Washington D.C. In a reference written by Kalim Bahadur in his book Democracy in Pakistan: Crises and Conflicts, Prime Minister Ali Khan quickly accepted the invitation and postponed his visit to Moscow. On 3 May 1950, Prime Minister Ali Khan, the First Lady of Pakistan, Begum Ali Khan and the large civic- military delegation arrived to the United States via United Kingdom and their official flight landed at the New Orleans Airport, New Orleans, Louisiana. Prime Minister Ali Khan was met with honour and received a warm welcome from the general American public; he was personally received by the President of the United States, Harry Truman. Upon reaching New York City, President Truman organised a parade and accorded the red-carpet treatment to welcome Ali Khan and his family. Ali Khan gave a lecture on political science at Columbia University, which conferred him with an honorary degree. Thereafter, he also engaged and spoke to the US House of Representatives. Speaking at the United States Congress session, Ali Khan highlighted the importance of Pakistan's geostrategic location, and the visit set the course of Pakistan's foreign policy: close ties with the United States and co-operation against a perceived threat from the USSR. Upon returning to Pakistan, he strongly defended his trip to the United States in a broadcast from Radio Pakistan on 30 June: Criticism and politicisation At home front, Prime Minister Ali Khan was highly politicised and criticised by the left-wing sphere who charged him with ignoring the Soviet Union's initiation. However, Ali Khan counter-argued that the USSR had slowly extended the invitation and \\"were unable to fix a date to pay a state visit.\\" Ali Khan's state visit and alignment towards the United States became a pivot in Pakistan's foreign policy during the Cold War. After the assassination of Ali Khan, the relations with the USSR soured until 1965 when the relations improved to such an extent that USSR sponsored the Tashkent Agreement between India and Pakistan. In 1972, due to Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's rapprochement, visit led to normalise the relation after providing a help to finance the founding of Pakistan's largest industrial complex: Pakistan Steel Mills. In a critical assessment opinion written in English newspaper Dawn, Liaquat Ali Khan is chiefly responsible for throwing Pakistan into the US camp.

Immense Legality in Saudi Arabia  Domestic abuse in Saudi Arabia started to receive public attention in 2004 after a popular television presenter, Rania al-Baz, was severely beaten by her husband, and photographs of her bruised and swollen face were published in the press.Saudi TV host's beating raises taboo topic: domestic violence against Muslim women By Souheila Al-Jadda csmonitor.com May 12, 2004accessed 2014-10-15 According to Al-Baz, her husband beat her, intending to kill her, after she answered the phone without his permission. Violence against women and children in the home was traditionally not seen as a criminal matter in Saudi Arabia until 2013. In 2008, \\"social protection units\\", Saudi Arabia's version of women's shelters, were ordered by the prime minister to expand in several large Saudi cities. That year the prime minister also ordered the government to draft a national strategy to deal with domestic violence. Some Saudi royal foundations, such as the King Abdulaziz Center for National Dialogue and the King Khalid Foundation, have also led education and awareness efforts against domestic violence. Five years later, in 2013, Saudi Arabia launched its first major effort against domestic violence, the \\"No More Abuse\\" ad campaign. In August 2013, the Saudi cabinet approved a law making domestic violence a criminal offence for the first time. The law calls for a punishment of up to a year in prison and a fine of up to 50,000 riyals (US$13,000). The maximum punishments can be doubled for repeat offenders. The law criminalizes psychological and sexual abuse, as well as physical abuse. It also includes a provision obliging employees to report instances of abuse in the workplace to their employer. The move followed a Twitter campaign. The new laws were welcomed by Saudi women's rights activists, although some expressed concerns that the law could not be implemented successfully without new training for the judiciary, and that the tradition of male guardianship would remain an obstacle to prosecutions. The number of reported harassment cases against women and juveniles in Saudi Arabia has reached 2,797 in one year, a newspaper stated on quoting official statistics. A significant amount of domestic violence towards women in Saudi Arabia is related to their lack of autonomy in their own lives. An example of this is male guardianship, which requires a woman to have a male guardian present to make significant decisions such as travel, marriage and legal transactions. Guardianship of women A form of domestic violence that is prominent for women in Saudi Arabia is male guardianship which is also known as Mahram. This system of guardianship by males results in a fully grown woman being treated as a minor with minimal or no power over their own lives. This system is based on social conventions and also the requirements from religion. These types of restrictions include travelling and to whom they marry. Women also find difficulty in making transactions without their male guardian present such as signing contracts for a rental property. Male guardians can be one of a variety of people such as a father, husband or son. As discussed by the Human Rights Watch, a divorced woman whose father is deceased would then have their son as their guardian. In this particular report a woman was placed under the guardianship of her 23-year-old son. As discussed by Yakin Ert√ºrk (the Special Rapporteur on violence against women), there are various reactions to this system by women living in Saudi Arabia. Some believe that this system is necessary for their protection and feel pampered by their male guardian. However, many believe it limits their lives to a severe extent. Guardianship severely limits women's autonomy, freedom of movement and the exercise of their legal capacity in situations such as marriage. This also impacts their more personal decisions such as decision-making in family matters, education and employment. A woman was arguably not considered to have had an identification prior to 2013, where no woman was issued an identity card as they would be registered alongside their guardian on that male's identification documents. Although not strictly binding in Saudi Arabian law, there are still many sectors of society that require a guardian for somewhat mundane tasks. In a 2008 Human Rights Watch report it is noted that even if there is no law regarding a decision, the kingdom gives a heavy portion of decision-making to a woman's male guardian. While the government has taken steps to prevent such limitations for women, there is minimal evidence that they are being implemented into society. Even in instances of medical procedures which is an individual's decision in other countries, this is regularly left to the guardian to decide for the woman in question. This will especially be the case if the hospital or medical centre is administered by religious conservatives. There have been cases that include a woman running the risk of facing criminal charges for having an extramarital affair if she enters the hospital to give birth without her male guardian.  Recent developments in the guardianship system  Although guardianship and other forms of domestic violence are still present in Saudi Arabia, there have been several successful attempts at reform in recent years. These issues have been recognized at a domestic level by King Abdullah, King Salman, and the government of Saudi Arabia alongside international institutions such as the United Nations. = International scrutiny = The United Nations has become involved in the attempted abolition of the guardianship system. For example. the 2009 ‚ÄòReport of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences‚Äô. This report included recommendations to the Saudi Arabian government in terms of guardianship. Recommendation (a) point 3 recommends ‚ÄúTake measures, including through awareness-raising campaigns, to end the practice of guardianship and abolish existing legal provisions that require a guardian‚Äôs authorization, such as those pertaining to women‚Äôs travel or access to services or employment.‚Äù In 2008 by the concluding comments of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on Saudi Arabia. discussed relevant issues of male guardianship for women including personal status such as marriage, divorce and child custody. It noted how the guardianship system encourages the patriarchal ideology in society which further discriminates against women. In concluding comment 16 of the report, the Committee urged Saudi Arabia to take immediate steps to abolish the male guardianship system. CEDAW comment that awareness campaigns should be created and that the state should produce a strict timetable with steps to ensure the modify or eliminate practices that discriminate against women in Saudi Arabia. = Domestic developments = A case that displays a change in regard to a woman's ability to marry was displayed in 2010. This case involved the highest court in Saudi Arabia overturning a decision from five years prior that ruled to annul the marriage between 36-year-old woman Fatima Azzaz and her husband. When wanting to marry it is customary in Saudi Arabia for the woman's guardian to look into the suitors' background, which Ms Azzaz's male relatives did in this case. They were unsatisfied with his tribal background and so with their opinion had attempted to have the marriage annulled, and were successful in 2005. They were able to annul the marriage on the grounds of tribal incompatibility and were successful meaning the couple had to separate. Azzaz chose at this time to go to jail with her infant son rather than reside in the family home with her brothers who had successfully separated her from her husband. She was then transferred to a state orphanage where she had the couple's second child. After the decision from the Supreme Court in Saudi Arabia in 2009, the couple resumed living together. Voice of Women leader Fawzia al Ayouni stated, \\"I consider this decision to be a milestone in Saudi modern history, as it loudly screams that we are all equal sons and daughters of this country‚Ä¶‚Äù. This case displayed a significant movement in the proceedings of the courts in Saudi Arabia. This decision was revisited due to a document delivered to King Abdullah which included a petition for review. As stated by Mr al Sudiary (Ms Azzaz's legal representation) the case ‚Äú‚Ä¶changes many things, including the way courts examine cases presented to it, [and] the types of cases they accept‚Äù. This case has been applauded across Saudi Arabia. Human Rights Watch discussed the case as a great victory, not only for the parties involved but for the many other people in a similar situation. A prominent movement against domestic violence in relation to the male guardianship system was created under the hashtag #Iammyownguardian. This movement began after the 2008 Human Rights Watch report and was started by women who had been fighting the system for over a decade. Activist Aziza Al- Yousef stated that ‚Äúwomen should be treated as a full citizen.‚Äù With the report and the hashtag on social media site Twitter, a Saudi woman Hala Aldosari wrote a petition that quickly gathered 14,682 signatures after being promoted heavily online under the hashtag. The Saudi King also received approximately 2500 direct telegrams in relation to this petition and the matter of guardianship in their country. In the petition, Aldosari addressed King Salman and urged him to consider the impact the guardianship system had on women in terms of poverty, exploitation and domestic violence. Since the United Nation Human Rights Council universal period reviews of Saudi Arabia's human rights policies in 2009 and 2013, the government has agreed to work towards abolishing the guardianship system. Small steps have been taken since to lessen control over women by their guardians alongside enactment of laws criminalizing domestic violence.

The lake is the main water source for Kokshetau.  History  The area where the lake now stands was once swampland. In the late 1800s Military authorities ordered a canal be dug from the Chaglinka River such that the redirected waters turned the swamp into the Lake Kopa. In 1974 work began to clean sediment from Lake Kopa, which continued intermittently until 1993. In total, approximately of sand and gravel were removed from the lake.

It was first described by mycologist Ralph Emerson in 1941 as a variety of Allomyces javanicus, and later given distinct species status in 1954. Its genome has been sequenced by the Broad Institute. Genome studies The genome of Allomyces macrogynus has been sequenced and this makes it desirable to review an organism of interesting structure and one which is responsive to environmental changes in easily observable ways. In Seattle 1969, at an informal meeting of Emerson, Machlis, Olson, Seale and Youatt, Youatt agreed to study chemical aspects of the fungus so that when the genome was known gene activity could be related to what the genes governed. =Normal growth= Allomyces macrogynus features defined by Emerson and Emerson and Wilson were of immediate interest for research and teaching because the organism had such clear and interesting structures. The vegetative growth showed the formation of rhizoids, hyphae and branching and then in the diploid cultures two kinds of fruiting body, zoosporangia ZS that reproduced the diploid organisms and resting or resistant sporangia RS that led to the haploid organism. Then on the haploid hyphae gametangia were produced with small terminal male gametangia containing carotene and larger female gametangia below. Olson reviewed studies to 1984 that included chemotaxis of male gametes to female gametes, the identification of the hormone sirenin, studies of the chemistry of walls and discharge plugs and methods for classroom demonstrations. His comprehensive monograph also compares Allomyces with other fungi in detail. The organism which lives in tropical ditchwater has a range of survival mechanisms which can be studied in the laboratory. These include chemotaxis of zoospores to amino acids, especially leucine and lysine and to some peptides and to oxygen, and a minicycle where a germinated spore, deprived of nutrients, can produce another zoospore to move on to better conditions. Allomyces macrogynus also shows chemotropism in the growing hyphal organisms by which the rhizoids can grow towards amino acid sources and the hyphae to a better oxygen supply. The diploid organisms can produce zoosporangia ZS when conditions are good and the resistant or resting sporangia RS when they are unfavourable. The RS can survive desiccation for years. =Methodology= Study requires synchronous culture in defined media. Allomyces macrogynus is commonly grown in media with casein hydrolysate and yeast extracts as the source of nitrogen and growth factors but can be grown in a variety of chemically defined media. The simplest of these had ammonium salt as the only source of nitrogen. Defined media allow selection of ZS or RS in diploid plants and male or female gametangia in haploid plants, the chief factor being the ratio of amino acids to glucose. Interpretation of results is always easier if organisms are grown in chemically defined media and media could be very simple as would be expected for a saprophytic organism first isolated from ditch water. In this context it is worth noting that, although methionine is supplied in all culture media, the organisms can synthesise methionine and in their natural environment they probably use sulfide available at low concentration. Methionine is required for branching and, if added just before branching of a growing culture, hydrogen sulfide, cysteine and homocysteine can all be used. Methods based on vortex mixing and osmotic shock cause death of many spores. Casein hydrolysate CH or mixtures of leucine and lysine can also be used. Small peptides in hydrolysed CH were also effective. Casein hydrolysate CH was good for producing synchronous germination. Zoospores encysted and attached to the unshaken glass vessel and the CH could then be removed and replaced with defined medium. As wall development began the organisms detached from glass and with suitable shaking grew as suspensions of single organisms, ideal for observation. With new ways to produce RS synchronous cultures of haploid organisms could now be grown in the same way from selectively produced mature RS. For chemically defined induction of germination mixtures of leucine and lysine or phenylpyruvate were the best of many compounds tested. =Growth and cell cycles= The synchronously growing hyphae showed development at the hyphal tip in G1 of the growth cycle and widening at the base in G2. This study used time lapse photography because the alternating pattern seemed unusual. However from the earliest descriptions of spore germination the same pattern was present. After rhizoids had emerged the cysts developed first at a 180¬∞ angle to the rhizoids but then widened at the base to give the typical tubular hyphae. Oxygen Variations in the angle of emergence of hyphae were related to oxygen gradients. A further departure from apical growth was observed if hyphal organisms, growing on the surface of solid media, were covered with a microscope slide to create an oxygen gradient. The hyphal response involved growth towards the oxygen of thin unbranched hyphae which, when they reached open access to the air, widened back to the hyphal base to give hyphae of normal diameter. Ion currents and hyphal growth Synchronous germination and the chemotropism for oxygen were used to orient growing organisms suitably for measurements with a delicate vibrating probe electrode to measure currents along the hyphae during the backward and forward growth and also to identify the ions involved. The latter study also showed effects of growth in applied voltages and chemotropism of the rhizoids to casein hydrolysate. The ions leaving the hyphal tip were protons, which confirmed Turian's observations of acidification of the hyphal tips. Calcium In the experiments with oxygen and hyphal development there was no requirement for calcium and no inhibition by EGTA. At the time of these studies many mycologists thought that calcium played a role in fungal morphology and were disinclined to believe that the labelling of agents such as the chelator EGTA and the ionophore A23187 could have been incorrectly said to be specific for calcium in many studies. Indeed it is still not clear how the error occurred because stability constants for EGTA chelated with Fe, Zn and Mn had been published before any claim of specificity for Ca. Calculations of the availability of free ions of essential divalent cations like Fe and Zn showed that experiments with EGTA were better explained as having caused deficiencies in these essential ions. Classical demonstration of the requirements for trace metals requires careful cleaning of all glassware or plastic dishes and the use of very pure distilled water, and AR grade chemicals. By this method A.macrogynus and Achlya species were shown to require Fe, and Zn but not Ca. The traditional supply of calcium salts to fungal cultures may have met the need for trace elements as even A.R. calcium salts always contain other divalent cations.

Additionally, there were 7 incidents involving local police. Several incidents of assault on staff were reported. No incidents of sexual misconduct of the faculty were noted. Each year the school safety data is reported by the District's administration to the Pennsylvania Safe School Center which publishes the reports online. The Susquehanna Township School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, Susquehanna Township School District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Tuition Students who live in Susquehanna Township School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. Or a student living in a neighboring public school district may seek admission to Susquehanna Township School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2012 tuition rate for Susquehanna Township School District's Middle School and High School is $8,826.01. Wellness policy Susquehanna Township School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 ‚Äì Student Wellness Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äì Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for its approval. This includes classroom party guidelines from the Pennsylvania Department of Education.Classroom party foods guidelines Susquehanna Township School District offers both a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch at school. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of the lunch. Susquehanna Township Middle School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also annually monitor each child's weight and report the data to the state. Extracurriculars Students at Susquehanna Township Middle School offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive sports program. The sports are open to sports to 7th and 8th graders. Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy and in compliance with standards set by the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). To receive automatic academic eligibility to participate in any extra-curricular activities (athletic, music) sponsored by the Susquehanna Township School District, students must not fail two or more classes on their previous report card. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. ;Susquehanna Township Middle School Sports: ;Boys: *Basketball *Cross Country *Soccer *Track and Field *Wrestling ;Girls: *Basketball *Cross Country *Field Hockey *Soccer (Fall) *Track and Field According to PIAA directory July 2013 References Category:Middle schools in Pennsylvania Category:Schools in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania Category:Education in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Category:Buildings and structures in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania ","title":"Susquehanna Township Middle School"},{"id":"42303522","text":"Woodyard is an unincorporated community in Edgar County, Illinois, United States.

It often differentiates financial instruments that are easily tradable (or tradeable) as opposed to those that require the permission of the company or a signed document that registers the transfer of securities between two market participants. Another way to look at it is the difference between how a person buys a fund (collective investment scheme) and how they buy a bond or share. Liquid Tradable Securities come in many forms and with a wide variety of acronyms. These include stocks and bonds as well as exchange- traded funds, exchange traded commodities, exchange-traded notes (including certificates), REITs, as well as most OTC securities. Note that these do not include Swaps or repurchase agreement (repos), which are contractual arrangements and as such are not tradable. This is a wider definition than the definition of transferable securities under MiFIDSee Article 4(1)(18) http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:145:0001:0044:EN:PDF LTS advantage over collective investment scheme LTS' offer a significant advantage over collective investment schemes. Collective investment schemes (or CIS or UCIS) come in many legal forms. What is common in each legal form is the existence of a shareholder register; according to the laws of most jurisdictions, an entry in the shareholder register must be accompanied by a signed declaration to invest. Equally, a transfer of shares in a collective investment scheme is usually not allowed without the signed consent of the company. These procedural requirements limit the ability of shareholders to trade their shares. A small subset of collective investment schemes are electronically tradable through stock exchanges (most notably REITs). However, the vast majority of collective investment schemes require these procedural steps.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/part/8/chapter/2 and related sections LTS' on the other hand have no such limitations. They are most commonly represented by dematerialised certificates or immobilisation conditions (according to US IRS definitions).https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs- drop/n-12-20.pdf LTS' are held in a global note form and deposited with a central securities depository (CSD). The simplifies the administrative procedures of buying and selling and reduces both the costs of administration for the company and the cost of compliance. The benefit for investors is the ease of trading. Positions can be sold without consent of the company and it is perfectly feasible for active secondary market sales to take place unbeknownst to the company. Many exchanges provide a list of tradable instruments (either in the form of a requirements for listing or as a searchable function). LTSs simply the compliance requirements of fiduciary trustees and financial advisers as they usually include a standard set of documents (including the form of the global note), an information memorandum or prospectus, and a term sheet. The approval of the CSD is critical to this process; all instruments are verified before the issue of an ISIN number and the creation of the dematerialised security is handled by the CSD. The criteria for acceptance are quite strict. https://www.euroclear.com/dam/Brochures/Annex5-PGM- from%20MA1521%20-%20ISMAG%20MPB.pdf IRS regulations stipulate particular requirements for tradable securities. These generally describe the characteristics necessary for an LTS (according to IRS definitions, at least).https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Employee-Plans-News--ESOPs-- Definition-of-Readily-Tradable-Employer-Securities References  Category:Securities (finance) ","title":"Liquid tradable securities"},{"id":"42303568","text":"Woodyard is an unincorporated community in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States.

Career He started teaching Latin and Greek at Princeton University in 1808. By 1813, he became Professor of Languages, Librarian, Inspector (Dean), and secretary of the Board of Trustees. He then served as its Vice President from 1817 to 1822, and as its Acting President from 1822 to 1824.Vanderbilt University: Historical Background of Peabody College However, he declined its presidency, as well as the presidencies of Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, Ohio University in Athens, Ohio and Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.James F. Davidson, Philip Lindsley: The Teacher as Prophet, Peabody Journal of Education, Vol. 41, No. 6, May, 1964 In December 1824, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to take up the presidency of Cumberland College. Among his first acts as president was to request that its name be changed to the University of Nashville, a change that took effect about a year after his arrival. He hired respected scholars as faculty in fields including classics, foreign languages, mathematics, and geology. At the same time, he actively recruited students. He also suggested starting a medical school. He resigned his position in 1850, when the university suspended operations as a result of the cholera epidemic which led to low enrollment and to financial difficulties. His son, John Berrien Lindsley, became the university's president when it reopened in 1855. After leaving the University of Nashville, he taught Ecclesiastical Polity and Biblical Archaeology at New Albany Theological Seminary in New Albany, Indiana (now the McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago). His ideas and ambitions regarding education had a lasting impact. He promoted the Nashville city slogan \\"Athens of the South\\", a sobriquet coined by Leroy J. Halsey (1812-1896) that reflected his goal of making the University of Nashville into a nationally recognized institution. He was an advocate for better education at all levels, becoming one of the first academics to urge the formal training of school teachers in normal schools. He saw education as, \\"a great equalizer, a special right for the poor.\\"Christine M. Kreyling, Wesley Paine, Charles W. Warterfield, Susan Ford Wiltshire, Classical Nashville: Athens of the South, Nashville, Tennessee: Vanderbilt University Press, 1996, p. 8 Additionally, in an essay entitled Thoughts on Slavery, he wrote, \\"Our slaves must be emancipated.\\" In the 1830s he published a pamphlet that argued that all children should be offered a broad academic education, including Greek, Latin, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, geography, and English.

It was established in 1967 principally to protect a New Zealand fur seal breeding colony. The conservation park was subsequently expanded to include the adjoining waters in order to control and manage berleying activities used to attract great white sharks. As of 2002, the conservation park is the only place in Australia where shark cage diving to view great white sharks is legally permitted. Description The conservation park includes all the islands within the group with the exception of all or part of the southernmost island (known as Lighthouse Island) in the South Neptune Islands where land has been reserved for ongoing use by a lighthouse and the waters within 2 nautical miles (4 km) of the mean low water mark of both groups of islands. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category Ia protected area. History Part of the island group was proclaimed as a fauna conservation reserve under the Crown Lands Act 1929-1966 on 16 March 1967 mainly to conserve the New Zealand fur seal breeding colony on the southern island of the North Neptune Islands which is reported as being one of the largest in Australia. Other features that contributed to the declaration include the small breeding population of Australian sea lions on the North Neptune Islands, Australian sea lion haul out areas on the South Neptune Islands and the breeding/nesting populations of Cape Barren goose, white-bellied sea eagle, osprey and peregrine falcon. The conservation park was subsequently extended in 1997 to include the waters within of the shoreline of both the North and South Neptune Islands via a declaration under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 to regulate and manage great white shark berleying activities around both groups of islands. 1n 1990, most of Lighthouse Island was reportedly added to the conservation park after the conversion of the lighthouse to automatic operation with the exception of some land around the lighthouse and an associated helicopter landing site. On 29 November 2012, the waters within of the coastline of both the North and South Neptune Islands at median high water also became part of a protected area known as the Neptune Islands Group (Ron and Valerie Taylor) Marine Park. The marine park entity provides a level of regulation additional to that of the conservation park in respect to the use of the waters adjoining both groups of islands. Visitor services Since 2002, the conservation park is the only venue in Australia where the use of shark cage diving to view great white sharks is legally permitted. Access for shark cage diving is via three operators licensed by the Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources.

In May 2006, she and her climbing partner Karen McNeill disappeared on Mount Foraker in Alaska and neither body has ever been recovered. Mountaineering Nott began climbing in 1989 in her hometown of Vail, Colorado. Early on, she dedicated her attention to ice climbing and led a climb on a free-hanging icicle called \\"the Fang\\" within her first year of climbing. Throughout the 1990s, Nott focused her efforts on a number of technical ice climbs, particularly in the Canadian Rockies, such as \\"Acid Howl\\" on Mount Stanley, British Columbia; \\"the Replicant\\" on Mount Rundle, Alberta; and the first ascent of the \\"Glass Onion\\", a difficult rock and ice route in southwestern Alaska. She later traveled to Patagonia to climb Fitz Roy, and to the French Alps. Nott met New Zealand climber Karen McNeill at an American ice-climbing competition. In 1998, Nott and McNeill paired up for an expedition to Peru to climb Taulliraju; in 2001, they climbed Shivling together in India's Garhwal Himalaya. Nott climbed the Eiger in 2003 with her boyfriend John Varco, and became the first American woman to complete a winter ascent of the mountain's north face. The same year, she and Varco made an unsuccessful attempt to claim the first ascent of the North Spur of Kalanka in Nanda Devi National Park, India. In 2005, Nott and McNeill reached the summit of Mount McKinley in Alaska via the Cassin Ridge. =Death on Mount Foraker= In May 2006, Nott and McNeill returned to the Alaska Range to climb Mount Foraker via the Infinite Spur route, planning to be the first women to do so. They left the mountain's base camp on May 12 with a 14-day supply of food and fuel. When they had not returned or been seen by June 1, the National Park Service (NPS) launched an aerial search for the women; the search was called off on June 11, having only found the climbers' lost gear, avalanche debris, and tracks near the summit. A report issued by the NPS in 2007 summarized the evidence found in the search and investigation, and speculated about how the climbers perished. The report concluded that neither Nott nor McNeill fell when their gear was dropped at around , and surmised that the women continued to climb as high as before building a snow cave, where they ultimately died. Legacy Following the deaths of Nott and McNeill, the American Alpine Club and Mountain Hardwear, Nott's sponsor, established the McNeill-Nott Award in 2007. The award is a US$5,000 grant which is given annually to \\"amateur climbers exploring new routes or unclimbed peaks with small and lightweight teams\\".

He is known for his Manual of Classical Bibliography (1825). Life Born at Dudley, then in Worcestershire, Moss matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, 21 March 1820. While an undergraduate he was preoccupied with classical bibliography. He graduated B.A. 1825, M.A. 1827, M.B. 1829, and settled in practice at Dudley. Moss was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 18 February 1830. In 1847 he moved from Dudley to Longdon, near Lichfield, and in 1848 to the Manor House, Upton Bishop, in Herefordshire. In 1853 he again moved, to Hill Grove House, Wells, Somerset, where he died 23 May 1862. By the end of his life he was regarded as an eccentric recluse. Works Moss's Manual of Classical Bibliography, was, he said, sent to the press early in 1823. The work was published in 1825, in two volumes, containing over 1250 closely printed pages. Publicity material made comparisons with works of Guillaume-Fran√ßois Debure, the Manuel of Jacques Charles Brunet and the Introduction to the Knowledge of the Editions of the Classics of Thomas Frognall Dibdin; and claimed improvements over those of Edward Harwood and Michael Maittaire. In spite of omissions and mistakes, the Manual became a standard work of reference. Favourable reviews appeared, but the Literary Gazette (1825), in three articles, severely attacked the book. A reply from Moss was in the Gentleman's Magazine for September 1825: he admitted that he had borrowed the plan of his work from Dibdin. The Literary Magazine published a rejoinder. The Manual was reprinted, with a new title-page, but with no corrections, in 1837, by Henry George Bohn. An inconsistent Supplement, compiled by the publisher, brought the lists down to 1836.

His uncle was the respected Antwerp sculptor Erasmus Quellinus I, whose son was Artus Quellinus I, the most successful Flemish Baroque sculptor of the mid 17th century. Artus II is likely to have received his training as a sculptor from his cousin Artus Quellinus I in Antwerp to where he must have moved from his native city of Sint-Truiden (then in the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge, now in the Belgian province of Limburg). Artus Quellinus II became a master of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp in 1650‚Äì51.Artus Quellinus (II) at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Artus Quellinus II married Anna Maria Gabron, the sister of the painter Willem Gabron, in 1653. The couple had six children of whom three became artists: Artus Quellinus III and Thomas Quellinus were both successful sculptors whereas Cornelis Quellinus became a painter about whom little is known. The young Artus joined his cousin Artus Quellinus I in Amsterdam around 1653 where he became one of the members of the team of artists that worked under the direction of Artus I on the decoration of the newly built City Hall on the Dam Square. The artist traveled to Italy and probably visited Turin, Florence and Rome between 1655 and 1657.Hans Vlieghe and Iris Kockelbergh. \\"Quellinus.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 25 March 2014 He was back in Antwerp in 1657 and became an Antwerp burgher on 11 May 1663. His wife died on 15 October 1668 and the next year Artus remarried to Cornelia Volders. In the latter part of his life Quellinus received many commissions, primarily for church furnishings and tomb sculptures. His pupils include Alexander van Papenhoven, Thomas Quellinus, Jan van den Steen, (1633‚Äì1723), the Master of the St. Luke in Antwerp, Cornelis van Scheyck (1679‚Äì1680); Balten Rubbens (1685‚Äì1686); Adriaen Govaerts (1690‚Äì91) and Jacobus de Man (1694‚Äì95). As Artus Quellinus the Elder and the Younger resided at the same time in Antwerp for a long period it is not always clear from the records of the local Guild of Saint Luke (the so-called Liggeren) whether someone was a pupil of Artus the Younger or the Elder. Work Tomb of bishop Ambrosius Capello in Antwerp Cathedral Artus Quellinus II received many commissions in the Southern Netherlands as well as from other cultural centres of Europe, such as Copenhagen. Artus the Younger's style marked an evolution in Baroque sculpture in Flanders towards a more dramatic and expressive form. This distinguishes him from his cousin Artus I who had worked in Rome in the workshop of Fran√ßois Duquesnoy and upon his return in Flanders in the 1640s had helped introduce the Baroque style developed by Fran√ßois Duquesnoy, which was based on classical sculpture.Helena Bussers, De baroksculptuur en het barok at Openbaar Kunstbezit Vlaanderen This style was less expressive than the Baroque style of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the main competitor of Fran√ßois Duquesnoy in Rome. Artus the Younger's emphasis on emotion reveals a link with the work of Bernini and Lucas Faydherbe (1617‚Äì1697), the leading sculptor from Mechelen who had trained with Peter Paul Rubens. This is reflected in Artus Quellinus II's preference for graceful bodies, flowing draperies, hair that is tussled by the wind and fine facial expressions with little sense of realism. The influence of Bernini became more pronounced after 1670 when Artus the Younger's work acquired a distinctively expressive and heroic character. This is apparent in the sculpture group of God the Father, in the St. Salvator's Cathedral in Bruges as well as in the Apotheosis of St. James in the St. James' Church in Antwerp. The twisted columns and the radial rays are borrowed directly from Bernini's Baldachin in the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Here Artus the Younger created a new type of altar: freestanding, circular and open on all sides. Artus Quellinus II also made a number of more contemplative figures. The statue of St. Rosa of Lima in St. Paul's Church in Antwerp is an example of Quellinus' more contemplative style and is regarded as one of the most beautiful sculptures from the Baroque in the Southern Netherlands.

It dates from around 660 BC. The Rider Amphora belongs to the wider examples of the type. Its name derives from its main image, which recalls that on the somewhat older Horses Amphora: two horses stand opposite each other, with a large palmette between them. However, in this image, a rider sits on each of the horses' backs. Each rider leads another horse with him, using a rope, which is depicted slightly offset behind the rider's horse. Ekschmitt claims that the painter of this amphora does not show the talent of the painter of the Horses Amphora since the bodies of his horses are far too long and as a result the rider appears unnaturally small. Convention apparently forced the painter to adapt his motif to a restricted space. The empty room around this space was filled with various designs inherited from earlier Cycladic art, including the zigzag bands and diamonds. The neck of the amphora is decorated with bulging double palmette volutes, which are separated from one another by vertical bands. On the backside, the painter depicts two riderless horses facing each other. There are no images on the other two sides. The vessel is 90 cm high.

The game was released on the Steam platform for the PC on March 24, 2014. Set in colonial Virginia in the 17th century, the game includes stealth elements, with players stalking their enemies and using colonial weaponry to defeat them. Gameplay Betrayer is a stealth horror action-adventure played from a first-person perspective. It uses a monochrome art style that Eurogamer Dan Whitehead described as \\"undeniably striking\\". The game has no clear missions or markers for quest objectives, aiming to initially perplex players by not providing a defined sense of direction. Sound plays a central role in exploring the game world, as it is used to lead the player to clues and other points of interest. While progressing, any clues found are meticulously documented in the inventory windows. Similar to The Elder Scrolls series, players can quickly navigate from one location to another by clicking a point-of-interest icon on the game's map. In the game, players stealthily kill enemy conquistadors by creeping through tall grass and hiding their movements by timing them with strong gusts of wind. Enemies are killed using a variety of antiquated weaponry including bows, crossbows, pistols, muskets, and thrown tomahawks. Taking inspiration from Dark Souls, when the player dies in the game all of their items are left on their corpse at the location of death. The player then respawns at the base fort and must journey back to where they died to retrieve their items from their corpse. If the player dies again before retrieving their items, then the items on that first corpse will disappear and cannot be recovered. Plot The protagonist begins the game washed up on a Virginian shore in Colonial America. A path leads the player to Fort Henry which is found abandoned. He gradually discovers that the entire colony is uninhabited, with the former English colonists having seemingly been reduced to human-shaped ash figures. The area around the colony is also patrolled by hostile Spanish Conquistadores and Native American warriors whose bodies have been transformed into burning embers; both groups seem to have devolved into an almost animal-like state and will attack the protagonist relentlessly. He soon encounters the only other living human in the area, a woman wearing a red hooded cloak referred to as the Maiden in Red. She has amnesia and cannot remember her name or where she came from, and tells the player that she does not see the Conquistadores or the human-shaped ash figures. He also discovers that by ringing a bell inside Ft. Henry, he is transported to a dark version of the world where hostile skeletons and evil spirits lurk. Inside this Otherworld, he encounters the spirits of the lost colonists; white Wraiths, who were alive at the time the colony was doomed, and black Shadows, colonists who had died (usually by violence) prior to the colony's doom. Both the Wraiths and the Shadows have fractured memories of their lives, and the protagonist must search for clues and conduct investigations to learn the identity and past of each lost soul, in the process learning of the sins each of them have committed against each other, including suicide, murder, rape, and a false execution for witchcraft. In the process, the protagonist makes his way westward to further investigate the fate of the colony. Over the course of the game, it is revealed that the former leader of the colony, Captain Benedict Harper, had journeyed west into forbidden territory in search of fabled treasure, and never returned. This created a rift between the colonists and their former Native American allies, who had previously forbidden any such expedition due to fears of awakening a great evil living in those lands, and which resulted in attacks by the natives against the colonists. The colonists also began to experience hostile paranormal activity in the aftermath of Harper's expedition. In Harper's absence, James Markley became governor of the colony. He was a selfish and paranoid man who greatly hated the natives. When James' daughter Tabitha fell in love with a native boy and became pregnant by him, she ran away to the native village knowing her father would be enraged. Upon learning of Tabitha's actions and perceiving them as a betrayal of his honor, James murdered his wife for not telling him of Tabitha's love affair, then pursued Tabitha into the area near the native village and murdered her for her miscegenation. However, Tabitha's despair was so great it manifested as an overwhelming paranormal force of death, killing all life around her corpse and spreading out into the surrounding area. Her twin sister Allison went into the woods in search of her and, having discovered her corpse and the death she was creating, tried to burn her body in order to lay her to rest. However, this only fueled Tabitha's supernatural rage, resulting in a powerful wave of death that swept across the land and killed everyone, both natives and colonists, except for her sister Allison. After helping the Maiden in Red remember her identity as Allison Markley, the protagonist is tasked with releasing the trapped souls of all the colonists, as their torment fuels Tabitha's power. The protagonist can either release each soul by telling them to let go of their regrets, or condemn them to eternal torment for their sins against each other. Once all souls have been either released or condemned, the protagonist travels to the location of Tabitha's corpse and, after defeating several waves of evil spirits summoned by her rage, speaks with her and convinces her to release her rage and move on. However, Tabitha informs him that she is being held in the world by her twin sister Allison. He speaks with Allison and convinces her to release her sister from this world by saying goodbye to her. Allison buries Tabitha and seems to be at peace, but abruptly reveals that she is not yet ready to let go of her twin sister. She apologizes for this just as it causes the protagonist to be teleported into the Otherworld and surrounded by the shadowy spirits of giants, at which point the game ends. Development The game was developed by Blackpowder Games. Members of the development studio were previously employed by Monolith Productions and worked on the games F.E.A.R., The Operative: No One Lives Forever and Shogo: Mobile Armor Division. The game was made available through the Steam Early Access platform, after which the final version was released on Steam on March 24, 2014. The game takes inspiration from a number of others including The Elder Scrolls series, Far Cry 3, Dark Souls, and Silent Hill. Reception Betrayer received a score of 62 out of 100 on Metacritic's user ratings. Writing for GameSpot, Cameron Woolsey gave the game 7 out of 10, concluding that \\"the macabre, eerie world of Betrayer is worth the time spent\\" but that \\"the game also begins to get repetitive\\" by the end. IGN gave Betrayer a score of 5 out of 10, stating that \\"the things you actually do in this world rarely come across as anything other than uninspired.\\" References Category:2014 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Stealth video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Early access video games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Single- player video games Category:Video games set in Virginia Category:Video games set in the 17th century ","title":"Betrayer (video game)"},{"id":"42304045","title":"Manning executive council of Ceylon"},{"id":"42304049","text":"Mama Bhagne is a 2009 Bengali film directed by Anup Sengupta and produced by Ishika Films Pvt.

It merged with the Alpine Club of Great Britain in 1975. History The Great Central Hotel, Marylebone (now the Landmark London), where the club had rooms and held its annual dinner In December 1907 a group of ladies who were climbers in the Alps met in London and agreed to form a new club, similar to the long-established Alpine Club, which at the time did not accept women members on account of their supposed physical and moral deficiencies in the matter of mountain climbing. The club's first president was the Bishop of Bristol, the second was Elizabeth Le Blond in 1908, who had been praised by T. G. Bonney when he became president of the Alpine Club as one of those \\"whom our stern Salic law prevents us from numbering among our members\\", and it was the first club specifically for women mountaineers.Ronald Clark, The Alps (2011), p. 129 Initially, it was the Alpine Section of the Lyceum Club, an intellectual women's club,Thompson, Simon, Unjustifiable Risk? The Story of British Climbing, Cicerone Press, 2010, p. 74 to which Elizabeth Le Blond belonged, but in 1908 it established an independent existence.David Doughan, Peter Gordon Women, Clubs and Associations in Britain (2007), p. 111 The club had its base at the Great Central Hotel, Marylebone, but was seen as affiliated to the Alpine Club and junior to it.Derek Walker, The Evolution of Climbing Clubs in Britain (pdf) at alpinejournal.org.uk. Retrieved 25 March 2014 As well as arranging climbing expeditions, the Ladies' Alpine Club organised a monthly lecture and provided rooms where members could meet for tea. For the duration of the First World War, the club's rooms were taken over by the War Department, but they were restored in 1919. The Alpine Club itself was at first sceptical about the Ladies' Club, but it soon began to take it seriously and to co-operate with it, especially after Queen Margherita of Italy accepted the position of Honorary President. According to Ann Bridge, a friend and climbing partner of George Mallory, the Ladies' Club held an annual dinner at the Great Central Hotel: At the first such annual dinner, on 7 December 1908, the President of the Alpine Club, Herman Woolley, spoke supportively of the new organisation and noted that ladies could make \\"ascents of the very first order\\". A former president of the Alpine Club then added that in his time he had wanted to admit women to membership, and indeed had found that a majority of other members supported this, but he had decided not to force the issue on an \\"unwilling minority\\".Ann C. Colley, Victorians in the Mountains: Sinking the Sublime (2013), p. 116 Despite this apparent rapprochement, a certain animus towards women climbers from their colleagues in the senior club remained for many years. Ellen Pigeon stated: \\"In days gone by many A.C.s refused to speak to us,\\" and one of the leading women climbers of the age, the American Fanny Bullock Workman, found male mountaineers in Britain to be less than friendly to her. In his obituary of Workman, Captain J. P. Farrar remarked: In 1921 a rival organisation called the Pinnacle Club was founded by the wives of two members of the Climbers' Club. When the British Mountaineering Council was constituted in 1945, both clubs for women, the Ladies' Alpine Club and the Pinnacle Club, were represented on its committee. Merger with Alpine Club The Alpine Club had long resisted admitting women members, and in 1973 an attempt to have this policy reversed was defeated, the necessary two-thirds majority not being achieved. In May 1974, however, another vote was held and, despite the continued opposition of the influential Bill Tilman, women were at last allowed to join the club. This made the existence of a separate women's club unnecessary, and in 1975 the Ladies' Alpine Club merged with the Alpine Club, the latter gaining 150 new members. The merger was not universally popular, and 37 women resigned in protest in 1975 or soon thereafter, including Joyce Dunsheath, Miriam Underhill and Monica Jackson. The first two women to be elected to membership of the Alpine Club in their own right were Sally Westmacott, wife of Mike Westmacott, who had been on the 1953 Everest expedition, and Betty Seifert. Ladies' Alpine Club Journal Between 1920 and 1975 the club issued a yearbook, which was absorbed into the Alpine Journal on the merger of the two clubs. Until 1960 the title of the yearbook was simply Ladies Alpine Club, then from 1961 to 1975 it was called Ladies Alpine Club Journal. All issues were indexed in 2000 by Johanna Merz, former editor of the Alpine Journal. Presidents *1907‚Äì1913: Mrs Aubrey Le Blond (1860‚Äì1934)Peter H.

The third man in the world to jump 13 feet (3.96 m), Wagoner won the United States championship in 1913. Pole vault career Wagoner won the national junior championship in 1911 with a new age-group record of 12 ft 5.64 in (3.80 m), making him also a leading contender for the senior championship, which was contested the following day. At 12 ft 3 in (3.73 m) he made what was likely the highest vault in the competition, clearing the bar by a large margin; at 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m), however, he failed on all three attempts and ended up sharing fourth place with future Olympic champion Harry Babcock. Wagoner broke the intercollegiate pole vault record in May 1912, nearly also breaking the world record. Having made 12 ft 8 in (3.86 m) to secure victory over his Yale teammate Bobby Gardner, Wagoner raised the bar to 13 ft (3.96 m), a height that no one in the world had cleared in a competition. He went over the bar faultlessly, but as the original measurement had been taken at the ends of the bar the height was remeasured at the middle, and the bar was found to sag so much the actual height was only 12 ft in (3.89 m) - still good for an intercollegiate record, but short of the world record. Gardner would become the first official 13 foot jumper the following month. Wagoner succeeded Gardner as captain of the Yale track team in 1913. He won the national pole vault championship that year, this time legitimately clearing 13 ft (3.96 m) for a new meeting record. He was only the third man to jump 13 feet, after Gardner and Marc Wright; he attempted to cap his victory by breaking Wright's world record, but failed.

Specifically, it occurs when adherents of different religions (or denominations) are treated unequally, either before the law or in institutional settings such as employment or housing. Background In the United States the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment states that \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\\". In a 1979 consultation on the issues, the United States Commission on Civil RightsU.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington D.C., April 9‚Äì10, 1979 defined religious discrimination in relation to the civil rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Whereas religious civil liberties, such as the right to hold or not to hold a religious belief, are essential for Freedom of Religion (in the United States secured by the First Amendment), religious discrimination occurs when someone is denied \\"the equal protection of the laws, equality of status under the law, equal treatment in the administration of justice, and equality of opportunity and access to employment, education, housing, public services and facilities, and public accommodation because of their exercise of their right to religious freedom.\\"U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1979: IIStokes, DaShanne. (2001). \\"Sage, Sweetgrass, and the First Amendment.\\" The Chronicle of Higher Education. May 18, 2001, sec. 2: B16. However, in 1878 the U.S. supreme court has ruled that religious duty is not a suitable defense to a criminal indictment, and that religious activates could be regulated by law.U.S. Supreme Court Reynolds v. U.S., 98 U.S. 145 (1878). Retrieved Feb 6, 2005. Notable examples =Discrimination against Catholics= =Antisemitism= =Discrimination against atheists= =Discrimination against neopagans= =Reynolds v. United States= In 1878 the U.S. supreme court, in Reynolds v. United States, ruled that a law against bigamy was not considered to be religiously discriminatory against members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), who were practicing polygamy up until 1890. George Reynolds was a member of the LDS Church, and was convicted of bigamy under the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act. He was secretary to Brigham Young and presented himself as a test of the federal government's attempt to outlaw polygamy. The Court investigated the history of religious freedom in the United States and quoted a letter from Thomas Jefferson in which he wrote that there was a distinction between religious belief and action that flowed from religious belief. The former \\"lies solely between man and his God,\\" therefore \\"the legislative powers of the government reach actions only, and not opinions.\\" The court considered that if polygamy was allowed, someone might eventually argue that human sacrifice was a necessary part of their religion, and \\"to permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.\\" The Court believed the First Amendment forbade Congress from legislating against opinion, but allowed it to legislate against action. Therefore, religious duty was not a suitable defense to a criminal indictment, religious activates could be regulated by law. =Religious tests= The No Religious Test Clause of the United States Constitution is found in Article VI, paragraph 3. This has been interpreted to mean that no federal employee, whether elected or appointed, career or political, can be required to adhere to or accept any religion or belief. However, some state and local jurisdictions have enacted legal restrictions that require a religious test as a qualification for holding public office. For instance in Texas an official may be \\"excluded from holding office\\" if he or she does not \\"acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being.\\" (i.e. God), thus atheists, agnostics, most Satanists, some Unitarian Universalists and New Age followers, who do not believe in a supreme being would be excluded from public office. =Native American religious practices= Peyote usage Peyote is listed by the United States DEA as a Schedule I controlled substance. However, practitioners of the Peyote Way Church of God, a Native American religion, perceive the regulations regarding the use of Peyote as discriminating, leading to religious discrimination issues regarding about the U.S. policy towards drugs. As the result of Peyote Way Church of God, Inc. v. Thornburgh the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 was passed. This federal statute allow the \\"Traditional Indian religious use of the peyote sacrament,\\" exempting only use by Native American persons. Other jurisdictions have similar statutory exemptions in reaction to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division v. Smith, , which held that laws prohibiting the use of peyote that do not specifically exempt religious use nevertheless do not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Eagle Feather usage The Eagle Feather Law, which governs the possession and religious use of eagle feathers, was officially written to protect then dwindling eagle populations while still protecting traditional Native American spiritual and religious customs, of which the use of eagles are central. The Eagle Feather Law later met charges of promoting racial and religious discrimination due to the law‚Äôs provision authorizing the possession of eagle feathers to members of only one ethnic group, Native Americans, and forbidding Native Americans from including non-Native Americans in indigenous customs involving eagle feathers‚Äîa common modern practice dating back to the early 16th century. =Boston University and University of South Dakota= Charges of religious and racial discrimination have also been found in the education system. In a recent example, the dormitory policies at Boston University and The University of South Dakota were charged with racial and religious discrimination when they forbade a university dormitory resident from smudging while praying. The policy at The University of South Dakota was later changed to permit students to pray while living in the university dorms. Another example concerns the Peralta Community College District which threatened to discipline two students when they prayed for a sick professor. The college later rescinded the warnings when threaten with a lawsuit.http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking- news/ci_15033286 =Church of Jesus Christ Christian= In 2004, a case involving five Ohio prison inmates (two followers of Asatru, a minister of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, a Wiccan witch and a Satanist) protesting denial of access to ceremonial items and opportunities for group worship was brought before the Supreme Court. The Boston Globe reports on the 2005 decision of Cutter v. Wilkinson in favour of the claimants as a notable case. Among the denied objects was instructions for runic writing requested by an Asatruer. Inmates of the \\"Intensive Management Unit\\" at Washington State Penitentiary who are adherents of Asatru in 2001 were deprived of their Thor's Hammer medallions.Walla Walla's Suppression of Religious Freedom In 2007, a federal judge confirmed that Asatru adherents in US prisons have the right to possess a Thor‚Äôs Hammer pendant. An inmate sued the Virginia Department of Corrections after he was denied it while members of other religions were allowed their medallions. = Merrill Lynch= Religious discrimination has also been documented in employment in the United States, such as an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) lawsuit alleging discrimination against an Iranian-Muslim employee by the Merrill Lynch company in the United States. =Cooke et al v. Colorado City, Town of et al= On March 20, 2014, a jury hearing the case of Cooke et al v. Colorado City, Town of et al ruled that the twin towns of Colorado City and Hildale had discriminated against Ronald and Jinjer Cooke because they were not members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS church). The Cooke‚Äôs were awarded $5.2 million for \\"religious discrimination\\". The Cooke family moved to the Short Creek Community in 2008 but were refused access to utilities by the town governments.

It was last assigned to the 24th School Wing, and was demobilized on 15 July 1931 at Duncan Field (Kelly Field No. 1), Texas. The unit was an early United States Army Air Service flying training group, becoming the center for Advanced Army pilot training in 1922. It was demobilized in 1931 as part of a reorganization of flying units in the San Antonio, Texas, area. History =Origins= Kelly Field, Texas, was the major Air Service facility in the United States during World War I. During the war, approximately 250,000 men were organized into aero squadrons at Kelly. Of the 23,000 who had begun preflight training during World War I, over 11,000 completed primary flying instruction, received their wings and were commissioned as 2d lieutenants before entering four weeks of advanced training either in the United States or Europe. Kelly Field graduated 1,459 pilots and 398 flying instructors during the course of the war.Maurer, Maurer (1987). Aviation in the U.S. Army, 1919‚Äì1939, Office of Air Force History, Washington, D.C. Advanced flying training during the war occurred primarily at Ellington Field, Texas, where bombing instruction was taught. Taliaferro Field, Texas, among other locations, provided reconnaissance and observation training, while pursuit (fighter) courses were restricted to the 3d Air Instructional Center, Issoudun Aerodrome, France because of a lack of necessary equipment in the United States.Manning, Thomas A. (2005), History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942‚Äì2002.

Posts, Camps and Stations. At the end of the war, the Air Service, along with the rest of the Army, faced crucial reductions and most wartime training fields were closed. Kelly, however, was one of the few that remained open. After a hiatus in training during 1919, pilot instruction resumed with both advanced pursuit and bombardment instruction being taught at Kelly, with the 1st Pursuit and 1st Day Bombardment Groups providing training in those branches of aviation. Cadets arriving at the 1st Pursuit Group in the summer of 1920 had finished primary training, but had not yet graduated from either JN-4 or JN-6 Jennies. Their advanced instruction at Kelly started with formation flying, stunting in formation, combat with camera guns, observation, elements of bombing, and elementary gunnery in JN training planes. After flying in Dayton-Wright DH-4s the students progressed to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s. =Advanced Flying School= Budget reductions and a need for better coordination of flight training brought on a major Air Service reorganization in 1922. San Antonio thereupon became the flying training center of the Air Service. In the reorganization of 1922, the Air Service opened an Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field to take over training formerly performed by the tactical units and by the Observation School at Post Field, Oklahoma. To accommodate this consolidation, the Air Corps Advanced Flying School was organized at Kelly Field Number 1, which let the tactical units operate from the main field (Kelly Field Number 2). The 10th School Group was organized on 19 July 1922 to perform duties as the headquarters for the school. Four Flying Training Squadrons (40th, 41st 42d 43d) were assigned to the group to train the students. The pursuit course taught pilots tactics; acrobatics; and fancy formation, night, and cross-country flying. They became proficient in landing on small fields, aerial gunnery, individual combat, battle maneuvers, and bomb dropping. Initially flying Curtiss Jennies for gunnery training, they were assigned to DH-4s and then to SE-5s. Training exposed them to Army paperwork and the duties of operations, armament, radio, engineering, supply, and mess officers. Running about six months, the course aimed to do more than just qualify men for the silver wings of the airplane pilot. It sought to turn out first-rate pursuit pilots who were confident, accurate flyers and excellent shots, possessing quick keen judgment. Advanced training in bombardment and observation, like that in pursuit, entailed work in classrooms and hangars as well as in the air. Students flew DH-4s and were schooled in flying, bombsights, camera obscura, gunnery, and, among other things, the history of the development of aviation. At the Observation School, students transitioned to and learned DH-4 airplanes. There were courses on formation and cross-country flying; visual and photographic reconnaissance; surveillance; intelligence; liaison with ground forces; observation and adjustment of artillery fire; map reading; meteorology; maintenance and operation of radio, telephone, and telegraph; Liberty engines; and rigging. Cadets completing advanced training were certified for appointment in the Officers' Reserve Corps. Most newly rated pilots who had enlisted as cadets took discharges and entered the Reserve Corps. Those who had been enlisted men when they entered flying training reverted to their enlisted rank and remained on duty. Under Army and Air Service regulations, enlisted men who went through pilot training and were certified for or held Reserve commissions were permitted to pilot aircraft. In fact, there were suggestions that the Air Service use more enlisted and fewer commissioned pilots, if for no other reason than to save money. Some people would go so far as to let enlisted men be pilots in tactical units, with commissioned officers serving as their flight leaders and commanders. However, the Air Service wanted all pilots to be commissioned officers as it cost the government at least $25,000 to teach a man to fly. Assuming the enlisted graduate elected to stay in the Air Corps, he had but a few years (perhaps just a few months) before he could no longer pass the physical examination for flying. An officer at this point could still serve in administrative and staff positions. But an enlisted pilot who could no longer fly was of no more use than an ordinary enlisted man. Enlisted pilots often sought more lucrative jobs available in civilian life. Their Reserve commissions also created a problem. While some Reserve officers served as enlisted men, others served as officers. Nevertheless, the Air Service always had some enlisted pilots during the 1920s. A board of officers reviewing the program suggested enlisted pilots be used chiefly as transport and ferrying pilots rather than in tactical units. The Advanced Course at Kelly originally ran eight months but later was reduced to six with two classes a year. Each student chose one of the branches of aviation (Pursuit, Bombardment, Observation). Graduates got the rating of airplane pilot. In the late 1920s, the World War I Curtiss Jennies, SE-5s and the DH-4s were phased out, and the Air Corps began ordering modifications of the Curtiss P-1 Hawk for pursuit training (AT-4, AT-5 and AT-5As). Bombardment training was performed in the Keystone B-4A, while reconnaissance and observation was taught in the Thomas-Morse O-19E and the O-39 Falcon. In 1925, Kelly Field No. 1 was renamed Duncan Field in honor of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Duncan. Formerly stationed at Kelly Field, Duncan died in an airplane accident at Bolling Field in Washington, DC. Kelly Field No. 2 became simply, Kelly Field. However, both fields conducted their training, maintenance, command, and supply functions separately for the next 18 years. The decision by the Coolidge Administration in 1926 to expand the Air Corps mainly affected the primary flying school. However, a fifth advanced training squadron (39th) was added to the group in 1927. In 1929, the 48th School Squadron was added as a sixth squadron. =Inactivation= Initially, plans were to consolidate all flying training in San Antonio at the new Randolph Field as the growth of the City of San Antonio created hazards for training. However, it was found that Randolph Field would become quite congested with only primary and basic training located there. In 1931, a reorganization of flying training in the Air Corps led to the demobilization of the 10th School Group, and its squadrons being transferred to Randolph. The advanced school at Kelly, however, remained with students being assigned directly to the school. (This changed in 1936, when students were assigned to designated squadrons (61st, 62d, 63d, 64th) instead of directly to the school).Mueller, Robert, Air Force Bases Volume I, Active Air Force Bases Within the United States of America on 17 September 1982, Office of Air Force History, 1989 = Lineage= * Organized as 10th Group Headquarters (School) on 22 June 1922 : Re-designated as 10th School Group 25 January 1923 : Demobilized on 15 July 1931Clay, Steven E.

He alternated his political activities with teaching history, first at the University of Palermo, then at the University of Messina and finally at the University of Perugia, where he was in charge of the Dipartimento di Scienze Storiche for a period in the 1980s. An upstanding man with deep democratic beliefs, he educated generations of students in the code of honour propagated by the Resistance in the 1940s: love of liberty, respect for human dignity, solidarity with the poor and the oppressed. A strong supporter of the USSR, he was also President of the Associazione Italia-URSS (1961-1970) and later a member of its governing board. He resigned from the board in 1980 as a result of the Moscow authorities' treatment of the nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov, saying \\"Non posso essere amico di chi si comporta come al tempo degli Zar\\" (I cannot be a friend of those who behave as in the time of the Tsar).The statement is reported by Piero Melograni. Cfr. the website of the Historical Archive of the Corriere della Sera He died at Rome in 1995 from an incurable disease. Historian and journalist Paolo Alatri was especially interested in Modern and Contemporary European History, with particular interest in the Eighteenth century reformists, Italian unification (which he taught at the University of Palermo) and the rise and fall of Fascism. His literary and historical studies on the life and works of Gabriele D'Annunzio are of fundamental importance, as are his philosophical studies of the leaders of the Enlightenment and of some contemporary Italian thinkers.See all of his works according to the ¬´Sistema Bibliotecario Nazionale¬ª (Italian) Among the last category is a valuable biography of Bertrando Spaventa, published at Rome in 1941The text was attributed to the pseudonymous Paolo Romano to elude the Italian Racial Laws of 1938) (his first work) and particularly appreciated by Benedetto Croce, who invited the author (then only twenty-three years old) to Naples so that he could meet him.

It was based on a 1932 novel by Gina Kaus, and made by Paramount Pictures. Mendes worked on a number of films for Paramount during the era. Shortly after making the film, he went to Britain where he directed his most celebrated film Jew S√ºss.Bock & Bergfelder p.319 Plot The steamship Germania is setting sail from Bremen to New York, with a stop in Cherbourg. Dr. Veith is annoyed that he has been assigned to be the ship's doctor, as he would rather stay home with his family. His married friend and fellow ship's officer Baron von Luden tries to flirt with the ship's nurse, Morgan, but she is not interested. Veith says Morgan seems to have no friends and never leaves the ship when it is in port. Dr. Veith meets his old friend Dr. Bernhard (George Brent), who is desperate to sail on the sold-out ship because his wife Sybil (Vivienne Osborne) is on board, running away with her lover, the financier Alex Stevanson (Frank Morgan). Veith arranges for Bernhard to take his place. To Bernhard's surprise, his wife's cabin is empty; a maid suggests that she might board at Cherbourg. Milli Lensch (Alice White), a winsome young blonde who is traveling in third class, but eager to make her way up in the world, flirts with old Edward Thorndyke (C. Aubrey Smith). Thorndyke was once a wealthy textile manufacturer, but he was ruined by Stevanson and is now seeking to start over in America. Schultz, one of Thorndyke‚Äôs former employees and now a company owner, comes down from 2nd class to invite Thorndyke (and Milli) to take tea with him tomorrow. Thorndyke turns him down, but Milli is delighted to accept. After the ship docks at Cherbourg, Bernhard goes to his wife's cabin, but she locks the door and refuses to see him. Bernhard is called away by a medical emergency before he can break the door down. Meanwhile, Stevanson is very pleased to encounter opera singer Luise Marheim (Verree Teasdale). Stevanson sends a telegram ordering the purchase of German-American Steamship shares, causing other passengers to also rush to buy the stock. When the third-class passengers want to pool their meager funds to do the same, Thorndyke reluctantly offers to handle the transaction. Milli enjoys dancing in second class, although she fails to persuade Schultz to buy her a present. When Schultz's business acquaintance, jewelry dealer Exl (Theodore von Eltz), comes along, she gets him to invite her up to first class. This disappoints an elevator operator (Barry Norton) who has fallen for her and promised to show her New York. After a fine dinner and champagne, Exl takes Milli to his cabin and tries to force himself on her in return for a diamond bracelet. She flees to the arms of her elevator operator and realizes that she prefers to be poor but honorable. After Bernhard delivers a baby, he confronts his wayward wife. She tells him she never loved him. When Stevanson tries to intervene, Bernard punches him and leaves. Stevanson then has his things moved to another suite, much to Sybil's distress. Sybil finds Stevanson dining with Luise. He tells Sybil their relationship is over and he will \\"write her a check\\" to be rid of her. In his stateroom, Sybil kills Stevanson with the pistol she stole from Bernhard's desk. Bernhard arrives moments afterwards and takes the blame. When Morgan cannot make him defend himself, she becomes greatly agitated and reveals that, five years ago, she had a husband and two children. After he left her for another woman, she tried to kill herself and her children. She was saved, but her babies died. Bernhard regrets that he did not meet her sooner. Sybil then jumps overboard, but not before leaving a note in which she admits killing Stevanson. Bernhard and Morgan decide to start a new life together as the ship pulls into New York. With Stevanson dead, the value of German-American Steamship shares plummets. The third-class passengers fear they are penniless ‚Äì until Thorndyke reveals that he never invested their money.

Mr. Mendes was evidently not inspired by the script furnished him and he fails to give more than a haphazard conception of the movement of the vessel, after the first quarter of the film. The attempt at levity is feeble and the clock-work-like manipulation of the happenings is often rather wearying.\\" He felt there were \\"one or two competent performances by the principals\\" (C. Aubrey Smith, Zita Johann and Vivienne Osborne), but thought that Frank Morgan was miscast and George Brent was \\"not at his best\\". References Bibliography * Bock, Hans-Michael & Bergfelder, Tim.

The two story house was built between 1896 and 1900, and was the summer residence of German-American conductor Theodore Thomas and his wife Rose Fay. Thomas was an influential figure in popularizing classical orchestral music in the United States during the 19th century. The house and garden were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history Felsengarten is located south of the village center of Bethlehem, at the southern end of Lewis Hill Road. It occupies a parcel about in size on a southeast-facing hillside. The house stands on a level area carved out of the hillside with a retaining wall behind it. It is a wood frame structure, with an exterior finished in wooden shingles and a foundation of local rubblestone. Stylistically the exterior is reminiscent of Dutch Colonial Revival architecture, with hip-roofed dormers on each roof face. The interior has only been modestly altered, mainly to add some electrical service and plumbing. It now houses an extensive collection of books and papers of Theodore Thomas, and the gardens laid out by him and his wife are still to be discerned in the landscape. The property was developed by Theodore and Rose Thomas between 1896 and 1900 as a summer retreat. Thomas, a German immigrant, founded the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and introduced a wide swath of the classical music repertoire to the American public. His wife, well known in Chicago society before their marriage, wrote two books about the couple's time at Felsengarten.

It had simple defences including a moat and a palisade with an enclosure to shelter the population. Owing to its location, it rapidly developed as an ideal place for surveillance of the river, exercising military and economic control. In 1411, the lord and lady of Ancenis were ordered by the authorities to cease detaining boats that passed the castle and extracting punitive tolls on their cargoes.P Mantellier, Histoire de la Communaut√© des Marchands Fr√©quentant la Rivi√®re de Loire, vol. 3, p 288-9 Orl√©ans 1869 .

Description The gatehouse, built at the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 16th century, has a unique defensive device: a drawbridge arranged in a chicane and a crooked arched gallery with a portcullis.

Its facade, on the courtyard side, has decor of the first Renaissance, while the structure of the house remains Gothic. Preservation It has been listed since 1977 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. This protection concerns the entirety of the fortifications, as well as the fa√ßades and roof of the buildings (Renaissance house, former chapel and a dwelling called \\"logis de Marie Fouquet\\"). It became the property of the town in 1986. In the 1990s, work was undertaken to demolish the 19th century chapel and the 1960s school building and to restore the gatehouse. Between 2013 and 2015, the Renaissance house was repaired, with the structure strengthened and entrances reopened.

Ruthin Gaol ceased to be a prison in 1916 when the prisoners and guards were transferred to Shrewsbury. The County Council bought the buildings in 1926 and used part of them for offices, the county archives, and the town library. During the Second World War the prison buildings were used as a munitions factory, before being handed back to the County Council, when it was the headquarters of the Denbighshire Library Service. In 2004 the Gaol was extensively renovated and reopened as a museum. History The first House of Correction, or Bridewell, was built at the bottom of Clwyd Street, next to the river, in 1654, to replace the Old Court House, where able-bodied idlers and the unemployed were sent to work. Following John Howard's investigations into prison conditions the Denbighshire justices resolved to build a new model prison in Ruthin on the site of the old Bridewell. Work began in January 1775. In 1802 the prison had four cells for prisoners and nine rooms for debtors. By 1837 it could hold 37 inmates. The Prisons Act of 1865 set new standards for the design of prisons -- as the Ruthin County Gaol did not meet the standards plans were drawn up for a new four-storey wing, and the new prison accommodating up to 100 prisoners, in the style of London's Pentonville Prison was built at a cost of ¬£12,000. On 1 April 1878 the Ruthin County Gaol became HM Prison Ruthin, covering the counties of Denbighshire, Flintshire, and Merionethshire. As far as is known, only one person was ever executed in the prison, William Hughes of Denbigh, aged 42, who was hanged on 17 February 1903 for the murder of his wife, his plea of insanity having failed. Another colourful prison personality was John Jones, known as Coch Bach y Bala - who was a kleptomaniac and poacher who had spent more than half his 60 years in all the prisons of north Wales and many in England; he twice escaped from Ruthin Gaol, first on 30 November 1879 when he walked out of prison with three others while the staff were having supper -- a ¬£5 reward was offered for his capture, which happened the following 3 January. On 30 September 1913 he tunnelled out of his cell and using a rope made out of his bedding he climbed over the roof of the chapel and kitchen and got over the wall; after seven days living rough on the Nantclwyd Estate several miles away, Jones was shot in the leg by one of his pursuers, 19-year-old Reginald Jones-Bateman. Jones died of shock and blood loss, while Jones-Bateman was charged with manslaughter, though the charges were subsequently dropped.

It was the royal lane where members of the Rohilla royalty and nobility lived during the Rohilkhand empire. The palatial houses were subdivided into smaller houses over the years. Most of the Rohillas lived on Gali Nawaban at the independence of Pakistan when some migrated to Pakistan. Gali Nawaban is still inhabited by many Rohilla families and also members of other communities. Rohillas Rohilkhand was ruled by Rohillas with their capital in City of Bareilly until their defeat in Rohilla War of 1774‚Äì75. Rohillas took active part during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The rebellion began as a mutiny of native soldiers (sepoys) employed by the British East India Company's army against race- and religion-based injustices and inequities, on 10 May 1857. After the failure of rebellion many Rohillas were lost their lands and some were exiled. When the rebellion failed, Bareilly was subjugated. Khan Bahadur Khan was sentenced to death and hanged in the Kotwali on 24 February 1860. Many urban cities in Uttar Pradesh were experiencing economic stagnation and poverty. After the failure of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 many Rohilla Muslim Pathans from Bareilly and surrounding cities migrated to Dutch South American Colonies, now Surinam and Guyana, as indentured labour.HISTORY OF MY PEOPLE: The Afghan Muslims of Guyana While a majority of Rohillas remained landowners and cultivators, a significant minority were also taking to western education, and entering profession such as the law and medicine. They also began to take an interest in the political debates of the last decade of the 19th Century, with some joining the newly formed Indian National Congress, while others were being attracted to pan- Islamism. This period also saw a wholesale adoption of North Indian Muslim culture, with Urdu becoming the native language of the Rohilla. In fact the term of Rohilla was being replaced with the term Pathan, which was the new self-identification. But a sense of distinct identity remained strong, with the Rohillas occupying distinct quarters in the cities, such as Gali Nawaban (home to the descendants of Hafiz Rahmat Khan), Kakar Tola and Pani Tola, in Bareilly. The intermarriage with neighbouring Muslim communities such as the Shaikh, Muslim Rajput and Kamboh started after the failure of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

The modest two-story brick building, now a private residence, was built in 1816 by Ira Goodall, and is an unusual local example of Federal architecture. It is particularly distinctive for its two-story rounded bay, which projects from the front (street facade). The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The former Goodall-Woods Law Office building is located in Bath's Upper Village, on the east side of US 302. It is a small 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a gabled roof set perpendicular to the road. Its street facade is a single bay wide, consisting of a rounded projection housing two windows on each floor. It is topped by a semi-conical roof that has a wooden balustrade, and there is a brick chimney sandwiched between the projection and the main block. The main block is three bays deep, with the main entrance in the rightmost bay on the north side, slightly askew from a symmetrical placement. It is topped by a half-round transom window with a granite keystone at the top. Ground-floor windows are set in rectangular openings with stone lintels, while the upper-floor windows are butted against the roof eave at the top. The structure was built in 1816 by Ira Goodall. At the time of its National Register listing in 1980, most of the distinctive front bay's brickwork and mortar were original, as were the decorative woodwork elements, which were carved to fit its curve. The bricks for the house were locally made, and those for the rounded section were custom-moulded for the purpose.

He won the 2007 Gilbert H. Cady Award from the Geological Society of America for outstanding contributions to coal geology. He is widely regarded an expert on wildfire and charcoal and has highlighted the role of fire in deep time. He also contributes as a palaeobotanist and science communicator. Scott was educated at Cannon Lane Primary School, (Pinner); St. Martins School, Northwood; Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood; and the University of London, where he obtained a B.Sc. (Bedford College) and a Ph.D. (Birkbeck College) studying under William Gilbert Chaloner. His thesis concerned the palaeoecology of Carboniferous Coal Measure plants. After a 2-year post-doctoral fellowship at Trinity College, Dublin, he returned to England to take up a lectureship in Geology at Chelsea College, University of London. During this period, his research concentrated on the Lower Carboniferous floras of Scotland including those from the Pettycur Volcanics and the East Kirkton Quarry. In 1985, the geology departments at Chelsea College and Bedford College merged to form a new department at Royal Holloway, University of London. He was awarded a personal chair in 1996, becoming Professor of Applied Palaeobotany. During the 1990s, he worked on Drawings and Prints in the Royal Library that had been collected by Cassiano dal Pozzo. These were part of a project undertaken by Federico Cesi and Francesco Stelluti, founders of the Accademia dei Linceii. His book on the drawing of fossil woods was launched by Charles, Prince of Wales at Windsor Castle in 2005. From 1998 to 2006, he was the Director of Science Communication.

It is a co-educational school where pupils of all religious denominations study together. As is the case with all community schools, a board of management, answerable to the school's trustees and to the Minister for Education, manages the school. The board is composed of two teacher representatives, two parent representatives, six nominees from the trustees and the principal, who is secretary to the board of management. As of 7 October 2015, the school has approximately 738 students enrolled in its classes. The school has recently finished construction on a new building that is used alongside the prior building. Overview ACS has a wide array of subjects for students to choose from. Leaving Cert students may study: Accounting, Art, Biology, Business, Chemistry, Construction Studies, Economics, English, Engineering, French, Geography, German, Home Economics, History, Health Education, Irish, Mathematics, Music, Physical Education, Religious Education and Technical Drawing. The school is staffed with Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) who provide assistance to students with additional needs. History Ardee Community School was established in 1974 and was the first community school outside the Greater Dublin area. It aims to fulfil the secondary educational needs of Ardee and its surrounding areas. The school was founded as an amalgamation of three schools which had previously existed independently: St Anne‚Äôs Convent of Mercy, De La Salle Brothers‚Äô School and the Vocational School. Many of the teachers who worked in one of the three schools continued their work in Ardee Community School.  Sport  ACS encourages students to participate in Gaelic football, soccer, rugby, golf, basketball and athletics. Selected sporting highlights from 2012-14 included: = Lennon Cup = In 2012, the Senior Gaelic football team, under the guidance of Mark Gilsenan, a Maths teacher in ACS, won the Lennon cup for the first time, defeating St. Mary's of Drogheda on a scoreline of 4-11 to 0-7. The following year, Ardee made it back to the Lennon cup victorious once again, defeating The Marist of Dundalk in a replay. The school was not as success in the following years however, it wasn't until 2017 that Ardee CS claimed the Lennon Cup after three attempts, edging out St Josephs Secondary School on a scoreline of 0-13 to 1-09. = All-Ireland 'C' Championship = In 2014, the Senior Gaelic team at the time reached the All Ireland 'C' final, this team included Louth player Ryan Burns, though they were defeated by Col√°iste Ghobnatan of Cork on a scoreline of 1-12 to 2-6. Four years later, after two new senior team squads, the Senior Gaelic team achieved success at a national level by beating St Declan's Community College from Waterford in Newbridge on Easter Saturday in 2018, they were crowned All-Ireland Schools 'C' Championship winners, beating St. Declan's CS from Waterford 1-9 to 0-3 at Newbridge.

The area now known as Lake Jodeco was once inhabited by the Muskogee Creek Nation. History Prior to the end of World War II, the Lake Jodeco area was rural farm land connected to the City of Jonesboro by a one-lane dirt road. In the lowland of this farming area was a small mill pond with a crude earthen dam. Dr. Walter Spivey (who was born on a farm in North Carolina and attended what is now Duke University) was a practicing dentist in Atlanta. One of Dr. Spivey‚Äôs patients, the Sheriff of Clayton County, W. Loy Dixon (brother of Jonesboro‚Äôs late Mayor Hugh Dickson) sold Dr. and Mrs. Spivey 800 acres just five miles east of Jonesboro which they intended to farm and eventually develop. A tenant house stood on the piece of property which is now the corner of Jodeco Road and Jodeco Drive. The lake itself was created in 1947. Its name was derived out of the Jonesboro Development Corporation, an organization formed by Dr. Spivey and several associates. Lake Jodeco sits adjacent to the much larger Lake Spivey. Lake Jodeco was the first of the two lakes created by Dr. Spivey. The two lakes are separated by Jodeco Road which sits on a causeway and a small bridge. Outflows from Lake Jodeco enter Lake Spivey at the bridge. The outflows continue over the Lake Spivey dam spillway and into Rum Creek in Henry County, Georgia. Ownership A boat dock on Lake Jodeco The Lake Jodeco Homeowners Association was formed in 1969. In 1975 the deed to Lake Jodeco was transferred to the association, which owns and maintains the lake today. Members of the homeowners association enjoy fishing, kayaking and cruising on pontoon boats. Jet-skis and speed boats are not permitted on the lake. There are no marinas or common docks. Boaters are limited to speeds of 5-mph or less. Recreation In 2008 the Lake Spivey Road Race was created to promote the neighborhoods around the lakes. The annual foot race, which takes place in November, features a 5K and 15K course. Participants on the 15K course run the circumference of Lake Spivey and Lake Jodeco. Both courses are USA Track & Field (USATF) certified and provide a challenge to runners as the topography is quite hilly. The USATF course numbers are GA09021WC for the 5k and GA08011WC for the 15K.

The episode was written by Brett Mahoney and directed by Marcos Siega. Summary A flashback shows Claire Matthews in the hospital with Mike Weston as he and Scott Turner tell Claire that the only way to keep her safe is to lead everyone to believe she died, including Ryan Hardy, though she feels she has to tell Ryan the truth. Back in present day, Weston fills Claire in on everything that has gone on in the past year. Claire wants to kill Joe Carroll and insists on joining Weston in helping find Joe, but he advises her to stay in protection. Robert brings Joe and Emma to meet up with Korban members that wish to help as Joe's messengers. He later meets with a bigger group of Korban members to spread some of his ideas and drill in his message of \\"no redemption without blood.\\" Agent Clarke brings Ryan to talk to Dr. Strauss, who's in custody. Strauss says he has no involvement with Lance but says Ryan is essentially a follower of Joe due to his obsession. Ryan calls Carrie Cooke and says he'd like to go on the record about the case. During her next TV broadcast, she announces that Strauss has been captured by the FBI and is fully cooperating. This brings Joe to call Jana. When he calls, Ryan answers and the FBI attempts to track Joe's phone to find a location, but they're unable to. A flashback shows Joe when he was a student of Strauss'. Strauss says he understands that Joe was sent to America by his uncle after his parents both died in England. Strauss later brings Joe to a lab where a dead woman's body lies on a table as he continues mentoring Joe. The group of Korban members sent as messengers (Robert, Mallory, Lucas, Patrick, and Tilda) gather on a street sidewalk. Tilda selects a random man across the street to be the victim as Lucas proceeds to stab him while whispering \\"no redemption without blood\\" and places a piece of paper with that phase on his clothes. The group next goes to a house where they select a family after seeing the father outside with a dog. They kill the father, his wife and their son and write the phrase on the wall in blood. Police and FBI later show up and determine the murders were done at random. Back at Korban, Joe strangles a cat in front of another group of Korban members as he further explains his ideas. Joe allows anybody feeling uncomfortable to go off and take some time to think after a member, Carla, says that killing is not \\"their ways.\\" Mandy joins that group as they leave. Later, Emma finds Mandy and tells her that everyone who walked out was put into Korban's underground cell, but Mandy was spared as Joe instructed them to give her another chance. Mandy confronts Emma, believing her to be jealous over Joe thinking she's special. The two separate after a brief argument. Mallory and Patrick go to the restaurant that Mallory was previously fired from and Mallory picks her victim. Max tells Ryan that FBI facial recognition identified Mallory. Ryan pieces together an earlier clue from Joe goes with Weston to the restaurant. Mallory follows her target to the bathroom and pulls her knife, but the woman fights back and runs out of the bathroom only to be grabbed by Patrick and held hostage as the FBI and police raid the restaurant. Ryan tries convincing Mallory to give up information on where Joe is. She drops her knife but Patrick gives up the hostage and slits Mallory's throat before she's able to give any information away. Patrick is then shot dead. Back at Korban, Joe anoints Tilda and Lucas after they return from their mission by slitting his arm and smearing his blood on their foreheads. Carrie shows up at Ryan's apartment and tries to convince Ryan that he saved people at the restaurant and also showed her a bit of trust before the two fool around in Ryan's bed. Claire tells Scott Turner that she's not going to Arizona, where witness protection wants to move her, because she wants to see Ryan Hardy. Reception =Critical response= Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club rated the episode a D, saying \\"It‚Äôs the subtext of the show that makes my skin crawl.\\" Dan Hajducky of Den of Geek gave the episode another positive review, saying \\"This week‚Äôs episode sends the rapidly evolving plot flying forward, while also giving us the long-awaited origin story of Joe Carroll.\\" Another positive review came from Mark Trammell of TV Equals. stating about the plot \\"we saw how being a cult leader of a religious sect maybe wasn‚Äôt as far off the mark as one might think.\\" =Ratings= The episode received the largest post air-date 18‚Äì49 rating percent increase from DVR viewings, bringing the ratings up 88% compared to the shows it competed with on its premiere night.

Hollands played college baseball for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos, where he earned a degree in sociology. The Phillies drafted him in the 2010 MLB Draft, and after a few seasons in their farm system, they invited him to spring training, in 2014. After performing well in those exhibition games, he made the Phillies' 2014 Opening Day roster, and although he walked too many hitters, showed some potential to emerge as a decent relief pitcher. His teammates described him as a good personality to have in the bullpen, and his coaches approved of his development. Hollands, meanwhile, continued to further his college education, pursuing yet another degree, this time, studying merchandise marketing, at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. Early life Hollands attended El Cerrito High School in El Cerrito, California, where he played for the school's baseball team as a pitcher. He then enrolled at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), where he played college baseball for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos baseball team. After redshirting his first season, he was named the Big West Conference freshman of the year and received placement on the national freshman All-American team in 2008. His sophomore season was less successful, and was hampered by a groin injury. The Minnesota Twins drafted him in the subsequent draft, but he did not sign. He focused on bulking up and improving the velocity of his fastball, which gained about thanks to his work. In college, his coaches praised his mental toughness, a key to being a good pitcher. In 2008, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Cotuit Kettleers, and returned to the CCBL in 2009 to play for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. Hollands went on to have a strong senior season, during which he \\"was twice named the Big West Pitcher of the Week, twice named the National Pitcher of the Year, and tied a school record with a 16 strikeout performance.\\" He graduated from UCSB with a degree in sociology. The Philadelphia Phillies selected Hollands in the tenth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft. Professional career =Minor league career= Hollands pitched for the Lakewood BlueClaws of the Class A South Atlantic League in 2011, and then pitched for Lakewood, the Clearwater Threshers of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, the Reading Phillies of the Class AA Eastern League, and the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the Class AAA International League in 2012. Essentially, Hollands pitched for \\"whatever minor-league team required pitching help\\", which in one case required him to sleep on the living room floor of a shared apartment. Late in the season in Lehigh Valley, he compiled a 9.24 earned run average (ERA) in three starts, and possessed a fastball that reached only , prompting Rod Nichols, then Lehigh Valley's pitching coach, and subsequently the Phillies' bullpen coach, to praise Hollands' work ethic, but opine that his pitching repertoire was insufficiently effective. He had a solid 2013 season with Clearwater and Reading, recording a 1.56 ERA in 14 games for Clearwater between May 3 and July 10, and then a 4.06 ERA after being promoted to Reading. He then pitched for the Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Winter League after the season, recording a 2.45 ERA. Phillies' officials credited that experience in Venezuelan winner ball as the impetus for his subsequent success. Hollands commented, \\"I've just gotten better,\\" while Nichols commented, \\"He found it.\\" =Major league career= The Phillies invited Hollands to spring training in 2014. He made the team's Opening Day roster after compiling a 3.09 ERA in nine exhibition appearances. His performance in spring training left Phillies' manager Ryne Sandberg and pitching coach Bob McClure \\"smitten,\\" especially considering the fact that he entered spring training as a \\"veritable unknown.\\" He made his major league debut on April 1, coming into the ninth inning of a tied game. Hollands allowed two walks, before being relieved by B. J. Rosenberg, who allowed an inherited runner to score. Hollands received the loss. As the season progressed, Hollands was rather streaky, seeing some success in May and June, but experiencing a stretch in July during which he retired only seven of 19 batters, and surrendered six runs. He walked 10.3% of batters he faced. Ryan Sommers of Crashburn Alley commented, Overall, Hollands pitched 50 games, and compiled a 4.40 ERA with a 2‚Äì2 record. As spring training 2015 began, Hollands noted that he was not taking a spot in the bullpen for granted, and that he expected to compete with several other lefties. During spring training, he strained the common flexor tendon in his throwing arm. He underwent Tommy John surgery in April, and missed the 2015 season. After completing a rehabilitation assignment, the Phillies optioned Hollands to Lehigh Valley on June 2, 2016. He was released on May 20, 2017.http://www.baseballamerica.com/minors/minor-league-transactions- may-20-28/#rqJEJEQPxPufwZLs.97 Personal life Cognizant that there is \\"life after baseball\\", in 2013, Hollands enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising to earn a degree merchandise marketing. He notes that fashion has permeated his life; he grew up in the Bay Area of California, where fashion is \\"everywhere and a part of everyone's life in some way or another\\", and worked at an Abercrombie & Fitch store while in high school. He also frequently counsels his teammates on appropriate fashion choices. Fellow reliever Jake Diekman characterized Hollands as having a \\"really good personality for the bullpen ... I don't know, he just hangs out, he's probably the most chill human being I have ever met in my life.\\" He has even instructed fellow relievers on techniques for folding shirts. Despite earning during his first season, Hollands takes the subway to Citizens Bank Park for Phillies' games. While on the subway, he applies his degree in sociology by studying Philadelphians and their mannerisms. Player profile A \\"funky\\" lefty who \\"throws hard and looks deceptive,\\" Hollands' fastball hovers around but can modestly exceed that at times, a drastic increase from his velocity while pitching in the minor leagues, and a primary reason for his emergence on the Phillies' major league pitching staff. Secondarily, he throws a slider, that \\"at its peak, can be impressive\\". At times, he struggles with his control, and issues walks with relative frequency, but as a young pitcher, shows potential to develop if he can avoid nibbling, and focus on directly attacking hitters with better command of his pitches within the strike zone.

AaR represents certain quantile for a given probability distribution, so is similar to Value at Risk (VaR). But, AaR measures risk amount as time (time until an adverse event) rather than value (loss amount). Age at Risk is a special case of Time at Risk (TaR). When TaR is applied to a household's financial planning rather than corporate finance, TaR in this case is referred to as AaR. In fact, TaR is an expanded idea from AaR which is originated by actuaries. In actuaries's view, loss model and survival model are identical, so they could naturally transform VaR into time- based measure. Survival model is actively used in life insurance modeling, but the application is not limited to this area. Anything that has lifespan can be a subject of survival model; for example, durability of products, default of bonds, bankruptcy of companies etc. AaR had been used in models that include a person's lifetime as a random variable, and it was naturally expanded to TaR as actuaries generalized subjects of models.

History  In the 11th century, the castle belonged to the family of Zacharie de Pouzauges, from who it passed it to the enigmatic Chantemerle family and then to the famous Savary family of Maul√©on and finally to the Viscounts of Thouars, who administered nearly the whole of Vend√©e; they gave the castle to a cadet son who also owned Tiffauges. Catherine de Thouars brought the castle into the possession of Gilles de Rais thanks to their marriage. She was going to live there after his death. Under the aegis of Catherine, the keep underwent many alterations to make it more comfortable as a residence. A new floor was added as well as a spiral staircase linking it to all the others. Several windows were made, replacing the older arrowslits, to give more light to the interior. The castle was sold in 1634 to the lord of La P√©lissonni√®re au Boup√®re. His descendants kept it until the mid-20th century. During the War in the Vend√©e (1793-1794), the men of the \\"infernal columns\\" commanded by General Lachenay shot 31 inhabitants of Pouzauges who had taken refuge in the enceinte of the old castle. This act was committed on 26 January 1794 at the end of a banquet offered by the republican to General Grignon. On the same day, the surrounding villages were burnt and a number of inhabitants were massacred.  Architecture  The castle ruins are dominated by its majestic 12th century keep. The keep, more than 25 metres high, is one of twelve towers that make the curtain wall, offering visitors a fine example of civil Romanesque architecture. It has been listed since 1862 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

Background Cangamba is an Angolan town in the province of Moxico. It was garrisoned by soldiers of FAPLA's 32 Brigade and forty to sixty Cuban instructors and due to the conditions of the roads in the region, was supplied by air from Menongue. During late July, UNITA had briefly raided the town but FAPLA failed to strengthen its defences. UNITA sought the help of the SADF for mortar and artillery training as well as fire support in the next attack against Cangamba. A SADF artillery team was formed and flown to a secret special forces base in the Caprivi where they met to train the UNITA artillerymen in captured Soviet 120 mm mortars and 76 mm artillery before moving northwards into Angola. Battle UNITA attacked on 1 August with between 3000 and 6000 soldiers with the SADF team assisting the next day with artillery observation. The FAPLA troops in Cangamba called for reinforcements which were assembled in Huambo, Menongue and Lubango but would take a week to cross UNITA territory to reach the garrison. The FAPLA garrison was bombarded by UNITA artillery for three days before attempting frontal assaults which incurred high casualties. UNITA then resorted to digging trenches driving them closer to the Angolan positions. The UNITA artillery attack continued and by the 7 August the FAPLA and Cuban troops were short of ammunition and water. By this time the UNITA troops were being subjected to FAPLA/Cuban air attacks and took casualties. On the 10 August, the FAPLA relief columns arrived covered by a FAPLA/Cuban air strike on UNITA positions. The Cuban troop were said to be airlifted out while garrison and relief columns had to fight their way out. Two days after the relief columns arrived, the South African Air Force (SAAF) was called in on 12 August to assist UNITA. Canberra bombers and Impala aircraft were used to flatten the town and by 14 August the battle was over.

Flatbed truck carburetor GAZ-3307 is announced in late 1989, and a turbodiesel truck GAZ-3309 - the end of 1994. GAZ-3307 replaces the third-generation family GAZ-52/53 which completely eradicated from the conveyor to the beginning of 1993. Trucks GAZ-3307 and GAZ-3309 4.5 tons carrying capacity are designed for use on all types of paved roads. In the fourth family truck GAZ also included 5-ton diesel truck GAZ-4301 (1984-1995) and 3-ton diesel truck GAZ-3306 (1993-1995). Since 1999 a 2-/2,3-ton all terrain truck GAZ Sadko (4√ó4) is available with single rear axle and busbar system of centralized control of air pressure in the tires, and since 2005, 4-ton truck terrain GAZ-33086 \\"Zemlyak\\" with busbar gable rear axle.

In 1992, the GAZ deployed mass production 5-ton truck GAZ-4301 6-cylinder air-cooled diesel engine GAZ-542 125 hp, manufactured under license from the German company Deutz AG, as well as agricultural truck GAZ-SAZ-4509 on its chassis for operation in the 8.6-tonne tipper lorry convoy GAZ-6008 (truck GAZ-4509 + trailer GKB-8536). With significant structural differences, such as wheels for models 3307 and 4301 are not interchangeable, cars are almost identical in appearance. GAZ-4301 production continued until 1995. Total produced 28,158 trucks of GAZ-4301. In 1993 he started to produce replacement model GAZ-52 - 3-ton truck GAZ-3306 4-cylinder air-cooled diesel engine GAZ-544 85 hp According to some sources in 1992 was released in a limited edition 2.5 ton modification 33061 with carburetor engine from GAZ-52. Production of three-ton GAZ-3306 (mainly in the performance of \\"Cargo Taxi\\") continued until 1995. In late 1994, with the development of the four issue at GAZ diesel turbo air cooling GAZ-5441 115 hp, a model GAZ-3309 carrying capacity 4,5 t, completely unified on the chassis and cab with GAZ-3307 (only looks different engine air intake pipe on the left side of the cab). By mid-1996, it completely replaced with a conveyor truck carburetor 3307. In mid-1997 its own production of diesel \\" air-vent \\" at GAZ was considered uneconomical, resulting in release of the model 3309 has been suspended until the end of 2001, and was restored in the production of 4,5-thin carburetor GAZ-3307. Subsequently, gas switched to purchase Belarusian diesels MMZ D-245.7 (similar turbo water cooling installed on ZiL-5301 \\"Bull\\") Minsk Motor Plant (MMZ), which is installed in the production resumed in 3309 model. Since 1999, the 4th family truck GAZ serially produced four-wheel drive (4√ó4) car GAZ Sadko in the army (capacity 2 tons) and civil (2.3 m) versions. With 2006 GAZ-3307, GAZ-3309 and GAZ-3308 installed petrol and diesel engines certified for environmental standards Euro-2, and since 2008 Euro-3. Large scale production of 3307 and 3308 models with petrol engines ZMZ actually was discontinued in 2009, but some time maintained their limited production under certified for government agencies spetsversii (for example, in 2010 produced 406 units GAZ-3307). Carburettor models 3307 also continue to export, for example, in Belarus, where it was equipped with HBO. In 2010-2012, medium-duty trucks GAZ (4√ó2) diesel engine was fitted with a predominantly MMZ D-245.7 E-3 (model 3309), and all-wheel drive (4√ó4) Model 33081 \\"Sadko\\" and 33086 \\"Countryman\\" - diesel engine MMZ D-245.7 E-2. Since 2013, all trucks GAZ 4- generation civil received as the base engine turbo MMZ D-245.7 E-4 power 119 hp Since 2012, under the order are modified GAZ-33096 with diesel Cummins ISF 3.8L, as used by the truck GAZ- 3310 \\"Valdai\\". Since 2013 the engine has been certified under the Euro-4. In February 2013 a series went modification GAZ-33098 with a new Russian-made diesel engine - 5342.10 YaMZ - class Euro-4, as well as a new version of the truck, all-terrain vehicle GAZ-33088 \\"Sadko\\" with the same engine YaMZ-5344-96 ECE class.

Such scares have been promoted for decades but have become more popular with the advent of the Internet. They may be based on a misinterpretation of scientific studies, or, as has happened more recently, complete fabrication. This page lists widely reported media stories about how some good or product may have a certain adverse health effect, regardless of whether subsequent research confirmed the proposed link, debunked it, or has been inconclusive. MMR vaccine controversy In 1998, a paper, of which Andrew Wakefield was the lead author, was published in The Lancet suggesting that the MMR vaccine might cause autism. Since then, many epidemiological studies have refuted this hypothesis, and Wakefield has been found guilty of scientific fraud. The vaccine-autism link, since it has led to declining vaccination rates and, in turn, epidemics and deaths of vaccine- preventable diseases, has been called the \\"most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years.\\" Aspartame controversy In 1998 an email began circulating claiming that aspartame, an artificial sweetener, caused many chronic diseases, including multiple sclerosis and lupus. The email was attributed to \\"Nancy Markle\\" and cited sources such as the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation and the World Environmental Conference. However, although it appears credible, the claims made in the email are a complete fabrication, and statements about the toxicity of methanol produced by aspartame metabolism rely on ignoring the small amounts produced by this process. Cancer-causing shampoo Some types of shampoo contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) as a foaming agent. Also in the late 1990s, many websites claimed that this ingredient could, at the doses found in shampoo, cause cancer. However, according to the American Cancer Society, SLS is an irritant, not a carcinogen, and according to David Emery of About.com, this claim is promoted primarily by makers of all-natural personal care products. Swine flu pandemic The mainstream media portrayed the so- called \\"swine flu\\" outbreak as a serious threat, with the then U.S. Vice President Joe Biden going so far as to advise people against confined spaces, such as airplanes, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it a pandemic in June of that year. The flu itself was responsible for about 18,500 deaths, according to the WHO's estimate, which they described as \\"almost surely underreported.\\" Nevertheless, this figure was far lower than the number of annual deaths believed to be caused by ordinary flu strains. However, Vanderbilt University Medical Center's William Schaffner stated that the capacity of the center was \\"stretched\\" as a result of the outbreak. Dangers of power lines The hypothesis of a link between proximity to power lines and leukemia was first raised in 1979 when a study was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. The study contended that children living in homes in close proximity to \\"an excess of electrical wiring configurations\\" were more likely to develop cancer. The ensuing public controversy has been described by John W. Farley as a health scare, and has said that there is \\"nothing to worry about\\" with regard to the proposed link between power lines and cancer. Although, in 1996, the United States National Research Council concluded that \\"the current body of evidence does not show that exposure to these fields presents a human-health hazard,\\" some studies have reported an association between the two, e.g., for myeloid leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cell phones and cancer The hypothesized link between cell phone use and an increased risk of cancer is based on the fact that these phones emit radio waves, a form of non-ionizing radiation. Since the proposal was first made many studies have been published on the topic. According to the World Health Organization, the results have been \\"mixed\\" with regard specifically to glioma and acoustic neuroma; thus, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified cell phones as group 2B carcinogens, meaning they are \\"possibly carcinogenic.\\" However, given the considerable amount of fear regarding the alleged link, some commentators have described the link as a health scare, regardless of whether or not mobile phone use actually does cause cancer. Nitrites and cancer Nitrites are compounds found in processed meat, which have been implicated in causing cancer because they can be converted into nitrosamines in the body, and because of a 1970 study linking nitrosamines to cancer in rats. Additional support to this hypothesis came from a 1979 study in Science that has since been discredited. Critics of the hypothesized nitrites-cancer link argue that the amount of nitrite produced by the human body is far greater than the amount consumed through processed meat. Others, such as the World Cancer Research Fund, disagree, saying that people should limit their consumption of processed meat because \\"Dietary nitrates and nitrites are probable human carcinogens because they are converted in the body to N-nitroso compounds.\\"Processed meat, nitrites and human health References Category:Health-related lists ","title":"List of health scares"},{"id":"42305425","title":"Tenerife Sea"},{"id":"42305452","text":"The 1897 Yale Bulldogs football team represented Yale University in the 1897 college football season.

He was the founding member of Gamma USA and Sygma, the largest photography agency in the world, which in 1999 was acquired by the Corbis Corporation.  Biography  Born in Algeria in 1935, Laffont attended high school and college in Morocco, where he graduated in 1955. In 1959, he received his Master's Degree in Photography from Europe's prestigious School of Arts et Metiers in Vevey, Switzerland. In 1960, Laffont graduated from Military Infantry Academy, in Cherchell (Algeria), where he was a Press Officer, and then proceeded to serve in the French Army as a Commanding Officer in the Oran region in the Algeria War throughout April 1962. He then returned to Paris, where, from 1962 to 1964, he began assisting photographers Sam Levin and Choura, renowned for their photographs of celebrities and movie stars. It was in this period of time that Laffont started to work in portraiture and fashion photography, and was hired as special photographer on movie sets for MGM in Rome. In 1965, he arrived in the United States and began his career as a photojournalist, and worked as a staff photographer for Status Magazine. In 1966, he married Eliane Lucotte and in 1970 they had a daughter, Stephanie, born in Nice (France), who is now a professional artist living in New York City. Laffont then became the first Foreign Correspondent for Gamma Press Images, and in 1970, with his wife Eliane Laffont, opened the U.S. office of Gamma Press Images agency. Laffont covered historical American events, such as the Civil Rights Movement, the Race Riots, the Vietnam War, the peace movement, as well as the gay and feminist movement. In 1973, Laffont was one of the co-founders of the Sygma Photo News agency. His work expanded to the coverage of international events in Japan, Korea, Africa, India, China, the Middle East, Poland and the U.S.S.R. During those years, deeply touched by the suffering endured by children, he, from 1970-1980, made a major reportage on child labor throughout the world. The photographs he brought back from those countries were the first global photo essay on child labor and the most eloquent and cruel testimonials. Jean-Pierre has won the most prestigious awards in photojournalism for this series, including the Overseas Press Club's Madeline Dane Ross Award and first prize in the World Press General Picture category. During the 80's, still photographing around the world, his work particularly focused on the U.S agricultural crisis, scientific research and world economy, mostly in Eastern Europe, the USSR, China, India and Third World countries. His photographs have been featured in major publications worldwide: Time, Newsweek, The New York Times, Paris Match, Le Figaro Magazine, Stern, Bunte, √âpoca, The Sunday Times in London and Manchete, his work has also gained high recognition through numerous awards. In 1999, Corbis acquired Sygma and Jean-Pierre Laffont was appointed General Director of Corbis Sygma in the U.S. In 2000, he left Corbis and was hired by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. as General Manager of Gamma Press USA.

The Baltimore Jewish Times, accessed Jan. 23 2014, URL - http://jewishtimes.com/review-well-done/#.UuE4F2T8Ib0 The book combines the gravity of adult issues such as the pursuit of well-being and self- actualization with the levity of a picture book and the disinhibition of a child.  Origins  According to the author, \\"The Well of Being is a pictorial narrative and my first book. The book took a few turns before I learned where it was headed. I thought I was writing a pictorial adventure about T. S. Eliot‚Äôs famous Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. I had drawn illustrations of Mr. Prufrock muttering tedious arguments to himself as he visited a museum or walked along muddled half deserted streets. I cataloged his (and my) dark moods - his confusion and longings and ennui, and his states of victimhood. I then decided to expand the repertoire of watercolors to include my positive states of mind, my moments of contentment and joy. Traces of Eliot‚Äôs poem all but disappeared as I discovered the book‚Äôs true purpose: to guide modernist Everyman - and along with him, myself - to the wellbeing he longs for, dimly remembers yet no longer believes in.\\"Neshoma Network, accessed Jan. 23 2014, URL - http://www.neshomanetwork.com/weofbebyjewe.html  Plot  The story is a running duality, exploring the formations of universal order and of individual identity.The Times of Israel, accessed Jan. 23 2014, URL - http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-well-of-being-a-childrens- book-for-adults/ The story told is at once personal and universal, literal and allegorical. Commenting on this duality, Kirkus Reviews notes that \\"readers may feel encouraged to read their own life experiences into these stark images, using Weill‚Äôs paintings like spiritual Rorschach blots. What wisdom or reassurance they draw from such an exercise will depend on what they put into it.\\"Kirkus Reviews, accessed Jan. 23 2014, URL - https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jean-pierre-weill/the-well-of- being/ Spiritual themes and religious myths are creatively interlaid with the plot to give the book a distinct historico-cultural dimension. The story may be seen as much as a modern retelling of human history and tradition as it is an argument for its reconditioning. Starting with the first cause and moving to the Big Bang, the book covers evolution before settling on its primary subjects of human psychology, fortune, and freewill. These subjects are explored through stories and reflections from the author's own life.Kickstarter Video, accessed Jan. 23 2014, URL - https://d2pq0u4uni88oo.cloudfront.net/projects/552943/video-287040-h264_high.mp4 The plot picks up in the Garden of Eden, a symbol of childhood security and well-being from which we are all eventually evicted. This is where the reader is introduced to the protagonist, a faceless man revisiting his original sin, his childhood fall from grace that proved to be an enduringly formative experience. The story around which the rest of the book pivots is that of the faceless little boy who, taken by a fit of creative expression, decides to adorn his bedroom wall with a scenic mural.The Well of Being (sample), accessed Jan. 23 2014, URL - http://thewellofbeing.co/book_sample.html After completing the painting, the boy waits with pride for his mother's surprise and adulation. Instead of approval the boy's creation is met with fury. This, the reader learns, is when the protagonist first perceived that he was flawed and inadequate; deep within him, it seemed, laid mischief and wrong thinking. The focus of the book then shifts back to the fully grown faceless man and his struggle for emotional homeostasis and well-being. Ever since that childhood experience, the faceless man tried to contain his inadequacy, scheming to present himself in different ways to mask his fundamental deficits.Kirkus Reviews, accessed Jan. 23 2014, URL - https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book- reviews/jean-pierre-weill/the-well-of-being/ This scheming resulted in a convolution of associative thought-processes and value symbols. It is these sorts of associations, expounds The Well of Being, that all people carry with them that extensively govern human psychology, implanting themselves as unshakeable truisms in the minds of their hosts. And, continues the book's narrative, human psychology plays no small part in determining the course and perception of human fortune. In this way, the plot of The Well of Being may be seen as a pragmatic, if not philosophical, affirmation and advocacy of human freewill.

Founded in 1846, it is one of the oldest medical schools in the United States and is the only medical school in Buffalo. It offers degrees in various field such as Biomedical Sciences undergraduate majors, Biotechnical and Clinical, Laboratory Sciences, Master's programs in Biomedical Sciences, PhD programs in Biomedical Sciences, MD program, Graduate Medical Education residency program, Continuing Medical Education, Postdoctoral programs, as well as Dual-degree programs. History The school was established by U.S. President Millard Fillmore in 1846. Buffalo was a boomtown on the Erie Canal and the gateway to the West. Leading citizens ‚Äî primarily physicians and lawyers ‚Äî proposed that an institution of higher learning be established, which led to the founding of the private, nonsectarian University of Buffalo. The Medical School, or Medical Department, as it was called, was the first decanal unit within the university, and 40 years passed before other departments were added. Medical classes began February 24, 1847, with an enrollment of 66 students. The medical school's first permanent location was next to Buffalo General Hospital in downtown Buffalo. In 1893, the school relocated to High Street in the city, where it remained until 1953, when it moved to the university's South Campus. It moved in 2017 to a new campus High Street and Main Streets, again adjacent to the Buffalo General Hospital complex. In 1962, University of Buffalo merged with the State University of New York (SUNY) system. The Medical School then became the School of Medicine, State University of New York at Buffalo. Throughout its history, the university has not owned or operated a teaching hospital, but instead has instructed students in affiliated hospitals throughout the city. Today's network of teaching affiliations was formalized in 1983 as the Graduate Medical Dental Education Consortium of Buffalo. In 2015, the school's name was changed to Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo in response to a $30 million donation by the Jacobs family. The Jacobs family includes Jeremy Jacobs, the owner of the Boston Bruins. Before that, in 1987, the school's name was changed to the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in recognition of the basic sciences underpinning medical knowledge. Today, the school enrolls 180 medical students each year, 133 PhD students, 28 MD/PhD students, 71 master's students and 435 undergraduates. Currently, the school is located at the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus/University at Buffalo's downtown campus as of the Spring of 2018. Hospital and research affiliations Unlike many other medical schools, UB does not own or operate its own medical center. Rather it has affiliations with almost every major hospital in the city of Buffalo. These include: * Buffalo General Medical Center-Located on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, Buffalo General Medical Center offers a wide spectrum of clinical inpatient and outpatient treatment programs. * John R. Oishei Children's Hospital-This regional center for specialized pediatric and women's health care has achieved national recognition and is ranked among the top 20 pediatric hospitals in the nation by U.S. News and World Report. * Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital- this 200-bed community hospital supports a residency training programs in anesthesiology, emergency medicine, general surgery, urology, obstetrics and gynecology, and family practice. * DeGraff Memorial Hospital-A 70-bed community hospital primarily serving the needs of patients in towns north of Buffalo. * Erie County Medical Center-This 550-bed medical center serves as a regional center for trauma, burns, rehabilitation and cardiac care. * Veterans Affairs Western New York Healthcare System-The Buffalo VA Medical Center provides inpatient and outpatient programs. It is the main referral center for cardiac surgery, cardiology and comprehensive cancer care for Western New York and northern Pennsylvania. * Sisters of Charity Hospital- Buffalo's first hospital and a Designated Stroke Center, Sisters of Charity Hospital serves patients in its inpatient and outpatient facilities. * Mercy Hospital of Buffalo-Mercy Hospital is a Center of Excellence for Stroke and Cardiac Care.

From 2014 to 2018 he served as the Vice-President of the country, along with Ana Helena Chac√≥n Echeverr√≠a. Fallas' main economic interest is national public policy. He generally opposes free trade and supports public social programs. Fallas has served in three separate presidential administrations. Career Fallas earned a degree in economics from the University of Costa Rica and a Master's from the University of Los Andes. Fallas was a member of the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC for its Spanish initials) before joining Citizens' Action Party (PAC for its Spanish initials). Fallas joined the administration of Rafael √Ångel Calder√≥n Fournier (1990-1994) as Minister of Planning. He was also Minister of Housing during Abel Pacheco's administration (2002-2006), quitting in 2005. Fallas resigned after facing criticism from Pacheco and PUSC over the amount of money available for low-income housing. In addition, he was a consultant on the State of the Nation. Between administrations, Fallas has worked as an independent economic consultant. Fallas left PUSC, the party of both Calder√≥n and Pacheco, to join the PAC. In 2013, Fallas became PAC's Vice-Presidential candidate, running with Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s, and fellow Vice-Presidential running-mate Ana Helena Chac√≥n Echeverr√≠a. The campaign was successful, resulting in a victory for Sol√≠s when the National Liberation Party ceased campaigning after the end of the first round of voting. In addition of serving as first vice president, he was the minister of finance.  Economic and social philosophy  Fallas follows PAC's platform of concern for the health of the national economy, citing corruption and poor budgeting as problems. Like most members of PAC, he is opposed to the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Fallas has also expressed an interest in rural poverty in Costa Rica and Central America. Of particular concern to Fallas in recent years has been what he describes as a reliance on overseas development and too few incentives for local economic growth. Fallas is also worried about the prevalence of sexual tourism in Costa Rica, citing the number of internet sites that promote the practice. As vice-president, Fallas claims that he will consider state spending and the implementation of responsible taxes as economic changes. Fallas says he is sensitive to the middle class, workforce development, and social programs. Fallas writes extensively on economic topics, including editorials, for El Pa√≠s, La Naci√≥n, La Tribuna Democr√°tica, and other Central American newspapers. Personal life Fallas is married to Nuria M√°s. He has three children (Luis Diego, Javier and Marcela) and three grandchildren (Daniela, Gabriel and Andr√©s), who he enjoys taking swimming. In 2008, Fallas was involved in a plane crash in Honduras. During the crash, the President of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration was killed and Fallas received considerable injuries, especially to his spinal column. He was flown to a hospital in Miami, Florida to receive emergency treatment and rehabilitation. Fallas claims that he is now in good health and is able to perform his political duties. For exercise, Fallas takes frequent walks.

In World War I, the house served as a hospital. It remained in the family's ownership until the death of Holdsworth's nephew in 1920.

Written by Agnes Brand Leahy, Edward E. Paramore Jr., Keene Thompson, and Richard H. Digges Jr., the film is about a Union Army captain who travels into Confederate territory as a spy with false dispatches hoping to mislead the Confederate forces. His mission is complicated when he falls in love with a southern woman who comes to his aid. Produced by Hector Turnbull for Paramount Pictures, Only the Brave was released on March 8, 1930 in the United States. Plot During the American Civil War, Capt. James Braydon (Gary Cooper) visits his sweetheart and finds her with another man. Angered by the betrayal, he volunteers to become a spy for the Union. His first assignment involves carrying false military dispatches behind enemy lines and allow them to be discovered by Confederate Army officers in order to mislead them. Braydon sets off on his dangerous mission. Pretending to be a Confederate sympathizer in possession of vital Union plans, Braydon arrives at the plantation of a beautiful southern belle, Barbara Calhoun (Mary Brian), who has organized a ball for Confederate officers. At the ball, Braydon openly flirts with his gracious host in order to make one of the Confederate officers, Capt. Robert Darrington (Phillips Holmes), jealous. Darrington is in love with Barbara, and Braydon believes that if he can make him jealous, he will be arrested and his fraudulent dispatches will be discovered. Braydon's plan is disrupted, however, by Barbara who comes to his defense, and soon falls in love with him. In the coming days, Barbara continues to save Braydon from being arrested, even after she discovers that he is a Union spy. Each time he attempts to get arrested, she intervenes and arranges for his release. Finally, Braydon leaps from a window and is captured by the Confederates, who discover the fraudulent dispatches and soon act on them. Later, after they discover that the dispatches were a deception, they order Braydon executed by firing squad. Just before the sentence can be carried out, the Union Army arrives, and in the subsequent battle, Braydon is saved, although seriously wounded. Barbara is there to comfort him. Sometime later, after General Lee surrenders at Appomattox Court House to end the war, Barbara and Braydon are married in a military wedding. Cast * Gary Cooper as Capt.

Understanding this tactical behavior, and why it is able to succeed requires an analysis of two key concepts: * Information warfare; and, * Command and Influence relationships (as a component of Military C2 'Command and Control').  Related concepts  There are several concepts that are related the 3D tactical analysis approach: * Simultaneous Tactical Actions * Airspace Battle = Simultaneous tactical actions = 3D tactical analysis has its origins in Simpkin's concept of simultaneous tactical actions.Simpkin, R.E. (1985) The Race to the Swift: Thoughts on Twenty-First Century Warfare, Brassey's, London. In summary, Simpkin: * Made a distinction between conventional land-based tactics articulated along a staged -sequential set of actions, where what can be seen within the line-of-weapon's sight, follows movement. * Simpkin also identified a more complex level of tactics, conducted not as a sequence of actions, but occurring as a barrage of continuous simultaneous actions. Simpkin 'originally proposed this, as multiple simultaneous manoeuvre and fire-directed attacks at an opponent in order to overwhelm them'.Flaherty, C. (2008) 3D Tactics and Information Deception.

This has been described as 'considering the three-dimensional situational awareness of the local friendly airspace in battle management'. And, in this particular formulation of the tactical paradigm (represented by 3D tactical analysis), the entire space surrounding a position or target in warfare is subject to continuous simultaneous examination.Flaherty, C.

OAS is used to treat aneurysms of the abdominal and thoracic aorta, aortic dissection, acute aortic syndrome, and aortic ruptures. Aortobifemoral bypass is also used to treat atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta below the level of the renal arteries. In 2003, OAS was surpassed by endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) as the most common technique for repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms in the United States. In OAS for abdominal aortic aneurysm, the aneurysmal portion of the aorta is replaced with a graft, usually made of dacron or PTFE. OAS is distinct from aortic valve repair and aortic valve replacement, as OAS describes surgery of the aorta, rather than of the heart valves. When the aortic valve is diseased in addition to the ascending aorta, the Bentall procedure is used to treat the entire aortic root. An axillary-bifemoral bypass is another type of vascular bypass used to treat aortic pathology, however it is not true open aortic surgery as it reconstructs the flow of blood to the legs from the arm, rather than in the native location of the aorta. Medical uses OAS is used to treat patients with aortic aneurysms greater than 5.5 cm in diameter, to treat aortic rupture of an aneurysm any size, to treat aortic dissections, and to treat acute aortic syndrome. It is used to treat infrarenal aneurysms, as well as juxta- and pararenal aneurysm, thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysms, and also non-aneurysmal aortic pathology. Disease of the aorta proximal to the left subclavian artery in the chest lies within the specialty of cardiac surgery, and is treated via procedures such as the valve-sparing aortic root replacement. Prior to the advent of EVAR, OAS was the only surgical treatment available for aortic aneurysms. It is still preferred at some institutions and by some patients as it may be more durable than EVAR and does not require post-operative surveillance CT scans. OAS is sometimes required for patients who have previously undergone EVAR but need further treatment, such as for degeneration of the EVAR seal zones leading to continued aneurysm growth. OAS is also sometimes required in cases of EVAR graft infection where the stent graft is removed to treat the infection. History The history of aortic surgery dates back to Greek surgeon Antyllus, who first performed surgeries for various aneurysms in the second century AD. Many advancements of OAS have been developed in the past century. In 1955, cardiovascular surgeons, Drs. Michael DeBakey and Denton Cooley performed the first replacement of a thoracic aneurysm with a homograft. In 1958, they began using the Dacron graft, resulting in a revolution for surgeons in the surgical repair of aortic aneurysms. DeBakey was first to perform cardiopulmonary bypass to repair the ascending aorta, using antegrade perfusion of the brachiocephalic artery. By the mid-1960s, at Baylor College of Medicine, DeBakey‚Äôs group began performing surgery on thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), which presented formidable surgical challenges, often fraught with serious complications, such as paraplegia, paraparesis and renal failure. DeBakey prot√©g√© and vascular Surgeon, E. Stanley Crawford, in particular, began dedicating most of his time to TAAAs. In 1986, he classified TAAA open surgery cases into four types: Extent I, extending from the left subclavian artery to just below the renal artery; Extent II, from the left subclavian to below the renal artery; Extent III, from the sixth intercostal space to below the renal artery; and Extent IV, from the twelfth intercostal space to the iliac bifurcation (i.e. total abdominal). In 1992, another classification, Extent V, characterized by Hazim J. Safi, MD, identified aneurysmal disease extending from the sixth intercostal space to above the renal arteries. Safi's group used experimental animal models for a prospective study on the use distal aortic perfusion, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, moderate hypothermia and sequential clamping to decrease in the incidence of neurological deficit. In 1994, they presented their experiences, showing that the incidence for Extent I and II dropped from 25% to 5%. This marked a new era for protecting the spinal cord, brain, kidneys, heart and lungs during OAS on TAAA. Open Repair versus Endovascular Repair The shift away from open aortic surgery towards endovascular surgery since 2003 has been driven by worse perioperative mortality associated with OAS, particularly in patients in relatively frail health. Unlike endovascular repair, there are no strict anatomic contra-indications to open repair; Rather, open repair is viewed as the fall back option for patients with unfavorable anatomy for endovascular repair. The main drawback of open repair is the larger physiologic demand of the operation, which is associated with increased rates of short term mortality in most studies. Patients younger than 50 years with descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm have low surgical risks, and open repairs can be performed with excellent short-term and durable long-term results. Open surgical repairs should be considered initially in younger patients requiring descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs. Heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD) warrants closer postoperative surveillance. Technique Front wall suture line of an infrarenal open aortic repair with a dacron bifurcated graft Open surgery typically involves exposure of the dilated portion of the aorta and insertion of a synthetic (Dacron or Gore-Tex) graft (tube). Once the graft is sewn into the proximal (toward the patient's head) and distal (toward the patient's foot) portions of the aorta, the aneurysmal sac is closed around the graft. Alternatively, the anastomosis can be carried out with expandable devices, a simpler and quicker procedure The aorta and its branching arteries are cross- clamped during open surgery. This can lead to inadequate blood supply to the spinal cord, resulting in paraplegia, when repairing thoracic aneurysms. A 2004 systematic review and meta analysis found that cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CFSD), when performed in experienced centers, reduces the risk of ischemic spinal cord injury by increasing the perfusion pressure to the spinal cord. A 2012 Cochrane systematic review noted that further research regarding the effectiveness of CFSD for preventing a spinal cord injury is required. =Approach= The infrarenal aorta can be approached via a transabdominal midline or paramedian incision, or via a retroperitoneal approach. The paravisceral and thoracic aorta are approached via a left-sided posteriolateral thoracotomy incision in approximately the 9th intercostal space. For a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm, this approach can be extended to a median or paramedian abdominal incision to allow access to the iliac arteries. =Sequential aortic clamping= At medical centers with a high volume of open aortic surgery, the fastest option for open aortic surgery was sequential aortic clamping or \\"clamp-and-sew\\", whereby the aorta was clamped proximally and distally to the diseased segment, and a graft sewn into the intervening segment. This technique leaves the branches of the aorta un- perfused during the time it takes to sew in the graft, potentially increasing the risk of ischemia to the organs which derive their arterial supply from the clamped segment. Critics of this technique advocate intra-operative aortic perfusion. In infrarenal aneurysms, the relative tolerance of the lower extremities to ischemia allows surgeons to clamp distally with low risk of ill effect. =Techniques to limit Ischemia= A number of techniques exist for maintaining perfusion to the viscera and spinal cord during open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair, including left heart bypass, balloon perfusion catheter placement in the visceral arteries, selective spinal drainage and cold crystalloid renal perfusion. There is limited evidence supporting these techniques. =Graft configuration= The abdominal aorta is anastomosed preferentially to the main limb of a tube or bifurcated graft in an end-to-end fashion to minimize turbulent flow at the proximal anastomosis. If normal aorta exists superior to the iliac bifurcation, a tube graft can be sewn distally to that normal aorta. If the distal aorta is diseased, a bifurcated graft can be used in an aorto-billiac or aorto-bifemoral configuration. If visceral vessels are involved in the diseased aortic segment, a branched graft can be used with branches sewn directly to visceral vessels, or the visceral vessels can be separately revascularized. =Reimplantation of the inferior mesenteric artery= Because of collateral blood flow from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) via the marginal artery, the inferior mesenteric artery usually does not have to be reimplanted into the aortic graft when performing an open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Risks and complications OAS is widely recognized as having higher rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality than endovascular procedures for comparable segments of the aorta. For example, in infrarenal aneurysms, perioperative mortality with endovascular surgery is approximately 0.5%, against 3% with open repair. Other risks and complications with OAS depend on the segment of aorta involved, and may include renal failure, spinal cord ischemia leading to paralysis, buttock claudication, ischemic colitis, embolization leading to acute limb ischemia, infection, and bleeding. Preoperative and intraoperative factors to determine the immediate and long- term results and recovery from TAAA OAS. Recovery after OAS Recovery time after OAS is substantial. Immediately following surgery, patients can expect to spend 1‚Äì3 days in the intensive care unit, followed by 4‚Äì10 days on the hospital ward. After discharge, patients will take 3‚Äì6 months to fully recover their energy and return to their pre-operative daily activities. TAAA repair requires a very large incision that cuts through muscles and bones making recovery very difficult and painful for the patient. Intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoanalgesia has been used during procedure to help reduce pain after TAAA.  Progress and future challenges  Postoperative paraplegia and paraparesis have been the scourge of thoracoabdominal aortic repair since the inception of the procedure. However, with evolving surgical strategies, identification of predictors, and use of various adjuncts over the years, the incidence of spinal cord injury after thoracic/thoracoabdominal aortic repair has declined. Embracing a multimodality approach offers a good insight into combating this grave complication  See also  *Aortic valve repair References Category:Cardiac surgery ","title":"Open aortic surgery"},{"id":"42306014","text":"Marlon Blackwell (born November 7, 1956) is an American architect and university professor in Arkansas.

Singe, DJ M. Singe, and DJ Singe) is an American female electronic music composer and academic in the field of new media studies. Her work has been featured in a variety of venues such as the Whitney Museum of American Art, MoMA PS1, Mus√©e D'art Moderne Paris, and the Waag Society Amsterdam. From 2005 until 2011, she was a professor of Comparative Media Studies and Writing at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Currently she is Assistant Professor, Department of English Language and Literature, University of Waterloo, Canada, and co-director of Waterloo's Critical Media Lab. Early career Following a trip exploring the burgeoning experimental and electronic music scenes in Berlin in the summer of 1994, Coleman and frequent collaborator Howard Goldkrand returned to New York City, where they formed Soundlab Cultural Alchemy with Paul D. Miller (aka DJ Spooky). SoundLab was formed as a grass roots initiative to provide a space for emerging artists to display new ideas and forms of music and experimental art instillations in response to legal pressures placed on traditional musical venues during the Giuliani administration.Rodgers, Tara (2010). Pink noises: Women on electronic music and sound. Durham [N.C.]: Duke University Press, . p. 82 Coleman performed her first solo DJ set with the collective in January 1996.Rodgers, T. (2010). Pink noises: Women on electronic music and sound. Durham [N.C.]: Duke University Press. 83 Over her career, Coleman has transitioned from being known primarily as a DJ to being strongly associated with environment installations and new media studies. Music Extended experimentation with digital interfaces and audio data manipulation are characteristic of Coleman‚Äôs musical output, creating what she refers to as an ‚Äúelectronic architecture interface.‚Äù Her music is often associated with the illbient music scene of 1990‚Äôs New York City, a hybrid of ambient, dub, and hip-hop traditions. Over the course of her career, Coleman has shifted from primarily using turntable equipment, a staple of illbient music, to focusing more on audio design software such as Logic. Coleman has stated that she has an aversion towards improvisation in her work, preferring the use of more premeditated, thought-out sound structures.Rodgers, T. (2010). Pink noises: Women on electronic music and sound. Durham [N.C.]: Duke University Press. 84 Coleman is one half of the duo Singe & Verb, a collaboration with her fellow SoundLab co-founder Howard Goldkrand, and has also collaborated with other artists such as Ilhan Ersahin, Lawrence D. Morris, Graham Haynes, and Fredy Studer. Academia Coleman has written articles advocating a break down of musical and cultural segregation through technology and new art forms, a reflection of the ‚Äúcultural alchemy‚Äù originally introduced in the SoundLab collective.Rodgers, T. (2010). Pink noises: Women on electronic music and sound. Durham [N.C.]: Duke University Press. 88-93 In 2011, Coleman published her first book, Hello Avatar: Rise of the Networked Generation. In the book, she explores how the boom of social and mobile media and new technologies in the later half of the 2000s has allowed humanity to filter their experiences into a new digital medium, creating an augmented x-reality.Coleman, Beth. Hello Avatar: Rise of the Networked Generation. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2011. Selected works In 1999, Coleman and Goldkrand created the piece Mobile Stealth Unit (Pink Noise), a mixed-media sculpture consisting of a workman tricycle and a system of audio electronics. The piece was meant to be an ‚Äúinvestigation of space in the form of two-way transmission‚Äù through the concept of pink noise.‚ÄúIntegrated Systems: Mobile Stealth Unit,‚Äù Sound Unbound. Paul D.

Early life and education  Park was born in 1944 in Danyang County, South Korea. His family then moved to Daejeon City, where he attended elementary, junior high, and high school. In high school, Park practiced Judo, a form of martial arts; by the time he went to college, he had earned a black belt. Park entered Seoul National University in 1962 and received a Certificate in the Arts and Sciences. In 1964, he attended Seoul National University's College of Dentistry, and received a DDS in 1968. As a dental student, he was heavily involved in scientific research, specifically pharmacology and biological chemistry. He went on to receive a Certificate in Periodontics in 1971 from Seoul National University. He then was drafted into the Korean Army, where he served for three years, 1971 to 1974, retiring as a captain. Park was given the opportunity to conduct research for a year as a postdoctoral fellow at the Medical College of Georgia at Georgia Regents University in 1975. At the end of the year, he decided to stay and pursue a PhD degree in Pharmacology, which he received in 1978. From 1978 to 1982 he served as a research associate at the Harvard University/Eye Research Institute, while pursuing a Certificate in Virology and Molecular Biology Fellowship, which he earned in 1980. He then entered Harvard School of Dental Medicine to work towards an American dental degree, and he received a Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) degree in 1982.  Career  In 1982 he became an assistant professor in the Department of Oral Biology and Pathophysiology at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. In 1984 he relocated to the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) School of Dentistry, starting as an associate professor in the Section of Oral Biology for a year, then becoming a professor in 1985. In 2004, he also became a professor in the Department of Medicine (Division of Hematology and Oncology) at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. In 2006 he was named a distinguished professor at both schools. During his time at UCLA, Park also served as the associate director of UCLA Dental Research Institute (July 1986 ‚Äì June 1990), the associate dean for Research, UCLA School of Dentistry (January 1997 ‚Äì June 1998), and the director of the UCLA Dental Research Institute (January 1995 ‚Äì June 2002).

It was constructed between 1984 and 1987 for the purpose of providing hydroelectric power to both Togo and Benin as well as creating fisheries and supplying water for irrigation. The dam's power station was commissioned in June 1987. The project was financed by the World Bank and African Development Bank at a cost of US$98.22 million. The objectives of the dam were to satisfy the medium-term requirements of Benin and Togo for power, and to provide a large water reserve, amounting to 1.7 billion cubic metres. It was expected that 1000 to 1500 tonnes of fish would be produced each year and that 43,000 hectares of land would be irrigated. Evaluation of the project six years later showed that the project had been completed on time and on budget to a satisfactory standard. The project was a good example of cooperation between the two countries. The power generation objective was satisfied but the fish development scheme had failed and the irrigation project was proceeding at a slower rate than expected. However, initial results of the cultivation of rice on the irrigated land were encouraging. The Nangbeto Dam serves part of Togo's needs for electricity and is subject to interruptions in supply when the water level is low, which may happen for periods of several months. As a result, a further dam on the Mono River further downstream at Adjaralla is being constructed, starting in 2016. The fish production scheme involved in this project and other environmental issues are being planned at an earlier stage in its development.
