Their rickety boat's engine failed and the group drifted for five days, with the captain of the group overthrowing himself at one point in despair. The group were rescued by an oil tanker off the coast of Daytona Beach, Florida. He started his own business selling household items door to door in Cuba, eventually opening his own grocery store. He acquired enough money to buy land and property, and his family had electricity and TV, unusual in Cuba in 1957. Still, his adventurous side wanted to see what more, so he crossed the Florida Straits with nine others, settling first in Miami Beach. He flew his wife, Teresa, and two sons to Miami the next year and eventually bought his own store in Hialeah, Florida near a race track. Having done well, he opened a bigger store that catered to a more mixed clientele eventually leading to his own wholesale business in 1972 in the Jackson Memorial Hospital district, serving customers with roots in Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos. He sold the business in 2011, by which time he had already retired.

D. Holman House is a historic residence in Ozark, Alabama. One of the most elaborate Neoclassical homes in the Wiregrass Region, it was built in 1912‚Äì13 for Jesse DeCosta Holman, a prominent local merchant. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History Holman, a native of Ozark, began in the livestock business in the 1890s by selling a mule belonging to his father. The business flourished, and allowed him to invest in other enterprises, including a cotton mill (one of the first in Southeast Alabama) and a Buick dealership. See also: The house was built in 1912‚Äì1913 at a cost of around $75,000 (). Following Holman's death in 1960, it remained in the family until 1982, when it was purchased by Jack Mizell for $120,000. The city of Ozark purchased the house in 2013 for $296,000. Architecture The Holman House is a two-story structure, measuring about 62 feet (19 meters) square. It was designed in a Neoclassical style by Montgomery architect C. Frank Galliher. Two identical porticos are centered on the front and west elevations, facing Broad and Mutual Streets. Four Corinthian columns support a triangular pediment and entablature. An elaborately outlined oval window adorns the center of the pediment. The main entry is surrounded by a latticed transom and sidelights, which are flanked by pilasters with capitals that match the main columns. Above the main entrance is a balcony with wrought iron railings, which features a door with similar transom and sidelights as that below. The portico is framed by pilasters against the house which match the main columns. A wrap-around porch stretches around the west, south (front), and east sides of the house. On the front elevation, French windows with fanlights on either side of the portico open onto the porch. Casement windows with lattice lights above sit on the second story above the French windows. On the east side, there are two French windows with casements above and a porte-coch√®re below a small balcony. Windows on the west elevation are one-over-one double-hung sash windows, except for casements on a sleeping porch off the rear of the house. The interior of the house is laid out with a central hall with two bedrooms and a library on one side, and a dining room and salon on the other. A mantel in the library features reliefs of a horse and a mule, emblematic of Holman's early business. The stairwell at the end of the hall is flanked by Corinthian columns. The second floor corresponds to the first, with a central hall between three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a dressing room, and access to the sleeping porch.

It was developed initially by Sir Edward Coke, in his law reports; and has been analysed in modern times by J. G. A. Pocock in The Ancient Constitution and the Feudal Law (1st edition 1957; reissued \\"with a retrospect\\" 1987).Pocock 1987. Legal antiquarianism The self-conscious antiquarian study of the law gathered momentum from the 15th century. It supported the theories of the ancient constitution. In his Institutes of the Lawes of England Coke challenged the accepted view of the Norman Conquest by asserting it amounted to trial by battle, with William the Conqueror agreeing to maintain the Anglo-Saxon laws. Political role In the reign of Charles I of England, reasoning based on the \\"ancient constitution\\" became available as a resistance theory for those who saw the monarch as high-handed. In its theoretical aspects, this type of reasoning is now seen as loaded with politics or ideology, rather than being the antiquarian study its proponents claimed for it. Coke's style of argument was inherently conservative, based as it was on defending a legal continuity claimed to be rooted in English governance from before 1066; but it is now argued that a radical variant was developed in the English Civil War period, by Nathaniel Bacon and William Prynne in particular. During the Exclusion Crisis of the late 1670s and early 1680s, the theory of the ancient constitution was upheld by Whig writers such as William Petyt, Algernon Sidney and James Tyrrell.Isaac Kramnick, 'Editor's Introduction', in Kramnick (ed.), Lord Bolingbroke: Historical Writings (University of Chicago Press, 1972), p. xliv. The Royalist writer Robert Brady criticised them in his Introduction to the Old English History (1694) and in the first volume of his History of England (1695).David C. Douglas, English Scholars. 1660‚Äì1730. Second, revised edition (Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1951), p. 124. Following the studies of feudal history made by Henry Spelman and William Dugdale, Brady argued that William I at the Norman Conquest had completely changed English law and had introduced feudal tenures.Isaac Kramnick, Bolingbroke and His Circle: The Politics of Nostalgia in the Age of Walpole (Harvard University Press, 1968), p. 128. Whereas Petyt maintained that a class of freeholders had survived from Anglo-Saxon times despite the Norman Conquest, Brady argued that during the Middle Ages the population was entirely feudal, with no freeholders.Kramnick, Bolingbroke and His Circle, p. 128. During the 1730s the ancient constitution again became the subject of debate. The Tory politician Lord Bolingbroke sought to use the traditional Whig belief in the ancient constitution to criticise the Whig government of Robert Walpole.Kramnick, Bolingbroke and His Circle, p. 129. In his Remarks on the History of England (1730‚Äì31) and A Dissertation upon Parties (1733‚Äì34) Bolingbroke asserted that the freedoms bestowed on Englishmen by the ancient constitution were undermined by Walpole's corrupt government.Kramnick, Bolingbroke and His Circle, pp. 129‚Äì130.H. T. Dickinson, Bolingbroke (Constable, 1970), p. 198. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 had sought to restore the ancient constitution but (Bolingbroke argued) it had been betrayed by Walpole. Bolingbroke insisted that annual parliaments, the exclusion of placemen from parliament and a militia would save the ancient constitution from Walpole's corruption.Kramnick, Bolingbroke and His Circle, p. 130. Walpole's supporters in the press countered Bolingbroke by claiming that the ancient constitution was a fiction: Englishmen owed their freedom to the Revolution of 1688 and to the modern Whigs. In order to undermine Bolingbroke's criticisms, they used Brady's work to maintain that Englishmen in the Middle Ages had not been free.Kramnick, Bolingbroke and His Circle, pp. 130‚Äì131, p. 135. The Whig writer Lord Hervey, in his Ancient and Modern Liberty Stated and Compared (1734), argued that until the Revolution of 1688 there was no liberty in England.Reed Browning, Political and Constitutional Ideas of the Court Whigs (Louisiana State University Press, 1982), p. 52. In his Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), the Whig MP Edmund Burke argued that the Revolution of 1688 was \\"made to preserve our antient indisputable laws and liberties ... We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as an inheritance from our forefathers\\".J. C. D. Clark (ed.), Reflections on the Revolution in France: A Critical Edition (Stanford University Press, 2001), p. 181. Burke was unusual in reverting to the ancient constitution because by the time he was writing it was usually employed by the reformist intelligentsia.Clark, p. 181, n. 126.

She creates virtual representations that take the form of 3D imagery integrated into photography, animated loops and multi- channel animation installations. Biography After graduating cum laude from New York University with a BA in art history in 1978, Hart studied architecture at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture and received a MS in 1984. She then practiced as an art and architecture critic. In 1985-86, she was associate editor of I.D. magazine (then Industrial Design magazine) where, along with the senior editor Steven Skov Holt, she redeveloped it as ID: the Magazine of International Design. She published her critical writings widely and went to Artforum magazine where she was reviews editor until 1988. She continues to write critically but in the academic context, and continues to publish theoretical papers in academic journals such as Media-N, the New Media Caucus journal, Bad Papers and Byte Shark. In 1988, Hart began to exhibit with the Pat Hearn Gallery, moving from critical to artistic practice. At that time, she exhibited paintings and installations inspired by the visionary architectural languages of Ledoux, Boullee and Leque. After receiving an NEA Fellowship in 1989, she moved her practice to Europe where she spent ten years. She received numerous fellowships, including the Kunstfond Bonn, Stiftung Kulturfonds, the Stiftung Luftbrueckendank Grant, the Arts International Foundation Grant, the Kunstlerhaus Bethanian grant, an honorary fellowship at Eyebeam, and two fellowships from the American Center in Paris, \\\\- where she met French conceptual artist Sylvia Bossu. In Europe she exhibited widely with galleries and museums. Her work from this time has been collected by the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Vera List Center for Art and Politics at The New School in New York, M.I.T. List Center in Cambridge, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, Museum of Contemporary Art in Berlin, and the Goetz Collection in Munich. Hart returned to New York in 1998 to publish two illustrated books, originally catalogs for her exhibitions. She wrote, illustrated and designed A Child's Machiavelli, published by Abbeville, Penguin and Nautilus, and Dr. Faustie's Guide to Real Estate Development, published by Nautilus. Hart then studied animation at New York University Center for Advanced Digital Applications with the intention of animating her illustrated books. Instead, she developed a body of work consisting of 3D-animated installations that she thinks of as temporal paintings. Her contemporary art consists of designs for sublime landscape gardens often containing expressive and sensual female bodies meant to interject emotional subjectivity into what is typically the overly-determined Cartesian world of digital design. Her work has been seen at various public institutions including MoMA PS1 (New York) PS122 (New York), biennial Zero1 (San Jose). She had the first one-woman show presented at the Wood Street Galleries in Pittsburgh. Her works are part of The Sandor Family Collection (Chicago), the Teutloff Photo + Video Collection (Cologne) and the Borusan Contemporary Art Collection (Istanbul) among others.Claudia Hart Bio Works Hart's work applies a feminist perspective to a discussion of digital technology and a critique of the media. Much of her work attempts to introduce women into a male-dominated technological culture and condemn the violent impulses of a masculine digital production environment. In her artist statement, Hart says, \\"By creating virtual images that are sensual but not pornographic within mechanized, clockwork depictions of the natural, I try to subvert earlier dichotomies of woman and nature pitted against a civilized, \\"scientific\\" and masculine world of technology. In my own way, I am staging a romantic rebellion against technocratic and bureaucratic culture.\\" =Welcome to Alice's Giftshop! (2014)= In 2014, Hart held her third solo exhibition at bitforms gallery in Chelsea, New York. The works shown were inspired by Lewis Carroll's 1865 Alice in Wonderland and apply the metaphors in the text to explore the increasing mediation of contemporary life through digital platforms and technology. \\"I started working in a kind of hyper-feminine way,\\" said Hart. \\"I was dealing with ideas of beauty in the context of first-person shooter games that were fast and violent and pornographic. In resistance, I started making slow sensual work, focusing on the female body.\\" At the core of this work are issues of representation, as Hart questions what might be considered \\"natural\\", and the role of the computer in shifting values about identity and the real. =On Synchronics (2013)= On Synchronics is a media project Hart created in collaboration with 24 of her current and former students at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. On Synchronics deals with the topic of individual identity in a media-saturated and increasingly technological environment. In the work, \\"many individual characters merges into a single global body, performing one unified, poetic choreography in which a digital avatar heroically wrestles to escape the confines of the artificial computer world an emerge into the unpredictable flow of reality.\\" =Caress (2011)= Caress splits a reclining, life-size female nude into three video monitors. The framing of the body develops a sense of claustrophobia, depicting the figure as imprisoned by a kind of modern coffin. The black and white image is also intended to refer to tomb sculptures and the entrances to Gothic churches. The work was displayed in the bitforms gallery in New York.

History  Ocean Vista (western part of Kalani Kai) In 1975, professional dancers Richard Koob and Earnest Morgan purchased the original 19-acre property, which they called Kalani Honua, translated as \\"harmony of Heaven on Earth\\". They based the center on their ideal of building a community to \\"celebrate art, nature, health, and spirit\\". In the early years, Kalani was a small family operation. A conscious effort was made to include Hawaiian natives in the growing community. Workshops and classes focused on topics such as Hawaiian culture, yoga, dance, painting, music, and creative writing. Workshop and course offerings increased as Kalani became known as a destination retreat center. Extensive volunteer, sabbatical, and visiting artist education programs were developed, and Kalani grew to be the largest and oldest retreat center in Hawaii. Over time, the Kalani campus was expanded to its current 120 acres, with purchase of the adjacent 94-acre Kalani Kai (\\"Heavenly Sea\\") parcel, and the 6-acre Kalani Mauka (\\"Heavenly Uplands\\") parcel, land specifically dedicated to building a sustainable agricultural community.

A proportional myoelectric control system utilizes a microcontroller or computer that inputs electromyography (EMG) signals from sensors on the leg muscle(s) and then activates the corresponding joint actuator(s) proportionally to the EMG signal.  Background  A robotic exoskeleton is a type of orthosis that uses actuators to either assist or resist the movement of a joint of an intact limb; this is not to be confused with a powered prosthesis, which replaces a missing limb. There are four purposes that robotic lower limb exoskeletons can accomplish:Ferris, D.P. and Lewis, C.L.: ‚ÄúRobotic Lower Limb Exoskeletons Using Proportional Myoelectric Control‚Äù, 31st Annual International Conference of the IEEE EMBS, pp 2119‚Äì2124, 2009 * Enhancement of human performance, which typically deals with increasing strength or endurance (see Powered exoskeletons) * Long-term assistance, which aims to provide impaired individuals with the ability to walk by themselves while wearing an exoskeleton * Study of human locomotion, which utilizes robotic exoskeletons to better understand human neuromuscular control, energetics, and/or kinematics of locomotion * Post-injury rehabilitation, which is intended to help an individual recover from an injury (such as a stroke, spinal cord injury, or other neurological disabilities) by wearing an exoskeleton for a short time during training in order to perform better later without the use of the exoskeleton Robotic lower-limb exoskeletons can be controlled by several methods, including a footswitch (a pressure sensor attached to the bottom of the foot), gait-phase estimation (using joint angles to determine the current phase of walking), and myoelectric control (using electromyography).Jung, J, Jang, I, Riener, R and Park, H:\\"Walking Intent Detection Algorithm for Paraplegic Patients Using a Robotic Exoskeleton Walking Assistant with Crutches\\", International Journal of Control, Automation, and Systems, 10(5), pp 954‚Äì962, 2012 This article focuses on myoelectric control.  Control methods  Sensors on the skin detect electromyography (EMG) signals from the muscles of the wearer's leg(s). EMG signals can be measured from just one muscle or many, depending on the type of the exoskeleton and how many joints are actuated. Each signal measured is then sent to a controller, which is either an onboard microcontroller (mounted to the exoskeleton) or to a nearby computer. Onboard microcontrollers are used for long-term assistive devices since the wearer must be able to walk in different locations while wearing the exoskeleton, whereas computers not carried by the exoskeleton can be used for therapeutic or research purposes since the wearer does not have to walk very far in a clinical or lab environment. The controller filters out noise from the EMG signals and then normalizes them so as to better analyze the muscle activation pattern. The normalized EMG value of a muscle represents its activation percentage, since the EMG signal is normalized by dividing it by the maximum possible EMG reading for the muscle it came from. The maximum EMG reading is generated when a muscle is fully contracted. An alternative method to normalization is to proportionally match the actuator power to the EMG signal between a minimum activation threshold and an upper saturation level. = Direct proportional myoelectric control = With a proportional myoelectric controller, the power sent to an actuator is proportional to the amplitude of the normalized EMG signal from a muscle.Ferris, D.P, Czerniecki, J.M. and Hannaford, B.: \\"An ankle-foot orthosis powered by artificial pneumatic muscles\\", '‚ÄôJournal of Applied Biomechanics'‚Äô, 21,pp 189‚Äì97, 2005 When the muscle is inactive, the actuator receives no power from the controller, and when the muscle is fully contracted, the actuator produces maximum torque about the joint it controls. For example, an powered ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) could employ a pneumatic artificial muscle to provide plantar flexion torque proportional to the activation level of the soleus (one of the calf muscles). This control method enables the exoskeleton to be controlled by the same neural pathways as the wearer's biological muscles and has been shown to allow individuals to walk with a more normal gait than other control methods, such as using a footswitch.Cain, S.M., Gordon, K.E. and Ferris, D.P.: \\"Locomotor adaptation to a powered ankle-foot orthosis depends on control method\\", Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation, 4, pp 48, 2007 Proportional myoelectric control of robotic lower limb exoskeletons has advantages over other control methods, such as: * Its physiological nature allows for an effective way to scale the magnitude of mechanical assistance from the exoskeletonFerris, D.P, Sawicki, G.S. and Daley, M.A.: \\"A physiologist's perspective on robotic exoskeletons for human locomotion\\", International Journal of Humanoid Robotics, 4, pp 507‚Äì28, 2007 * It results in reduced biological muscle recruitment versus kinematic based control methods * It allows easy adaptation of the exoskeleton control for new motor tasksSawicki, G.S. and Ferris, D.P.: \\"A pneumatically powered knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO) with myoelectric activation and inhibition\\", Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation, p. in press, 2009 However, proportional myoelectric control also has disadvantages compared to other control methods, including: * The surface electrode interface can often cause difficulties in obtaining a reliable EMG signalParker, P, Englehart, K and Hudgins, B: \\"Myoelectric signal processing for control of powered limb prostheses\\", J Electromyogr Kinesiol., 16(6), pp 541‚Äì48, 2006 * The system requires tuning to determine the appropriate thresholds and gainsGordon, K.E. and Ferris, D.P.: \\"Learning to walk with a robotic ankle exoskeleton\\", Journal of Biomechanics, 40, pp 2636‚Äì44, 2007 * The musculoskeletal system has many synergistic muscles that are not easily accessible via surface EMG electrodesKinnaird, C.R. and Ferris, D.P.: \\"Medial Gastrocnemius Myoelectric Control of a Robotic Ankle Exoskeleton\\", IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng., 17(1), pp 31‚Äì37, 2009 * Since neurological disorders result in decreased neuromuscular control, some individuals may not have sufficient neural control to allow them to use an exoskeleton with myoelectric control = Proportional myoelectric control with flexor inhibition = Direct proportional control works well when each joint of the exoskeleton is actuated in one direction (uni-directional actuation), such as a pneumatic piston only bending the knee, but is less effective when two joint actuators work in opposition (bi-directional actuation). An example of this would be ankle exoskeleton using one pneumatic artificial muscle for dorsiflexion based on tibialis anterior (shin muscle) EMG and another pneumatic artificial muscle for plantar flexion based on soleus (calf muscle) EMG. This could result in a large degree of co-activation of the two actuators and make walking more difficult.Ferris, D.P., Gordon, K.E., Sawicki, G.S. and Peethambaran, A.: \\"An improved powered ankle-foot orthosis using proportional myoelectric control\\", Gait and Posture, 23, pp 425‚Äì428, 2006 To correct for this unwanted co- activation, a rule can be added to the control scheme so that artificial dorsiflexor activation is inhibited when soleus EMG is above a set threshold. Proportional control with flexor inhibition allows for a more natural gait than with direct proportional control; flexor inhibition also allows subjects to walk much more easily with combined knee and ankle exoskeletons with bi- directional actuators at each joint.  Applications  = Performance enhancement = Performance enhancement deals with increasing typical human capabilities, such as strength or endurance. Many full-body robotic exoskeletons currently in development use controllers based on joint torques and angles instead of electromyography. See Powered exoskeletons. = Long- term assistance = One application of a robot lower limb exoskeleton is to assist in the movement of a disabled individual in order to walk. Individuals with spinal cord injury, weakened leg muscles, poor neuromuscular control, or who have suffered a stroke could benefit from wearing such a device. The exoskeleton provides torque about a joint in the same direction that EMG data indicate the joint is rotating. For example, high EMG signals in the vastus medialis (a quadriceps muscle) and low EMG signals in the biceps femoris (a hamstring muscle) would indicate that the user is extending his/her leg, therefore the exoskeleton would provide torque on the knee to help straighten the leg. = Study of human locomotion = Proportional myoelectric control and robotic exoskeletons have been used in upper limb devices for decades, but engineers have only recently begun using them for lower-limb devices to better understand human biomechanics and neural control of locomotion.Scott, R.N.: \\"Myoelectric control of prostheses\\", Archives of Physical medicine and Rehabilitation, 47, pp 174‚Äì81, 1966Reinkensmeyer, D.J., Emken, J.L. and Cramer, S.C.: \\"Robotics, motor learning, and neurologic recovery\\", Annu Rev Biomed Eng, 6, pp 497‚Äì525, 2004 By using an exoskeleton with a proportional myoelectric controller, scientists can use a non-invasive means of studying the neural plasticity associated with modifying a muscle's force (biological +/- artificial force), as well as how motor memories for locomotor control are formed. = Rehabilitation = Robotic lower limb exoskeletons have the potential to help an individual recover from an injury such as a stroke, spinal cord injury, or other neurological disabilities. Neurological motor disorders often result in reduced volitional muscle activation amplitude, impaired proprioception, and disordered muscle coordination; a robotic exoskeleton with proportional myoelectric control can improve all three of these by amplifying the relationship between muscle activation and proprioceptive feedback. By increasing the consequences of muscle activation, an exoskeleton can improve sensory feedback in a physiological way, which in turn can improve motor control Individuals with spinal cord injury or who have had a stroke can improve their motor capabilities through intense gait rehabilitation,Dietz, V, Wirz, M, Colombo, G and Curt, A: \\"Locomotor capacity and recovery of spinal cord function in paraplegic patients: a clinical and electrophysiological evaluation\\", Electroenceph Clin Neurophysiol, 109, pg 140‚Äì53, 1998 which can require up to three physical therapists to help partially support the body weight of the individual.Behrman, A.L. and Harkema S.J.: \\"Locomotor training after human spinal cord injury: a series of case studies\\", Phys Ther, 80, pp 688‚Äì700, 2000 Robotic lower limb exoskeletons could help in both of these areas.  Physiological response  The neuromuscular system has targeted joint torques it tries to generate while walking. Assistive exoskeletons produce some of the torque needed to move one or more leg joints while walking, which allows a healthy individual to generate less muscle torque in those joints and use less metabolic energy. The muscle torque is reduced enough to keep the net torque about each joint approximately the same as when walking without an exoskeleton.Lewis, C.L. and Ferris, D.P.: \\"Invariant hip moment pattern while walking with a robotic hip exoskeleton\\", Journal of Biomechanics, 44, pp 789‚Äì93, 2011 The net torque about each joint is the muscular torque plus the actuator torque. Disabled individuals do not see much of a decrease, if any, in muscular torque while walking with an exoskeleton because their muscles are not strong enough to walk with a normal gait, or at all; the exoskeleton provides the remaining torque needed for them to walk.

It was named by Matthew Flinders in memory of John Hopkins who was one of the eight crew lost from a cutter that capsized on 21 February 1802. Since 2004, the island has been part of the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. Description Hopkins Island is located approximately south-east of Port Lincoln and west of Carrington Point, on the west coast of Thistle Island. The island is triangular in plan with its long axis being approximately and it maximum width being about . Its long axis is aligned in a north-east direction, similar to that of the north-west coast of Thistle Island. The island has an area of and has a maximum height of near its south west end. Access by boat is possible at the small beach on the island‚Äôs north coast. In 1910 it was described as \\"low-lying and somewhat bare\\". Guano deposits were found in caves on the island. It was quarried there in the 19th and early 20th centuries, in some cases under a combined lease including deposits on Lewis Island and Williams Island. In the 1930s, the lease was owned by Dr Angas Johnson, who purchased it on advice from Arthur Searcy and made it a sanctuary for seals, Cape Barren geese, rock parrots and the Stormy petrel. He had no intention of grazing goats on it, or allowing the activity to occur there. The island had a reputation for being snake infested, but this was not observed by all landing parties. Formation, geology and oceanography Hopkins Island was formed about 7000 years ago after sea levels rose at the start of the Holocene. The island has a perimeter consisting of granite over which ‚Äòa flat upper plateau‚Äô of calcarenite sits and which supports ‚Äòa thick soil bed‚Äô. The island rises from the seabed at from within of its north west coast while the same transition occurs over a distance of almost on its south coast. On its north east coast, the passage between the island and Thistle Island is relatively shallow with a maximum charted depth of due to both islands sharing the same geological base strata. Flora and fauna = Plants= As of 1996, a shrubland dominated by marsh saltbush grows in the deeper soil present on most of the upper platform. Tussock grass and nitre bush is present in locations where thinner soils lying over underlying ridges of rock. Heath bluebush dominates the thinner exposed soils on the island‚Äôs perimeter. Weed species were represented by African box thorn, common iceplant, and grasses such as red brome and rat's-tail fescue. It was suggested that these weed species have been successful due to various attempts to develop a pasture on the island suitable for grazing. = Terrestrial animals= Accounts given of the island's ecology in 1933 refer to its informal name \\"Snake Island\\" and describes large populations of snakes and rats. It also noted the presence of little penguins, \\"thousands\\" of mutton birds and their eggs. The lessee in the 1930s, Dr Angas Johnson believed Cape Barren geese also roosted on the island. The short-tailed shearwater was reported in 1996 as being the dominant animal species on the island with an estimated population of ‚Äò69700 adult birds in 34800 burrows.‚Äô Other species observed at the time include the bush rat and the black tiger snake. As of 2013, the island is reported as being an unconfirmed breeding site for flesh- footed shearwaters. =Marine animals= Australian sea lions use the beach on the island‚Äôs north west coast as a haul out site. In 1938, tuna (then referred to as \\"tunny\\") weighing up to 35 lb were caught off Hopkins Island. History The island was one of several first sighted by Europeans on Saturday, 20 February 1802, from HMS Investigator whilst under the command of Matthew Flinders entered what is now Spencer Gulf. Flinders named the island on Wednesday, 24 February 1802, in memory of John Hopkins who lost his life, presumably drowned, along with seven other members of the crew on Sunday 21 February 1802 when one of HMS Investigators cutters capsized near Cape Catastrophe. Economic activity = Guano= Hopkins Island is one of the island sites from which guano was mined under licence from the South Australian Government prior to 1919. = Tourism = Hopkins Island is notable as a venue to see, swim and snorkel with Australian sea lions. Protected areas status Since 30 September 2004, Hopkins Island has been part of the Memory Cove Wilderness Protection Area. Previously, it had been part of the Lincoln National Park. It originally obtained protected area status as a fauna reserve under the former Fauna Conservation Act 1964 in 1965 and status as a fauna conservation reserve declared under the Crown Lands Act 1929‚Äì1966 on 16 March 1967.

He graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At Harvard, Professor John Collins Warren (1778‚Äì1856) taught him scientific racism, which would pave the way for his future career as a slaveowner. Shortly after graduation, he moved to Mobile, Alabama to find work as a teacher in an academy or on a plantation in the affluent American South. Unable to find work even after meeting Henry Clay Sr. (1777‚Äì1852), he returned to the North by riding on horseback with his friend Caleb Mills (1806‚Äì1879), where they observed the ruins of Native American settlements. He then studied the Law under Henry Barnard (1811-1900). =Career= By 1834, he settled in Greensboro, Alabama. At first he longed to return home to Connecticut,The Most Esteemed Act of My Life: Family, Property, Will, and Trust in the Antebellum South but he soon became a successful lawyer. He went on to purchase a 1,500-acre plantation in Newbern, Alabama and up to 200 slaves, making him one of the largest slaveholders in Alabama at the time.Saul S.

He founded the Planter's Insurance Company and served as its President. He also owned shares in the Ohio Land Company, and his wealth increased significantly as a result of the Panic of 1837. Prior to the Civil War, he was part of the \\"planter elite.\\" He spent much of his time at the resort town of White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia and in New York City. During the American Civil War of 1861-1865, he lived in Europe. As early as 1861, he said, \\"I wish the Union could be preserved\\" and he likened secession to a family feud. After the war, he was unable to produce as much cotton as before, as worker productivity had decreased significantly and slavery was no longer an option, especially due to the ubiquitous presence of Union League members.Stephen G.

Life He was born in Mechelen, the son of the notary Peter Croon and brother of Peter Croon (1634-1682), a canon and devotional writer. He was a pupil of the prominent painter Peter Franchoys in Mechelen around 1650. He possibly left for Rome immediately after completing his training in 1657. In Rome he lived at the home of Pieter Mulier the Younger, a Dutch marine painter, in the parish of the Santa Maria del Popolo. He became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. It was customary for the Bentvueghels to adopt an appealing nickname, the so-called 'bent name'. Ignatius Croon was given the bent name Gaudtvinck (also written as Goudtvinck), which means 'bullfinch'. His name appears in one of the niches of the Santa Costanza, the Roman church where the Bentvueghels used to congregate.

The demonology of Puritans was not unusual within the Early Modern demonology of Protestants, but the use of ritual and prayer in exorcism was more distinctive. The Church of England did not recognise the ritual of exorcism, while the Roman Catholic Church has always done so. Some radical Puritan ministers performed exorcisms; but some leading Puritan writers, such as William Perkins, opposed the ritual, while accepting the underlying theories, for example about witchcraft. The term Protestant dispossession is also used, which allows for the differences from Catholic practice. There are a number of well-documented cases. John Darrell had a career as an exorcist spanning about 15 years; others were Robert Balsom, John Foxe, Edward Nyndge, and Richard Rothwell. Cessationist view and its alternative Orthodox for the Church of England, and more broadly for followers of the Protestant Reformation, was that the cessation of miracles after the apostolic times ruled out the resort to exorcism or casting out of devils. The Book of Common Prayer from 1552 made no mention of it. On the other hand, a general Calvinist pattern might be applied, of thoughtful investigation of an \\"affliction\\" attributed to God, prayer and fasting, and a minister ultimately commanding a spirit to leave the afflicted person's body. This procedure was accepted by some who would reject completely Catholic priestly exorcism. Use of fasting Fasting became important in Puritanism exorcism, but was not present in earlier Elizabethan procedures. John Foxe exorcised Robert Briggs without fasting, and John Darrell initially did not use it. The exorcism in Norwich by its bishop John Parkhurst, in 1574, may have introduced a fast day in this context. It became a sine qua non of the Puritan approach to exorcism. When Richard Bancroft as Bishop of London undertook to limit Puritanism, he had the cessationist view advanced against Darrell. In 1602 Puritan ministers who attempted an exorcism of Mary Glover were imprisoned. The new Canons of the Church of England of 1604 specified (Canon LXXII) that days of prayer and fasting for casting out of devils could be held only with the bishop's permission. The Canon did not put an end to Puritan belief in the efficacy of exorcism. On the other hand, it stamped out the public use of exorcism by clergy of the church, until the period of the English Civil War. Nonconformists continued to use exorcism.

The Jews were emancipated from the requirement of living in a ghetto in 1860. The present synagogue was erected in 1786 on the site of the older synagogue. Because Jews in that era were prohibited from building houses of worship identifiable from the street, the stone facade of the four story building is plain, resembling neighboring residential buildings.

The country is formally in the EU, but Finland does not want to be involved in sanctions against Russia.

Finnbay received several criticisms as the media website did not mention the name of its editor-in-chief, although this is required by Finnish law for both web and print news. In addition, the street address listed on the publication contact page does not exist. Finnbay however later deleted the invalid address and said that it did not want to reveal its physical address for security reasons due to having received threats from Finnish anti-immigration groups. Finnbay claimed to have an exclusive partnership with Italy's leading news agency ANSA and announced plans to start a print newspaper with the Russian-language Novosti Helsinki. But the news agency, when contacted, denied the existence of any exclusive partnership agreement apart from general content partnership with itself and Finnbay, and the editor-in-chief of Novosti Helsinki said that the extent of co-operation between Novosti Helsinki and Finnbay was limited to content exchange. The editor-in-chief of Novosti Helsinki characterised Finnbay's writers as \\"a group of enthusiastic hobbyists\\".

As early as 1909, Ernest Thompson Seton described the winter tick as a greater enemy of the moose than were \\"wolves, bears, and cougars.\\" The tick can be found all across North America, and has a large geographic distribution. While it can be found in several different habitats, it is often located in areas with a presence of moose. Some evidence indicates that increasing populations of the winter tick may be responsible for a steep decline in the eastern moose population throughout the southern half of their range. In recent years, heavy infestations up to 75,000 ticks have been seen on single moose, and can lead to the death of the animal.  Description  The winter tick is sexually dimorphic, with adult females larger than the males. The adult female is mostly reddish-brown, but with a white dorsal shield behind the head. The smaller adult male is dark brown with some white markings. Female ticks become unusually large toward the end of winter, measuring up to .  Lifecycle  The lifecycle of D. albipictus lasts for about a year, and it is a single-host tick. This means that the entire lifecycle of the tick (larvae, nymphs, and adults) progresses on a single host animal. First, in late summer, larvae hatch from eggs. After lying dormant for some time, they start to ascend vegetation and to group in clusters on plants up to 1.25 m in height. This allows them to latch onto animals that pass by and begin to feed on their hosts. While on a host, the larvae go through the nymphal stage and then finally transform into adults. Larvae became nymphs about 10 days after being applied to the moose. Nymphs then undergo a long diapause before becoming adults in roughly mid-February. One moose, which had been infected with larvae 37 days after the others, still showed a similar timing of adult ticks appearing. The diapause may serve to delay maturity until the onset of warmer weather, as has been seen in other species of ticks. During late winter, the ticks mate, and blood-filled females drop off the host to lay their eggs and die. For captive moose observed in Ontario in 1988, tick detachment occurred in late March to early April.  Effect on ecosystems  Tick populations and their effects on moose have been observed to vary from year to year. Winters that are shorter and warmer have been shown to correlate with increased numbers of ticks in moose populations. The tick not only affects moose, but also other wildlife that can be connected with the moose. In 2001, the moose abundance on Isle Royale was around 1200, but due to the ticks, the moose population fell to around 400 in 2007. With the decreased moose population, the main food source of the moose--various shrubs species and balsam fir--has had an increase in abundance. .

Shanmugam) was a Tamil theatre and film artist. He acquired the prefix \\"Avvai\\" after portraying saint-poet Avvaiyar in a play. Kamal Haasan refers to him as his Guru and says this is where he learned acting. When Kamal Hassan starred as a woman, Avvai Shanmugi, in the Tamil adaptation of Hollywood blockbuster Mrs. Doubtfire, it was the actor's tribute to his teacher and thespian. Early Life T.K. Shanmugam was born on 26 April, 1912 to Tamil parents in Thiruvananthapuram, in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore. His family hailed from Nagercoil, (in present-day Kanyakumari District). Career T.K. Shanmugam‚Äôs family had a background in theatre and acting. At the age of six, Shanmugam joined the troupe of the legendary Sankaradas Swamigal, considered the father of Tamil theatre. At the time, women did not normally venture into the field of acting, and thus it was difficult to find women to play female roles in theatre. To overcome this, Swamigal‚Äôs troupe made males to play female roles. Thus, T.K. Shanmugam acted in both male and female roles. In later years, he went on to do the title role in the play ‚ÄòAvvaiyar‚Äô, portraying the famous Tamil woman poet. Such was Shanmugam‚Äôs dedication that it is said he removed two front teeth for a more realistic portrayal of Avvaiyar, the old female poet. In his later years, he was more popularly referred to as ‚ÄòAvvai Shanmugam‚Äô. \\"He curved his lower lip inwardly to give a realistic image of an old woman without teeth. He even removed two of his teeth for the role,\\" says T.K.S. Kalaivanan, his son. \\"He had pain in his jaws for the rest of his life and the curved posture, holding a walking stick gave him constant back pain.\\"Photo of TKS Brothers A Scene from his historical drama TK Shanmugam's Drama Team His self-effacing autobiography Yenathu Nataka Vaazhkai , gives a panoramic view of the theatre from the beginning of the 20th century, the personalities involved in it, the plight of boys who were inducted into these troupes by their parent out of poverty, the social status of the actors and importantly the uncertain financial condition.

The TKS Brothers had close association with both the Communist and Dravidian movements. They used many of the songs of late communist leader P. Jeevanandham in their plays and it was Shanmugam who wrote a foreword for Annadurai's first novel, Kumasthavin Magal. As early as in 1943, T.K. Shanmugam described Annadurai as a future leader of the Tamils. In his autobiography, he had wondered how it occurred to him to call him so. Cho Ramaswamy appreciated that his contributions to Tamil stage are unparalleled. References External links *Article on T. K. Shanmugam in Madras Heritage and Carnatic Music *Article on T. K.

Along with the Finkelstein inquiry, the Convergence review was one of the most significant reviews of Australian media policy in recent years. The Finkelstein inquiry was ordered by the Federal Government in reaction to the UK's phone-hacking controversy and the subsequent Leveson Review and Convergence Review was asked to consider its findings. The final Convergence Review report was released in 2012. Background and report  The Convergence review focused on three areas: media ownership and control, content standards and promoting locally produced content. The Convergence Review's Final Report suggested a move away from platform regulation, to a framework which focussed on the size and relevance of content entities. It also suggested changes to media ownership rules, content regulation and Australian content. The Committee was chaired by Glen Boreham, former Managing Director of IBM Australia and New Zealand. It included board member and international digital executive Louise McElvogue who has worked in the UK, US and Australia and former Managing Director of SBS and deputy managing director of ABC, Malcolm Long. Reception As noted in The Conversation: \\"Media owners have always, in response to inquiry recommendations, run campaigns against any suggestion that their right to carry out their business as and how they see fit should be tampered with.\\" The review sparked strong reactions from media entities. News Corp executive Kim Williams accused the then ruling Labor government of using the review as 'political payback' while Foxtel chief executive Richard Freudenstein expressed concern over the powers of the new regulators. Other commentators argued that the reforms were needed in order to respond to the changing media environment. The review \\"proposes an entirely different philosophy of media regulation...one in which politicians don't make the key decisions about media ownership through law, merely identify the broad principles of what they want achieved and leave it to an independent regulator to accomplish\\".

Like other streams of pricing, service parts pricing is a scientific pursuit aimed at aligning service part prices internally to be logical and consistent, and at the same time aligning them externally with the market. This is done with the overarching aim of extracting the maximum possible price from service parts and thus maximize the profit margins. Pricing analysts have to be cognizant of possible repercussions of pricing their parts too high or too low in the after-sales market; they constantly have to strive to get the prices just right towards achieving maximum margins and maximum possible volumes. The after-sales market consists of service part and after-sales service. These areas often account for a low share in total sales, but for a relatively high share in total profits.Winning in the Aftermarket, Cohen et al. (2006) It is important to understand that the after-sales supply chain is very different from the manufacturing supply chain, and hence rules that apply to pricing manufacturing parts do not hold good for pricing service parts. Service parts pricing requires a different outlook and approach. Service networks deal with a considerably higher number of SKUs and a heterogeneous product portfolio, are more complex, have a sporadic nature of demand AND have minimal response times and strict SLAs. Companies have traditionally been content with outsourcing the after-sales side of their business and have encouraged third- party parts and service providers in the market. The result has been a bevy of these operators in the market with strict price competition and low margins. Increasingly, however, companies are realizing the importance of the after- sales market and its impact on customer retention and loyalty. Increasingly, also, companies have realized that they can extract higher profit margins from the after-sales services market due to the intangible nature of services. Companies are investing in their after-sales service networks to deliver high levels of customer service and in return command higher prices for their parts and services. Customers are being sold the concept of total cost of ownership (TCO) and are being made to realize that buying from OEMs comes packaged with better distribution channels, shorter response times, better knowledge on products, and ultimately higher product uptime. The challenge for companies is to provide reliable service levels in an environment of uncertainty. Unlike factories, businesses can't produce services in advance of demand. They can manufacture them only when an unpredictable event, such as a product failure, triggers a need. The challenge for Service Parts Pricing is to put a value to this customer need. Parts that are critical, for example, can command higher prices. So can parts that only the OEM provides in the market. Parts that are readily available in the market cannot, and must not, be priced to high. Another problem with after-sales market is that demand cannot be stimulated with price discounts, customers do not stock up service parts just because they are on discount. On the up-side, the fact that most service parts are inelastic means pricing analysts can raise prices without the adverse effects that manufacturing or retail networks witness. These and other characteristics of the after-sales market give Service Parts Pricing a life of its own. Companies are realizing that they can use the lever of service part pricing to increase profitability and don't have to take prices as market determined. Understanding customer needs and expectations, along with the company's internal strengths and weaknesses, goes a long way in designing an effective service part pricing strategy. Pricing strategies =Cost based pricing= left Cost based or cost-plus pricing is the approach of pricing service parts using cost as a base and then adding a standard markup on top to get the price for the service part. Cost based pricing is a popular technique and arguably still the most prevalent in the service parts pricing field. The single most important reason for such widespread popularity is the ease of implementation of this method. Even in case of lack of other information, companies usually have their spare part cost data and find it natural to apply cost based pricing. The second and complementary reason for taking this approach has been a lack of focus on service parts pricing domain for most companies in the past. Cost-Volume Death SpiralPrinciples of Marketing, Kotler and Armstrong (2013) Cost based pricing, however, suffers from some fundamental flaws. Firstly, costs are not fixed but fluctuate with raw material prices, purchased volumes, supplier contracts etc. Pure cost based pricing thus causes fluctuating prices which can result in customer confusion, dissatisfaction and demand fluctuations. Although, service parts are less price elastic than their manufacturing counterparts, continued reliance on cost based pricing can ultimately make customers sensitive to price fluctuations ‚Äì if not to the actual prices then to the frequency of price changes. This can cause demand to start being affected by the frequent price changes, and can even push the company into a death spiral. Secondly, cost based pricing does not take competition into account and may result in severe under or over pricing of service parts relative to the market. This may also result in under pricing of strong products and over pricing of weak ones. Recent research also shows that cost based pricing can lead to lower than average profitability.Customer value-based pricing strategies: why companies resist Andreas Hinterhuber (2008) When service part prices are set directly from costs, companies basically have no control over their prices and it is in fact the suppliers who control prices. These suppliers might not know the true market conditions and thus might be leading to sub-optimal prices. Relying on costs also means that cost reductions achieved by the purchasing department in a company are passed on directly to the customers and not utilized by the company at all. Most companies that use cost based pricing realize the pitfalls and try to soften the impact by never lowering prices with cost reductions, but only increasing them when costs run too high. If they encounter price resistance in the market, they deal with it by providing discounts based on customer relationship or order volume or order criticality etc. However, when customers are rewarded with discounts for their price resistance, the resistance becomes more frequent even when the product is valuable for them.Strategy and Tactics of Pricing Nagle & Homan (2006) Even when used in conjunction with part segmentation on business groups, part lifecycle and part criticality to decide more granular markups on cost, the approach still tends to generate prices that are not simple to comprehend for customers. Customers are used to comparing prices among similar parts from the same company and also across part manufacturers in the market. Exposing them to inconsistent service part pricing runs the risk of losing customer confidence, and eventually the customers. Cost based pricing is still a useful method for specific categories of service parts. Low volume parts sold once in a product-lifetime have little effect on profitability but do need a price in the market. Such parts can be priced using the cost based approach with slight markups on the cost of the parts. Other examples are standard parts such as bolts and screws that must be priced. These can also be priced simply using cost based approach. A useful case for cost based pricing is that of high-warranty parts. Since these parts do not generate revenue for the company, it makes sense to keep them as close to the actual cost as possible. =Internal alignment= 500px The end goal of internal price alignment is to achieve consistency in pricing and to establish prices that make sense to the end customers. Price alignment to part groups may also show areas to increase prices without causing too much discomfort to the customers. Since the customers expect prices of similar parts to be similar, it may be possible to increase prices for parts that were previously too low. Exhaust pipes on two different models of car should be similarly priced, for example. If one costs considerably less than the other, due to sourcing location, raw material, bulk contracts etc., it provides an opportunity to increase price and make the price consistent with other exhausts. Similarly companies may decide to have leader-follower relationships between their service parts, and may require followers to derive prices from leaders. Driver door might be the leader and other doors the followers, priced with a slight mark down. Standard floor mats can be leaders and carpeted mats the followers, priced with an additional mark up. A popular practice is to align the prices of part kits with the service parts that constitute the kit. Kits are usually sold at a discount to increase volumes and to sell together components that companies think complement each other. It is also a mechanism to lock customers to OEM parts and not give them many opportunities to explore third party after market vendors. Customers also need to see the logic in buying a whole kit and generally compare prices of individual components with the price of the kit. For some companies kits compete directly with similar kits in the market and thus need to be handled effectively. Since the after- sales market needs to service products for the complete life of the product, service contracts for durable goods usually run into many years after the product is sold. Through this time service parts become obsolete and get replaced by new parts. This may happen due to technological advancements, supplier preferences or plain cost constraints on the raw materials being used. The situation is such that as high as 23% of all inventory may become obsolete every year. Companies need to be able to price new service parts as they come in and they need to do this being consistent with the parts being replaced and other internal groups that the part may belong to. In come cases companies may also want to price the replaced part in accordance with the one replacing it. Another usual scenario is to look at the part in the supersession chain that has the maximum holding inventory and align the whole chain to this part. This is done to help burn down the excess inventory of the replaced part, by slightly marking up the other parts for example. Companies may also apply overarching rounding rules on their service part prices to give a semblance of consistency. Pricing parts ending with 99 cent values, for example, is a common practice. The rounding rules may vary by geography, product lines, or distribution channel depending on company policies. Companies seldom round-down their prices and prefer to only round-up which can provide additional, albeit small, margin improvements on the parts. =Market based pricing= 300px The outward looking pricing methodology for service parts is called market based pricing. Service part prices are based on the competition part prices, where companies try to keep their own prices competitive in the market. Prices might be based on the average price in the market, or the minimum price, or the maximum price among the competition for a service part. Additionally, prices might be marked up or down in comparison to a key competitor in the market. Honda might want to price its headlights solely based on how Toyota prices theirs, and not be concerned about other competitors in the market. This could be because the other competitors are insignificant in the particular market or that Honda is taking a strategic decision to chase Toyota service part prices. Market based pricing gives companies a means to align themselves to the market at large and gives companies price thresholds to be working in. In highly competitive markets, market based pricing becomes almost essential. Additionally, OEMs segregate their competitive parts from their captive ones and apply market based pricing only on the competitive parts. There may also be instances where companies take a strategic decision to lose money on the competitive parts and cover up on their captive and critical parts. This is usually done to retain market share and customer share of mind. It is tempting to lower prices to gain market share for companies, but that would not be able to go unnoticed by the competition. Such tactics may lead to short term market advantage but may consequently lead to a downward, value destroying spiral for these companies. The decision to cut prices for market share is especially dangerous in the service parts industry since most parts are not price elastic to start with. Price cuts may do little more than set new expectations on service part prices and never even manage to gain market share. A decision to lower service part prices to undercut the market, in general, may signal poor financial decision making from a company On the other hand, effective use of market data to find avenues for price increases is a particularly beneficial strategy. Companies might be leaving money on the table by unnecessarily pricing their parts low in some cases and may be able to increase prices without fear of a market backlash. Companies may also be able to benchmark their customer reach and brand value against their competitors, and use this information in conjunction with the market data to decide how much higher or lower they may price their service parts. Market data that does not look at competitor prices may be in form of customer surveys and attempts to find the customer willingness to pay (WTP). Companies may use this information to decide how much their parts are valued in the market and how much they may be able to charge for them. This approach blurs into the value-based pricing approach in service parts pricing and is most powerful when blended with competition information. However, the problem with this approach is that customers are seldom honest about how much they want to pay. =Value based pricing= 300px Value or economic value is the benefit that a consumer derives after using a product or a service. In most cases the benefit is measured in terms of currency (money) and hence the name economic value. Economic value is not the same as market price; if a consumer is paying for a product or a service his measure of perceived value from the same could be higher than what he pays for it in the market. The maximum amount (of something, usually currency) that the consumer would agree to pay for a product or service is called willingness to pay (WTP). It follows, therefore, that a consumer would buy a product or a service at the market price when it is lower or equal to his WTP. WTP varies per consumer as the perceived value of the product or service is subjective and may differ substantially from one consumer to another. However, market price for the product or service is the same for all consumers (in absence of price discrimination), and hence consumers whose WTP is equal to or higher than the market price buy it, and the rest decide not to. Another peculiarity due to the subjective nature of the perceived value of any product or service is that this may vary greatly from the real value that is provided on consumption. For example, the first cellular phones introduced in the market had few early adopters since the perceived value of a phone that could be carried on person was low. Over time, however, cellular phones have proved to be an integral part of human race as a whole and most people consider them a necessity. A contrary case can be made for kitchen appliances that have high perceived value while being bought but deliver lesser and lesser real value over time as they spend most of their time locked in kitchen closets. Cases where the perceived value is lower than the real value of the product or the service are of special interest to marketers and pricing analysts since they provide room for price increases via improvements in product perception in the market (usually through increased advertisement) Value based pricingValue based pricing is an approach that suggests pricing after the consumers' perception of value. This approach completely reverses the process of pricing in contrast to the cost based pricing approach, and is in fact gaining acceptance as a superior method of pricing. Estimating a product's economic value to the customer could be a difficult, but an essential, task for a pricing analyst or a marketer. Economic Value Estimation or EVE is a method that is used to do the same, and requires setting a reference value equal to the cost of the next best alternative to the customer and then adding a differentiation value to get the final price. The differentiation value can be calculated by taking into account what economical benefits the product or service provides over the next best alternative ‚Äì for example lowering customer's labor cost, providing higher quality product, providing higher product support etc. For service parts in particular, the differentiation value can be estimated by determining the value drivers and estimating how important these are to the customers. For example, material finish for car alloy wheels can be a value driver that can be estimated, or diameter of the wheel can be used as a value driver. Putting price values to these drivers can be done in multiple ways ‚Äì focus groups, conjoint analysis, advanced analytics on sales data, or precious old pricing analyst's experience. Value based pricing decouples part prices from the part costs and thus provides stability to the prices. Combining value based pricing with market based pricing can result in better market segmentation and better targeted prices. Value based pricing may also uncover competitive niches for a company and allow them to command higher margins than their peers in the market.

She was educated at Southall County Secondary School, then at Bedford College, London University, where she obtained a first-class degree in 1921. Whetnall was an external doctoral student of Susan Stebbing, at Bedford College where she wrote her thesis on the theory of symbols. They were friends, and Stebbing, in the preface to her book A Modern Introduction to Logic (1930), wrote: ‚Äú...in personal discussion I owe more than I can say to my friend, Miss E.M. Whetnall‚Äù. Whetnall was a non-resident Director of Studies and Lecturer in Moral Sciences (philosophy) for Girton College and Newnham College. She attended Girton College, Cambridge as a Jex- Blake student between 1924 and 1926. While at Cambridge, she was one of the first woman officers in the Moral Sciences Club, in her role as Club Secretary for a paper Bertrand Russell delivered on 3 December 1926. After completing her doctorate in 1929, Whetnall subsequently held a number of teaching posts first at Kingsley School, Hampstead, then as a lecturer at Huguenot College, University of South Africa. She returned to Bedford College as Stebbing's temporary replacement during 1930 and 1931 She also taught at the Hillcroft College for Working Women, Surbiton, a women's residential college from 1932 to 1943. In 1925, she became one of very few women to be elected to the membership of the Aristotelian Society and was an active member and frequent panel discussant in the company of other notable panellists including G.E. Moore, John Wisdom, C.D. Broad, and Stace. In the early 1930s she considered metaphysical analysis to be useful for considering the psychological process of concept formation. She contributed to works on logic such as the revised edition of James Welton's An Intermediate Logic. Whetnall married William James Smith on 30 August 1939.

Increasingly, elements and principles of game design are also applied to other interactions, in the form of gamification. Game design creates goals, rules and challenges to define a board game, card game, dice game, casino game, role-playing game, sport, video game, war game or simulation that produces desirable interactions among its participants and, possibly, spectators. Academically, game design is part of game studies, while game theory studies strategic decision making (primarily in non-game situations). Games have historically inspired seminal research in the fields of probability, artificial intelligence, economics, and optimization theory. Applying game design to itself is a current research topic in metadesign. History Sports (see history of sports), gambling, and board games are known, respectively, to have existed for at least nine thousand, six thousand, and four thousand years. =Folk process= Tabletop games played today whose descent can be traced from ancient times include chess, go, pachisi, backgammon, mahjong, mancala, and pick-up sticks. The rules of these games were not codified until early modern times and their features gradually evolved and changed over time, through the folk process. Given this, these games are not considered to have had a designer or been the result of a design process in the modern sense. After the rise of commercial game publishing in the late 19th century, many games that had formerly evolved via folk processes became commercial properties, often with custom scoring pads or preprepared material. For example, the similar public domain games Generala, Yacht, and Yatzy led to the commercial game Yahtzee in the mid-1950s. Today, many commercial games, such as Taboo, Balderdash, Pictionary, or Time's Up!, are descended from traditional parlour games. Adapting traditional games to become commercial properties is an example of game design. Similarly, many sports, such as soccer and baseball, are the result of folk processes, while others were designed, such as basketball, invented in 1891 by James Naismith. =New media= Technological advances have provided new media for games throughout history. The printing press allowed packs of playing cards, adapted from Mahjong tiles, to be mass-produced, leading to many new card games. Accurate topographic maps produced as lithographs and provided free to Prussian officers helped popularize wargaming. Cheap bookbinding (printed labels wrapped around cardboard) led to mass-produced board games with custom boards. Inexpensive (hollow) lead figurine casting contributed to the development of miniature wargaming. Cheap custom dice led to poker dice. Flying discs led to disc golf and Ultimate. Personal computers contributed to the popularity of computer games, leading to the wide availability of video game consoles and video games. Smart phones have led to a proliferation of mobile games. The first games in a new medium are frequently adaptations of older games. Pong, one of the first widely disseminated video games, adapted table tennis. Later games will often exploit distinctive properties of a new medium. Adapting older games and creating original games for new media are both examples of game design. Theory Game studies or gaming theory is a discipline that deals with the critical study of games, game design, players, and their role in society and culture. Prior to the late-twentieth century, the academic study of games was rare and limited to fields such as history and anthropology. As the video game revolution took off in the early 1980s, so did academic interest in games, resulting in a field that draws on diverse methodologies and schools of thought. These influences may be characterized broadly in three ways: the social science approach, the humanities approach, and the industry and engineering approach.Konzack, Lars (2007). \\"Rhetorics of Computer and Video Game Research\\" in Williams & Smith (ed.) The Players' Realm: Studies on the Culture of Video Games and gaming. McFarland. Broadly speaking, the social scientific approach has concerned itself with the question of \\"What do games do to people?\\" Using tools and methods such as surveys, controlled laboratory experiments, and ethnography researchers have investigated both the positive and negative impacts that playing games could have on people. More sociologically informed research has sought to move away from simplistic ideas of gaming as either 'negative' or 'positive', but rather seeking to understand its role and location in the complexities of everyday life. In general terms, the humanities approach has concerned itself with the question of \\"What meanings are made through games?\\" Using tools and methods such as interviews, ethnographies and participant observation, researchers have investigated the various roles that videogames play in people's lives and activities together with the meaning they assign to their experiences.Consalvo, 2007 From an industry perspective, a lot of game studies research can be seen as the academic response to the videogame industry's questions regarding the products it creates and sells. The main question this approach deals with can be summarized as \\"How can we create better games?\\" with the accompanying \\"What makes a game good?\\" \\"Good\\" can be taken to mean many different things, including providing an entertaining and an engaging experience, being easy to learn and play, and being innovative and having novel experiences. Different approaches to studying this problem have included looking at describing how to design gamesRollings and Morris, 2000; Rouse III, 2001 and extracting guidelines and rules of thumb for making better gamesFabricatore et al., 2002; Falstein, 2004 =Strategic decision making= Game theory is a study of strategic decision making. Specifically, it is \\"the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers\\".Roger B. Myerson (1991). Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict, Harvard University Press, p. 1\\\\. Chapter-preview links, pp. vii‚Äìxi. An alternative term suggested \\"as a more descriptive name for the discipline\\" is interactive decision theory.R. J. Aumann ([1987] 2008). \\"game theory,\\" Introduction, The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition. Abstract. The subject first addressed zero-sum games, such that one person's gains exactly equal net losses of the other participant or participants. Today, however, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and has developed into an umbrella term for the logical side of decision science. The games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the players of the game, the information and actions available to each player at each decision point, and the payoffs for each outcome. (Rasmusen refers to these four \\"essential elements\\" by the acronym \\"PAPI\\".)‚Ä¢ Eric Rasmusen (2007). Games and Information, 4th ed. Description and chapter-preview. ‚Ä¢ David M. Kreps (1990). Game Theory and Economic Modelling. Description. ‚Ä¢ R. Aumann and S. Hart, ed. (1992, 2002). Handbook of Game Theory with Economic Applications v. 1, ch. 3‚Äì6 and v. 3, ch. 43. A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a solution concept of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium strategies for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an equilibrium to the game‚Äîa stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability. . Design elements Games can be characterized by \\"what the player does\\" and what the player experiences. This is often referred to as gameplay. Major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of game. =Tools of play= Games are often classified by the components required to play them (e.g. miniatures, a ball, cards, a board and pieces, or a computer). In places where the use of leather is well established, the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history, resulting in a worldwide popularity of ball games such as rugby, basketball, football, cricket, tennis, and volleyball. Other tools are more idiosyncratic to a certain region. Many countries in Europe, for instance, have unique standard decks of playing cards. Other games such as chess may be traced primarily through the development and evolution of its game pieces. Many game tools are tokens, meant to represent other things. A token may be a pawn on a board, play money, or an intangible item such as a point scored. Games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not utilise any obvious tool; rather, their interactivity is defined by the environment. Games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is altered. For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game in a park; an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course, even with the same cars. =Rule development= Whereas games are often characterized by their tools, they are often defined by their rules. While rules are subject to variations and changes, enough change in the rules usually results in a \\"new\\" game. There are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own rules, but even then there are often immutable meta-rules. Rules generally determine turn order, the rights and responsibilities of the players, each player's goals, and how game components interact with each other to produce changes in a game's state. Player rights may include when they may spend resources or move tokens. Victory conditions Common win conditions are being first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens (as in Settlers of Catan), having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the game (as in Monopoly), some relationship of one's game tokens to those of one's opponent (as in chess's checkmate), or reaching a certain point in a storyline (as in most roleplay- games). =Single or multiplayer= Most games require multiple players. Single-player games are unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces. Unlike a game with multiple players competing with or against each other to reach the game's goal, a single-player game is against an element of the environment, against one's own skills, against time, or against chance. This is also true of cooperative games, in which multiple players share a common goal and win or lose together. Many games described as \\"single-player\\" or \\"cooperative\\" could alternatively be described as puzzles or recreations, in that they do not involve strategic behavior (as defined by game theory), in which the expected reaction of an opponent to a possible move becomes a factor in choosing which move to make. Games against opponents simulated with artificial intelligence differ from other single-player games in that the algorithms used usually do incorporate strategic behavior. =Storyline and plot= Stories told in games may focus on narrative elements that can be communicated through the use of mechanics and player choice. Narrative plots in games generally have a clearly defined and simplistic structure. Mechanical choices on the part of the designer(s) often drastically effect narrative elements in the game. However, due to a lack of unified and standardized teaching and understanding of narrative elements in games, individual interpretations, methods, and terminology vary wildly. Because of this, most narrative elements in games are created unconsciously and intuitively. However, as a general rule, game narratives increase in complexity and scale as player choice or game mechanics increase in complexity and scale. One example of this is removing a players ability to directly affect the plot for a limited time. This lack of player choice necessitates an increase in mechanical complexity, and could be used as a metaphor to symbolize depression that is felt by a character in the narrative. =Luck and strategy= A game's tools and rules will result in its requiring skill, strategy, luck, or a combination thereof, and are classified accordingly. Games of skill include games of physical skill, such as wrestling, tug of war, hopscotch, target shooting, and horseshoes, and games of mental skill such as checkers and chess. Games of strategy include checkers, chess, go, arimaa, and tic-tac-toe, and often require special equipment to play them. Games of chance include gambling games (blackjack, mah-jongg, roulette, etc.), as well as snakes and ladders and rock, paper, scissors; most require equipment such as cards or dice. Most games contain two or all three of these elements. For example, American football and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy while tiddlywinks, poker, and Monopoly combine strategy and chance. Many card and board games combine all three; most trick-taking games involve mental skill, strategy, and an element of chance, as do many strategic board games such as Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Carcassonne. =Use as educational tool= By learning through play children can develop social and cognitive skills, mature emotionally, and gain the self-confidence required to engage in new experiences and environments.Human growth and the development of personality, Jack Kahn, Susan Elinor Wright, Pergamon Press, Key ways that young children learn include playing, being with other people, being active, exploring and new experiences, talking to themselves, communication with others, meeting physical and mental challenges, being shown how to do new things, practicing and repeating skills and having fun.Learning, playing and interacting. Good practice in early years foundation stage. Page 9 Play develops children's content knowledge and provides children the opportunity to develop social skills, competences and disposition to learn.Wood, E. and J. Attfield. (2005). Play, learning and the early childhood curriculum. 2nd ed. London: Paul Chapman Play-based learning is based on a Vygotskian model of scaffolding where the teacher pays attention on specific elements of the play activity and provides encouragement and feedback on children's learning.Martlew, J., Stephen, C. & Ellis, J. (2011). Play in the primary school classroom? The experience of teachers supporting children's learning through a new pedagogy. Early Years, 31(1), 71‚Äì83. When children engage in real-life and imaginary activities, play can be challenging in children's thinking.Whitebread, D., Coltman, P., Jameson, H. & Lander, R. (2009). Play, cognition and self regulation: What exactly are children learning when they learn through play? Educational & Child Psychology, 26(2), 40‚Äì52. To extend the learning process, sensitive intervention can be provided with adult support when necessary during play-based learning. Development process Game design is part of a game's development from concept to its final form. Typically, the development process is an iterative process, with repeated phases of testing and revision. During revision, additional design or re-design may be needed. =Development team= Game designer A game designer (or inventor) is the person who invents a game's concept, its central mechanisms, and its rules. Often, the game designer also invents the game's title and, if the game isn't abstract, its theme. Sometimes these activities are done by the game publisher, not the designer, or may be dictated by a licensed property (such as when designing a game based on a film). Game developer A game developer is the person who fleshes out the details of a game's design, oversees its testing, and revises the game in response to player feedback. Often the game designer is also its developer, although some publishers do extensive development of games to suit their particular target audience after licensing a game from a designer. For larger games, such as collectible card games and most video games, a team is used and the designer and developer roles are usually split among multiple people. Game artist A game artist is an artist who creates art for one or more types of games. Many graphic elements of games are created by the designer when producing a prototype of the game, revised by the developer based on testing, and then further refined by the artist and combined with artwork as a game is prepared for publication or release. For video games, game artists are responsible for all of the aspects of game development that call for visual art.Gamespot UK ‚Äì So You Want To Be An: Artist ‚Äì Accessed 17 November 2012. Game artists are often vital to and credited in role-playing games, collectible card games and video games.Exhibitions: The Art of Video Games ‚Äì Accessed 17 November 2012. =Concept= A game concept is an idea for a game, briefly describing its core play mechanisms, who the players represent, and how they win or lose. A game concept may be \\"pitched\\" to a game publisher in a similar manner as film ideas are pitched to potential film producers. Alternatively, game publishers holding a game license to intellectual property in other media may solicit game concepts from several designers before picking one to design a game, typically paying the designer in advance against future royalties. =Design= During design, a game concept is fleshed out. Mechanisms are specified in terms of components (boards, cards, on-screen entities, etc.) and rules. The play sequence and possible player actions are defined, as well as how the game starts, ends, and what is its winning condition. In video games, storyboards and screen mockups may be created. =Prototype= A game prototype is a draft version of a game used for testing. Typically, creating a prototype marks the shift from game design to game development and testing. Although prototyping in regards to human-computer interaction and interaction design are both studied, the use of prototyping in game design has remained relatively unexplored. It's known that game design has clear benefits from prototyping, such as exploring new game design possibilities and technologies, the field of game design has different characteristics than other types of software industries that considers prototyping in game design in a different category and need a new perspective =Testing= Game testing is a major part of game development. During testing, players play the game and provide feedback on its gameplay, the usability of its components or screen elements, the clarity of its goals and rules, ease of learning, and enjoyment to the game developer. The developer then revises the design, its components, presentation, and rules before testing it again. Later testing may take place with focus groups to test consumer reactions before publication. During testing, various balance issues may be identified, requiring changes to the game's design. Video game testing is a software testing process for quality control of video games.Bates 2004, pp. 176‚Äì180Moore, Novak 2010, p. 95Oxland 2004, p. 301-302 The primary function of game testing is the discovery and documentation of software defects (aka bugs). Interactive entertainment software testing is a highly technical field requiring computing expertise, analytic competence, critical evaluation skills, and endurance.Bates 2004, pp. 178, 180Oxland 2004, p. 301 Issues Different types of games pose different game design issues. =Board games= Charles Darrow's 1935 patent for Monopoly includes specific design elements developed during the prototype phase. Prototypes are very common in the later stages of board game design, and \\"prototype circles\\" in many cities today provide an opportunity for designers to play and critique each other's games. Board game design is the development of rules and presentational aspects of a board game. When a player takes part in a game, it is the player's self-subjection to the rules that creates a sense of purpose for the duration of the game.Neyfakh, Leon. \\"Quest for fun; Sometimes the most addictive new technology comes in a simple cardboard box\\". Boston Globe. 11 March 2012 Maintaining the players' interest throughout the gameplay experience is the goal of board game design.Wadley, Carma. \\"Rules of the game: Do you have what it takes to invent the next 'Monopoly'?\\" Deseret News. 18 November 2008. To achieve this, board game designers emphasize different aspects such as social interaction, strategy, and competition, and target players of differing needs by providing for short versus long-play, and luck versus skill. Beyond this, board game design reflects the culture in which the board game is produced. The most ancient board games known today are over 5000 years old. They are frequently abstract in character and their design is primarily focused on a core set of simple rules. Of those that are still played today, games like go (c.400BC), mancala (c.700AD), and chess (c.600AD) have gone through many presentational and/or rule variations. In the case of chess, for example, new variants are developed constantly, to focus on certain aspects of the game, or just for variation's sake. Traditional board games date from the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Whereas ancient board game design was primarily focused on rules alone, traditional board games were often influenced by Victorian mores. Academic (e.g. history and geography) and moral didacticism were important design features for traditional games, and Puritan associations between dice and the Devil meant that early American game designers eschewed their use in board games entirely.Johnson, Bruce E. \\"Board games: affordable and abundant, boxed amusements from the 1930s and '40s recall the cultural climate of an era.\\" Country Living. 1 December 1997. Even traditional games that did use dice, like Monopoly (based on the 1906 The Landlord's Game), were rooted in educational efforts to explain political concepts to the masses. By the 1930s and 1940s, board game design began to emphasize amusement over education, and characters from comic strips, radio programmes, and (in the 1950s) television shows began to be featured in board game adaptations. Recent developments in modern board game design can be traced to the 1980s in Germany, and have led to increased popularity of \\"German-style board games\\" (also known as \\"Eurogames\\" or \\"designer games\\"). The design emphasis of these board games is to give players meaningful choices. This is manifested by eliminating elements like randomness and luck to be replaced by skill, strategy, and resource competition, by removing the potential for players to fall irreversibly behind in the early stages of a game, and by reducing the number of rules and possible player options to produce what Alan R. Moon has described as \\"elegant game design\\". The concept of elegant game design has been identified by The Boston Globe's Leon Neyfakh as related to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's concept of \\"flow\\" from his 1990 book, \\"Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience\\". Modern technological advances have had a democratizing effect on board game production, with services like Kickstarter providing designers with essential startup capital and tools like 3D printers facilitating the production of game pieces and board game prototypes.Whigfield, Nick. \\"Video Hasn't Killed Interest in Board Games ; New Technologies Have Contributed to Revival of Tabletop Entertainment\\". The Irish Times. 12 May 2014.Hesse, Monica. \\"Rolling the dice on a jolly good pastime\\". The Washington Post. 29 August 2011. A modern adaptation of figure games are miniature wargames like Warhammer 40,000. =Card games= Card games include games with cards that are custom- tailored to the game, as in many modern games, as well as those whose design is constricted by the type of the deck of cards, like Tarot or the four-suited Latin decks. Card games can be played for fun, such as Go Fish, or as gambling games, such as Poker. In Asian cultures, special sets of tiles can serve the same function as cards, as in mahjong, a game similar to (and thought to be the distant ancestor of) the Western card game rummy. Western dominoes games are believed to have developed from Asian tile games in the 18th century. Magic: The Gathering was the first collectible card game (or \\"trading card game\\") in 1993. The line between card and board games is not clear-cut, as many card games, such as solitaire, involve playing cards to form a \\"tableau\\", a spatial layout or board. Many board games, in turn, uses specialized cards to provide random events, such as the Chance cards of Monopoly (game), or as the central mechanism driving play, as in many card-driven wargames. As cards are typically shuffled and revealed gradually during play, most card games involve randomness, either initially or during play, and hidden information, such as the cards in a player's hand. This is in contrast to many board games, in which most of the game's current state is visible to all participants, even though players may also have a small amount of private information, such as the letter tiles on each player's rack during Scrabble. How players play their cards, revealing information and interacting with previous plays as they do so, is central to card game design. In partnership card games, such as Bridge, rules limiting communication between players on the same team become an important part of the game design. This idea of limited communication has been extended to cooperative card games, such as Hanabi. =Dice games= A set of poker dice and a dice cup Dice games are among the oldest known games and have often been associated with gambling. Non-gambling dice games, such as Yatzy, Poker dice, or Yahtzee became popular in the mid-20th century. The line between dice and board games is not clear-cut, as dice are often used as randomization devices in board games, such as Monopoly or Risk, while serving as the central drivers of play in games such as Backgammon or Pachisi. Dice games differ from card games in that each throw of the dice is an independent event, whereas the odds of a given card being drawn is affected by all the previous cards drawn or revealed from a deck. Dice game design often centers around forming scoring combinations and managing re-rolls, either by limiting their number, as in Yahtzee, or by introducing a press-your-luck element, as in Can't Stop. =Casino games= All casino games are designed to mathematically favor the house. The house edge for a slot machine can range widely between 2 and 15 percent.Shackleford, Michael. \\"House Edge of casino games compared\\". Wizardofodds.com. Retrieved 9 December 2013. Casino game design can entail the creation of an entirely new casino game, the creation of a variation on an existing casino game, or the creation of a new side bet on an existing casino game.Lubin, Dan. \\"Casino Game Design: From Cocktail Napkin Sketch to Casino Floor\\". Available: . Retrieved 13 December 2014. Casino game mathematician, Michael Shackleford has noted that it is much more common for casino game designers today to make successful variations than entirely new casino games.Shackleford, Michael. \\"Ten Commandments for Game Inventors\\". Wizardofodds.com. Retrieved 13 December 2014. Gambling columnist John Grochowski points to the emergence of community-style slot machines in the mid-1990s, for example, as a successful variation on an existing casino game type.Grochowski, John. \\"Gaming Guru: Tracing Back the Roots of Some Popular Gaming Machines at Casinos\\". The Press of Atlantic City. 28 August 2013. Unlike the majority of other games which are designed primarily in the interest of the player, one of the central aims of casino game design is to optimize the house advantage and maximize revenue from gamblers. Successful casino game design works to provide entertainment for the player and revenue for the gambling house. To maximise player entertainment, casino games are designed with simple easy-to-learn rules that emphasize winning (i.e. whose rules enumerate many victory conditions and few loss conditions), and that provide players with a variety of different gameplay postures (e.g. card hands). Player entertainment value is also enhanced by providing gamblers with familiar gaming elements (e.g. dice and cards) in new casino games. To maximise success for the gambling house, casino games are designed to be easy for croupiers to operate and for pit managers to oversee. The two most fundamental rules of casino game design is that the games must be non- fraudable (including being as nearly as possible immune from advantage gambling), and that they must mathematically favor the house winning. Shackleford suggests that the optimum casino game design should give the house an edge of smaller than 5%. =Role-playing games= The design of role- playing games requires the establishment of setting, characters, and basic gameplay rules or mechanics. After a role-playing game is produced, additional design elements are often devised by the players themselves. In many instances, for example, character creation is left to the players. Likewise, the progression of a role-playing game is determined in large part by the gamemaster whose individual campaign design may be directed by one of several role-playing game theories. There is no central core for tabletop role-playing game theory because different people want such different things out of the games. Probably the most famous category of RPG theory, GNS Theory assumes that people want one of three things out of the game ‚Äì a better, more interestingly challenging game, to create a more interesting story, or a better simulation ‚Äì in other words better rules to support worldbuilding. GNS Theory has been abandoned by its creator, partly because it neglects emotional investment, and partly because it just didn't work properly. There are techniques that people use (such as dice pools) to better create the game they want ‚Äì but with no consistent goal or agreement for what makes for a good game there's no overarching theory generally agreed on. =Sports= Sports games are made with the same rules as the sport the game portrays. Retrieved on 15 December 2014. Retrieved on 14 December 2014 Retrieved on 15 December 2014. =Video games= prototypes created during the pre-production design phase are often used as a proof of concept for the implementation of new rules or gameplay features. Video game design is a process that takes place in the pre-production phase of video game development. In the video game industry, game design describes the creation of the content and rules of a video game. The goal of this process for the game designer is to provide players with the opportunity to make meaningful decisions in relation to playing the game. Elements of video game design such as the establishment of fundamental gameplay rules provide a framework within which players will operate, while the addition of narrative structures provide players with a reason to care about playing the game. To establish the rules and narrative, an internally consistent game world is created, requiring visual, audio, and programming development for world, character, and level design. The amount of work that is required to accomplish this often demands the use of a design team which may be divided into smaller game design disciplines. In order to maintain internal consistency between the teams, a specialized software design document known as a \\"game design document\\" (and sometimes an even broader scope \\"game bible\\" document) provides overall contextual guidance on ambient mood, appropriate tone, and other less tangible aspects of the game world. An important aspect of video game design is human-computer interaction and game feel. =War games= H. G. Wells playing Little Wars The first military war games, or Kriegsspiel, were designed in Prussia in the 19th century to train staff officers. They are also played as a hobby for entertainment. Modern war games are designed to test doctrines, strategies and tactics in full scale exercises with opposing forces at venues like the NTC, JRTC and the JMRC, involving NATO countries.

The celebration commemorates the inauguration of the first Brahmo Samaj by Ram Mohan Roy on 23 January 1830, which was on 11 Magh according to the Bengali calendar in that year. Maghotsav is celebrated with traditional fervour and gaiety by Brahmos all over the world. It is celebrated by divine service or prayer, offered by the acharya or minister, interspersed with devotional hymns popularly known as Brahmasangeet. In Kolkata, which is now the main seat of Brahmoism, week long celebrations are carried out in the Brahmo Samajes like Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, Navavidhan Brahmo Samaj, Brahmo Sammilan Samaj. The other Samajes in Bengal like Harinavi, Konnagar, Baniban, Nimta, Puddopukur also join in the festivities. A special divine service is held on 11 Magh at Jorasanko Thakur Bari - the seat of the Tagore's in Kolkata where ministers from the three main Samajes join together in performing the Maghotsav. The songs are sung by the music group Baitanik - founded by late Soumendranath Tagore. Maghotsav is also celebrated in other Brahmo Samajes in India and the Brahmo educational institutions as well and in Tagore's Santiniketan.

History The Mining Association of Great Britain was established in 1854 to represent mining industry employers. Its purpose was to review proposed legislation that could affect the owners, and take action in necessary. There was a central policy committee and various sub-committees. The MAGB participated in discussions over mine worker's wages, hours and employment conditions. It published a journal, ran schools and a college of mining, and funded research into ways to prevent coal dust from causing explosions in the mines. The MAGB worked with the government's National Conciliation Board for the Coal Mining Industry and the Mineworkers' Federation of Great Britain. Following World War I (1914‚Äì18) there was discussion about the possibility of the mines being nationalized. Some of the owners were open to this if they could get sufficient compensation. Evan Williams, chairman of the Monmouthshire and South Wales Coal Owners' Association and soon to become virtually the life-president of the MAGB, told the MSWCOA that there would inevitably be some change in structure, and \\"there are certain owners who think it would be advisable to accept Nationalisation. There is, to an extent, an amount of justification for this, but it must be remembered that it is not in the Nation's interests, as well as the Owner's interests, that this should be resorted to.\\" The MAGB became largely irrelevant after the coal industry was nationalized in 1947. It was dissolved on 23 September 1954. Presidents Presidents of the association included: *Sir Frederick Jones, 1st Baronet *W. E.

Muir himself knew that with the injury his time had come to retire, a decision not brought on by team performance but by his knowledge of his personal limitations to his own fitness and a previous race, the Allan Scally Relay, as a gauge for the upcoming Glasgow-Edinburgh run.

Numerous signature seals have been found in Ba‚ÄìShu graves, suggesting that the states used written records, though none have been found. The known inscriptions are too few to be deciphered, or even to identify the language recorded. The first script was used to decorate weapons found in Ba graves in eastern Sichuan. It features tiger-totem motifs and other pictographic symbols. The longest inscription, on a lacquer tray found near Changsha, Hunan, consists of 11 symbols. The second script is found in both western and eastern Sichuan, on five halberd blades, a belt buckle and the base of a bronze vessel. Some scholars believe this script to be phonetic, pointing to similarities between some of the symbols and symbols of the later Yi script. Except for one symbol resembling the Chinese character Áéã (\\"king\\"), the symbols cannot be connected with Chinese characters, or with the earlier pictographic script. The third script is known from a single sample, an inscription on the lid of a bronze vessel found in a grave in Baihuatan, Chengdu dating from c. 476 BC. It may also be phonetic.

Springboks wing Chester Williams was on the cover. SA Rugby magazine was initially published by Random House Struik, before being sold to Strobe Publishing, which published the magazine until the December 2001-January 2002 issue, when Strobe closed. The title was then purchased by Highbury Monarch Communications (now Highbury Media) and relaunched with the May 2002 issue. An Afrikaans edition of the magazine was published from the September 2015 issue to the June 2016 issue. In 2017, SA Rugby magazine began publishing 12 issues a year instead of 11 (with a combined January-February issue), which had been the case since 2002. Notable issues The April 2005 issue of SA Rugby magazine was its 100th, featuring Ashwin Willemse, Brent Russell, Victor Matfield and Schalk Burger, and cost R16.95.

Established by Chinese-Indonesian businessman Jo Eng Sek and Chinese cameraman Cho' Chin Hsin in 1940, it produced five black-and-white films in 1940 and 1941; two of these were directed by Jo, and the remainder were directed by Wu Tsun. Another film was under production when the studio was closed following the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. Star helped establish the careers of actors such as S Waldy and Elly Joenara, and produced screenplays written by Rd Ariffien and Saeroen; its output, however, is probably lost. History Star Film was established by Jo Eng Sek, who had previous film experience as co-producer of Si Tjonat (1929), and Shanghai-based cameraman Cho' Chin Hsin; for much of the life of the company, Jo would take the role of producer while Cho' would be on camera. The company's headquarters were located at Prinsenlaan, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta). The company released its first film, Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, in April 1941. For this detective film, Star signed L. V. Wijnhamer Jr., an Indo social worker popular with the ethnic Chinese community. The film was a commercial success, allowing the company to expand. Later Jo signed Rd Ariffien as a screenwriter; the studio touted this as a victory, owing to Ariffien's wide network as a journalist. He wrote a single work for the company, Tjioeng Wanara, based on the Sundanese legend as retold by M. A. Salmoen in a 1938 Balai Pustaka-published edition; this was directed and produced by Jo. Several actors cast for the film continued with Star for the remainder of its existence, including comedian S Waldy and future film producer Elly Joenara. However, Ariffien left Star owing to dissatisfaction over Tjioeng Wanara. Poster for Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, the company's first production Star continued expanding, and Jo brought aboard Chinese director Wu Tsun, whose first film for the company was Lintah Darat. It had begun production before the release of Tjioeng Wanara and dealt with a family torn apart by dealings with a loan shark. This production received positive reviews. Star then produced a sequel to Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, again with Wu at the helm, and drew the journalist Saeroen as writer. In this film, titled Pah Wongso Tersangka, Star emphasised comedy, relying on the interactions between Waldy, Pah Wongso, and the comedian Sarip. Saeroen wrote one more film for Star in 1941, Ajah Berdosa, before leaving the company. This film, which follows a villager named Mardiman over a period of several years in which he loses everything owing to his infatuation with a \\"modern\\" woman, was advertised as \\"an extremely simple and touching story\\" and received positive reviews. By late 1941, Star was producing an adaptation of the One Thousand and One Nights, titled 1001 Malam. At the time several contemporary works were being adapted from Nights, including Tan's Film's Aladin and Koeda Sembrani, Populair's Film's Moestika dari Djemar, and Java Industrial Film's Ratna Moetoe Manikam. By early 1942, the colonial government of the Dutch East Indies had become concerned with the possibility of an invasion by the Empire of Japan. This fear reached the general populace, and the February 1942 edition of film magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film reported that several studios would move away from the colonial capital of Batavia or go on a production hiatus. Star, though production of 1001 Malam was incomplete, was reported to be preparing to move. When the Japanese occupied the Indies in March 1942, Star was closed, never to reopen. Filmography Star Film produced six films in two years. All were feature length, black-and-white works, receiving wide releases in the Dutch East Indies. Some, such as Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, were reportedly screened as far away as British Malaya, China, and Singapore. Though its films were screened at least into the late 1940s, the company's output is likely lost. *Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman (1940) *Tjioeng Wanara (1941) *Lintah Darat (1941) *Pah Wongso Tersangka (1941) *Ajah Berdosa (1941) *1001 Malam (unfinished) Explanatory notes References Works cited      Category:1940 establishments in the Dutch East Indies Category:1942 disestablishments in the Dutch East Indies Category:Mass media companies established in 1940 Category:Mass media companies disestablished in 1942 Category:Film production companies of the Dutch East Indies Category:Defunct companies of the Dutch East Indies ","title":"Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)"},{"id":"42435317","text":"Beggar's Bush is a hamlet in the community of Pencraig, Powys, Wales, which is 55 miles (88 km) from Cardiff and 137 miles (220 km) from London.

Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. p.3 The earliest studies of marine biology trace back to the Phoenicians and the Greeks who are known as the initial explorers of the oceans and their composition.\\"History of the Study of Marine Biology\\" MarineBio Conservation Society. Retrieved: April 7, 2014. The first recorded observations on the distribution and habits of marine life were made by Aristotle (384‚Äì322 BC).Levinton, Jeffrey S.. Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. p.4 Observations made in the earliest studies of marine biology provided an impetus for the age of discovery and exploration that followed. During this time, a vast amount of knowledge was gained about life that exists in the oceans. Individuals who contributed significantly to this pool of knowledge include Captain James Cook (1728‚Äì1779), Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì1882) and Wyville Thomson (1830‚Äì1882).Ward (1974) p.161 These individuals took part in some of the more well-known expeditions of all time, making foundation contributions to marine biology.Gage & Tyler (1991) p.1 The era was important for the history of marine biology, but naturalists were still constrained by available technologies that limited their ability to effectively locate and accurately examine species that inhabited the deep parts of the ocean. The subsequent creation of marine laboratories was another important development because marine scientists now had places to conduct research and process their specimens from expeditions. Technological advances, such as sound ranging, scuba diving gear, submersibles and remotely operated vehicles, progressively made it easier to study the deep ocean. This allowed marine biologists to explore depths people once thought never existed.Levinton, Jeffrey S. (1995) Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology, New York: Oxford University Press. p.7-8  Early exploration of the deep sea  Model of a Greek boat =Phoenicians and Greeks= The history of marine biology can be traced as far back as 1200 BC when the Phoenicians and the Greeks began ocean voyages using celestial navigation. Phoenicians and Greeks were some of the first known explorers to leave their local communities bordering the Mediterranean Sea. They ventured outside the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean with their knowledge of tides, currents and seasonal changes. It wasn't until much later at around 450 BC when observations of natural phenomena related to the oceans started getting recorded. Herodotus (484‚Äì425 BC) wrote of the regular tides in the Persian Gulf, the deposition of silt in the Nile Delta and used the term ‚ÄúAtlantic‚Äù to describe the western seas for the first time. It was during this time when many of the first observations about the composition of the oceans were recorded. =Aristotle= Aristotle was one of the most notable Greek philosophers to examine and keep written records of observations concerning marine organisms. Aristotle identified a large range of species such as crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks and fish. Aristotle has been known as the initiator of the tradition of natural philosophy and an influential player in the beginnings of marine biology because of the early observations he made about marine life Hawaiian navigators sailing multi-hulled canoe =Polynesians= The Polynesians were also very involved in the exploration of marine life and their efforts are often overlooked.Ward (1974) p.5 Throughout the time period of 300‚Äì1275 AD the Polynesians made efforts to explore and populate the great Polynesian triangle, which is bounded in the east by Easter Island, in the north by Hawaii and in the southwest by New Zealand. The Polynesians were among the first to go out and explore the mysteries of the ocean and marine life. In the years that followed the Polynesian efforts, there were minimal efforts that aimed to further man's understanding of the sea. This ended with the Age of Discovery in the late 15th century.Ward (1974) p.6 Age of discovery Between the late 15th century and early 20th century, humans explored the oceans like never before creating new maps and charts and collecting specimens to bring back to their home ports. Most of the exploration that took place during this time was fueled by European countries such as Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Scotland and Germany. Some of the landmark explorers of marine biology carried out their famous work during this time period. Explorers such as Captain James Cook, Charles Darwin and Wyville Thomson made revolutionary contributions to the history of marine biology during this time of exploration.Levinton, Jeffrey S.. Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. =James Cook= James Cook is well known for his voyages of exploration for the British Navy in which he mapped out a significant amount of the world's uncharted waters. Cook's explorations took him around the world twice and led to countless descriptions of previously unknown plants and animals. Cook's explorations influenced many others and led to a number of scientists examining marine life more closely. Among those influenced was Charles Darwin who went on to make many contributions of his own. The voyage of the Beagle =Charles Darwin= Charles Darwin, best known for his theory of evolution, made many significant contributions to the early study of marine biology. He spent much of his time from 1831 to 1836 on the voyage of HMS Beagle collecting and studying specimens from a variety of marine organisms. It was also on this expedition where Darwin began to study coral reefs and their formation. He came up with the theory that the overall growth of corals is a balance between the growth of corals upward and the sinking of the sea floor.Levinton, Jeffrey S.. Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995.p.5 He then came up with the idea that wherever coral atolls would be found, the central island where the coral had started to grow would be gradually subsiding Ward (1974) p.162 =Charles Wyville Thomson= Another influential expedition was the voyage of HMS Challenger from 1872 to 1876, organized and later led by Charles Wyville Thomson. It was the first expedition purely devoted to marine science. The expedition collected and analyzed thousands of marine specimens, laying the foundation for present knowledge about life near the deep-sea floor.Gage & Tyler (1991) p.6 The findings from the expedition were a summary of the known natural, physical and chemical ocean science to that time.Rozwadowski, Helen M.. Fathoming the ocean the discovery and exploration of the deep sea. New ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap, 2005. p173 =Later exploration= This era of marine exploration came to a close with the first and second round-the-world voyages of the Danish Galathea expeditions and Atlantic voyages by the USS Albatross, the first research vessel purpose built for marine research. These voyages further cleared the way for modern marine biology by building a base of knowledge about marine biology. This was followed by the progressive development of more advanced technologies which began to allow more extensive explorations of ocean depths that were once thought too deep to sustain life. Modern studies =Marine biology labs= In the 1960s and 1970s, ecological research into the life of the ocean was undertaken at institutions set up specifically to study marine biology. Notable was the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in America,Maienschein, Jane. 100 years exploring life, 1888‚Äì1988: the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole. Boston: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 1989: 189‚Äì192Gage & Tyler (1991) p.7 which established a model for other marine laboratories subsequently set up around the world.Ward (1974) p.142 Their findings of unexpectedly high species diversity in places thought to be inhabitable stimulated much theorizing by population ecologists on how high diversification could be maintained in such a food-poor and seemingly hostile environment. oceanographic research vessel. =Exploration technology= In the past, the study of marine biology has been limited by a lack of technology as researchers could only go so deep to examine life in the ocean.Rozwadowski, Helen M.. Fathoming the ocean the discovery and exploration of the deep sea. Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap, 2005:5 Before the mid-twentieth century, the deep- sea bottom could not be seen unless one dredged a piece of it and brought it to the surface. This has changed dramatically due to the development of new technologies in both the laboratory and the open sea. These new technological developments have allowed scientists to explore parts of the ocean they didn't even know existed.Levinton, Jeffrey S.. Marine biology: function, biodiversity, ecology. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. p.7 The development of scuba gear allowed researchers to visually explore the oceans as it contains a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus allowing a person to breathe while being submerged 100 to 200 feet into the ocean. Submersibles were built like small submarines with the purpose of taking marine scientists to deeper depths of the ocean while protecting them from increasing atmospheric pressures that cause complications deep under water. The first models could hold several individuals and allowed limited visibility but enabled marine biologists to see and photograph the deeper portions of the oceans. Remotely operated underwater vehicles are now used with and without submersibles to see the deepest areas of the ocean that would be too dangerous for humans. ROVs are fully equipped with cameras and sampling equipment which allows researchers to see and control everything the vehicle does. ROVs have become the dominant type of technology used to view the deepest parts of the ocean. =Romanticization= In the late 20th century and into the 21st, marine biology was \\"glorified and romanticized through films and television shows,\\" leading to an influx in interested students who required a damping on their enthusiasm with the day-to-day realities of the field.

She climbed extensively in the Dolomites and made the first ascent of the south face of the Marmolada in 1901. Biography =Early life= Beatrice Tomasson was born in 1859 to William and Sarah Anne Tomasson, in Barnby Moor, Nottinghamshire; she was their second child. At ten years old, Tomasson and her family moved to Ireland, where they lived in Gortnamona, a property near Tullamore, County Offaly. In 1882, when she was 22 years old, Tomasson travelled to Potsdam, then part of Prussia, to work as a private tutor for the household of Prussian army General von B√ºlow. Unsuccessfully, she tried to translate and publish Felix Dahn's four-volume novel A Struggle for Rome from German to English. She and C√§cilie W√ºstenburg later wrote and translated The Chimes of Erfurt: A Tale, which was published in 1885. =Mountaineering= Tomasson moved to Innsbruck in 1885 where she took up mountain climbing. From 1892, she worked as a governess for Edward Lisle Strutt, whom she accompanied on numerous expeditions to Tyrol, √ñtztal, the Stubai Alps and the Karwendel range. Despite Tommason being 15 years older than Strutt the family believed they were romantically involved. Tomasson became a member of the Austrian Alpine Club in 1893 and began to attempt major climbs in the Dolomites from 1896 onwards. Tomasson began climbing with Michele Bettega, a mountain guide, in 1897. Together, they made the first ascents of Cima d'Alberghetto, Torre del Giubileo, Campanile della Regina Vittoria, Monte Lastei d'Agner, and Sasso delle Capre. In 1898 she made the first ascent of the northeast face of Monte Zebr√π, which was considered at the time to be the most difficult ice wall to climb in the Tyrol, as well as the first ascent of Ortler and the second ascent of the west face of Laurinswand, which was considered to be the Dolomites' most difficult rock wall. She and Luigi Rizzi were the first climbers to summit the Dent di Mesdi via the south face in 1900. In July 1901 Tomasson, Bettega and Bartolo Zagonel made the first ascent of the south face of the Marmolada, which is considered her greatest climbing achievement. The route had been considered \\"the longest and most difficult climb in the Alps\\" for more than a decade, yet Tomasson's team made the ascent in just one day. For the duration of her mountaineering career, Tomasson worked as a governess for wealthy families in Innsbruck, London, Copenhagen, Graz, Cortina, Nottingham, and Brierley; this income allowed her to embark on so many guided climbing expeditions. =Retirement= Beatrice Tomasson by John Singer Sargent Tomasson's climbing career was essentially ended by the outbreak of World War I, at which time most of her guides were recruited for war. She returned to Britain in 1912 where she devoted her time to horse riding and hunting. She married Patrick Chalmers Mackenzie in 1921, when she was 61 years old, and they settled in his Sussex estate, where Tomasson died in 1947 at the age of 87.

Long regarded as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch (Sitta leucopsis), it nevertheless differs significantly in morphology and vocalizations. Both S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been regarded as closely related to the North American white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis). It is a medium-sized nuthatch, measuring about in length. Its upper body is a dark gray-blue or slate color, becoming dark blue-black at the crown. The cheeks and throat are a white buff-orange, turning to a rich cinnamon on the underparts that intensifies in color on the sides of the breast. Vocalizations consist of alternating series of ascending whistles and short notes. The bird is endemic to areas in southeastern Tibet and west central China, including eastern Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan, inhabiting coniferous montane forest of spruce or fir. The altitude at which it nests varies according to locality, but typically is from . The species was first described in 1891 from a specimen collected in China's Haidong Prefecture. The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky, who first recorded the species in 1884. Little is known about its ecology, which is probably comparable to that of the white-cheeked nuthatch. It was given the rank of full species (separate from the white-cheeked nuthatch) in 2005 in Pamela C. Rasmussen's Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide. Other authorities followed suit, but as of 2014, S. przewalskii does not have a full threat-status evaluation by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A 2014 phylogenetic study of the species found it to be at the base of the nuthatch evolutionary tree out of 21 species examined, dispelling a hypothesis that S. przewalskii could belong to the same species as S. carolinensis.  Taxonomy  Drawing by John Gould and H. C. Richter of a white-cheeked nuthatch couple, S. przewalskii's supposed closest cousins The nuthatches constitute a genus ‚Äì Sitta ‚Äì of small passerine birds in the family Sittidae. The genus may be further divided into seven subgenera, of which S. przewalskii belongs to Leptositta, along with its nominate subspecies, Sitta leucopsis, and the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis). Nuthatches are typified by short, compressed wings and short, square 12-feathered tails, compact bodies, longish pointed bills, strong toes with long claws, and behaviorally, by their unique head-first manner of descending tree trunks. Most nuthatches have gray or blue upperparts and a black eyestripe. (One recognizable feature of Przevalski's nuthatch is that it lacks the eyestripe common to most nuthatch species.) Sitta is derived from the Ancient Greek name for nuthatches, , sittƒì. \\"Nuthatch\\", first recorded in 1350, is derived from \\"nut\\" and a word probably related to \\"hack\\", since these birds hack at nuts they have wedged into crevices. Sitta przewalskii was first scientifically described in 1891 by Russians Mikhail Mikhailovich Berezovsky and Valentin Bianchi based on a single specimen obtained in the Haidong Prefecture, in Eastern Qinghai. The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky, who found the species in Tibet in 1884 and dubbed it Sitta eckloni without providing adequate description, rendering it a nomen nudum. Though the primary habitats of Sitta przewalskii and the white-cheeked nuthatch (Sitta leucopsis) are separated from each other by almost , Przevalski's nuthatch was described as closely related to the white-cheeked nuthatch, and was thereafter often considered and treated conspecifically, as a subspecies of S. leucopsis. In 2005, Pamela C. Rasmussen granted the taxon autonomous status in her book, Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide, uncoupling the species from S. leucopsis. The classification was noted by ornithologists Nigel J. Collar and John D. Pilgrim in 2007, and endorsed by the International Ornithological Congress, by Alan P. Peterson in his well-known Zoological Nomenclature Resource (Zoonomen), and by the Internet Bird Collection (IBC), sponsored by the Handbook of the Birds of the World. No subspecies of S. przewalskii itself have been identified. In explaining this separation of species, Rasmussen points to morphological divergence and significant differences in vocalization. Ornithologist Edward C. Dickinson observed in a 2006 article that though evidence of morphological and vocal differences between S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been delineated, little had yet been published presenting comparative morphological details, and that it would be instructive to study how each taxon responds to the calls of the other. The white-cheeked nuthatch, with S. przewalskii subsumed within it, has been regarded as closely related to the North American white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), which has a similar contact call (though S. carolinensisss is moderately higher in pitch), and they have sometimes been treated as conspecific. In turn, it has been proposed that the triumvirate of S. przewalskii, S. leucopsis and S. carolinensis could be related to the Sitta canadensis, monophyletic group, corresponding to the subgenus Micrositta, which includes six species of average-sized nuthatches. The relationships remain very unclear. A molecular study by Eric Pasquet conducted in 2014 may provide some clarity. In 2014, Eric Pasquet, et al. published a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 nuthatch species. Though S. leucopsis was not included in the study, it found that within the nuthatch group covered, S. przewalskii is basal‚Äîan ancestor at the base (or root)‚Äîto the nuthatch evolutionary family tree, and thus \\"sister to all other nuthatches, without any close relatives\\". The findings resulted from phylogenetic analyses (employing Bayesian inference and the maximum likelihood methods). A biogeographical analysis (using the dispersal-extinction‚Äìcladogenesis model) was then performed. The cladogram drawn from the evidence indicates that the first clade and closest descendants of Przevalski's nuthatch are the North American white-breasted nuthatch and the giant nuthatch (S. magna), dispelling the hypothesis that S. przewalskii could belong to the same species as S. carolinensis.  Description  J.G. Keulemans Because Sitta przewalskii has long been regarded as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch, its description has often been made in comparison with it. Though both species lack the black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches, their coloring is distinct, with S. leucopsis being white- or creamy-buff on its throat, cheeks, breast, flanks and belly, where S. przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of cinnamon. S. przewalskii is also the smaller of the two, and its bill is markedly thinner. Males and females of the species are nearly identical in appearance, except for the male's brighter cinnamon coloring. The area above the eyes, including the forehead, crown and nape, is a deep blue-black, through the top edge of the mantle. The mantle proper is a medium to dark gray-blue as are the tertials and upperwing-coverts, turning to a dark gray at the median, greater and primary coverts and the alula. The secondaries and inner primaries are fringed in gray-blue. The central rectrices are gray-blue, and the outer rectrices are a blackish-gray, paling towards the tips. The face and surrounding areas, including the lores, supercilium, ear-coverts, cheeks and throat are a white buff-orange. Below, the belly and breast are a rich cinnamon, darkening to an orange-cinnamon at the sides of the breast. The rear flanks and undertail- covert feathers are rufous. In worn plumage, the color may be uneven in the lower parts and lighter in hue. The upper mandible of the bill is black, and the lower is gray with a black tip. The iris and legs are dark brown. Juveniles of the species resemble adults but for the base of their beaks being yellow, proportionately shorter, and their overall coloring being less vibrant. Przevalski's nuthatch is a medium-sized bird, measuring about in length. The folded wing of the male is long and that of the female ; an average of shorter than the white-cheeked nuthatch. The wingspan is about . The beak measures , which is thinner and shorter than that of S. leucopsis, in which the beak is approximately long. The tarsus is , and the tail is in length.  Vocalizations and behavior  Sitta przewalskii's territorial calls differ significantly from those of S. leucopsis, whose notes are more nasal, whereas the song of S. przewalskii is in long verses composed of whistles that ascend in pitch, interspersed with short notes. According to the Handbook of the Birds of the World, vocalizations include a \\"muffled, mellow 'chip' repeated in irregular series...; a loud, emphatic, whistled 'dweep' or 'dweep- eep'; a slightly nasal, querulous 'que', usually repeated 3‚Äì5 times...; and thinner 'pee-pee-pee-pee...' or 'seet-seet-seet-seet...' notes on [the] same pitch but slowing towards [the] end of [the] phrase.\\" In 1950, English naturalist Frank Ludlow reported a description of the bird, as provided to him by Ernst Sch√§fer who studied an adult male near Litang in 1934. It was characterized as: \\"one of the shyest and rarest denizens of the conifer forest\\", and one leading a solitary life, much like nearby populations of three-toed woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus funebris). By contrast, Ludlow observed the species in southeastern Tibet, probably during the winter, and did not find it particularly reserved. He reports having killed a specimen in a willow tree, far from the species' usual coniferous nesting grounds. The specimen was captured on the outskirts of a forest, on a ridge between two valleys, where it stood on a dead branch from which it launched in pursuit of insects in flight, like a flycatcher.  Distribution and habitat  The species is endemic to an area in west central China and southeastern Tibet. In China, it is found in eastern Qinghai, from the Daba Mountains as far north as the Menyuan Hui Autonomous County, and as far south as the plateau of Amdo (35¬∞ N. 101¬∞ E.), as well as in the southern part of Qinghai in Nangq√™n County; in the area of the Yellow River in Xinghai County; in Gansu, southwest of Xiahe and Min counties; in Sichuan, where it has been observed in the north, center and west of the province, including sightings in Songpan County at the Jiuzhaigou Valley nature reserve, in the Qionglai Mountains in the Wolong District, in the region of Barkam County, and in the area of Litang. The species has also been observed in Kunming, Yunnan, in far southwestern China, where it most likely migrates to overwinter. In Tibet, the species has been found in the northeastern Tibet Autonomous Region in the Chamdo Prefecture; and in the southeast of the region in Tse (in December) and in Dzeng (in April), both in the South Tibet (Tsangpo) Valley region. The Tsangpo Valley sightings may be anomalous, only indicating winter visitation. The bird observed in Dzeng was in an environment alien to the species' normal coniferous forest environs, and both the Dzeng and Tse individuals had atypically pale underparts, indicating they may have been nominate S. leucopsis, but with genetic introgression traits from Przevalski's nuthatch. S. przewalskii inhabits coniferous montane forest of spruce or fir. Its altitudinal range commonly approaches a forest's tree line. In China it has been observed at height distributions of (in Sichuan during August) and in Qinghai at and at approximately (during June). In western Nepal a range of has been described. In Tibet individuals have been recorded at heights of in the northeast, and from in the southeast.  Threats and protection  Sitta przewalskii is not yet treated as an independent species by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and its threat level is not evaluated by either. Despite being described as rare in China and Southeast Tibet, because the taxon is treated instead as a subspecies of S. leucopsis, the evaluation of its population incorporates the relative abundance of its parent species. Concomitantly, it takes on its parent category of least concern. As S. przewalskii has not been extensively studied independently from S. leucopsis, a classification of data deficient could be applied, but the rarity of sightings indicates concern for its status; a finding of near threatened or even classification as a vulnerable species may be warranted.

He did much work on the Isle of Bute. Almost all of his buildings are now category A listed buildings, reflecting the high quality of his work. Life He was born in Port Glasgow son of Henry Schultz, a Greenock sugar refiner, and Isabella Small Weir, the daughter of Dr Robert Weir of Galashiels. Due to this family connection, when Henry Schultz died in 1863 the infant Robert was sent to Galashiels to be raised by his aunt Jane, the wife of Dr Alexander Cunningham Tweedie. In 1876 Robert was articled to work under Robert Rowand Anderson where he later worked alongside George Washington Browne and Hew M Wardop when they joined the partnership. In January 1884 he moved to work as assistant to Richard Norman Shaw. Here he also became acquainted with the newly created Art Workers Guild set up by Shaw's other assistants: Edward Schroeder Prior, Ernest Newton, Mervyn Macartney and William Richard Lethaby. In 1885 he was joined by Sidney Barnsley and his brother Ernest Barnsley widening the circle of stylistic influence. In 1886, he moved to the offices of Sir Ernest George and Harold Ainsworth Peto in London. In 1887 he won a travelling scholarship and, with funding supplemented by the Marquess of Bute (who he had met through Robert Rowand Anderson and Dr Edwin Freshfield, he travelled Italy, Greece and the Near East, partly in the company of Sidney Barnsley. In 1889, as part of his travels, he became a member of the British School at Athens. Schultz and Barnsley returned to Britain in 1890 and set up office together at 14 Gray's Square Inn, adjacent to a friend and former colleague, Francis William Troup. In 1890 he also officially joined the Art Workers Guild and secured a commission by his travel sponsor, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, for alterations at Mount Stuart House. Further work for Bute included restoration at Dumfries House and major renovation and alteration of The House of Falkland in Fife. Schultz continued working for his successor, the 4th Marquess, the most significant of which was at St. Andrew's Chapel in Westminster Cathedral. Schultz's mosaic design, based partly on St. Andrew's connections with Constantinople is in keeping with this key work of the Byzantine Revival in the United Kingdom.Stamp, Gavin (1981) Robert Weir Schultz, Architect, and his work for the Marquesses of Bute, Mount Stuart Whilst in practice both Frank Mears and John Greaves trained under Schultz.

It was written by Michael Hitchcock and directed by Eric Stoltz, and it aired on Fox in the United States on April 22, 2014, and features Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) opening as Fanny Brice in Funny Girl on Broadway. Archive footage of Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is used in this episode. Plot Out-of-town visitors arrive for Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) official Broadway opening night in Funny Girl, including Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz). The episode starts off with a nightmare in which Rachel is drastically unprepared for the opening night, then is heckled by her former high school tormentors and supported by her New York friends in a performance of \\"Lovefool\\". She falls and is surrounded by everyone, booing her. At breakfast, Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) bans her from going on the Internet and reading the negative reviews, taking away her phone until opening night. At McKinley, Sue asks Will for the extra plane ticket to New York, and her ulterior motive is revealed later on Sue's Corner, in which she has stated she hates New York and Broadway, but now has to visit it as she has never actually been there. She imagines singing \\"N.Y.C.\\" with Will, and the song ends as both arrive in New York and head off. Tina arrives at Rachel and Kurt's apartment with gifts, where she unintentionally brings up more reasons for Rachel to worry, such as her previous problems with tonsillitis, and also the online hate. Rachel lies that she is fine, and is found by Kurt to secretly watch abusive blogs. She is only motivated to get out of bed when Santana reads her a few horrible comments from the Internet before revealing they were about Barbra Streisand when she first played Fanny in 1964. Meanwhile, Sue shows up to utilize Kurt's room for the night, as the hotel room had one double bed instead of two singles (the ticket being meant for Emma). It is opening night. Sue is trying to scalp her ticket, before spotting someone trying to do the same before seeing her, and entering the theater. She follows. Will shows up at Rachel's dressing room, where she reveals that she bought a ticket for Finn, and is nervous of singing \\"Who Are You Now?\\" as it always reminded her of him. Will tells her that he's proud of her before Emma calls him from Lima, her water having broke, and he rushes off. The curtain goes up and Rachel performs \\"I'm the Greatest Star\\". During the performance, Sue, sitting next to the New York Times reviewer, constantly complains about the show and leaves, meeting the man previously trying to scalp his ticket, Mario (Chris Parnell), who shares her hatred of Broadway, and asks her to a meal at his restaurant. Her leaving worries the group and Sidney during the interval, the latter impressing on Rachel how even more important it is the second act goes well. Sue and Rachel sing \\"Who Are You Now?\\", the former dancing with Mario and the latter on stage. Rachel thinks of Finn during the number and sheds a few tears for him. After the show, which went smoothly, Rachel turns down a satisfied Sidney's invitation to a Broadway cast party, and the seven (Rachel, Blaine, Kurt, Santana, Mercedes, Tina, and Sam) go to a gay bar full of Funny Girl fans, where Rachel performs \\"Pumping Blood\\". In the morning, they return to the apartment, only to find Sue and Mario having been there all night \\"copulating wildly\\". Sue begins to tear down Rachel and her performance the previous night, but she stops Santana from a retort, saying that a group of friends joined together and a dream came true last night, a feat which Sue will never accomplish, being a rotten and miserable person. The two adults leave, and Rachel is applauded by her friends. Santana reads the New York Times out loud, and it is positive towards Rachel's performance. Will calls Rachel, saying he's named his newborn Daniel Finn Schuester and that he's completely happy for the first time. Rachel agrees and congratulations are exchanged. Sue and Mario each try to convince the other to stay in their respective homes, but realize that they cannot be together and share a kiss before Sue gets in a taxi. On Sue's Corner, she states that she still stands by her statements last week‚Äîexcept now she loves New York. She found love there, and believes it quite possible for others to do the same. Production The episode was written by co-executive producer Michael Hitchcock, and directed by Eric Stoltz. Production was ongoing in mid-March. Recurring characters in this episode include aspiring singer Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), former McKinley students Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter), Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman) and Dave Karofsky (Max Adler), Funny Girl producer Sidney Greene (Michael Lerner), and news anchors Rod Remington (Bill A.

Constable. p270 Alternative names are Castle of Hallforrest, Hall Forest Castle or simply Hallforrest. History The castle is believed to have been built by Robert the Bruce as a hunting lodge; he is said to have granted it to Robert II Keith, Marischal of Scotland, the predecessor of the Earls of Kintore. Mary, Queen of Scots visited Hallforrest in 1562. The castle was frequently attacked during the 17th-century wars. It may have been abandoned shortly afterward, although it remains the property of the Earls of Kintore. Structure Hallforrest is a plain oblong tower long and wide. It once had a parapet, and probably a stone roof resting on an upper arch. It had two vaults, divided by entresol floors. It seems that the entrance led to the first entresol floor. There are small gun-loops to the basement, which may have had a cattle door. Originally the castle had six floors, while its walls were thick. There are windows on the south. There is no evidence of masonry stairs; ladders and hatches must have been used. The interior is now ruinous.

It is also a kind of youth subculture, which has gained momentum in recent years among disaffected Moroccan youth.Al-Jazeera: Morocco's Tcharmils 'consider jail home' More recently the name has been adopted by gangs of youths from the slums of the country. Their Modus operandi is to spread extreme fear by placing video images of its members commuting crimes of extreme violence on social media. Most criminals who commit Tcharmil tend to be violent, and usually stab or leave scar wounds on their victim's face despite receiving what they were after (Mobile phones, wallet, etc...). Tcharmil display distinctive hair-styles and seek to emulate the organized Hispanic street gangs of the United States of America such as the Latin Kings. Their preferred weapons are meat cleavers and butchers knives. The first attack occurred in a fashionable hair salon in the district of Ma√¢rif in Casablanca during March 2014. Three male youths entered and wreaked havoc by wielding machetes. Clients fled in terror. A copycat crime wave ensued occasioning serious assaults occasioning actual bodily harm and violent deaths. Tcharmil although begun in Casablanca, it quickly spread to Fes, Meknes, Agadir, Rabat, Temara Marrakesh and is appearing in other Moroccan cities. To combat this phenomenon, King Mohammed VI of Morocco on 7 April 2014 launched a major national police campaign resulting in multiple arrests. The number of recent attacks has been in the rise throughout the Moroccan cities ; This is mainly due to the lack of police force in poor neighborhoods and lack of severe law sentences. Most \\"mcharmline\\" (perpetrators), usually receive light jail sentences varying between six months to one year in jail if they are caught, allowing them to gain more confidence to commit even more violent crimes upon exiting prison.

History SGM Technology for Lighting was founded in 1978 in Italy, by Gabriele Giorgi and Maurizio Guidi ‚Äî the company name a truncation of ‚ÄòSocieta Gabriele Maurizio‚Äô. In the early days they were known for producing a diverse catalogue of products for the emerging disco industry ‚Äî ranging from illuminated dancefloor modules, ‚Äòbubblesmoke‚Äô machines and controllers ‚Äî from their base in Pesaro. In April 2009 ownership was passed by president Gabriele Giorgi and his daughter Alessandra to long- standing Italian pro audio company, RCF Group. Peter Johansen was brought in to head up R&D; in late 2010 ‚Äî marking his return to the industry following a ten year absence, after earlier setting up Martin Professional which he subsequently floated on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. He recruited many of his former R&D; team and quickly relocated the operation to Denmark ‚Äî to work on innovations for the entertainment and architectural segments. In February 2012 Peter Johansen formed a consortium to acquire the company from the RCF Group. Renaming it SGM A/S, today it is headquartered in Aarhus, and continues to focus exclusively on developing LED solutions. As the major shareholder in SGM A/S, Peter Johansen was joined by the LED specialists from his Danish R&D; team and former members of his Martin Professional sales force as well as some of the company‚Äôs Italian personnel. With R&D;, administration and after-sales based in Denmark, manufacturing initially took place at bases in Italy, Thailand, and China before being consolidated into a single, purpose-built factory in Denmark. To broaden its marketing reach, SGM has set up subsidiaries in key territories around the world, including SGM Lighting Inc based in Orlando, FL and serving the North American market, SGM Deutschland and SGM UK. Since then, SGM LED products have appeared in large numbers of festivals and on world tours by artists including Beyonc√©, Taylor Swift, Pink, and One Direction, and featured on international events such as the 2013 and 2014 Eurovision Song Contest. In November 2015, SGM A/S was restructured as SGM Light A/S with new ownership by Paolo Covre and new capital, while maintaining the management, the entire team behind the company, the distribution network, etc. In October 2019, Peter Johansen stepped down from his role as SGM Light‚Äôs CEO. Since then, the company has been managed by the three Executive Directors Torben Balmer, Mikkel Falk, and Ulrik Jakobsen. Entertainment Products SGM Light manufactures a wide range of IP65 or IP66 rated products for the entertainment industry. These products include moving heads, washes, strobes, and effect lighting products.  Architectural Products  Besides the entertainment focused product range, SGM Light also develops and builds IP66 rated lighting fixtures for architectural installations. These fixtures are marked POI (Permanent Outdoor Installation) and specifically developed to fulfill the requirements of installations on buildings, bridges, cruise ships, etc. Industry awards In October 2013 SGM won the PLASA Award for Innovation for developing the weather-resistant G-Spot LED moving head.

His diverse interests include behavioral addictions, bipolar disorder, suicide prevention, and the role of family in psychiatric illness. He has published on these topics both in professional journals and in the lay press. Most recently his research has been devoted to describing a suicide- specific clinical state, a phenotype of the Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS). Galynker is the Associate Chairman for Research in the Department of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, and is the Founder and Director of the Family Center for Bipolar and of the Mount Sinai Suicide Research Laboratory based at Mount Sinai Beth Israel. As of 2014 he is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine in New York City.  Education and work in chemistry  Galynker was born in Moscow, USSR. His mother, Raya, was an internist and his father, Ilya, was a professor of textile engineering. They met and married in Voronezh before World War II and moved to Moscow after the war ended. In 1971 Galynker graduated from Moscow's Public School #109 as valedictorian, and in 1976 he graduated magna cum laude from the Department of Chemistry at Moscow State University. He immigrated to the United States in 1978, and after working for one year as a chemist researcher at the CIBA-Geigy corporation, he began his graduate studies (1978‚Äì1981) in organic synthesis under professor W. Clark Still at Columbia University. His PhD thesis, which earned the Hammet Award for outstanding research, described the first use of computer modeling in organic synthesis and has subsequently been widely cited. After completing a fellowship in human genetics at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, Galynker taught chemistry at Purdue University and at Columbia University.  Work in psychiatry and Mount Sinai Beth Israel  Galynker received his medical degree in 1988 from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where he was elected into the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society, and completed his psychiatry residency at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He has since worked at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan (currently Mount Sinai Beth Israel), where he is the Associate Chairman for Research in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. In the Department, Galynker created a residency research program, which requires all psychiatry residents to learn the research process and complete a research project. He also founded and ran the Russian Health Service and is a Patient Experience Physician Advocate at Beth Israel. He was awarded the Patient Experience Excellence Award and has been listed in the America's Top Psychiatrists list as well as in the Top New York Physicians \\"Superdoctors\\" list. = Richard and Cynthia Zirinsky Center for Bipolar = In 2006, Galynker founded the Family Center for Bipolar (FCB), which was part of the Zirinsky Mood Disorders Center and is a clinical and research center treating children, adolescents, and adults. The Center has become a Center of Excellence in the Mount Sinai Health System and has been profiled in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. In 2015, the Family Center for Bipolar was officially renamed the Richard and Cynthia Zirinsky Center for Bipolar, in honor of a gift from the Zirinsky Family.  Other research  = Cognition = While working as a resident psychiatrist, Galynker was the first to report that both hospital admissions from the ER and the duration of hospital stay in the acute psychiatric unit was influenced by cognition, suggesting that in addition to psychiatric symptoms, cognitive dysfunction should be a target of pharmacological intervention. This work anticipated later focus on treatment of cognitive dysfunction and cognitive training in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Galynker later reported on persistent cognitive deficits in opiate addicts in methadone maintenance treatment = Addictions = While in residency working at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Galynker synthesized [11-C]-buprenorphine for use in PET studies of opiate addiction. He later published PET studies of remitted opiate addicts which showed that cognitive deficits, negative affect, and abnormal glucose metabolism present during active drug use persisted for months and years after detoxification from methadone. With Dr. Lisa Cohen, Galynker later showed that behavioral sex addicts, such as male pedophiles, had deficits in glucose metabolism in the temporal cortex and severe character pathology that was similar but broader and more pronounced than that of the opiate-dependent subjects. In a subsequent series of reports, Cohen and Galynker described character pathology of pedophiles and other sex offenders and proposed a model for the etiology of pedophilic behavior. = Mood disorders = In 1998 Galynker published a widely cited SPECT study of cerebral perfusion in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), which showed that in MDD, reduced cerebral blood flow was associated with negative symptoms rather than mood. This was one of the first imaging studies to demonstrate that cerebral function was not related to a specific diagnosis but to symptoms, a finding which echoed Galynker's early findings on cognitive deficits and patient function, and anticipated the current NIMH Research Domain Criteria Project. Galynker was also the first to report (in a case series) that low dose quetiapine and risperidone were effective for treatment of depression and anxiety a finding later supported by randomized clinical trials, leading to quetiapine approval for these indications. = Suicide = Galynker's present research focuses on suicide prevention. In 2010, with Dr. Zimri Yaseen he described a suicide-specific clinical syndrome, the Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS), initially known as Suicide Trigger State. This finding was later replicated in three other studies. In high-risk suicidal inpatients, high scores in the Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI) were strongly predictive of suicidal behavior within one-two months after discharge. The core feature of SCS is the persistent and desperate feeling of entrapment, which is urgency to escape or avoid an unbearable life situation when escape is perceived as impossible (Typical situations would include terminal illness, humiliating failure at work, or rejection by a romantic partner). In addition, the SCS involves affective disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal and social withdrawal. Importantly, the staple of current suicide risk assessment, suicidal ideation and intent may or may not be present. In addition to the SCI, Galynker and colleagues have recently developed a multi-informant Modular Assessment of Risk for Imminent Suicide (MARIS). MARIS has four independent assessment modules and is unique in that both patients and clinicians provide information. Clinicians' modules include their emotional responses to the SCS, which significantly improve predictive scale. Both the SCS and the MARIS projects were funded by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Galynker recently proposed a Narrative- Crisis Model of Suicide, which so far has been supported by the experimental evidence. The SCS, the MARIS, and their clinical use are described in Galynker's recent textbook, \\"The Suicidal Crisis. Clinical Guide to the Assessment of Imminent Suicide Risk.\\"  Media and public awareness  Galynker has been outspoken in his concerns about possible conflicts of interest between psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical industry. In 2005, he showed that the results of pharmaceutical trials published in even the most reputable scientific journals, JAMA Psychiatry and the American Journal of Psychiatry, systematically favored the drug produced by the manufacturer that paid for the study and disfavored the competitor. This study was profiled on the front page of USA Today. Galynker has also been concerned with the harmful consequences of family exclusion from psychiatric treatment, which he associated with an increased risk of violence and suicide as well as poor outcomes His opinions on the role of family (and staff) in preventing campus violence and reducing student suicide risks have been published by ABC News, the New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal.. Galynker has written an acclaimed book, Talking to Families About Mental Illness, on how to involve family in psychiatric treatment, as well as an advice book on how to recognize the right romantic partner, \\"Choosing Right: A Psychiatrist's Guide to Starting a New Relationship\\" (). Galynker uses media appearances to educate the public about mental illness and mental health, aiming to reduce and ultimately eliminate the stigma of mental illness.

Her father may have been the pianist and composer of German origins Sebastian Demar, with her mother being Elisabeth Riesam, also of German origin . They had settled in Orl√©ans in 1791, but apparently no birth was recorded in that city's vital statistics for the year 1799 (Year VII-Year VIII, nor in the corresponding decennial table.

D√©mar was one of the most combative women of Saint-Simonian movement. She used the Saint-Simonian movement to go further and express findings and claims that were rejected by a majority of her contemporaries, but became accepted by feminists during following years. Shortly before her death, she published a Appel d'une femme au peuple sur l'affranchissement de la femme (\\"Appeal of a woman to the people on the enfranchisement of women\\") which calls for the application to women of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. She also describes marriage as legalized prostitution. During the last years of her short life, Claire Demar participated in feminist journals created during the opportunity offered by the revolution of 1830, She became associated with the feminist journalist Suzanne Voilquin in her publications La femme nouvelle, L'Apostolat des femmes, et La Tribune des femmes. D√©mar was preparing to publish a second book, she committed suicide with her lover Perret Desessarts. They were found on the same bed with two letters and a roll of paper, which she had asked to be read in the Saint- Simonian society of Paris and then given to Barth√©lemy Prosper Enfantin, who sent the papers to Suzanne Voilquin who published them in La Tribune des femmes.

It was opened in 1870 as part of the Austro-Hungarian Rudolfsbahn railway network. Today, only the Slovenian section between Jesenice and Ljubljana is still open to traffic, as part of the main line between Ljubljana and Villach in Austria; the cross- border section between Jesenice and Tarvisio has been closed to traffic since 1967 (Italian part) and 1969 (Slovenian part). History =Construction and first years= In 1869, the Kaiserlich-k√∂nigliche privilegierte Kronprinz Rudolf-Bahn Gesellschaft (KRB, Imperial and Royal privileged company of the Crown Prince Rudolf railway), that had been formed for the construction and operation of the Rudolfsbahn railway line from St. Valentin to Tarvisio, received the concession to build a railway line linking Tarvisio and Ljubljana. The projected railway would follow the Sava valley from Ljubljana to Assling (now Jesenice) and Kronau (Kranjska Gora), then reach Tarvisio through Fusine in Valromana. The railway line was opened on 14 December 1870. In the first years of service, the end station in Tarvisio was located in an area south-west of the current Tarvisio Boscoverde station. A new station, the current Tarvisio Centrale, was opened when the railway line from Villach was inaugurated in 1873, and the Ljubljana line was connected to it, leading to disaffection of the first station, who was then known as Alt Tarvis (Old Tarvisio). In 1884, following financial crisis of the KRB, the railway was nationalised. It was therefore operated by the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways, who proceeded to modernise the line. In 1906, the station of Jesenice became a junction when two segments of the New Alpine Railways met there: the Bohinj Railway to Trieste and the Karawanks Railway to Villach. As the latter opened two months later, during a brief period, the trans-alpine trains from Villach to Trieste used the Tarvisio‚ÄìLjubljana line between Tarvisio and Jesenice. =Between the two World Wars= Following the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the railway was divided between Italy and the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Yugoslavia from 1929). The lined crossed the border near the station of Fusine Laghi. The end station of Tarvis, rebaptised Tarvisio Sobborghi, then Tarvisio Centrale by its new owner, the Italian State Railways (FS), became an international border station. Both passenger and goods traffic between Tarvisio and the border was operated by the National Railways of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, that would become the Yugoslav Railways (JD≈Ω), but the infrastructure were owned and managed by the FS. Beyond the border, the JD≈Ω had both ownership and operation of the line. =After World War II= After World War II, and following the consequent closing of the Yugoslav border, traffic strongly decreased on the Italian segment of the line, and stopped completely in 1965. A presidential decree officially closed the line on 14 August 1967. The tracks were removed in the 1980s. The Yugoslav segment between Jesenice and the border was officially closed in 1969. In recent years, part of the path in the Slovenian Upper Sava Valley has been reclaimed as a bicycle trail. Characteristics and operation The line was originally 103.7 km, from the railway station of Tarvisio Centrale to that of Ljubljana. The remaining part from Jesenice to Ljubljana is 64.5 km long. It is a single- track line, electrified with 3 kV DC. Only the short section between the Ljubljana ≈†i≈°ka marshalling yards and the Ljubljana railway station is double- track. It is exploited by Slovenian Railways, the national railway operator of Slovenia.

It originally aired on HBO on April 6, 2014. The episode was written by series creators John Altschuler, Dave Krinsky and Mike Judge and directed by Judge. HBO made the episode available for free on YouTube. Plot Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch) is a shy, reclusive programmer working for Hooli, a large tech corporation headquartered in Silicon Valley. He lives in a house in Palo Alto that serves as an Business incubator run by Erlich Bachman (T.J. Miller), an entrepreneur who founded the tech company Aviato before selling it years ago. Other cohabitants include Nelson \\"Big Head\\" Bighetti (Josh Brener) Hendricks's coworker at Hooli, system architect Bertram Gilfoyle (Martin Starr), and Java programmer Dinesh Chugtai (Kumail Nanjiani). Richard is working on a side project called \\"Pied Piper\\", an application that tracks songs to help musicians avoid copyright infringement. The app is dismissed by Erlich, who tells Richard to either pursue more innovative ideas or move out of the incubator. While at the Hooli campus, Richard pitches Pied Piper to two \\"brogrammers\\", who dismisses and taunts him. Richard proceeds to pitch the project to Peter Gregory (Christopher Evan Welch), a venture capitalist who also awkwardly dismisses him. Richard would end up pitching the app to Gregory's assistant Monica (Amanda Crew) instead. While running through the application, the brogrammers are stunned by the efficiency and flawlessness of the app's compression algorithm. This is noticed by Hooli VP Jared Dunn (Zach Woods), who notifies CEO Gavin Belson (Matt Ross). Richard is then contacted by Belson, who offers to buy his app, peaking his offer at $10 million for the rights to the application. While meeting with Gavin, Richard receives a call from Gregory, who offers him $200,000 for 5% of Pied Piper. Overwhelmed with the offers, Richard heads out and suffers a panic attack before heading to a clinic. Outside the clinic, Richard finds Monica, who informs him that everyone is fighting for control of the algorithm, not the app: Belson wants the algorithm under his control and intends to shut down Pied Piper after the acquisition. Under Gregory, Richard could grow Pied Piper into the business he wants it to be while directing its future. Richard returns to the incubator and tells the incubees he is taking Gregory's offer and receives Erlich's blessing. Richard proceeds to recruit Big Head, Gilfoyle, and Dinesh to join the Pied Piper team. Production After Mike Judge graduated from UCSD with a degree in physics, his first job was as a programmer working on the F-18 fighter. In 1987 he moved to the Silicon Valley region of Northern California and joined Parallax, a startup video card company with about 40 employees. Disliking the company's culture and his colleagues (\\"The people I met were like Stepford Wives. They were true believers in something, and I don't know what it was\\"), Judge quit after less than three months, but the experience gave him the background to later create a show about the region's people and companies. Filming for the pilot began on March 12, 2013, in Palo Alto, California. HBO green-lit the series on May 16, 2013. Kid Rock appeared in the episode as a personal favor to Judge, who said \\"Rock sort of owed me one. I'd done a Beavis And Butt-head thing for him for free that he used on his Jumbotrons on tour in 2011\\"; the cameo was inspired by a tech company's party Judge had attended only because Run-DMC were performing, with Judge stating that \\"it was just a lot of disinterested tech people standing around. It seemed like an odd juxtaposition.\\"https://amp.theguardian.com/tv-and- radio/2014/jul/04/mike-judge-silicon-valley Reception The episode was viewed by 2 million viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews. The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. Slate called it \\"sharp, very funny\\".

It covers a part of the Burren, a rugged area on the Atlantic coast, and contains the seaside village of Fanore. Location The parish is on the west coast of the barony of Burren. It is northwest of Ennistymon. The parish is and covers . The land is mountainous and rocky, as is typical of the Burren, and mostly not suitable for farming. It rises from the sea shore to on Slieve-Elva, on the east boundary. The Caher river, which flows through the parish, enters the sea near Fanore. The river valley exhibits typical Burren scenery and flora. Antiquities and History The parish name of Cill Onchan (Church of Onchu) refers to the patron Saint Onchum son of Blathmac, who was venerated at Rathblacmac in Inchiquin. His festival was on 9 July and 14 July each year. The church of Killonaghan was in good preservation in 1897. There is the ruin of an older church in the townland of Crumlin whose style of construction indicates that it is one of the early Christian churches. Traditionally is said to have been built by Saint Columbkill after he left Saint Endeus at Aran. There are many cahers, or stone ringforts, in the parish. There is the ruin of a round castle in the townland of Faunarooska. It is not included in the 1580 list of castles of Thomond. The population in 1841 was 1,369 in 235 houses. The Catholic chapel was united with the Rathborney chapel. In 1847 John McNamara, who owned most of the land at Fanore and was considered a good landlord, applied for government funds to build a National School there. This was not approved. A schoolhouse was finally opened at Fanore in 1887, a single room, with two teachers. A lady taught the younger children up to the age of ten, then the master continued until school leaving at age fourteen. The classroom was cold in the winter, despite having a large fireplace at one end. The children had to take turns to bring cartloads of turf as fuel. Saint Patrick's Church was built in 1870 at the entrance to the Caher river valley. The present school at Fanore was built in 1963. Fanore today is a small seaside village in the parish, with a long beach and a wide area of sand dunes. The village today has a shop, a bar/restaurant and a post office.

The company initially used the trade name of \\"Atlas\\" for the accessory and supply segment, producing vehicle lights, signaling equipment, fuel and oil canisters, jacks and air pumps. In October 1926, the company patented its crank drive for lowerable windows. After buying the rights to use the patent for the wrap sling brake from the American company Ternstedt, series production of mechanical window regulators started in 1928. Commonly referred to as a window crank apparatus, this device was also manufactured for buses, trains and streetcars. Windshields and ventilation systems expanded the range of products in the years following. Production switched to the 20-liter standard canister for the German Wehrmacht (armed forces) in 1936 and to contact fuses and impact grenades during World War II. At the time, nearly 900 employees worked for Brose and towards the end of the war some 200 Soviet prisoners of war, who lived next to the plant in a camp run by the German Wehrmacht. In 1945, the company was placed under trusteeship for three years by the American military government and produced household devices such as ovens and irons with fewer than 100 employees. Production expanded into a new segment beyond automotive accessories with the manufacture of a portable typewriter called \\"Brosette\\" in 1953. =1956‚Äì1999= After having sold more than 40,000 devices, production was stopped and sold to India in 1958, allowing Max Brose to focus on products for the automotive industry. The window regulator became one of the company's main pillars. In 1963, the company began series production of this product fitted for the first time with an electrical drive. In 1968, Brose ventured into a new key segment ‚Äì the seat systems business ‚Äì with the production of seat recliners for adjusting backrests. The mid-fifties saw numerous changes in management. In 1956, Ernst J√ºhling died and his heirs withdrew as shareholders. After the death of Max Brose, his eldest daughter Gisela ran the company from 1968 and changed it to a limited partnership (KG). Three years later, Michael Stoschek, grandson of company founder Max Brose, took over at the age of 23. At that time, the company had around 1000 employees and was generating a turnover of DM 55 million. The company's legal form was changed to Brose Fahrzeugteile GmbH & Co. KG in 1982. During the 1974 recession with the first oil crisis, the company was forced to lay off one quarter of its employees and to switch production to water taps and recliners for the furniture industry. Brose Coburg started to expand again over the next few years, investing DM 35 million into its new \\"Plant 2\\" in Coburg, which went into full operation in 1983. The company employed then around 1500 people. However, the production of injection molded products for the automotive industry which started in 1981 was stopped again in 1989. In the eighties, numerous products were refined such as the power window regulator with anti- trap protection, the power seat adjuster and the electronic position memory. In 1988, Brose purchased its first foreign production site in Coventry. In 1990, production started in Hallstadt, the first German plant outside Coburg. Another German plant opened in Gera in 1991, which was transferred to Meerane in 1997 to bring it closer to Volkswagen's plant in Mosel for the just-in- sequence production of door systems. In line with this procurement logistics concept, many other national and international production sites have since been either built or purchased. International expansion has focused mainly on North America and Asia. =2000‚Äì2015= In the 21st century, the family-owned company primarily expanded by means of several takeovers. Through the acquisition of closure systems business from Robert Bosch GmbH in 2002, it was possible to venture into a new business segment. 2004 saw the takeover of the window regulator business of Maxion Sistemas in Brazil, followed by the acquisition of a 40 percent stake in the Turkish window regulator manufacturer Pressan A.S. one year later. When Michael Stoschek ceded his CEO position to J√ºrgen Otto after 34 years in the last months of 2004, this signaled the so far most successful business year in the history of the company: The organization achieved an annual turnover of 2.2 billion Euro and employed about 9,000 members of staff at 37 locations in 19 countries. In 2006, Brose left the Employers‚Äô Associations for the Bavarian Metalworking and Electrical Industries and has since not been bound by a collective bargaining agreement. In April 2008, Brose added electric drives for window regulators, sunroofs and seat belt retractors to its portfolio by purchasing the electric motor business of Continental AG. In setting up the drives business division, the number of employees increased from nearly 10,000 to more than 14,000. Since then, the company has been divided into three business divisions: Seat, Door and Drives. The joint venture SEW Eurodrive is established in early 2011 with the aim to develop drives for e-mobility. In 2011 Brose is the world's fifth- largest family-owned automotive supplier based on turnover. 10% of the total annually business volume is invested in the development of new products and processes with a special focus on the development of products that contribute to fuel efficiency.Florian Langenscheidt, Bernd Venohr (Hrsg.): Lexikon der deutschen Weltmarktf√ºhrer. Die K√∂nigsklasse deutscher Unternehmen in Wort und Bild. Deutsche Standards Editionen, K√∂ln 2010, . The company also localizes its R&D; activities in China the same year. In Chongqing, the foundation stone is laid for another plant; Brose is now present in five locations in China. Brose opens a plant for window regulators and seat height adjusters in Pune/India. Brose plans to strengthen its global activities in Asia in the future. In May 2012, Brose wins the innovation prize in the ‚ÄúErfolgsfaktor Familie‚Äù competition supported by the German government for the ‚ÄúBrose Kids Club‚Äù and receives special recognition for the company's family-friendly philosophy. In fall 2012, another production site is opened in Beijing ‚Äì the second just-in-sequence plant for door systems in China. The whole process, from the arrival of an order to delivery of the ready-to-fit product at the Beijing Benz Automotive plant eight kilometers away, takes only 300 minutes. In April 2013, Brose receives its first Pace Award for the sensor for hands- free opening of liftgates; it is the most highly sought-after and prestigious award in the US automotive supplier industry. The company supports the introduction of the dual-track training system in the US state of Michigan, thereby securing future skilled employees for its four locations in the United States. New production facilities in South Africa (seat systems) and Bremen (door systems) expand Brose's production capacity in 2014. Berlin-based Brose Antriebstechnik GmbH & Co begins series production of the first pedelec electric motor in fall as part of a joint project with bicycle manufacturer Rotwild. Due to the increasing electrification and digitization of vehicles, Brose invests in a test center in W√ºrzburg to measure electromagnetic compatibility. In 2015, a plant to produce door systems for Fiat opens in Goiana/Brazil. In fall, the foundation stone is laid for a new plant in Prievidza in Central Slovakia. The logistics center at the location in Ostrava/Czech Republic commissions an automatic high-bay and small parts warehouse in which transport takes place without forklifts. Brose presents numerous innovations at trade shows such as the International Motor Show in Frankfurt am Main and Auto Shanghai in China. The company receives two prestigious quality awards ‚Äì the Procurement Leaders Award and the Volkswagen Group Award. The city of Coburg pays tribute to the life's work of Max Brose by naming a street after the company founder. In 2016 Brose prepares the way for respective expansion of central technical and commercial functions in Bamberg. In this modern office building, about 600 employees control global purchasing, design, electronics and information technology for the group. Brose also opened a new administration building for 600 employees in Shanghai in April 2017. The aim is to strengthen and expand Brose's market position in China. Shareholders The Brose Group's shareholders include Michael Stoschek, his daughter Julia Stoschek and his son Maximilian Stoschek, his elder sister Christine Volkmann and her daughter. Michael Stoschek is Chairman of the Brose Group.

It is calculated by dividing the number of neutrophils by number of lymphocytes, usually from peripheral blood sample, but sometimes also from cells that infiltrate tissue, such as tumor. Recently Lymphocyte Monocyte ratio (LMR) has also been studied as a marker of inflammation including Tuberculosis and various cancers.  Uses  = Prognosis of cardiovascular diseases= Higher NLR is independent predictor of mortality in patients undergoing angiography or cardiac revascularization. =Prognostic marker in cancer= Increased NLR is associated with poor prognosis of various cancers, such as esophageal cancer or advanced pancreatic cancer. =Prognostic marker in COVID-19= NLR can be used as a prognostic marker for COVID-19 given the significant difference of NLR between those died and recovered from COVID-19. Reference values In a recent study, 95% of healthy adult subjects had a ratio between 0.78 and 3.53. 95% range : 2.5% of healthy adults having less than 0.78, and 2.5% above 3.53. History Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio was first demonstrated as useful parameter after a correlation of a relationship between the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio to reactions of the immune response was noted. A study in 2001 was conducted by the Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, St. Elizabeth Cancer Institute in Bratislava by Zahorec which suggested the routine used of the ratio as a stress factor in clinical ICU practice in intervals of 6-12 and 24 hours.

Background and filming Oflag XVII-A was a prisoner-of-war camp operated by Nazi Germany in Austria, on the border of Czechoslovakia. Its 40 barracks housed five thousand French prisoners of war captured during the Battle of France. According to Robert Christophe, in his making-of booklet on the film, Oflag XVII-A had a Gaullist resistance group called \\"La Maffia\\", which had ties to a French Resistance group (apparently the only such collaboration between prisoners outside France and resistance inside it), and thus acquired the materials for the camera (and supplies for escape attempts). Taking advantage of humanitarian packages from France, the prisoners smuggled in materials necessary for the construction and operation of a camera. Film was sent from France in packets with food for prisoners; they were hidden in sausages and other foods, and after being developed the negatives were hidden in the heels of the prisoners' boots (the footage documents such detail). Fourteen rolls were filmed by March 1945. The camera was made from a wooden box, which was hidden in a Larousse dictionary; the spine of this dictionary was capable of being opened like a shutter. Content The 30-minute film documents daily life in the camp, including a theater production, food distribution, as well as a surprise raid by the Nazi guards. The film even documents the digging of tunnels for several escape attempts. One, of which parts are documented in the film,they dug under the whole prison.but then they hit a problem,granite every swing of the pickaxe could be heard so the put on a show atop for the nazis whilst they dug and soon hit freedom resulted in 132 prisoners escaping; 1 week later 126 got recaptured; only six made it back to France. Legacy After the camp was liberated by the Soviets the rolls were hidden in a mess tin and given to the French liaison officer for General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. A booklet by Christopher about the making of the film was published in 1948 by √âditions OPTA.

Location  Dame Lane is located in the south of Dublin's historic city center, parallel to Dame Street. Temple Bar and College Green are found just north of the street. Dame Lane is close to Dublin Castle, St Andrew's Church (now the Dublin Tourism Office) and Trinity College. The lane stretches from Trinity Street, to Palace Street, across South Great George‚Äôs Street in an east-west direction. It also runs alongside and close to part of the \\"Dubline\\", an historic Dublin tourist walking trail that stretches from College Green to Kilmainham. History Dame Lane derives its name from the medieval church of St. Mary del Dam, which was demolished in the 17th century. According to some sources, the name of the church comes from a Poddle dam that originally gave its name to Dam(e) Street and to the eastern gate of the city of Dublin. These are identified as Damas Street and Damas Gate on John Speed‚Äôs map of 1610.http://images.dubline.ie/pdfs/East_West_Cultural_Alignment_Doc.pdf Speed's map also shows a residential area stretching east from the walled city, the old 12th-century St Andrew's Church, and a semi-circular enclosed graveyard near Palace Street.Wright, George Newenham, An Historical Guide to the City of Dublin. 2nd edition published London: Baldwin, Cradock and Joy, 1825 Various spellings appear in different sources and on maps, including Damas, Dammas, Dames, and Dame's.http://www.logainm.ie/eolas/Data/IHTA/dublin-2.pdf Dame Street, just to the north, \\"was the Royal Mile of 18th Century Dublin,\\" linking the castle to the parliament building.McCullough, Niall, Dublin: An Urban History, Anne Street Press, Dublin, 2001, p.47 Today, Dame Lane dates mainly from the late 18th century, when it was set out as a mews lane as part of the work of the Wide Streets Commission, between 1785 and 1790, in the second phase of its works \\"for making wide and convenient streets.\\" The section of Dame Lane closest to Dublin Castle follows the line of an older route through the area where the old Castle Market stood, just off what is now South Great George's Street. The re-alignment of this, the oldest part of the existing lane, began in 1782 with the demolition of Castle Market.Pearson 2000, p.69McCullough, Niall, Dublin: An Urban History, Anne Street Press, Dublin, 2001, p.128 Dame Lane is shown but described as \\"unnamed\\" on Brooking's map of 1728, but is identified on Rocque's later map of 1756. The old Castle Market, dating from around 1707, was developed by Alderman William Fownes and James Pooley, Esq.Harris, Walter, The History and Antiquities of the city of Dublin, from the earliest accounts (1766) and built on the site of the churchyard of the old St Andrew's Church. Some time after 1682, the old St. Andrew's graveyard was obliterated with the construction of the market. This market is shown clearly on Rocque‚Äôs 1756 map. It featured 34 stalls of butchers, cheesemakers and poulterers, and the map: \\"shows a marketplace connected to George's street by a narrow laneway. It could be entered from Palace St by another short alleyway known as Dame Lane\\".Pearson 2000, p.68 From 1785-1790, the newer section of Dame Lane, east of George's Street, replaced an earlier medieval street pattern of \\"tangled plots and lanes between George's Lane and Trinity Street\\".McCullough, Niall, Dublin: An Urban History, Anne Street Press, Dublin, 2001, p.75 Trinity Place, a mainly residential lane and square, existed along this lane for many years in the 19th century, but has long since gone.

He was born in the East End of London to Jewish immigrants and his early years were devoted to activity as a Communist Party militant and then a party full timer. In 1945 he was the election agent for one of only two Communist candidates ever elected to the London County Council. Near the age of 50, he entered academia as an economist after studying at Balliol College, Oxford for a D.Phil. (without any previous academic qualifications) from 1967 to 1971. He once explained his difficulties in filling in applications for university posts: \\"Education: St George's-in- the-East Secondary, Stepney 1930‚Äì34; Balliol College, Oxford 1967‚Äì71.\\" He became head of the economics department at South Bank Polytechnic and published a stream of books and articles on topics such as industrial pricing, insurance, monopoly, the impact of the City on the London economy, macroeconomic policy. Although he remained a Communist Party member and a devoted Marxist, he was a critic of party orthodoxy. Working with a team of militant trade union officials and young intellectuals, Aaronovitch helped develop the Alternative Economic Strategy for the Labour movement only to see it derailed by the 1979 election victory of Margaret Thatcher. He published a series of books on British political economy helping popularize the subject and as a speaker was able to combine and integrate industrial and academic viewpoints. Aaronovitch aligned himself with the modernizing Eurocommunist movement in the 1980s and was a frequent contributor to Marxism Today. In 1981, he published The Road from Thatcherism in an attempt to articulate the need for a broad alliance against Thatcherism. In 1982, he established and ran the Local Economic Policy Unit and published the journal Local Economy. The Sam Aaronovitch Memorial Prize is awarded each year.Local Economy Journal, London South Bank University, UK. Falling ill, he retired from South Bank University in 1997. He was married three times, to Bertha, Kirstine, and Lavender. He was survived by five children, among them the science fiction scriptwriter and fantasy novelist Ben Aaronovitch, journalist David Aaronovitch and actor Owen Aaronovitch. A family memoir by David Aaronovitch, Party Animals: My Family and Other Communists, was published in January 2016.

RALD is characterized by lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, autoimmunity, and elevation in granulocytes and monocytes. It shares many features with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and is caused by somatic mutations in NRAS or KRAS. This was first described by investigators Jo√£o Oliveira and Michael Lenardo from the National Institutes of Health. Presentation Clinically, RALD is characterized by splenomegaly, a relatively mild degree of peripheral lymphadenopathy, and autoimmunity. The autoimmune phenotype can present in childhood or adulthood and primarily includes autoimmune hemolytic anemia, ITP, and neutropenia. Some patients have a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections. It is unclear if increased risk for malignancy is part of RALD. Importantly, however, the clinical and laboratory phenotype resembles juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The high fatality rate of this childhood blood cancer puts it in sharp contrast when compared to the relatively benign and chronic course of RALD. Approximately 15-30% of patients diagnosed with JMML have somatic, activating RAS mutations. However, due to the difficulty in distinguishing JMML from RALD, it is possible a subset of patients treated for JMML actually have RALD and could therefore avoid the aggressive JMML treatment. This distinction is under investigation. Genetics RALD is caused by gain-of-function somatic mutations in the genes NRAS or KRAS. NRAS and KRAS are members of the RAS subfamily and are implicated in many types of cancer. Somatic mutations are changes in DNA that occur after conception. Although generally somatic mutations can develop in any cell of the body, in RALD the somatic mutations only reside in the blood cells. Because these mutations are acquired and not in the germline, they cannot be inherited or passed on to children. =Function= Somatic RAS mutations greatly diminish the GTPase activity within the cell. The reduced GTPase activity locks the cells in an activated state and degrades the pro-apoptotic BIM protein, thus making the cells resistant to apoptosis. In contrast to ALPS, this apoptosis defect does not involve the FAS pathway. Diagnosis RALD patients show normal to modestly decreased total lymphocytes, mild to no elevation in Œ±Œ≤-double negative T cells, a relative expansion of B cells, and elevated granulocytes and monocytes. The absolute or relative monocytosis in particular is an important characteristic of this disorder and help differentiate it from ALPS. Autoantibodies are also common. Management Research Investigators at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health currently have clinical protocols to study new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder.http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, study ID NCT00246857, NCT00001467, and others References  External links  Category:Immune system disorders Category:Autoimmune diseases Category:Genetic diseases and disorders ","title":"RAS-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disorder"},{"id":"42437015","text":"Abb√© F√©lix Klein (12.

It was founded in 1864 in a workmen's meeting held in St. Martin's Hall, London. Its first congress was held in 1866 in Geneva. In Europe, a period of harsh reaction followed the widespread Revolutions of 1848. The next major phase of revolutionary activity began almost twenty years later with the founding of the IWA in 1864. At its peak, the IWA reported having 8 million members\\"Journal Officiel\\", May 29, 1871 (official journal of IWA). while police reported 5 million.Payne, Robert (1968). \\"Marx: A Biography\\".

Origins  Following the January Uprising in Poland in 1863, French and British workers started to discuss developing a closer working relationship. Henri Tolain, Joseph Perrachon and Charles Limousin visited London in July 1863, attending a meeting in St. James's Hall in honour of the Polish uprising. They discussed the need for an international organisation, which would amongst other things prevent the import of foreign workers to break strikes. In September 1864, French and British delegates again met in London, this time to set up an organization for sharing labor information across borders.  St. Martin's Hall Meeting, London, 1864  On 28 September an international crowd of workers gathered to welcome the French delegates in St. Martin‚Äôs Hall in London. Among the many European radicals were English Owenites, followers of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Louis Auguste Blanqui, Irish and Polish nationalists, Italian republicans and German socialists.Saul K.

Included among the last-mentioned of this eclectic band was a somewhat obscure 46-year-old √©migr√© journalist Karl Marx, who would soon come to play a decisive role in the organisation. The positivist historian Edward Spencer Beesly, a professor at London University, was in the chair. His speech pilloried the violent proceedings of the governments and referred to their flagrant breaches of international law and advocated a union of the workers of the world for the realisation of justice on earth. George Odger, Secretary of the London Trades Council, read a speech calling for international co- operation. The meeting unanimously decided to found an international organisation of workers. The centre was to be in London, directed by a committee of 21, which was instructed to draft a programme and constitution.

The French members were Denoual, Victor Le Lubez and Bosquet. Italy was represented by Fontana. Other members were Louis Wolff, Johann Eccarius and at the foot of the list Marx, who participated in his individual capacity and did not speak during the meeting.Jos√© Luis Rubio, Las internacionales obreras en Am√©rica. Madrid: 1971; p. 40. This executive committee in turn selected a subcommittee to do the actual writing of the organisational programme‚Äîa group which included Marx and which met at his home about a week after the conclusion of the St. Martin's Hall assembly. This subcommittee deferred the task of collective writing in favour of sole authorship by Marx and it was he who ultimately drew up the fundamental documents of the new organisation. On 5 October, the General Council was formed with co-opted additional members representing other nationalities. It was based at the headquarters of the Universal League for the Material Elevation of the Industrious Classes at 18 Greek Street.F. M. Leventhal. Respectable Radical. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson 1971. Different groups offered proposals for the organisation. Louis Wolff (Mazzini's secretary) offered a proposal based on the rules and constitution of the Italian Workingmen‚Äôs Association (a Mazzinist organisation) and John Weston, an Owenite, also tabled a programme. Wolff left for Italy and Lubez rewrote it in a way which appalled Marx. Marx then set about writing the Address to the Working Classes to which was attached a simplified set of rules.  Internal tensions  At first, the IWA had mostly male membership, although in April 1865 it was agreed that women could become members. The initial leadership was exclusively male. At the IWA General Council meeting on 16 April 1867, a letter from the secularist speaker Harriet Law about women's rights was read and it was agreed to ask her if she would be willing to attend council meetings. On 25 June 1867, Law was admitted to the General Council and for the next five years was the only woman representative. Due to the wide variety of philosophies present in the First International, there was conflict from the start. The first objections to Marx's influence came from the mutualists, who opposed communism and statism. However, shortly after Mikhail Bakunin and his followers (called collectivists while in the International) joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Perhaps the clearest differences between the groups emerged over their proposed strategies for achieving their visions of socialism. The anarchists grouped around Bakunin favoured (in Peter Kropotkin's words) \\"direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation\\". Marxist thinking at that time focused on parliamentary activity. For example, when the new German Empire of 1871 introduced male suffrage, many German socialists became active in the Marxist Social Democratic Party of Germany.  Geneva Congress, 1866  During the Geneva Congress, the Paris group of Proudhonians dominated the discussions. Six Blanquists from Paris came to the Congress to denounce the French representatives as emissaries of Napoleon III, but they were thrown out. A significant decision at this event was the adoption of the eight-hour work day as one of the IWA's fundamental demands.  Lausanne Congress, 1867  The Lausanne Congress of the International was held on 2‚Äì8 September 1867. Marx was unable to attend as he was working on the final proofs of Das Kapital. The Congress was attended by 64 delegates from Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland. The reports delivered recorded the increased influence of the International on the working classes in various countries. The Proudhonist delegates, primarily from France, influenced the orientation of the International's activity and its programmatic principles. Despite the efforts of the General Council's delegates, they succeeded in revising the resolutions of the Geneva Congress, passing a number of their resolutions, in particular on cooperation and credit. The Lausanne Congress confirmed the Geneva Congress resolutions on the economic struggle and strikes and passed a resolution on political freedom which emphasised that the social emancipation of workers was inseparable from political liberation. The Proudhonists also failed to seize the leadership of the International as the Congress re-elected the General Council in its former composition and retained London as its seat. The Lausanne Congress ignored the General Council's resolution and resolved officially to take part in the Congress of the League of Peace and Freedom. However, this Congress was attended by several General Council and some other International members and failed to resolve its political differences.  Brussels Congress, 1868  The Brussels Congress of the International in 1868 approved Marx's tactics in regard to the League, opposing official affiliation to the League, but calling upon the working class to combine efforts with all progressive anti-military forces.  Basel Congress, 1869  International Workingmen's Association Basel section banner (photo taken at now defunct Museum of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in Moscow, Soviet Union The Basel Congress took place on 6‚Äì12 September 1869. According to Yuri Mikhailovich Steklov's account:G. M. Stekloff, History of the First International, Chapter 10 The Basle Conference. > Seventy-five delegates assembled: from Great Britain, the 6 members of the > General Council, Applegarth, Eccarius, Cowell Stepney, Lessner, Lucraft, and > Jung; from France, which sent 26 delegates, among whom we may mention > Dereure, Landrin, Ch√©mal√©, Murat, Aubry, Tolain, A. Richard, Palix, Varlin, > and Bakunin: Belgium sent 5 delegates, among whom were Hins, Brism√©e, and De > Paepe; Austria 2 delegates, Neumayer and Oberwinder; Germany sent 10 > delegates, among whom were Becker, Liebknecht, Rittinghausen, and Hess; > Switzerland had 22 representatives, among whom were Burkly, Greulich, Fritz > Robert, Guillaume, Schwitzgu√©bel, and Perret; Italy sent but one delegate, > Caporusso; from Spain there came Farga-Pellicer and Sentinon; and the United > States of America was represented by Cameron. Jung was elected chairman of > the congress. The conference was mainly noted for the confrontation between the Proudhonist mutualists and the collectivist position, defended by Marx's envoy for the General Council and Bakunin both. However, the Belgian socialist de Paepe played a decisive role in bringing the Belgian delegation across to the collectivist side and isolating the mainly French Proudhonists.  Hague Congress, 1872  The fifth Congress of the IWA was held in early September 1872 in The Hague, the Netherlands. After the Paris Commune (1871), Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as authoritarian and argued that if a Marxist party came to power its leaders would end up as bad as the ruling class they had fought against (notably in his Statism and Anarchy). In 1872, the conflict in the First International climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress. This clash is often cited as the origin of the long- running conflict between anarchists and Marxists. The Hague Congress was notable for the attempted expulsion of Bakunin and Guillaume and for the decision to relocate the General Council to New York City. The main resolutions passed centred on committing the International to building political parties, aimed at capturing state power as an indispensable condition for socialist transformation.  After 1872: two First Internationals  From then on, the Marxist and anarchist currents of socialism had distinct organisations, at various points including rival internationals. This split is sometimes called the \\"red\\" and \\"black\\" divide, red referring to the Marxists and black referring to the anarchists. Otto von Bismarck remarked upon hearing of the split at the First International that \\"[c]rowned heads, wealth and privilege may well tremble should ever again the Black and Red unite!\\".As cited in The anarchist wing of the First International held a separate congress in September 1872 at St. Imier, Switzerland. The anarchists rejected the claim that Bakunin and Guillaume had been expelled and repudiated The Hague Congress as unrepresentative and improperly conducted. Over two days on 15‚Äì16 September 1872 at Saint-Imier, they declared themselves to be the true heirs of the International (see Anarchist St. Imier International). Bakunin's programme was adopted, Marx was implicitly excluded and the anarchist First International ran until 1877, with some early growth in areas like Egypt and Turkey. The sixth Congress of the Marxist wing of the International was held in Geneva in September 1873, but it was generally considered to be a failure. The Marxist wing hobbled on until it disbanded three years later at the 1876 Philadelphia conference. Attempts to revive the organisation over the next five years failed. Since scholarship on the International is heavily shaped by different assessments of the importance and the effects of the Marx‚ÄìBakunin conflict, different accounts emphasise different wings of the International and give different dates of its final closure (1876 or 1877). The Second International was established in 1889 as a successor. Both anarchists and Marxists were involved in the new body in its early years. The International Working People's Association (the so-called Black International), an anarchist International, appeared in 1881, was mainly influential in the United States and Mexico and gradually disappeared after the late 1880s. At a congress in Berlin in 1922, the anarcho-syndicalists decided to re-found the First International as the International Workers' Association, which still exists.

The Young Communist International was the parallel international youth organization affiliated with the Communist International (Comintern). History =International socialist youth organization before World War I= After failed efforts to form an international association of socialist youth organizations in 1889 and 1904, in May 1907 a conference in Stuttgart, Germany convened to form the International Union of Socialist Youth Organisations (the Internationale Verbindung Sozialistischer Jugendorganisationen, abbreviated IVSJO).Richard Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard: The Early Years of the Communist Youth International, 1914-1924. (Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press, 1982), pg. 9. IVSJO maintained its headquarters in Vienna and functioned as the youth section of the Second International. At its foundation the International Secretary of IVSJO was Hendrik de Man. De Man was succeeded by Robert Danneberg, who held the post from 1908 to 1915. The first Chairman of the IVSJO was the German anti-militarist radical Karl Liebknecht. Liebknecht served as an inspiration and \\"elder statesman\\" for radical youth throughout Europe.Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard, pg. 10. The coming of the first World War brought an end to the work of the IVSJO. The organization was founded on the premise that its task was primarily educational, rather than political, and that participation of the young socialists of all countries and all political tendencies was necessary for its continued ability to function.Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard, pg. 15. The coming of the European war and the support of the various national socialist parties for their governments in the conflict effectively ended the possibility of international cooperation and the official IVSJO effectively ceased to exist. The radical youth movement based in the neutral nation of Switzerland attempted to unite the various national sections of the socialist movement on a new basis, however. With the charismatic head of the Swiss socialist youth movement, Willi M√ºnzenberg, playing the leading part, an anti-militaristic conference of international youth sections was called. On April 4, 1915, nine delegates from various neutral countries assembled in Bern to attempt to establish a center for a revitalized IVSJO organization. While the conference did not endorse Lenin's call for revolutionary civil war to end the European bloodbath, the conference did endorse \\"revolutionary socialism\\" and the recreation of the socialist youth movement independent of the various (chauvinistic) national socialist parties. As historian Richard Cornell notes, \\"This marked a critical turning point in the history of the socialist youth movement.\\"Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard, pg. 17. The Bern conference decided to start a publication called Die Jugendinternationale (The Youth International) and an International Youth Bureau was established. Headquarters were established in Zurich, with Willi M√ºnzenberg elected by the conference to fill the role of International Secretary of the reconstituted IVSJO.Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard, pg. 18. =Formation of the YCI = Poster of YCI By 1918, all the official socialist youth organizations of Europe ‚Äî with the exception of the German, the Dutch, and the French ‚Äî had affiliated themselves with the reconstituted IVSJO.Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard, pg. 18. While the organization was anti-militarist, severe divisions remained as to how to bring an end to the war. The pacifist Center faction sought the establishment of binding arbitration and measures for the active limitation of armaments, while the revolutionary Left, inspired by events in Soviet Russia, increasingly came to see international revolution as the only possible solution to the inevitability of capitalist war.Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard, pp. 23-24. This division roughly paralleled the split in the adult movement of the Zimmerwald movement between pacifist Majority and revolutionary Left factions. The decisive break came in March 1919 with the establishment of the Communist International in Moscow. Splits began to take place in socialist parties around the world between electorally-oriented socialist and revolutionary- oriented communist tendencies. As Richard Cornell notes, \\"The young socialists were now pitched headlong into party debates. Neutrality was no longer possible.\\"Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard, pg. 31. On November 20, 1919, the IVSJO held its first conference after the war. In secret conditions in a beer- hall in Berlin delegates representing many of the socialist youth organizations of Europe assembled, called together by International Secretary Willi M√ºnzenberg. The conference decided to change the name to \\"Young Communist International\\" and was subsequently known as the First Congress of YCI. Some 19 delegates were in attendance, representing the socialist youth organizations of Russia, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Spain, as well as an opposition faction from Czechoslovakia.A Short History of the Young Communist International. (New York: Young Communist League, n.d. [1928]), pg. 12. The First Congress established headquarters for the YCI organization in Berlin. Decisions of the organization were to be made by a five-member Executive Committee of the Communist Youth International (ECCYI), and a program for the organization was adopted.A Short History of the Young Communist International, pp. 12-13. =The Question of Party Control= Perhaps the most important issue determined during the first years of the Young Communist International dealt with the relationship of the youth movement with the emerging communist parties of various countries. This matter had been tenaciously discussed at the 1919 Berlin Conference, with the Russian delegate, Lazar Shatskin, advancing the position that the various national youth groups should be under the immediate direction and control of the corresponding adult parties. This position was opposed by others from the Western European socialist tradition, which envisioned an independent vanguard role for the communist youth movement. At Berlin a compromise was reached, in which it was agreed that the YCI would not be considered a \\"sister\\" organization to the Communist International, but rather a \\"part\\" of the Comintern. National youth organizations were obligated to follow either the political program of \\"that party or faction in their country which is a member of the Third International\\" or the program of the Comintern itself.Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard, pg. 167. The YCI remained divided between adherents of an independent line, concentrated in Germany and headed by Willi M√ºnzenberg,Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard, pg. 176. and those desiring to follow a close Russian lead through the close direction of the youth movement by the Comintern. Historian of the early Communist youth movement Richard Cornell notes the thinking of the Berlin-centric group: > M√ºnzenberg at this time gave expression to what was clearly the underlying > sense of frustration of the young communist activists. Acknowledging the > necessity for centralism in the Communist movement so as to concentrate \\"the > greatest striking power,\\" he pleaded almost despairingly not to so > overcentalize the movement that the \\"revolutionary initiative\\" of all true > communists was bound and stifled. Having struggled for so long toget out > from under the bureaucracy of the German social democrats (SPD), M√ºnzenberg > and the young German communists had no desire to substitute a new communist > bureaucracy for the old social democratic one.Cornell, Revolutionary > Vanguard, pg. 177. The division between independent and Moscow-centric young communists came to a head in 1921 over the scheduling of a 2nd World Congress of the Young Communist International. The Russo-centric contingent of the YCI had sought a gathering in Moscow in the summer of 1921, in conjunction with the previously scheduled 3rd World Congress of the Communist International. Head of the Comintern Grigory Zinoviev had been prevailed upon to send a letter to the ECCYI in November 1920 supporting such a venue.Cornell, Revolutionary Vanguard, pg. 178. Nevertheless‚Äîand over the strong objections of its Russian contingent‚Äîthe Executive Committee of the YCI independently decided to convene the 2nd World Congress of the organization's deliberative body on April 6 in Jena. The Russians refused to attend this gathering, which had to be held in secrecy due to its \\"illegal\\" status in the eyes of the police. Four days after its convocation, the meeting place of the secret gathering was shifted to Berlin, due to security considerations. The session was abruptly terminated at the Comintern's behest on instructions from the Executive Committee of the Communist International. A so-called \\"Real Second Congress\\" was convened in Moscow between June 9 and June 23, immediately prior to the 3rd World Congress of the Comintern.Historian E.H. Carr remarked: > \\"That resistance and criticism was experienced is suggested by the fact that > Lenin intervened in person in order to reconcile divergent opinions, and > that Trotsky appeared at the congress to defend Comintern against the charge > of subordinating the interests of world revolution to those of Soviet > Russia.

For its part, the 3rd Congress of Comintern addressed the question of the communist youth movement. The YCI organization was streamlined along the structure of the Comintern and YCI member organization were obliged to adopt the name \\"Young Communist League\\" followed by their national denomination.

Class conflict, also referred to as class struggle and class warfare, is the political tension and economic antagonism that exists in society consequent to socio-economic competition among the social classes or between rich and poor. The forms of class conflict include direct violence, such as wars for resources and cheap labor, assassinations or revolution; indirect violence, such as deaths from poverty and starvation, illness and unsafe working conditions. Economic coercion, such as the threat of unemployment or the withdrawal of investment capital; or ideologically, by way of political literature. Additionally, political forms of class warfare are: legal and illegal lobbying, and bribery of legislators. The social-class conflict can be direct, as in a dispute between labour and management, such as an employer's industrial lockout of their employees in effort to weaken the bargaining power of the corresponding trade union; or indirect, such as a workers' slowdown of production in protest of unfair labor practices, such as low wages and poor workplace conditions. In the political and economic philosophies of Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin, class struggle is a central tenet and a practical means for effecting radical social and political changes for the social majority.The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought (1999) Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds., p. 127.  Usage  Truck drivers fight the police in the course of the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934 Heads of aristocrats on pikes Farmer confronting landlord during Mao Zedong's mass purging of landlords In political science, socialists and Marxists use the term class conflict to define a social class by its relationship to the means of production, such as factories, agricultural land, and industrial machinery. The social control of labor and of the production of goods and services, is a political contest between the social classes. The anarchist Mikhail Bakunin said that the class struggles of the working class, the peasantry, and the working poor were central to realizing a social revolution to depose and replace the ruling class, and the creation of libertarian socialism. Marx's theory of history proposes that class conflict is decisive in the history of economic systems organized by hierarchies of social class, such as capitalism and feudalism. Marxists refer to its overt manifestations as class war, a struggle whose resolution in favor of the working class is viewed by them as inevitable under plutocratic capitalism. Oligarchs versus commoners Where societies are socially divided based on status, wealth, or control of social production and distribution, class structures arise and are thus coeval with civilization itself. This has been well documented since at least European classical antiquity (Conflict of the Orders, Spartacus, etc.)The Class Struggle in the Ancient Greek World G.E.M. DE Ste. Croix Cornell University Press 1981 =Thucydides= In his History, Thucydides gives an account of a civil war in the city of Corcyra between the pro-Athens party of the common people and their pro-Corinth oligarchic opposition. Near the climax of the struggle, 'the oligarchs in full rout, fearing that the victorious commons might assault and carry the arsenal and put them to the sword, fired the houses round the market-place and the lodging-houses, in order to bar their advance'.Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Book Three, Chapter X, Translated by Richard Crawley. The Internet Classics Archive. The historian Tacitus would later recount a similar class conflict in the city of Seleucia, in which disharmony between the oligarchs and the commoners would typically lead to each side calling on outside help to defeat the other.Cornelius Tacitus. Annals, Book VI, Section 42, Translated by John Jackson. LacusCurtius. Thucydides believed that 'as long as poverty gives men the courage of necessity, [...] so long will the impulse never be wanting to drive men into danger.'Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Book Three, Chapter IX. =Aristotle= Similarly, Aristotle commented that 'poverty is the parent of revolution'.Aristotle. Politics, Book Two, Part VI. Translated by Benjamin Jowett. Internet Classics Archive. However, he didn't consider this the only cause of revolution. In a society where property is distributed equally across the community, 'the nobles will be dissatisfied because they think themselves worthy of more than an equal share of honours; and this is often found to be a cause of sedition and revolution.'Aristotle. Politics, Book Two, Part VII. Aristotle thought it wrong for the poor to seize the wealth of the rich and divide it among themselves, but he also thought it wrong for the rich to impoverish the multitude.Aristotle. Politics, Book Three, Part X. Moreover, he discussed what he considered a middle way between laxity and cruelty in the treatment of slaves by their masters, averring that 'if not kept in hand, [slaves] are insolent, and think that they are as good as their masters, and, if harshly treated, they hate and conspire against them.'Aristotle. Politics, Book Two, Part IX. In his treatise Politics, Aristotle describes the basic dimensions of class war: 'Again, because the rich are generally few in number, while the poor are many, they appear to be antagonistic, and as the one or the other prevails they form the government.'Aristotle. Politics, Book Four, Part IV. =Socrates= Yet it was Socrates who was perhaps the first major Greek philosopher to describe class war. In Plato's Republic, Socrates proposes that 'any city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of the poor, the other of the rich; these are at war with one another'.Plato. The Republic, Book IV. Translated by Benjamin Jowett. Project Gutenberg. Socrates took a poor view of oligarchies, in which members of a small class of wealthy property owners take positions of power in order to dominate a large class of impoverished commoners. He used the analogy of a maritime pilot, who, like a powerholder in a polis, ought to be chosen for his skill, not for the amount of property he owns.Plato. The Republic, Book VIII. =Plutarch= This 6th century Athenian black-figure urn, in the British Museum, depicts the olive harvest. Many farmers, enslaved for debt, would have worked on large estates for their creditors. Plutarch recounts how various classical figures took part in class conflict. Oppressed by their indebtedness to the rich, the mass of Athenians chose Solon to be the lawgiver to lead them to freedom from their creditors.Plutarch. Lives, Solon. Translated by John Dryden. Project Gutenberg. Furthermore, Hegel writes of Solon that, through his constituting of the Athenian popular assembly, he found a political sphere in which there could be found a balance of interests between three main classes of Athens: *The wealthy aristocratic party of the plain *The poorer common party of the mountains *The moderate party of the coastGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich HegelThe Philosophy of History, Part II. 'An antagonism had early arisen between ancient and wealthy families and such as were poorer. Three parties, whose distinction had been grounded on their local position and the mode of life which that position suggested were then fully recognized. These were, the Pediaeans ‚Äî inhabitants of the plain, the rich and aristocratic; the Diacrians ‚Äî mountaineers, cultivators of the vine and olive, and herdsmen, who were the most numerous class; and between the two [in political status and sentiment] the Paralians ‚Äî inhabitants of the coast, the moderate party. The polity of the state was wavering between Aristocracy and Democracy. Solon effected, by his division into four property-classes, a medium between these opposites.' McMaster University. Participation in Ancient Greek class war could have dangerous consequences. Plutarch noted of King Agis of Sparta that, 'being desirous to raise the people, and to restore the noble and just form of government, now long fallen into disuse, [he]incurred the hatred of the rich and powerful, who could not endure to be deprived of the selfish enjoyment to which they were accustomed.'Plutarch. Lives, Agis. Patricians versus plebeians It was similarly difficult for the Romans to maintain peace between the upper class, the patricians, and the lower class, the plebs. French Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu notes that this conflict intensified after the overthrow of the Roman monarchy.Charles Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu. The Spirit of Laws, Volume 1, Book XI, Chapter 13. Liberty Fund. In The Spirit of Laws he lists the four main greivances of the plebs, which were rectified in the years following the deposition of King Tarquin: * The patricians had much too easy access to positions of public service. * The constitution granted the consuls far too much power. * The plebs were constantly verbally slighted. * The plebs had too little power in their assemblies.Montesquieu. The Spirit of Laws, Volume 1, Book XI, Chapter 14. =Camillus= The Senate had the ability to give a magistrate the power of dictatorship, meaning he could bypass public law in the pursuit of a prescribed mandate. Montesquieu explains that the purpose of this institution was to tilt the balance of power in favour of the patricians. Montesqueiu. The Spirit of Laws, Volume 1, Book XI, Chapter 16. However, in an attempt to resolve a conflict between the patricians and the plebs, the dictator Camillus used his power of dictatorship to coerce the Senate into giving the plebs the right to choose one of the two consuls.Plutarch. Lives, Camillus. =Marius= Tacitus believed that the increase in Roman power spurred the patricians to expand their power over more and more cities. This process, he felt, exacerbated pre-existing class tensions with the plebs, and eventually culminated in the patrician Sulla's first civil war, with the populist reformer Marius.Cornelius Tacitus. The Histories, Book II, Section 38. Translated by C. H. Moore. LacusCurtius. Marius had taken the step of enlisting capite censi, the very lowest class of citizens, into the army, for the first time allowing non-land owners into the legions. =Tiberius Gracchus= Tiberius Gracchus Yet of all the notable figures discussed by Plutarch and Tacitus, agrarian reformer Tiberius Gracchus may have most challenged the upper classes and most championed the cause of the lower classes. In a speech to the common soldiery, he decried their lowly conditions: > \\"The savage beasts,\\" said he, \\"in Italy, have their particular dens, they > have their places of repose and refuge; but the men who bear arms, and > expose their lives for the safety of their country, enjoy in the meantime > nothing more in it but the air and light; and having no houses or > settlements of their own, are constrained to wander from place to place with > their wives and children.\\" Following this observation, he remarked that these men 'fought indeed and were slain, but it was to maintain the luxury and the wealth of other men.'Plutarch. Lives, Tiberius Gracchus. Cicero believed that Tiberius Gracchus's reforming efforts saved Rome from tyranny: > ‚ÄúTiberius Gracchus (says Cicero) caused the free-men to be admitted into the > tribes, not by the force of his eloquence, but by a word, by a gesture; > which had he not effected, the republic, whose drooping head we are at > present scarce able to uphold, would not even exist.‚ÄùIn Montesquieu. The > Spirit of Laws, Volume 1, Book XI, Chapter 15. Tiberius Gracchus weakened the power of the Senate by changing the law so that judges were chosen from the ranks of the knights, instead of their social superiors in the senatorial class.In Montesquieu. The Spirit of Laws, Volume 1, Book XI, Chapter 18. =Julius Caesar= Contrary to Shakespeare's depiction of Julius Caesar in the tragedy Julius Caesar, historian Michael Parenti has argued that Caesar was a populist, not a tyrant. In 2003 The New Press published Parenti's The Assassination of Julius Caesar: A People's History of Ancient Rome. Publisher's Weekly said, \\"Parenti [...] narrates a provocative history of the late republic in Rome (100‚Äì33 B.C.) to demonstrate that Caesar's death was the culmination of growing class conflict, economic disparity and political corruption.\\" Kirkus Reviews wrote: \\"Populist historian Parenti... views ancient Rome‚Äôs most famous assassination not as a tyrannicide but as a sanguinary scene in the never-ending drama of class warfare.\\" =Coriolanus= Gavin Hamilton. The patrician Coriolanus, whose life William Shakespeare would later depict in the tragic play Coriolanus, fought on the other side of the class war, for the patricians and against the plebs. When grain arrived to relieve a serious shortage in the city of Rome, the plebs made it known that they felt it ought to be divided amongst them as a gift, but Coriolanus stood up in the Senate against this idea on the grounds that it would empower the plebs at the expense of the patricians.Plutarch. Lives, Coriolanus. This decision would eventually contribute to Coriolanus's undoing when he was impeached following a trial by the tribunes of the plebs. Montesquieu recounts how Coriolanus castigated the tribunes for trying a patrician, when in his mind no one but a consul had that right, although a law had been passed stipulating that all appeals affecting the life of a citizen had to be brought before the plebs.Montesquieu. The Spirit of Laws, Volume 1, Book XI, Chapter 18. In the first scene of Shakespeare's Coriolanus, a crowd of angry plebs gathers in Rome to denounce Coriolanus as the 'chief enemy to the people' and 'a very dog to the commonalty', while the leader of the mob speaks out against the patricians thusly: > 'They ne'er cared for us yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses > crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily > any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing > statutes daily, to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not > up, they will; and there's all the love they bear us.' William Shakespeare. > Coriolanus, Act I, Scene I. The Complete Works of William Shakespeare =Landlessness and Debt= The Secession of the People to the Mons Sacer, engraving by B. Barloccini, 1849. Enlightenment-era historian Edward Gibbon might have agreed with this narrative of Roman class conflict. In the third volume of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, he relates the origins of the struggle: > '[T]he plebeians of Rome [...] had been oppressed from the earliest times by > the weight of debt and usury; and the husbandman, during the term of his > military service, was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm. The > lands of Italy which had been originally divided among the families of free > and indigent proprietors, were insensibly purchased or usurped by the > avarice of the nobles; and in the age which preceded the fall of the > republic, it was computed that only two thousand citizens were possessed of > an independent substance.' Hegel similarly states that the 'severity of the patricians their creditors, the debts due to whom they had to discharge by slave-work, drove the plebs to revolts.'Hegel. The Philosophy of History, Part III. McMaster University. Gibbon also explains how Augustus facilitated this class warfare by pacifying the plebs with actual bread and circuses.Edward Gibbon. History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume III, Chapter XXXI, Part 1. Project Gutenberg. The economist Adam Smith noted that the poor freeman's lack of land provided a major impetus for Roman colonisation, as a way to relieve class tensions at home between the rich and the landless poor.Adam Smith. The Wealth of Nations, Book IV, Chapter 7, Part 1. 'The citizens, therefore, who had no land, had scarce any other means of subsistence but the bounties of the candidates at the annual elections. The tribunes, when they had a mind to animate the people against the rich and the great, put them in mind of the ancient divisions of lands, and represented that law which restricted this sort of private property as the fundamental law of the republic. The people became clamorous to get land, and the rich and the great, we may believe, were perfectly determined not to give them any part of theirs. To satisfy them in some measure, therefore, they frequently proposed to send out a new colony.' Project Gutenberg. Hegel described the same phenomenon happening in the impetus to Greek colonisation.Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. The Philosophy of History, Part II. 'Nevertheless a part of the poorer classes would not submit to the degradations of poverty, for everyone felt himself a free citizen. The only expedient, therefore, that remained, was colonization. In another country, those who suffered distress in their own, might seek a free soil, and gain a living as free citizens by its cultivation.' McMaster University. Masters versus workmen Writing in pre-capitalist Europe, both the Swiss philosophe Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher Adam Smith made significant remarks on the dynamics of class struggle, as did the Federalist statesman James Madison across the Atlantic Ocean. Later, in the age of early industrial capitalism, English political economist John Stuart Mill and German idealist Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel would also contribute their perspectives to the discussion around class conflict between employers and employees. =Rousseau= Rousseau by Maurice Quentin de La Tour, 1753. It was with bitter sarcasm that Rousseau outlined the class conflict prevailing in his day between masters and their workmen: > ‚ÄúYou have need of me, because I am rich and you are poor. We will therefore > come to an agreement. I will permit you to have the honour of serving me, on > condition that you bestow on me the little you have left, in return for the > pains I shall take to command you.‚ÄùRousseau. The Social Contract and > Discourses, On Political Economy. Rousseau argued that the most important task of any government is to fight in class warfare on the side of workmen against their masters, who he said engage in exploitation under the pretence of serving society.Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The Social Contract and Discourses, On Political Economy. 'The law, which they thus abuse, serves the powerful at once as a weapon of offence, and as a shield against the weak; and the pretext of the public good is always the most dangerous scourge of the people. What is most necessary, and perhaps most difficult, in government, is rigid integrity in doing strict justice to all, and above all in protecting the poor against the tyranny of the rich.' Liberty Fund. Specifically, he believed that governments should actively intervene in the economy to abolish poverty and prevent the accrual of too much wealth in the hands of too few men.Rousseau. The Social Contract and Discourses, On Political Economy. 'It is therefore one of the most important functions of government to prevent extreme inequality of fortunes; not by taking away wealth from its possessors, but by depriving all men of means to accumulate it; not by building hospitals for the poor, but by securing the citizens from becoming poor.' =Adam Smith= Like Rousseau, the classical liberal Adam Smith believed that the amassing of property in the hands of a minority naturally resulted in an disharmonious state of affairs where 'the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of many' and 'excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade [the rich man's] possessions.'Adam Smith. The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Chapter 1, Part 2. Project Gutenberg. Concerning wages, he explained the conflicting class interests of masters and workmen, who he said were often compelled to form trade unions for fear of suffering starvation wages, as follows: > What are the common wages of labour, depends everywhere upon the contract > usually made between those two parties, whose interests are by no means the > same. The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little, as > possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise, the latter > in order to lower, the wages of labour. Adam Smith. An Inquiry into the > Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Book I, Chapter 8. Project > Gutenberg. Smith was aware of the main advantage of masters over workmen, in addition to state protection: > The masters, being fewer in number, can combine much more easily: and the > law, besides, authorises, or at least does not prohibit, their combinations, > while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no acts of parliament > against combining to lower the price of work, but many against combining to > raise it. In all such disputes, the masters can hold out much longer. A > landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, or merchant, though they did not > employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks, > which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few > could subsist a month, and scarce any a year, without employment. In the > long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to > him; but the necessity is not so immediate.Adam Smith. An Inquiry into the > Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Book I, Chapter 8. Project > Gutenberg. Smith observed that, outside of colonies where land is cheap and labour expensive, both the masters who subsist by profit and the masters who subsist by rents will work in tandem to subjugate the class of workmen, who subsist by wages.Smith. The wealth of Nations, Book IV, Chapter 7, Part 2. 'In other countries, rent and profit eat up wages, and the two superior orders of people oppress the inferior one; but in new colonies, the interest of the two superior orders obliges them to treat the inferior one with more generosity and humanity, at least where that inferior one is not in a state of slavery. Waste lands, of the greatest natural fertility, are to be had for a trifle. The increase of revenue which the proprietor, who is always the undertaker, expects from their improvement, constitutes his profit, which, in these circumstances, is commonly very great; but this great profit cannot be made, without employing the labour of other people in clearing and cultivating the land; and the disproportion between the great extent of the land and the small number of the people, which commonly takes place in new colonies, makes it difficult for him to get this labour. He does not, therefore, dispute about wages, but is willing to employ labour at any price.' Moreover, he warned against blindly legislating in favour of the class of masters who subsist by profit, since, as he said, their intention is to gain as large a share of their respective markets as possible, which naturally results in monopoly prices or close to them, a situation harmful to the other social classes.Smith. The Wealth of Nations, Book I, Chapter 11, Part 2. 'The interest of the dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public. To widen the market, and to narrow the competition, is always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can only serve to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow-citizens. The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention. It comes from an order of men, whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public, and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.' =James Madison= In his Federalist No. 10, James Madison revealed an emphatic concern with the conflict between rich and poor, commenting that > the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and > unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without > property have ever formed distinct interests in society. Those who are > creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination.James > Madison. The Federalist Papers, Federalist No. 10. Library of Congress. He welcomed class-based factions into political life as a necessary result of political liberty, stating that the most important task of government was to manage and adjust for 'the spirit of party'.Madison. The Federalist Papers, Federalist No. 10. 'The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.' =John Stuart Mill= Adam Smith was not the only classical liberal political economist concerned with class conflict. In his Considerations on Representative Government, John Stuart Mill observed the complete marginalisation of workmen's voices in Parliament, rhetorically asking whether its members ever empathise with the position of workmen, instead of siding entirely with their masters, on issues such as the right to go on strike.John Stuart Mill. Representative Government, Chapter 3. ' Yet does Parliament, or almost any of the members composing it, ever for an instant look at any question with the eyes of a working man? When a subject arises in which the laborers as such have an interest, is it regarded from any point of view but that of the employers of labor? I do not say that the working men's view of these questions is in general nearer to the truth than the other, but it is sometimes quite as near; and in any case it ought to be respectfully listened to, instead of being, as it is, not merely turned away from, but ignored. On the question of strikes, for instance, it is doubtful if there is so much as one among the leading members of either House who is not firmly convinced that the reason of the matter is unqualifiedly on the side of the masters, and that the men's view of it is simply absurd. Those who have studied the question know well how far this is from being the case, and in how different, and how infinitely less superficial a manner the point would have to be argued, if the classes who strike were able to make themselves heard in Parliament.' Project Gutenberg. Later in the book, he argues that an important function of truly representative government is to provide a relatively equal balance of power between workmen and masters, in order to prevent threats to the good of the whole of society.Mill. Representative Government, Chapter 6. 'In a state of society thus composed, if the representative system could be made ideally perfect, and if it were possible to maintain it in that state, its organization must be such that these two classes, manual laborers and their affinities on one side, employers of labor and their affinities on the other, should be, in the arrangement of the representative system, equally balanced, each influencing about an equal number of votes in Parliament; since, assuming that the majority of each class, in any difference between them, would be mainly governed by their class interests, there would be a minority of each in whom that consideration would be subordinate to reason, justice, and the good of the whole; and this minority of either, joining with the whole of the other, would turn the scale against any demands of their own majority which were not such as ought to prevail.' During Mill's discussion of the merits of progressive taxation in his essay Utilitarianism, he notes as an aside the power of the rich as independent of state support: > People feel obliged to argue that the State does more for the rich than for > the poor, as a justification for its taking more [in taxation] from them: > though this is in reality not true, for the rich would be far better able to > protect themselves, in the absence of law or government, than the poor, and > indeed would probably be successful in converting the poor into their > slaves.Mill. Utilitarianism, Chapter 5. Project Gutenberg. =Hegel= In his Philosophy of Right, Hegel expressed concern that the standard of living of the poor might drop so far as to make it even easier for the rich to amass even more wealth. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Elements of the Philosophy of Right, Part III, Paragraph 244. 'When a large number of people sink below the standard of living regarded as essential for the members of society, and lose that sense of right, rectitude, and honour which is derived from self-support, a pauper class arises, and wealth accumulates disproportionately in the hands of a few.' Marxists Internet Archive. Hegel believed that, especially in a liberal country such as contemporary England, the poorest will politicise their situation, channelling their frustrations against the rich: > Against nature man can claim no right, but once society is established, > poverty immediately takes the form of a wrong done to one class by > another.Hegel. The Philosophy of Right, Addition 149.  Capitalist societies  The typical example of class conflict described is class conflict within capitalism. This class conflict is seen to occur primarily between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, and takes the form of conflict over hours of work, value of wages, division of profits, cost of consumer goods, the culture at work, control over parliament or bureaucracy, and economic inequality. The particular implementation of government programs which may seem purely humanitarian, such as disaster relief, can actually be a form of class conflict.Greg Palast, Burn baby burn In the U.S., class conflict is often noted in labor/management disputes. As far back as 1933 representative Edward Hamilton of ALPA, the Airline Pilot's Association, used the term \\"class warfare\\" to describe airline management's opposition at the National Labor Board hearings in October of that year. Apart from these day- to-day forms of class conflict, during periods of crisis or revolution class conflict takes on a violent nature and involves repression, assault, restriction of civil liberties, and murderous violence such as assassinations or death squads. In the speech \\"The Great American Class War\\" (2013), the journalist Bill Moyers asserted the existence of social-class conflict between democracy and plutocracy in the U.S.Moyers, Bill (12 December 2013).

Historian Steve Fraser, author of The Age of Acquiescence: The Life and Death of American Resistance to Organized Wealth and Power, asserts that class conflict is an inevitability if current political and economic conditions continue, noting that \\"people are increasingly fed up‚Ä¶ their voices are not being heard.

Regarding the interaction between social classes, he wrote, = Warren Buffett = The investor, billionaire, and philanthropist Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, voiced in 2005 and once more in 2006 his view that his class ‚Äì the \\"rich class\\" ‚Äì is waging class warfare on the rest of society.

In 2011 Buffett called on government legislators to, \\"...stop coddling the super rich.\\" A year later, Peter Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, coined the term 'conscience laundering' to describe how charitable causes can be turned into useful tools of class warfare: > As more lives and communities are destroyed by the system that creates vast > amounts of wealth for the few, the more heroic it sounds to ‚Äúgive back.‚Äù > It‚Äôs what I would call ‚Äúconscience laundering‚Äù ‚Äî feeling better about > accumulating more than any one person could possibly need to live on by > sprinkling a little around as an act of charity. = Max Weber = Max Weber (1864‚Äì1920) agrees with the fundamental ideas of Karl Marx about the economy causing class conflict, but claims that class conflict can also stem from prestige and power. Weber argues that classes come from the different property locations. Different locations can largely affect one's class by their education and the people they associate with. He also states that prestige results in different status groupings. This prestige is based upon the social status of one's parents. Prestige is an attributed value and many times cannot be changed. Weber states that power differences led to the formation of political parties. Weber disagrees with Marx about the formation of classes. While Marx believes that groups are similar due to their economic status, Weber argues that classes are largely formed by social status. Weber does not believe that communities are formed by economic standing, but by similar social prestige. Weber does recognize that there is a relationship between social status, social prestige and classes. = Arab Spring = Numerous factors have culminated in what's known as the Arab Spring. Agenda behind the civil unrest, and the ultimate overthrow of authoritarian governments throughout the Middle-East included issues such as dictatorship or absolute monarchy, human rights violations, government corruption (demonstrated by Wikileaks diplomatic cables), economic decline, unemployment, extreme poverty, and a number of demographic structural factors, such as a large percentage of educated but dissatisfied youth within the population. Also, some, like Slovenian philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek attribute the 2009 Iranian protests as one of the reasons behind the Arab Spring. The catalysts for the revolts in all Northern African and Persian Gulf countries have been the concentration of wealth in the hands of autocrats in power for decades, insufficient transparency of its redistribution, corruption, and especially the refusal of the youth to accept the status quo.The Other Arab Spring April 7, 2012 Thomas L. Friedman New York Times op-ed as they involve threats to food security worldwide and prices that approach levels of the 2007‚Äì2008 world food price crisis. Amnesty International singled out WikiLeaks' release of U.S. diplomatic cables as a catalyst for the revolts.Peter Walker \\"Amnesty International hails WikiLeaks and Guardian as Arab spring 'catalysts' \\", The Guardian, Friday 13 May 2011  Socialism  = Marxist perspectives = Karl Marx, 1875 Karl Marx (1818‚Äì1883) was a German born philosopher who lived the majority of his adult life in London, England. In The Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx argued that a class is formed when its members achieve class consciousness and solidarity.Blackwell Reference Online.. Retrieved November 24, 2008. This largely happens when the members of a class become aware of their exploitation and the conflict with another class. A class will then realize their shared interests and a common identity. According to Marx, a class will then take action against those that are exploiting the lower classes. What Marx points out is that members of each of the two main classes have interests in common. These class or collective interests are in conflict with those of the other class as a whole. This in turn leads to conflict between individual members of different classes. Marxist analysis of society identifies two main social groups: * Labour (the proletariat or workers) includes anyone who earns their livelihood by selling their labor power and being paid a wage or salary for their labor time. They have little choice but to work for capital, since they typically have no independent way to survive. * Capital (the bourgeoisie or capitalists) includes anyone who gets their income not from labor as much as from the surplus value they appropriate from the workers who create wealth. The income of the capitalists, therefore, is based on their exploitation of the workers (proletariat). Not all class struggle is violent or necessarily radical, as with strikes and lockouts. Class antagonism may instead be expressed as low worker morale, minor sabotage and pilferage, and individual workers' abuse of petty authority and hoarding of information. It may also be expressed on a larger scale by support for socialist or populist parties. On the employers' side, the use of union busting legal firms and the lobbying for anti-union laws are forms of class struggle. Not all class struggle is a threat to capitalism, or even to the authority of an individual capitalist. A narrow struggle for higher wages by a small sector of the working-class, what is often called \\"economism\\", hardly threatens the status quo. In fact, by applying the craft-union tactics of excluding other workers from skilled trades, an economistic struggle may even weaken the working class as a whole by dividing it. Class struggle becomes more important in the historical process as it becomes more general, as industries are organized rather than crafts, as workers' class consciousness rises, and as they self-organize away from political parties. Marx referred to this as the progress of the proletariat from being a class \\"in itself\\", a position in the social structure, to being one \\"for itself\\", an active and conscious force that could change the world. Marx largely focuses on the capital industrialist society as the source of social stratification, which ultimately results in class conflict. He states that capitalism creates a division between classes which can largely be seen in manufacturing factories. The proletariat, is separated from the bourgeoisie because production becomes a social enterprise. Contributing to their separation is the technology that is in factories. Technology de-skills and alienates workers as they are no longer viewed as having a specialized skill. Another effect of technology is a homogenous workforce that can be easily replaceable. Marx believed that this class conflict would result in the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and that the private property would be communally owned. The mode of production would remain, but communal ownership would eliminate class conflict. Even after a revolution, the two classes would struggle, but eventually the struggle would recede and the classes dissolve. As class boundaries broke down, the state apparatus would wither away. According to Marx, the main task of any state apparatus is to uphold the power of the ruling class; but without any classes there would be no need for a state. That would lead to the classless, stateless communist society. = Soviet Union and similar societies = A variety of predominantly Trotskyist and anarchist thinkers argue that class conflict existed in Soviet- style societies. Their arguments describe as a class the bureaucratic stratum formed by the ruling political party (known as the nomenklatura in the Soviet Union), sometimes termed a \\"new class\\", that controls and guides the means of production. This ruling class is viewed to be in opposition to the remainder of society, generally considered the proletariat. This type of system is referred by them as state socialism, state capitalism, bureaucratic collectivism or new class societies. (Cliff; √êilas 1957) Marxism was such a predominate ideological power in what became the Soviet Union since a Marxist group known as the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was formed in the country, prior to 1917. This party soon divided into two main factions; the Bolsheviks, who were led by Vladimir Lenin, and the Mensheviks, who were led by Julius Martov. However, many Marxist argue that unlike in capitalism the Soviet elites did not own the means of production, or generated surplus value for their personal wealth like in capitalism as the generated profit from the economy was equally distributed into Soviet society. Even some Trotskyist like Ernest Mandel criticized the concept of a new ruling class as an oxymoron, saying: \\"The hypothesis of the bureaucracy‚Äôs being a new ruling class leads to the conclusion that, for the first time in history, we are confronted with a ‚Äúruling class‚Äù which does not exist as a class before it actually rules.\\" = Non-Marxist perspectives = Other class struggle commentators than Marx include Augustin Thierry,Augustin Thierry: Recueil des monuments in√©dits de l'histoire du Tiers √©tat Fran√ßois Guizot, Fran√ßois-Auguste Mignet and Adolphe Thiers. The Physiocrats, David Ricardo, and after Marx, Henry George noted the inelastic supply of land and argued that this created certain privileges (economic rent) for landowners. According to the historian Arnold Toynbee, stratification along lines of class appears only within civilizations, and furthermore only appears during the process of a civilization's decline while not characterizing the growth phase of a civilization. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, in What is Property? (1840) states that \\"certain classes do not relish investigation into the pretended titles to property, and its fabulous and perhaps scandalous history.\\"Pierre Proudhon, What is Property?, chapter 2, remark 2. While Proudhon saw the solution as the lower classes forming an alternative, solidarity economy centered on cooperatives and self-managed workplaces, which would slowly undermine and replace capitalist class society, the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, while influenced by Proudhon, insisted that a massive class struggle by the working class, peasantry and poor was essential to the creation of libertarian socialism. This would require a (final) showdown in the form of a social revolution. One of the earliest analyses of the development of class as the development of conflicts between emergent classes is available in Peter Kropotkin's Mutual Aid. In this work, Kropotkin analyzes the disposal of goods after death in pre-class or hunter-gatherer societies, and how inheritance produces early class divisions and conflict. Fascists have often opposed 'horizontal' class struggle in favour of 'vertical' national struggle and instead have attempted to appeal to the working class while promising to preserve the existing social classes and have proposed an alternative concept known as class collaboration. = Noam Chomsky = Noam Chomsky, 2004 Noam Chomsky, American linguist, philosopher, and political activist has criticized class war in the United States:  Relation to race  Jobless black workers in the heat of the Philadelphia summer, 1973 Some historical tendencies of Orthodox Marxism reject racism, sexism, etc. as struggles that essentially distract from class struggle, the real conflict. These divisions within the class prevent the purported antagonists from acting in their common class interest. However, many Marxist internationalists and anti-colonial revolutionaries believe sex, race and class to be bound up together. There is an ongoing debate within Marxist scholarship about these topics. According to Michel Foucault, in the 19th century the essentialist notion of the \\"race\\" was incorporated by racists, biologists, and eugenicists, who gave it the modern sense of \\"biological race\\" which was then integrated to \\"state racism\\". On the other hand, Foucault claims that when Marxists developed their concept of \\"class struggle\\", they were partly inspired by the older, non-biological notions of the \\"race\\" and the \\"race struggle\\". Quoting a non-existent 1882 letter from Marx to Friedrich Engels during a lecture, Foucault erroneously claimed Marx wrote: \\"You know very well where we found our idea of class struggle; we found it in the work of the French historians who talked about the race struggle.\\"Quoted in Society Must be Defended by Michel Foucault (trans. David Macey), London: Allen Lane, Penguin Press (1976, 2003), p. 79 For Foucault, the theme of social war provides the overriding principle that connects class and race struggle.Ann Laura Stoler, Race and the Education of Desire: Foucault's \\"History of Sexuality\\" and the Colonial Order of Things , Duke University Press (1995), p.71-72 Moses Hess, an important theoretician and labor Zionist of the early socialist movement, in his \\"Epilogue\\" to \\"Rome and Jerusalem\\" argued that \\"the race struggle is primary, the class struggle secondary... With the cessation of race antagonism, the class struggle will also come to a standstill. The equalization of all classes of society will necessarily follow the emancipation of all the races, for it will ultimately become a scientific question of social economics.\\"quoted in Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews by Jonathan Frankel, Cambridge University Press (1981), p. 22. W. E. B. Du Bois theorized that the intersectional paradigms of race, class, and nation might explain certain aspects of black political economy. Patricia Hill Collins writes: \\"Du Bois saw race, class, and nation not primarily as personal identity categories but as social hierarchies that shaped African-American access to status, poverty, and power.\\" In modern times, emerging schools of thought in the U.S. and other countries hold the opposite to be true. They argue that the race struggle is less important, because the primary struggle is that of class since labor of all races face the same problems and injustices.

His predictions about a great northern monarch proved acceptable in England and Scotland. Grebner's prophecies were modelled on Paracelsus. Life Grebner was born at Schneeberg, Saxony, probably between 1530 and 1550. In 1573, he was teaching at the Michaelisschule in L√ºneburg; and on 23 June, by his own account, the political future of Europe was revealed to him in a vision. From then on, Grebner concentrated on prophecy and took up residence in Magdeburg. He intended the first copy of his work for Eric II, Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. On the way to see Augustus, Elector of Saxony, he was not far from Dresden when it came to him that he ought to write about the new star SN 1572. In 1582, Grebner was in England and presented Elizabeth I with a manuscript copy of his major work, Sericum Mundi filum. It went to the library of Trinity College, Cambridge, where it remains. There is some evidence that the French diplomat Jacques de S√©gur-Pardaillan knew the prophecies a few years later. Grebner probably died in Hamburg. Works *Canticum canticorum Solomon, et Threni Hieremiae Prophetae elegiaco carmine Redditi. Accessit Oda de coniunctione fidelium cum Jesus Christ, Antwerp 1563. Its author is given as \\"Paul Grebnerus Junior Mysnensis Niuimontanus\\", who dedicated the work to Augustus, Elector of Saxony. *Sericum Mundi filum, expanded version of a work offered to the Duke of Brunswick in 1574. Influence The writings of Grebner were a major source for the \\"leonine prophecies\\", involving an anti-papal \\"Lion of the North\\". They were applied to Gustavus Adolphus, and, in other contexts, to the Scottish lion and the House of Stuart. =In Germany= Grebner's prophecy was not generally known to German speakers until 1619, with the printing of his Conjecturen, predicting the New Jerusalem in 1624. With its vision of Antichrist destroyed and universal monarchy, it was printed in the second edition (1625) of the Confessio Fraternitatis, a basic Rosicrucian document. A pamphlet Prognosticon (1631) is an explanation of the Great Comet of 1618, attributed to Paul Gr√§bner of Magdeburg. It was taken from a manuscript of the Sericum Mundi filum, with 1620 substituted for the year 1573 of the original.:de:s:ADB:Grebner, Paul =In England= Much notice was taken of \\"Grebner's prophecy\\" in English publications of the middle decades of the 17th century. Joseph Mede was able to consult the manuscript in Cambridge. In 1649, George Wither wrote about it, using the pseudonym \\"Palaemon\\", in Vaticinium Votivum, with royalist elegies. Illustration from Monarchy or no Monarchy in England. Grebner his Prophecy concerning Charles Son of Charles... English, Latin, Saxon, Scottish and Welch Prophecies concerning England in particular, and all Europe in general (1651), by William Lilly In the Interregnum, the Grebner prophecy was much contested, particularly by William Lilly, and was adopted by Fifth Monarchists. A brief description of the future history of Europe (1650) claimed to be based on the manuscript. It made specific predictions, such as the ruin of \\"Rome\\" around 1666, and that the Fifth Monarchy would be founded in America. Lilly's 1651 Monarchy or No Monarchy was mainly designed to undermine the royalist interpretation. It collected up interpretations: for example, one against the Presbyterian view, and also traditional Scottish prophecy, in Thomas of Ercildoune and the \\"prophecy of Waldhave\\" (published in 1613 by Andro Hart). The tenor of Lilly's work was that Charles I was the last King of England. The anonymous Visions and Prophecies concerning England, Scotland, and Ireland, of Ezekiel Grebner (1660) was a parody by Abraham Cowley, turning the prophecy and the praise of Andrew Marvell against Oliver Cromwell. James Howell cites Grebner in the Introduction to his Lexicon Tetraglotton (1660).MacLean, Gerald, editor. The Return of the King : An Anthology of English Poems Commemorating the Restoration of Charles II, Grebner's prophecy from Lexicon Tetraglotton.

The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. The bill was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. Background Minimum wage by U.S. state and U.S. territory (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands), as of January 1, 2014. In the United States workers generally must be paid no less than the statutory minimum wage. As of July 2009, the federal government mandates a nationwide minimum wage level of $7.25 per hour, while some states and municipalities have set minimum wage levels higher than the federal level, with the highest state minimum wage being $9.47 per hour in Washington as of January 1, 2015. Among those paid by the hour in 2013, 1.5 million were reported as earning exactly the prevailing federal minimum wage. About 1.8 million were reported as earning wages below the minimum. Together, these 3.3 million workers with wages at or below the minimum represent, respectively: 1.0% of the population, 1.6% of the labor force, 2.5% of all workers, and 4.3% of hourly workers. Many states already have a state minimum wage higher than the existing federal minimum wage. The major economic schools of thought - Classical economics, Keynesian economics, and the Austrian School - disagree about the importance and the effects of the minimum wage. According to a paper written in 2000 by Fuller and Geide-Stevenson, 73.5% (27.9% of which agreed with provisos) of American economists agreed that a minimum wage increases unemployment among unskilled and young workers, while 26.5% disagreed with this statement.Fuller, Dan and Doris Geide-Stevenson (2003): Consensus Among Economists: Revisited, in: Journal of Economic Review, Vol. 34, No. 4, Seite 369-387 (PDF) Some economic research has shown that restaurant prices rise in response to minimum wage increases.Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, The Minimum Wage, Restaurant Prices, and Labor Market Structure, August 2007 Overall, there is no consensus between economists about the effects of minimum wages on youth employment, although empirical evidence suggests that this group is most vulnerable to high minimum wages.Ghellab, Youcef (1998): Minimum Wages and Youth Unemployment, ILO Employment and Training Papers 26 (PDF) However, new evidence for workers that were bound by the minimum wage suggests a distinct negative impact on employment and income growth. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Minimum Wage Fairness Act would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to: (1) $8.20 an hour beginning on the first day of the sixth month after the enactment of this Act, (2) $9.15 an hour beginning one year after the date of such initial increase, (3) $10.10 an hour beginning two years after such date, and (4) the amount determined by the United States Secretary of Labor (based on increases in the Consumer Price Index) beginning three years after such date and annually thereafter. The bill would increase the federal minimum wage for tipped employees to $3.00 an hour for one year beginning on the first day of the sixth month after the enactment of this Act. The bill would provide a formula for subsequent annual adjustments of the minimum wage for tipped employees until it equals 70% of the wage in effect under FLSA for other employees. The bill would direct the Secretary of Labor, 60 days before any increase in the minimum wage, to publish it in the Federal Register and on the United States Department of Labor's website. The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend through taxable years beginning before 2017: (1) the increase to $500,000 of the expensing allowance for business assets, including computer software; and (2) the treatment of qualified real property (i.e., leasehold improvement property, restaurant property, and retail improvement property) as depreciable business property. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as introduced in the Senate on November 19, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 1737 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage in three steps from $7.25 per hour to $10.10 per hour, and to adjust the wage annually thereafter to account for inflation. In addition, the bill would increase the federal minimum cash wage for workers who receive tips by gradually raising that wage until it equals 70 percent of the federal minimum wage for other workers. Finally, S. 1737 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend through 2016 an increased limitation on the amount of investment that firms can immediately deduct from their taxable income‚Äîa limitation that mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses. Procedural history The Minimum Wage Fairness Act was introduced into the United States Senate on November 19, 2013 by Sen. Tom Harkin (D, IA). On April 8, 2014, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced that the Senate would not vote on the bill until three weeks later after a two-week April recess. Debate and discussion The delay of the Senate vote on the bill was attributed to Reid's inability to get all members of the Democratic party in the Senate to agree to vote in favor of the bill. Senator Mark Pryor (D-AR) opposed the bill. Pryor is up for election in 2014 and is considered \\"the Senate's most vulnerable incumbent.\\" Senator Tom Carper (D-DE) preferred legislation that would have a greater chance of becoming law, such as an increase to only $9 an hour. Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) expressed a willingness to negotiate with Republicans about some of the provisions of the bill, such as the timeline for the phase-in. Warner said that any increase needs to be done \\"in a responsible way.\\" Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA) wanted additional debate on the timeline and the raise for tipped workers. Landrieu said that \\"I do not believe that $10.10 an hour is too high to aspire to, but how quickly we get there and what increments, the tipped wage, how that should be handled, who should get paid the tipped wage, and who shouldn't. There are a lot of questions about that, and some of those discussions are going on.\\" President Barack Obama strongly supported increasing the minimum wage, giving speeches about it urging Congress to take action. Obama argued that \\"if you pay people well, there's more money in everybody's pockets, and everybody does better.\\" The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a report that an \\"estimate half a million jobs would be lost if lawmakers passed the president's proposal\\" to increase the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Spokesman Brendan Buck for Speaker of the House John Boehner said in reaction that \\"the president's plan would increase costs for consumers and eliminate jobs for those who need them the most\\" so the House would \\"continue focusing on our plan to protect workers' hours and create jobs, not the president's plan to destroy them.\\" The National Retail Federation (NRF) opposed the bill, saying that \\"raising the standard of living for low-skill, low-wage workers is a valid goal,\\" but that \\"there is clear evidence that mandate wage hikes undermine the job prospects for less skilled and part-time workers.\\" The trade group also argued that this was the \\"least opportune moment\\" to increase the minimum wage because employers were still dealing the fallout of changes they needed to make because of the Affordable Care Act (\\"Obamacare\\"). Senate Republican Susan Collins (R-ME) tried to negotiate a compromise that centrist Republicans could agree to, but was unable to do so. Several Republicans, such as Senators Dean Heller (R-NV) and Rob Portman (R-OH), noted that their states already have minimum wages higher than the federally-mandated level and thought that the minimum wage should be left up to the states. Heller said \\"I think there is a difference between North and South, East and West on what those minimum wages ought to be.\\" Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL) said he would not vote for the bill or a compromise. Collins' tried to argue that the Congressional Budget Office report predicting 500,000 jobs lost if the minimum wage was increased to $10.10 also said that an increase to $9.00 would only lead to 100,000 jobs lost, but the argument did not seem to persuade her fellow centrists. Collins said \\"I'm confident that the votes are not there to pass a minimum wage increase up to $10.10 therefore it seems to me to make sense for senators on both sides of the aisle to get together and see if we can come up with a package that would help low-income families with causing the kind of job loss that the Congressional Budget Office has warned against.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Minimum wage in the United States References External links *Library of Congress - Thomas S. 1737 *beta.congress.gov S. 1737 *GovTrack.us S. 1737 *OpenCongress.org S. 1737 *WashingtonWatch.com S. 1737 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Minimum wage ","title":"Minimum Wage Fairness Act"},{"id":"42437271","text":"St. Andrew Memorial Church is a Ukrainian Orthodox cathedral on Main Street, in South Bound Brook, New Jersey, United States.

The idea for a memorial church is credited to Archbishop Mstyslav (Skrypnyk), later Metropolitan, who had lamented in 1942 how many churches and cemeteries, and thus Ukraine's cultural and political leaders, had been destroyed under the Soviets. In 1950, work on his vision began with the acquisition of land in Somerset County. He engaged Ukrainian- Canadian architect George Kodak, who took inspiration from St Andrew's Church, Kiev. Groundbreaking ceremonies took place on July 21, 1955. The cemetery received its first burial in 1964, the Ukrainian sculptor Serhiy Lytvynenko, and the church was dedicated on October 10, 1965. The structure is a notable example of Ukrainian Baroque Cossack architecture. Later contributions to the interior ornamentation include mosaics and icons by Petro Cholodny and woodcarving by Andreas Darahan.

Until its closure in 2011 it was the oldest feldbahn in use in Austria. History For the supply of clothes, food and fuel to the nursing home Lainz, the Vienna City Administration decided to construct a manually operated narrow gauge railway. The Lehmann & Leyer company constructed a 4 km network with a track gauge of , with a base made of steel sleepers and flat bottom rails. The work was completed in three months. At the crossing points of the tracks as well as the branches to the pavilions 61 cast-iron turntables were constructed. In 1925, the construction company Langfelder & Sohn was commissioned to replace all turntables by switches and to lay grooved rails at the intersections with the local tramway. Furthermore, four battery locomotives were bought from AEG, which were still operational in modified form until 2011. The railway was also equipped with new flat waggons with a handbrake on one side. In 1966 a new diesel Locomotive type JW 15 was acquired from the Jenbacher Werke. It was used for snow removal, work trains and functioned as a back-up replacement for the battery locomotives. At the end of the operations in 2011, the train was only used for food transport, which took place two or three times a day. Operation of the train ceased on 27 November 2011. Since the tracks are partially listed as industrial heritage they were preserved, but the engine sheds were demolished.

It lies in the extreme northwest of the Burren, on the south of the mouth of Galway Bay. It is known for the well-preserved L-plan Gleninagh Castle, a 16th- century tower house. The parish also contains the lighthouse on Black Head. Name Gleann Eidhneach means the valley of ivy. However, it is possible that the correct Irish name is actually Cluain Eidhneach or \\"ivied retreat\\". The name predates the castle (see below). Parishes were often named after the principal church and this may be the case here. Location The parish is in the northwest corner of the Barony of Burren. It is north of Ennistymon. The parish is and covers . It contains the bold cape of Black Head with its lighthouse, at the south side of the entrance to Galway bay. The land is broken and mountainous. Antiquities =Castle= Gleninagh Castle The 16th-century Gleninagh Castle, an L-shaped tower house, stands on a hillside looking out over Galway Bay. It was an O'Loghlen (or O'Loughlin) stronghold from the early 16th century. Although it changed hands many times over the next centuries it was eventually regained by the family who used it until c. 1840. In 1839, it was described as \\"in good repair\\". A visitor in 1843 said the castle was being used as a barn by Mr. Blood, its proprietor. The upper part of the building was used as a dove-cot and abounded in pigeons. The tower measures by . In 1839 it was thatched with straw. There are four stories. The single square turret contains a spiral stairway. The entrance doorway on the first floor of the turret is protected by a machicolation high above. There are round bartizans in three of the main tower's corners. A number of window openings in the end wall were later closed (likely in the late 16th or early 17th century) so they could be used for fireplaces. =Church= The medieval church is of indeterminate age, but was in existence by 1302 (according to tax lists). There are some indications that the site may have been an earlier monastic settlement, such as a curved field wall shown on the 1842 OS map which could have been a remainder of a typical monastic enclosure wall. Domestic waste was discovered near the church and there are other signs of habitation such as outbuildings. Absent excavation, however, the age of the ecclesiastical site remains uncertain. The church was described in 1839 as being mantled in thick ivy. The floor measured . The walls were thick and about high. The south wall had a pointed doorway of cut stone that was high, measured to the vertex of the arch, and wide. The south wall had two windows, one quadrangular and the other round-topped, both fairly recent. There was a window in the east gable about high and wide. In the outside the window opening was . As of 1897, the church was in a good state of preservation. Today, though in poor repair, it is accessible to the public by a footpath from the road. The church is small for a parish church, which probably reflects the small population and poverty of the area which may well have been the poorest parish of the diocese of Kilfenora. =Gleninagh Lodge= The partially overgrown remains of this structure lie at the end of the lane connecting the road to the tower house. Mid-19th century maps show a substantial assembly of large buildings. The estate included a large formal garden south of the holy well. At the time, most of the land in this area was owned by the lodge's proprietor, William Bindon Blood, a descendant of Colonel Thomas Blood, who tried to steal the English Crown Jewels in 1671. =Others= Tobar na Croiche Naoimhe (Well of the Holy Cross) Near the castle is a holy well dedicated to the Holy Cross, which has many recorded names (Tobar na Croiche Naoimh, Croghneva, Tobar na Croise Naomhtha, Tobernacrobaneede etc.). The well has a little stone vault over it, with a Gothic-type arch and a cross on top. It was thought that performing stations at the well would help with problems with the eyes. In the early 1840s the votive offerings were reported to include human skulls. At least until that period the well was a destination for pilgrims. Another well called Tobar Cornain (or Tobercornan) is in the townland of Gleninagh North. This is today covered by a Gothic Revival well house (c. 1860) and lies right next to the road. There is a large heap of stones called Dough Branneen (\\"the heap of little Bran\\") in the townland of Aughaglinny. There is a stone ringfort called Caher doon Fergus in the townland of Murroogh with caves underneath it, said to be haunted. East of the castle is a lime kiln, previously thought to be a Fulacht Fiadh. History In 1544 King Henry VIII of England granted Gleninagh to Richard Harding. The castle was owned by James Lynch of Galway in 1570. The lands of Gleninagh were owned by the see of Kilfenora in 1629. In 1837 a parish was in the Catholic union or district of Glyn, or Glenarraha. The population in 1841 was 886 in 146 houses. In 1845 the main settlements were the villages of Glaninagh, Murroghkelly and Murroghwohy. Townlands Townlands are Aghaglinny North, Aghaglinny South, Gleninagh North, Gleninagh South, Murrooghkilly, Murrooghtoohy North and Murrooghtoohy South.

When possible, the Balagan Film Series screens works on 16mm or 35mm film and has the artist(s) present for post-screening discussion. Each program in the series is a curated, themed evening.  History  The Balagan Film Series was founded by two filmmakers, Jeff Daniel Silva and Alla Kovgan in 2000. The idea came out of the filmmakers' difficulties in finding screening venues for their own experimental works. Inspired by Amos Vogel's famed Cinema 16 Film Society and the film programming work of Jonas Mekas in New York City, Silva and Kovgan began setting up their own microcinema events of alternative film in Boston. New England's \\"strong and extremely diverse community of experimental filmmakers\\" needed a screening venue. In 2011, filmmakers Mariya Nikiforova and Stefan Grabowski joined Balagan as co-programmers and organizers and continue to run the series with Jeff Silva. Coinciding with Nikiforova and Grabowski's addition to the team, Balagan relaunched the series in December 2011 at Brattle Theater and a Kickstarter campaign to raise money for programming and events. The campaign was successfully funded in January 2012.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/911939745/balagan-film-series  Balagan Today  Today, The Balagan Film Series continues to put on year-round bi-monthly programming at The Brattle Theater and occasionally outdoor screenings at other venues around Boston, Massachusetts.

The term was first used in a 2011 study published in Nutrients by Professor Jennie Brand-Miller, in which she and co-author Dr Alan Barclay reported that, in Australia, \\"a substantial decline in refined sugars intake occurred over the same timeframe that obesity has increased.\\" The \\"paradox\\" in its name refers to the fact that sugar consumption is often considered (for example by Robert Lustig) to be a significant contributor to rising obesity rates, and because ecological studies in the United States have found a positive relationship over certain time periods between sugar consumption and obesity prevalence, although added sugars consumption is now also declining in the United States. Reaction Some people have criticized Brand-Miller's 2011 study, such as economist Rory Robertson, who argued that \\"[Brand-Miller's study's] regular claim - \\"In Australia sugar consumption has dropped 23 per cent since 1980\\" - is woefully misleading, based as it is on a series that was abandoned by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) as unreliable a decade ago.\\" Robertson has also argued that while the paper claims that consumption of sugary soft drinks in Australia declined by 10% between 1994 and 2006, it actually increased by 30%. He cites these and other data to support calling the research \\"a menace to public health\\". In February 2014, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) aired a program criticizing the 2011 study proposing the existence of the paradox, based in part on Robertson's research. The CEO of the Australian Beverages Council, Geoff Parker, has responded that his industry cites other studies besides Brand-Miller's 2011 study to support their view that sugar is not uniquely linked to obesity. In response to Robertson's allegations, Sydney University, Brand-Miller's employer, launched an investigation to determine if she is guilty of research misconduct. A spokesperson for the university said there were \\"...no substantiated claims against the work of any academic at the university, nor indeed has there been any finding that the complaints warrant any further investigation\\". In July 2014, Brand-Miller and Barclay were cleared of misconduct by a six-month investigation conducted by Robert Clark of the University of New South Wales. Following an investigation prompted by the Australian economist, two minor arithmetical errors were identified in the original manuscript of The Australian Paradox which were promptly corrected. This was the only allegation out of 8 others that was substantiated. Another study on the same topic was published in 2013 by researchers (Rikkers et al.) from the University of Western Australia. The study concluded that \\"The Australian Paradox assertion is based on incomplete data, as it excludes sugar contained in imported processed foods, which have increased markedly.\\" The study argued that the claim that sugar consumption had been declining in Australia relied only on production data, and that Australia gets back much of the raw sugar it exports in the form of processed foods. Tom McNeill argued that Rikkers et al.'s paper was significantly flawed, writing: \\"Rikkers et al.'s biggest source of error is the inclusion of incorrect products in the category of \\"moderate to high sugar content\\", in violation of their study inclusion criteria. Fruit juices and fruit drinks have been added to the analysis by the authors without consideration of their actual sugar content, or the very definition of these products which must be adhered to by food manufacturers under the control of Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ)\\". A narrative review of eye disease published the following year argued that the claim of the existence of an Australian paradox \\"is flawed as it assumes declining sugar intake, without taking into account imported foods containing sugar\\", quoting Rikkers et al.'s analysis as evidence. Brand-Miller and Barclay have responded that Rikkers et al. are wrong and that, in fact, the sugar consumption data they used (compiled by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Australian beverage industry) \\"all incorporated data on imported products\\". Recent research by Levy and Shrapnel (\\"Quenching Australia's thirst: A trend analysis of water-based beverage sales from 1997 to 2011\\") has concluded that added sugar from soft drinks has continued to decline. Brand-Miller's stated that per capita sales of sugar- sweetened beverages had decreased by 10%, in an interview with ABC Radio in 2014, \\"it might be that a key word came out. It's possible that this should be, 'While nutritively sweetened beverages ... 10 per cent sweetened beverages decreased by 10 per cent.' So I'll double-check it.\\" Barclay, the 2011 study's other author, also said, in an email to the program, that \\"the 10 per cent decline could not possibly refer to per capita sales of nutritively sweetened soft drinks\\". As mentioned previously, Brand-Miller and Barclay published a correction to their original 2011 study addressing this. According to Esther Han, this correction invalidates the study's claim that soft drink consumption decreased from 1994 to 2006. Complaints about the scientific journal Nutrients over its publication of The Australian Paradox paper led to the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA) investigating Nutrients publisher, MDPI. In 2014, OASPA's investigation concluded that MDPI continued to meet its membership criteria. In April 2017, an update of all available Australian added sugars consumption data titled \\"Declining consumption of added sugars and sugar-sweetened beverages in Australia: a challenge for obesity prevention\\" was published in the American Journal Of Clinical Nutrition. The analysis concluded \\"In Australia, 4 independent data sets confirmed shorter- and longer-term declines in the availability and intake of added sugars, including those contributed by SSBs (Sugar Sweetened Beverages).\\" Independent analyses by Australian researchers including Ridoutt and colleagues at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and Lei and colleagues also concluded that Australians consumed less added sugars in the years 2011-12 than they did in 1995. In December 2017, the Australian Bureau of Statistics published a comparison of free sugars consumption using Australia's 1995 National Nutrition Survey and 2011/2 Australian Health Survey titled \\"CONSUMPTION OF ADDED SUGARS - A COMPARISON OF 1995 TO 2011-12\\". Its main conclusion was \\"Between 1995 and 2011-12, Australians had a relative decrease in their consumption of free sugars, with the average proportion of dietary energy from free sugars declining from 12.5% to 10.9%.\\" See also *French paradox References Category:Sugar Category:Obesity Category:Obesity in Australia Category:Medical controversies in Australia Category:Health paradoxes ","title":"Australian paradox"},{"id":"42437522","text":"Swan Canyon is a neighborhood in the City Heights community of San Diego, California.

He first appeared in the fourteenth series episode \\"Wolf's Clothing\\", broadcast on 15 May 2012. Jonny is a clinical nurse manager and Holby City Hospital's transplant coordinator. He was introduced along with two other regular cast members by the show's then executive producer Johnathan Young, who wanted more \\"truthful and complicated\\" characters in the series. Thomson attended two auditions, before he learned that he had won the part of Jonny. To help him prepare for the role, Thomson went on a tour of a real-life hospital with a heart surgeon. Thomson confirmed his departure from the show in April 2015 and Jonny made his screen exit on 14 April. He returned for a guest appearance on 23 June. Jonny is portrayed as being funny and \\"a bit of a lad\\". He also has a confident and charming persona. Thomson liked playing Jonny because he was a good guy, who was flawed. He also praised the writers for way his character was written, while Katy Moon from Inside Soap was convinced that Jonny would become popular with viewers. Jonny's storylines have often developed through his close friendship with Mo Effanga (Chizzy Akudolu) and his on-off relationship with Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel). Jonny later became a father when Jac gave birth to their daughter Emma, he was engaged to fellow nurse Bonnie Wallis (Carlyss Peer) until her death on their wedding day and was sent to prison after being accused of causing a patient's death. Jonny later reunited with Jac and they left Holby together. Development =Creation and casting= On 29 March 2012, it was announced that three new regular characters would make their debuts during Holby City's fourteenth series in May 2012. Actor Michael Thomson joined the cast as Jonny Maconie, alongside Catherine Russell as Serena Campbell and Chizzy Akudolu as Jonny's best friend Mo Effanga. Jonny was introduced to the show as a nurse and transplant coordinator. Of the new characters, the show's then executive producer, Johnathan Young, commented \\"These are three very talented actors and I am delighted to welcome them to the cast. There are some dramatic and exciting storylines coming up on Holby City over the next few months and I know our new additions will have an immediate impact.\\" Consultant series producer Justin Young later stated that he had wanted to introduce more \\"truthful and complicated\\" characters to the series like Jonny and Mo. Thomson told David Collins from TV Choice that his first audition was \\"troublingly easy\\", and following a second audition, his agent called to tell him he had won the part. Thomson was surprised and initially in disbelief that he had been successful. To prepare for the role, Thomson went on a tour of a hospital with a heart surgeon. He commented, \\"I went to meetings about the best course of treatment for someone who needed a new organ. It was fascinating. There's also a massive amount of politics, which is why a show like Holby City is endlessly fascinating because there are so many layers. There's such a fluctuation of power.\\" Holby City was Thomson's first television role. The actor expected to get fired within the first six months because he initially struggled to hit his marks and get his lines right. He thought the producers had made a mistake in casting him. =Characterisation= Thomson described Jonny as \\"a bit of a lad\\", \\"funny\\", \\"naughty\\" and confident. He also said Jonny was good at his job and cared about his patients. While Thomson was not aware whether Jonny had \\"left a trail of broken hearts\\", he did say that Jonny understood women because he had sisters and his best friend was a woman. Thomson stated that he did not think he and Jonny shared many similarities. He later told Lorraine Kelly that he loved playing Jonny because even though he was a good guy, he was also flawed and could be \\"an idiot\\" at times. The actor was pleased at how the writers had written his character and wished Jonny was real. Kelly believed Jonny would be a good friend, but often wondered what was going on in his mind in regards to some of decisions. Katy Moon from Inside Soap observed that Jonny was \\"charming, mischievous and roguish\\". She also thought that Jonny lived up to Young's promise to introduce \\"a charismatic male nurse\\" and was convinced that Jonny would become popular with viewers. =Friendship with Mo Effanga= Jonny was recruited to work at Holby along with his best friend, Mo Effanga (Akudolu). Shortly after their arrival, Mo and Jonny perform a \\"domino operation\\", which involves transferring a donor's heart and lungs to two different recipients. Akudolu said she and Thomson clicked straight away when they met and they worked on getting their character's relationship right. Thomson revealed that he and Akudolu were close and said there was almost a family quality to their working relationship. He admitted that on occasion they did irritate each other, so were either fighting or hugging, which also helped with developing their characters' relationship. When Jonny began a relationship with Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel), he started lying to Mo and she felt pushed out. Mo was upset when Jonny continued to lie about missing their annual barbecue because he was visiting a relative ‚Äì when he was actually with Jac. The pair were reunited when they saved the life of a patient who was a Jehovah's Witness, and refused to have a transfusion because the Bible forbids the use of blood. An Inside Soap columnist observed that it would not be long before the \\"feuding friends\\" shared another spat, especially with Jac around. Akudolu believed Jac was jealous of Mo and Jonny's close relationship and that she wanted to share it. A couple of months later, Jonny and Mo had another falling out and a patient's life was placed in danger as a result. There was already tension between them following Jonny's break-up with Jac, but they had another fight when Jonny discovered Mo was having an affair with a married man. Thomson explained that while Jonny loved Mo, he could see that the affair would not end well and had seen his friend \\"bounce from one disaster to another\\". Jonny and Mo's personal issues impacted on their professional lives when Jonny disobeyed Mo's orders regarding a transplant patient. Jonny allowed the patient to leave her bed to go to the chapel and she then collapsed. Elliot Hope (Paul Bradley) threatened to remove Jonny and Mo from the transplant team, after realising there was trouble between them. =Relationship with Jac Naylor and fatherhood= While he was attending a people skills course, Jonny met Holby's Jac Naylor and lied that he was a neurosurgeon. They had a one-night stand and Jac had no idea Jonny was really a nurse and about to start working at Holby. When Jonny was introduced to Jac as part of the new transplant team, Thomson called Jac's reaction \\"hilarious\\". He continued \\"it's incredibly awkward for Jac ‚Äì not for Jonny because he doesn't care. In fact I think he says to her 'Have we met?' so that drives Jac completely crazy and creates all kinds of tension!\\" Thomson said Jonny was the \\"Kryptonite to Jac's super ice maiden\\" and believed his character was not intimidated by her at all. Thomson also said that he had never moved as quickly as Jonny did and called Jonny and Jac's relationship \\"fiery\\". The actor later stated that he wanted to make Jac and Jonny's relationship interesting to watch and was pleased that the couple had become popular with viewers. Thomson noted that Jac had messed with Jonny's head, while all he wanted to do was fix her. He also joked that his mother did not approve of Jac and wanted Jonny to be with Mo. Jonny was surprised when Jac declared her love for him and Thomson called it \\"an enormous moment\\" for the couple. Speaking to a What's on TV reporter, Thomson said \\"Up til now, Jac's had him jumping through hoops, but by her saying those words and making that commitment, it blows Jonny's mind and takes their relationship in a new direction.\\" While treating a patient, Jac suffered a sharp pain in her side and Jonny assumed that it was something to do with her kidney, which she had removed. Jac assured him it was nothing, but secretly had urine tests done. Thomson thought it was not unusual for Jac to hide something from Jonny, because she had built up many defences over the years when she felt scared. Jac later learned that she had endometriosis, which could prevent her from having children. Thomson believed that Jac was afraid to tell Jonny as she knew he wanted a big family, and he might have second thoughts about their relationship. Jac later became pregnant with Jonny's baby, but the couple broke up and Jonny began dating fellow nurse Bonnie Wallis (Carlyss Peer). Jac also considered having an abortion after learning the baby had a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, leaving it with just a 50% chance of survival. Jac went into labour a week early and Thomson told Inside Soap's Katy Moon that Jonny felt that if the baby was ready to come out, Jac would just have to face that. Thomson did some research before filming the birth scenes, in particular he viewed One Born Every Minute. He also said Jonny was dealing with a lot of uncertainty, as the baby's condition led to \\"an unpredictable set of circumstances\\" at the happiest time of his life. Jac allowed Jonny to be her birthing partner and Marcel commented that by the time Jac has given birth, she hates Jonny. Thomson added that Jac and Jonny would forever be united by their daughter, but was not sure if they would ever get back together. =Relationship with Bonnie Wallis= Jonny later began dating nurse Bonnie (Peer). Of their relationship, Thomson said \\"Romantically, Bonnie is the textbook answer to Jonny.\\" Peer wanted to believe that Jonny loved Bonnie, but knew that Jac would always have a place in Jonny's life because of Emma. However, Bonnie also knew Jonny did not want to spend the rest of his life with Jac and she was \\"determined\\" not to let him go. Jonny eventually proposed to Bonnie and Peer thought it seemed like the wedding came around quickly, but said that the couple had known each other for a long time. She added that marriage would be good for Bonnie and Jonny, as it would give them security. On the day of the wedding, Jac tried to stop Jonny from getting to the registry office. Thomson said Jonny spent the episode caught in between the past with Jac and his future with Bonnie. When Jonny finally made it to the registry office, he asked Bonnie for some money to pay the taxi driver. Bonnie crossed the road without looking and was hit by a truck. Jonny was \\"left devastated\\" when he realised that there was nothing that could be done to save Bonnie. Of the scene, Thomson quipped \\"Finally, Jonny had someone who could make him happy but then, in true Holby fashion, it's ripped away from him.\\" He added that he was equally devastated at Peer's departure as Jonny was at Bonnie's death. =Departure= In April 2015, it was confirmed that Thomson had left Holby City. Of leaving the show, Thomson stated \\"I've loved every second of my time on Holby but, as an actor, I want to try new roles and don't ever want to get too comfortable. I've really enjoyed playing Jonny and I'll remember him fondly ‚Äì but I don't think even he could handle any more devastation in his life!\\" Jonny left with Jac and their daughter Emma. Thomson explained that Jonny was ready for a new journey, after going through so much with Jac, Bonnie and his imprisonment. Before he leaves, Jonny confronted Guy Self (John Michie), as he blamed him for everything that had happened to him. Thomson later described the exit storyline with Guy as \\"the most high stakes\\" it had ever been for his character. Jonny departed on 7 April 2015, but made a guest appearance on 23 June 2015. In October 2015, it was mentioned that Jonny and Jac had broken up. Producer Simon Harper confirmed the off-screen split was \\"perfectly amiable\\" and that they were co-parenting Emma. Reception Jamie Downham from Yahoo! TV branded Jonny \\"the Scottie hottie\\". He also thought Jonny had the patience of a saint and was always \\"relentlessly upbeat\\". The Western Mail's Rachel Mainwaring observed \\"Jonny and Jac are completely mismatched\\". While a Sunday Mirror reporter thought Jonny was \\"braver than he looks\\" when he messed with Mo, and when he then spent the weekend with Jac, the reporter called him \\"a glutton for punishment\\". A reporter for the Daily Record quipped, \\"After the grief that Jonny gave Jac when she opted to perform surgery instead of attending her own daughter's christening, you'd think Jonny would know better than to be scrubbing up just a few hours before he's supposed to be marrying Bonnie ‚Äì even if the patient is somebody very special.\\" References External links * Jonny Maconie at BBC Online Category:Holby City characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional nurses Category:Fictional Scottish people Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Jonny Maconie"},{"id":"42437700","text":"Sir George Probert (c. 1617 ‚Äì 6 January 1677), of Pant Glas, Raglan, Monmouthshire, was a Welsh politician.

In 16 stanzas of 6 lines, it was first published in 1647 in Johann Cr√ºger's Praxis pietatis melica. The hymn is known as the source for chorales in Bach's Passions. It was translated to English in several versions, for example \\"O, World! behold upon the tree\\" by Catherine Winkworth in 1858.  Text and tune  Gerhardt wrote the hymn for Passiontide in 16 stanzas of 6 lines each to the melody of \\"O Welt, ich mu√ü dich lassen\\", which is taken from the earlier secular \\"Innsbruck, ich muss dich lassen\\" attributed to Heinrich Isaac. The tune requires the poetic form AABCCB. Gerhardt also wrote the evening song \\"Nun ruhen alle W√§lder\\" to the same melody, Zahn No. 2293. Gerhardt based his work on a meditation on the Passion by Martin Moller, part of his 1587 Soliloquia de passione. The theme is a reflection what the suffering of Jesus means for the Christian. Starting with the image of Jesus on the cross, life and death are juxtaposed, \\"Leben\\" (life) at the end of the first line, \\"Tod\\" (death) at the end of the third line. Another contrast is that of \\"Der gro√üe F√ºrst der Ehren\\" (the great duke of honours) and his humiliation: \\"mit Schl√§gen, Hohn und gro√üem Spott\\" (with beatings, scorn and great mockery). The third stanza raises the question of responsibility, \\"Wer hat dich so geschlagen ...?\\" (Who beat you like this ...?), while the fourth stanza answers that it is the one who asks: \\"Ich, ich und meine S√ºnden\\" (I and my sins). The fifth stanza draws the consequence: \\"Ich bin's, ich sollte b√º√üen\\" (It's me, I should atone). The following stanzas develop the resolution to follow the example of loving the enemies (\\"ich die soll lieben, die mich doch sehr betr√ºben\\", 13), forgive (\\"Dem N√§chsten seine Schulden verzeihen\\", 14), deny worldly pleasures (\\"dem absagen, was meinem Fleisch gel√ºst\\", 15) and finally hope for help to eternal rest (\\"begleiten zu der ew'gen Ruh\\", 16). The hymn was first published in 1647 in Johann Cr√ºger's Praxis pietatis melica. It was translated to English in several versions, for example \\"O, World! behold upon the tree\\" by Catherine Winkworth in 1858. A slightly more modern rendering, shortened and paraphrased, is \\"The duteous day now closeth\\" by Robert Bridges, in which version the hymn appears in the English Hymnal and Hymns Ancient and Modern. In the current German hymnal (EG) it is number 84.  Music  Christoph Graupner composed a church cantata for Good Friday (GWV 1127/19) for four voices SATB, strings and basso continuo. Felix Mendelssohn used the hymn to conclude a Passion section in his unfinished oratorio Christus. = Bach Passions = Johann Sebastian Bach used several stanzas of the hymn as reflecting chorales in his St John Passion (1724) and St Matthew Passion (1727). In the earlier work, Bach inserted two stanzas, 3 and 4 in the same harmonization, as movement 11 (in the Neue Bach- Ausgabe), after Jesus asks the one who beat him for justification. Stanza 3 asks, \\"\\" (Who hath thee now so stricken), and stanza 4 answers, \\"\\" (I, I and my transgressions), highlighting the personal responsibility of the speaking sinner for the suffering of Jesus. In the St Matthew Passion, two stanzas appear in different harmonization in different situations of the drama, as movements 10 and 37 (in the NBA). A question is part of Gospel, the disciples, being told that one of them will betray Jesus, ask \\"Herr, bin ich's?\\" (Lord, is it me?). Before the answer from the Gospel, stanza 5 of the hymn picks the wording up in an answer, \\"\\" (I should atone), which asks the listener to identify with that penitent position. Stanza 3, \\"\\", appears here after the beating of Jesus during the court hearing.

The law requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to establish common standards for financial data provided by all government agencies and to expand the amount of data that agencies must provide to the government website, USASpending. The goal of the law is to improve the ability of Americans to track and understand how the government is spending their tax dollars. The law was introduced into the United States Senate during the 113th United States Congress. A similar bill, the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2013 (H.R. 2061; 113th Congress), was introduced at the same time in the United States House of Representatives. There was also a previous version of the bill () that passed in the House during the 112th United States Congress, but did not become law. On May 9, 2014, President Barack Obama signed this version of the bill into law. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) stated its purposes to be to: :*expand the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 by disclosing direct federal agency expenditures and linking federal contract, loan, and grant spending information to federal programs to enable taxpayers and policy makers to track federal spending more effectively; :*establish government-wide data standards for financial data and provide consistent, reliable, searchable, and usable government-wide spending data on USASpending.gov for taxpayers and policy makers; :*simplify reporting for entities receiving federal funds by streamlining reporting requirements and reducing compliance costs while improving transparency; :*improve the quality of data submitted to USASpending.gov by holding federal agencies accountable for the completeness and accuracy of the data submitted; and :*apply approaches developed by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to spending across the federal government. Section 3 of the bill amended the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 to define \\"federal agency,\\" for the bill's purposes, to mean an executive department, a government corporation, or an independent establishment. The bill directed the Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that information on funds made available to or expended by a federal agency would be posted online quarterly and when practical monthly, in a searchable, downloadable format. The bill directed the Secretary and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish government-wide financial data standards for federal funds and entities receiving such funds. Requires such data standards, to the extent reasonable and practicable, to: (1) incorporate widely accepted common data elements and a widely accepted, nonproprietary, searchable, platform- independent, computer-readable format; (2) include government-wide universal identifiers for federal awards and entities; (3) be consistent with and implement applicable accounting principles; (4) be capable of being continually updated; (5) produce consistent and comparable data; and (6) establish a standard method of conveying the reporting period, reporting entity, unit of measure, and other associated attributes. The bill required the Secretary and the Director to issue guidance to federal agencies on such data standards and consult with public and private stakeholders in establishing such standards. The bill required the Director to review the information required to be reported by recipients of federal awards to identify: (1) common reporting elements across the federal government, (2) unnecessary duplication in financial reporting, and (3) unnecessarily burdensome reporting requirements for recipients of federal awards. The bill required the Director to establish a two-year pilot program to develop recommendations for: (1) standardized reporting elements across the federal government, (2) the elimination of unnecessary duplication in financial reporting, and (3) the reduction of compliance costs for recipients of federal awards. Requires such pilot program to include: (1) a combination of federal contracts, grants, and subawards, with an aggregate value of not less than $1 billion and not more than $2 billion; (2) a diverse group of recipients of federal awards; (3) recipients who receive awards from multiple programs across multiple agencies; and (4) data collected during a 12-month reporting cycle. The bill would require the Director, not later than 90 days after the termination of the pilot program, to submit a report to the House Committees on the Budget and Oversight and Government Reform and the Senate Committees on the Budget and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that includes: (1) a description of the data collected under the pilot program, its usefulness, and the cost to collect the data from other recipients; and (2) recommendations. The bill directed the Inspector General of each federal agency to: (1) review a statistically valid sampling of the spending data submitted under this Act by the federal agency; and (2) submit to Congress and make publicly available a report assessing the completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of the data sampled and the implementation and use of data standards by the federal agency. The bill would direct the Comptroller General (GAO) to submit a publicly available report to Congress assessing and comparing the data completeness, timeliness, quality, and accuracy of the data submitted under this Act by federal agencies and the implementation and use of data standards by federal agencies. The bill would authorize the Secretary to establish a data analysis center, or expand an existing service, to provide data, analytic tools, and data management techniques to support: (1) the prevention and reduction of improper payments, and (2) the improvement of efficiency and transparency in federal spending. Transfers assets of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board to the Department of the Treasury upon the establishment of the data analysis center. The bill declared that nothing in this Act: (1) shall require disclosure to the public of information protected from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) or information protected under the Privacy Act of 1974 or the Internal Revenue Code; and (2) shall be construed to create a private right of action. Section 4 would require the OMB Director to make available on the OMB website a financial management status report and government-wide five-year financial management plan. Section 5 would require a federal agency to notify the Secretary of the Treasury of any legally enforceable non-tax debt owed to such agency that is over 120 (currently, 180) days delinquent so that the Secretary can offset such debt administratively. Requires the Secretary to notify Congress of any instance in which an agency fails to notify the Secretary of such a debt. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on November 6, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 994 aims to make information on federal expenditures more easily accessible and transparent. The bill would require the U.S. Department of the Treasury to establish common standards for financial data provided by all government agencies and to expand the amount of data that agencies must provide to the government website, USASpending. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) would be required to conduct a two-year pilot program to make it easier for federal contractors and grant recipients to comply with federal reporting requirements. S. 994 also would require OMB, the Government Accountability Office, and the agencies‚Äô Inspectors General to submit additional reports to the Congress. Finally, the legislation would designate the Treasury Franchise Fund as the source of funding for the bill's implementation. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the bill would cost $300 million over the 2014-2018 period, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. The legislation also could affect direct spending by agencies not funded through annual appropriations; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. The CBO estimates, however, that any net increase in spending by those agencies would not be significant. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues. S. 994 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act; any costs to state, local, or tribal governments would result from complying with conditions for receiving federal assistance. Procedural history The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States Senate on May 21, 2013 by Sen. Mark R. Warner (D, VA). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. It was reported on March 27, 2014 alongside Senate Report 113-139. On April 10, 2014, the Senate voted to pass the bill by unanimous consent. On April 28, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted in a voice vote to pass the bill. On May 9, 2014, President Barack Obama signed the bill into law. Debate and discussion Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), a major supporter of the bill, said that \\"the DATA Act is but a first shot of a technological revolution that will transform the way we govern.\\" Issa also thought that \\"the American people deserve to know if their taxpayer dollars are being wasted or if they are being spent wisely.\\" Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) said that \\"this will improve the quality of data that agencies make available about their spending.\\" The National Taxpayers Union (NTU) urged Representatives to vote in favor of the bill, saying that \\"this legislation would take an important step toward greater accountability to taxpayers by providing more information on how their hard-earned dollars are spent.\\" The NTU argued that \\"the DATA Act would bring increased transparency to a system that is too often rife with favoritism, waste, and fraud. As the federal government continues to make heavy demands on the public's paychecks, taxpayers deserve the opportunity to find out more details about how the money they send to Washington is being spent.\\" The Data Coalition and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants supported the bill. The Data Foundation published two research reports related to the Digital Accountability and Transparency (DATA) Act. \\"The Data Act: Vision & Value\\", co-published by MorganFranklin, describes the law's history and mandates, surveys its benefits, and outlines the challenges it faces. ‚ÄúThe DATA Act: Vision & Value.‚Äù Data Foundation. A second report, published in May 2017, lays out a comprehensive long-term vision for the DATA Act, and discusses how the law is set to evolve beyond its statutory implementation deadline of November 2021. \\"DATA Act 2022: Changing Technology, Changing Culture.\\" Data Foundation.

The Works of M.Y.Lermontov in 4 volumes. Khudozhestvennaya Literatura Publishers. Moscow, 1958. Vol. 2. Pp. 518-519. Background A romantic poem, influenced by Lord Byron's \\"Parisina\\" (from which comes the epigraph to Chapter I), \\"Boyarin Orsha\\" also reflects Lermontov's interest in Russian folklore and history. The poem's action takes place in the time of Ivan Grozny and the Livonian War (1558-1583). The author seems to be ambivalent about the moral choice his hero makes: fighting successfully for personal rights and freedom, Arseny commits treason and finds himself siding with the enemy, fighting his own people. Synopsis Arseny falls in love with his master Boyarin Orsha's daughter and plots to take her away from her father's home. On discovering this, the old man locks the girl into her room and throws the key into Dnieper. The young man faces igumen and monks who interrogate him, but refuses to name his accomplices. On the night before the execution Arseny, helped by his mysterious friends, escapes from his cell. He finds himself in Lithuania, now at war with Russia. After one particularly fierce battle, he finds dying Orsha among the dead men lying on the ground. Having received the permission to come to his house and take the girl with him, Arseny goes there, breaks the lock on the door of the room which nobody has entered for years and finds a heap of bones on the bed where he once made love to Orsha's daughter. Critical reception The poem was praised by Vissarion Belinsky who admired the character of Arseny, a rebel, defying both his master and the church. The critic admitted the poem was far from perfect but considered it \\"more precious than many mature, artfully executed works.\\"The Complete Belinsky. The Academy of Sciences Publishers. 1955.

He works on philosophy of mind and is best known for formulating the explanatory gap argument against a materialist explanation for consciousness.Joseph Levine (1983), \\"Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap,\\" Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, 64(4), October 1983, pp. 354‚Äì361 This has been cited as a precursor to David Chalmers' formulation of the hard problem of consciousness and as one of the main objections materialist theories in philosophy of mind must address. The idea of the explanatory gap is that an unbridgeable gap exists when trying to comprehend consciousness from the perspective of natural science as a scientific explanation of mental states would require a reduction from a physical process to phenomenal experience. The property of mental states to be experienced from a subjective point of view (see Qualia) might not be reducible from the objective, i.e. outside perspective of science. In this sense there would be a gap between the outside perspective of science and the internal perspective of phenomenal experience. Levine does not believe this gap necessitates a metaphysical conclusion; that is, he does not believe his argument refutes materialism. However, he believes it poses a unique epistemic problem: > While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not > suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability > considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the > body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical > properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the > mental in terms of the physical.J.

In the 17th century, a grandly designed burial chapel for the De la Gardie family was added to the church, designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. The chapel was never entirely finished: it reached its current height in 1675 and work was then suspended. A temporary roof was not replaced with a more permanent one until the 1790s. The church is noteworthy for its rich internal decoration. The altarpiece is made in the atelier of Jan Borman and dates from the early 16th century. The triumphal cross is from the 15th century, while the baptismal font is from the 12th century. The church also houses an unusual carved wooden bench, dating from the 16th century.

It was founded and run by Bo≈æidar Ljubaviƒá, also known as Bo≈æidar Gora≈ædanin, who was a prominent merchant from Gora≈æde. His son Teodor Ljubaviƒá, a hieromonk of the Mile≈°eva Monastery, managed the work of the printing house. It worked until 1523, producing three books, which are counted among the better accomplishments of early Serb printers.Baraƒá 2008, pp. 46‚Äì47  Background  After the printing press was invented around 1450 by Johannes Gutenberg in Mainz, Germany, the art of book printing was soon introduced in other parts of Europe. By the end of the 15th century, Venice had become a major centre of printing. In 1493, ƒêuraƒë Crnojeviƒá, the ruler of the Principality of Zeta (in present-day Montenegro), sent Hieromonk Makarije to Venice to buy a press and learn the art of printing. At Cetinje, the capital of Zeta, Makarije printed in 1494 the Cetinje Octoechos, the first incunable written in the Serbian recension of Church Slavonic. The Crnojeviƒá printing house worked until 1496, when Zeta fell to the Ottomans.Baraƒá 2008, pp. 27‚Äì29 In 1518, Bo≈æidar Ljubaviƒá resided at the Mile≈°eva Monastery, the see of a Serbian Orthodox diocese which had been part of the Kingdom of Bosnia since 1373.Fine 1994, pp. 392‚Äì93, 484 Mile≈°eva and other parts of its diocese, including the town of Gora≈æde, were located in the region of Herzegovina, which was gradually conquered by the Ottomans between 1465 and 1481.  Printing  Church of St. George, Sopotnica In the second half of 1518, Bo≈æidar Ljubaviƒá sent his sons, ƒêuraƒë and hieromonk Teodor, to Venice to buy a printing press and to learn the art of printing. The Ljubaviƒá brothers procured a press and began printing a hieratikon (priest's service book), copies of which had been completed by 1 July 1519 either in Venice or at the Church of Saint George near Gora≈æde. After ƒêuraƒë Ljubaviƒá died in Venice on 2 March 1519, it is unclear whether his brother transported the press to Gora≈æde before or after finishing the work on the hieratikon. At the Church of Saint George, Teodor organised the Gora≈æde printing house, which produced, beside the hieratikon, two more books in Church Slavonic of the Serbian recension: a psalter in 1521, and a small euchologion in 1523. The Gora≈æde Psalter, containing 352 leaves, is the biggest of the three books. They were not bound at the printing house, as this job was a responsibility of book vendors. Trade was well developed in Gora≈æde, as the town was built at the junction of three important roads, which connected it with Dubrovnik, Vrhbosna (Sarajevo), and Kosovo.  Aftermath  The next printing house would not appear in Bosnia and Herzegovina until 1866, when Sopron's Printing House began its work. In 1544, the printing press was transported from Gora≈æde to T√¢rgovi»ôte, the capital of Wallachia, thus becoming the second such facility in the territory of present- day Romania. Its relocation and reactivation was accomplished by Dimitrije Ljubaviƒá, Bo≈æidar's grandson.ƒåurƒçiƒá 2008, pp. 335‚Äì36 In T√¢rgovi»ôte, Dimitrije printed a euchologion at the beginning of 1545, and an apostolarium in 1547. Bo≈æidar Vukoviƒá founded his printing house in Venice in 1519 or 1520, contemporaneously with the Ljubaviƒá brothers. It worked, with interruptions, until the end of the 16th century. There were other early Serbian printing works, established in the territory of the Ottoman Empire: at the Rujan Monastery near U≈æice in 1529, at the Graƒçanica Monastery near Pri≈°tina in 1539, at the Mile≈°eva Monastery in 1546, in Belgrade in 1552, again at Mile≈°eva in 1557, at the Mrk≈°ina Crkva Monastery near Valjevo in 1562, and in Skadar in 1563.

Each chapter focuses on helping their community with philanthropic programs ranging from donating classroom supplies, clothing and books to supplying teddy bears to law enforcement in giving to traumatized children, and providing Assault Survival Kits of new clothing at hospitals for rape victims. The Assistance League consists of Chapter Members (who volunteer to staff Thrift Stores and other events), Assisteens (high school youth), and ALPHA or Assistance League Professional Humanitarian Auxiliary (working professionals or business women who wish to contribute to the community). History Assistance League was established in 1919 by the philanthropic efforts of Anne Banning (daughter-in-law of Phineas Banning) and Ada Edwards Laughlin (daughter-in-law of Homer Laughlin) to form Assistance League of Southern California. Anne Banning, was a leading philanthropist of her time, with a mission to aid families in distress as a result of World War I. Her vision to provide service to all in need, regardless of their race, religion or culture, laid the foundation for the future of the organization. The first Assistance League thrift shop opened as a revenue source for the philanthropic programs: Day Nursery, Girl‚Äôs Club, and others. In the 1930s, the Assistance League called on daughters and granddaughters of its members to assist in various philanthropic projects. This participation developed into Assisteens, a youth focused program of volunteerism for grades seven to 12. After 1935, neighboring communities sprouted affiliate chapters and a national representation was beginning to organize under the guidelines of Ada Laughlin. In August 1949 National Assistance League was formed. Since its inception, the Assistance League has had the support of Hollywood celebrities participating in volunteerism and charitable events. It was not uncommon to see celebrities like Jean Harlow reading stories to children in need, Claudia Dell waiting tables for a good cause or Shirley Temple Black, who was actively involved as a member, running the register at an Assistance League gift shop. The Assistance League and its chapters have won numerous awards including being nominated and winning the All-Star Award for Make a Difference Day in 2012 and 2013, an annual recognition to individuals and organizations making the biggest impact nationally through volunteerism.

It was released on October 29, 2013, via Brutal Panda Records. The EP was produced and mixed by Ryan Boesch, who is known for his engineering work for acts such as Melvins, Helmet and Foo Fighters. Critical reception Upon its release, Clean generally received positive reviews. Natalie Zina Walschots of Exclaim! praised the album, writing: \\"The songs are appallingly catchy and \\"Blue Blood,\\" in particular, drives its hooks in as deeps as barbed porcupine quills, refusing to be dislodged. Rarely has an act of musical self- immolation been so enjoyable.\\" Orlando Weekly music reviewer Bao Le-Huu stated: \\"Dealing in exhilarating violence and rampaging heaviness, this record is kin to releases by bands like Unsane and Pissed Jeans, but with more concussive torque and searing clarity.\\" Andy O'Connor of Pitchfork was rather mixed in his assessment of the album: \\"It doesn't push or expand the genre, and it doesn't feel like that's the point: it, more or less, feels like they wanted something to put on their merch table, and an excuse to ditch town for a week, and Clean is serving that purpose. Not the worst thing in the world, but also not the most inspired.\\" Sputnikmusic staff reviewer Greg Fisher felt that the album \\"may not appeal to those who seek experimentation in heavy music\\", while stating that the band's \\"ultra-loud brand of noise rock seethes with enough unbridled anger, songwriting dexterity and alluring hooks to exert a lasting impact.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Whores. # \\"Baby Bird\\" - 3:41 # \\"Last Looks\\" - 4:07 # \\"I Am Not a Goal-Oriented Person\\" - 2:57 # \\"Cougars, Not Kittens\\" - 6:41 # \\"Blue Blood\\" - 1:41 # \\"I Am an Amateur at Everything\\" - 5:16 Personnel ;Whores *Christian Lembach - vocals, guitar *Jack Schultz - bass *Travis Owen - drums ;Technical personnel * Ryan Boesch - mixing, recording, production * Patrick \\"JJP\\" Copeland - artwork References External links  Whores on Brutal Panda Records Category:2013 EPs Category:Whores (band) albums Category:Noise rock EPs Category:Sludge metal EPs ","title":"Clean (Whores EP)"},{"id":"42438464","text":"Blaine Patrick Hardy (born March 14, 1987) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Minnesota Twins organization. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers. College career Hardy attended Edmonds-Woodway High School in Edmonds, Washington, graduating in 2005. He then enrolled at the University of Portland in 2006 where he played for the school's college baseball team. Hardy then transferred to Bellevue College for the 2007 season, and would go on to play for Lewis‚ÄìClark State College in 2008. Hardy was a member of the Lewis‚ÄìClark National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics World Series championship team in 2008. Professional career = Minor leagues = The Kansas City Royals selected Hardy in the 22nd round of the 2008 MLB Draft. The Royals released Hardy during spring training in 2013. Hardy signed with the Detroit Tigers in April 2013, and they assigned him to the Erie SeaWolves of the Class AA Eastern League. Hardy finished with a 2‚Äì2 record and a 1.63 earned run average (ERA) as a reliever before he was promoted to the Toledo Mud Hens of the Class AAA International League. He was pressed into duty as a starting pitcher due to a pitching shortage and performed well. He finished the season with an 8‚Äì3 record and a 1.67 ERA between Double-A Erie and Triple-A Toledo. =Detroit Tigers=  2014  Hardy was a non-roster invitee to spring training in 2014, and impressed as he competed for a role as the team's long reliever. The Tigers reassigned him to minor league camp towards the end of spring training. On June 15, 2014, the Detroit Tigers purchased Hardy's contract from Triple-A Toledo, and he was added to the 25-man roster. Hardy made his major league debut for the Detroit Tigers the next day in a game against the Kansas City Royals, pitching two scoreless innings, allowing one hit, walking two and striking out two. He performed well in his first major league season, posting a 2.54 ERA in 39 innings pitched.  2015  Hardy made the Tiger roster for Opening Day in the 2015 season, but was held back for extended spring training due to a minor injury. On August 23, 2015, Hardy's homerless streak of innings ended after allowing a home run to Mike Napoli. This was the longest active homerless innings streak in the major leagues. The last time Hardy had allowed a home run was to Jason Castro on June 27, 2014. Hardy holds the franchise record for the most appearances by a left-hander without allowing a home run, at 87, and was two appearances away from tying Bernie Boland's record for 89 homerless appearances. He would finish the season with a 3.08 ERA, while striking out 55 batters in innings. He appeared in a team- high 70 games in 2015. 2016 On May 12, 2016, Hardy was optioned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. He made seven appearances between June 6 and June 18 before being optioned to Toledo again. He was called up to the Tigers again in August, and pitched three scoreless innings of an August 9 game against the Seattle Mariners. For the 2016 season, Hardy made 21 relief appearances, posting a 1‚Äì0 record with a 3.51 ERA in innings pitched.  2017  Hardy again split time between Toledo and Detroit in 2017. He struggled with the Tigers this season, posting a 5.94 ERA and 1.77 WHIP while striking out 28 batters in innings. On November 25, 2017, the Tigers avoided arbitration with Hardy, agreeing on a one-year contract.  2018  On March 25, 2018, Hardy was outrighted to Triple-A Toledo by the Tigers. On May 4, 2018, the Tigers purchased Hardy's minor league contract and added him to the roster. Hardy made his first major league start on May 13, giving up two earned runs in innings against the Seattle Mariners, while throwing a career-high 79 pitches. In his third start on May 27, Hardy went a career-high seven innings and threw 85 pitches, giving up just one run and three hits against the Chicago White Sox to earn his first major league win as a starter. Due to injuries to Francisco Liriano and Jordan Zimmermann, Hardy continued to pitch in the Tigers starting rotation through the month of June. He made seven total starts, going 3‚Äì1 with a 3.66 ERA in those games, before returning to the bullpen on July 1. He earned his first major league save on July 2 against the Toronto Blue Jays. Back in the rotation on August 3, Hardy took a no-hitter against the Oakland Athletics into the seventh inning, before an infield single by Jed Lowrie ruined the no-hit bid. He finished the game allowing one hit, with two walks and six strikeouts on a career-high 106 pitches. On August 17, Hardy was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to elbow tendinitis. For the 2018 season, Hardy appeared in 30 games (13 starts), compiling a 4‚Äì5 record, 3.56 ERA, 1.17 WHIP, and 66 strikeouts in 86 innings. 2019 On January 11, 2019, the Tigers avoided arbitration with Hardy, agreeing on a one-year, $1.3 million contract. Despite having pitched in 194 games for the Tigers over five seasons, 2019 marked the first time in his career that Hardy was with the team for an opening day. After putting up a 4.47 ERA in 44 1/3 innings in 2019, mostly with elbow pain, Hardy was optioned to the Toledo Mud Hens on August 9. Hardy opted to receive PRP injections to treat his elbow on August 13 after seeking a second opinion during the 72-hour window to report to Toledo. Hardy was then placed on the 60-day injured list which ended his season. His option was rescinded since he had his elbow treated prior to reporting to his minor league assignment. Hardy was outrighted off the Tigers roster and elected free agency on October 24, 2019. =Minnesota Twins= On November 26, 2019, Hardy signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins. On March 27, 2020, it was announced that Hardy underwent Tommy John surgery, ending his 2020 season before it began. Pitch selection Hardy throws a fastball in the 87‚Äì91 mph range that he will occasionally cut for late movement. His most effective pitch is an upper-70s curveball, which has yielded most of his strikeouts to date. He mixes in a changeup at 78‚Äì81 mph.

It is conceptually similar to another widely used tool developed for transcriptomics called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis or GSEA. GSEA uses a collection of predefined gene sets to rank the lists of genes obtained from gene chip studies. By using this ‚Äúprior knowledge‚Äù about gene sets researchers are able to readily identify significant and coordinated changes in gene expression data while at the same time gaining some biological context. MSEA does the same thing by using a collection of predefined metabolite pathways and disease states obtained from the Human Metabolome Database. MSEA is offered as a service both through a stand-alone web server and as part of a larger metabolomics analysis suite called MetaboAnalyst. MSEA Web Server The MSEA web server is a freely available web server for performing metabolite set enrichment analysis on human or mammalian metabolomics data. The required input is either a list of compound names or compound names and concentrations. The output is a set of graphs and tables with embedded hyperlinks to the pertinent pathway images and descriptors. The Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis offered by the web server is based on a curated library of more 5000 predefined metabolite sets covering various human metabolic pathways (nearly 100), hundreds of human disease states (in 3 different biofluids), human biofluid and tissue locations as well as human SNP-metabolite associations (4500 different SNP associations). MSEA also allows users to upload custom metabolite sets for more specialized analysis (such as non-mammalian MSEA work). Three different enrichment analyses are supported by the server: 1) overrepresentation analysis (ORA); 2) single sample profiling (SSP) and 3) quantitative enrichment analysis (QEA). ORA analysis only needs a list of compound names. SSP and QEA need both compound names and their concentrations. Workflows, examples and other screenshot tutorials on how to use the server are available on the MSEA website. The MSEA server also offers a number of other functions including the conversion between metabolite common names, synonyms, and major database identifiers. In 2011 MSEA functions were expanded and integrated into MetaboAnalyst. This integration allows users to perform a more complete analysis and to link to other data processing and data interpretation functions available in MetaboAnalyst. MSEA is also offered in the MeltDB software platform.
