After her husband died in 1903, she continued to operate the business until she married Charles E. M. Caisse, a Canadian-born Vermont blacksmith. Around that time, she turned the boat line, which continued to operate until 1916, over to her son Fred and daughter-in-law Helen Lavigne.

Biography Henderson was born in Eastbourne in Sussex and with the encouragement of her mother, a keen amateur painter, she attended the South Kensington Schools before studying at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1903 and 1905. Henderson continued her art education in Paris. For periods of time, between 1908 and 1912, she took lessions at various ateliers in the city including the Academie Moderne, the Acad√©mie Colarossi, the Acad√©mie de La Palette and at Cercle Russe. In 1912 Henderson studied with Othon Friesz before spending 1913 in Italy. After some time on the island of Guernsey, Henderson enrolled at the Chelsea Polytechnic in 1916, where she was taught lithography by the artist Francis Ernest Jackson. In London she became a frequent visitor to London Zoo and animal drawings and paintings became a major theme of her work. London Transport commissioned a poster from her to promote travel to the Zoo, which was, despite its unusual design, well received. Henderson started her own press and became a member of the Senefelder Club. In 1924 Henderson had her first solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London. The exhibition consisted of drawings, lithographs and bronze sculptures of, often savage, animals such as Jaguar Tearing its Prey and Leopard Killing a Parrot. Between 1927 and 1938 several works by Henderson featured in exhibitions hosted by the Society of Graver Printers in Colour. In 1928 Henderson married Henri Baron de Coudenhove, the French consul to Guernsey. The couple lived on the island during World War Two and throughout the German occupation. Baron de Coudenhove died towards the end of the war and in 1946 Henderson moved to Hadlow Down in Sussex. She continued painting into the last years of her life. During her lifetime Henderson exhibited at the Royal Academy, with the Women's International Art Club and the Society of Women Artists. A joint retrospective exhibition of Henderson's work, with that of her friend Orovida Pissarro, was held in 1985 at the Michael Parkin Gallery. Sally Hunter Fine Art subsequently held exhibitions of her work in 1999, 2001 and 2004 at various locations. The Tate holds two examples of her work, both from 1916, while the British Museum holds several pieces. The Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge and Manchester City Art Gallery also hold works by Henderson.

It is a rare Victorian example of an I-house in Oakland Township. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. History In 1833, Martin Coleman purchased this parcel of land, likely building a small house and barn on the property soon afterward. In 1845, Coleman transferred 80 acres, including the house and barn, to Zenas Coleman, probably his son. In 1856, Zenas Coleman sold their 80 acres to Eli Albertson and his wife, Sidney Teeter Albertson. The Albertsons made extensive improvements to the property, including constructing a substantial main house as an additiona to the already extant small house. Eli Albertson died in 1882, and the farm eventually passed to his youngest daughter Carrie May and her husband Harvey Crissman. The Crissmans planted apple orchards on the property. In 1949, most of the 80 acre farm was platted into a subdivision, and the ownership of the house passed out of the family. Description The Albertson House is a two-story rectangular, side-gabled building five bays wide, on a fieldstone foundation. The house is likely timber-framed rather than balloon-framed. It has clapboard siding, decorative wood trim, and an asphalt-shingled roof. A string of connected additions runs to one side, and a bay window projects from one wall. The main facade is symmetrical, with a central front gable, a large window in the second story below, and a one-story entry porch on the first floor. The central entry axis is flanked on both floors with double-hung, two-over-two windows of equal size. Decorative wood trim accents the house, including stickwork support posts on the entry porch, with panels between the sticks displaying hearts, circles, and teardrops. Pedimented hoods with decorative trim are above the windows, and paired brackets run along the cornice line.

He was blinded by the usurper Andronikos I Komnenos, and raised to sebastokrator by his brother Isaac upon the latter's accession to the throne in 1185. Early life and career Constantine Komnenos Angelos was born , the eldest son of Andronikos Doukas Angelos and Euphrosyne Kastamonitissa. He was related to the ruling Komnenian dynasty through his paternal grandparents, Constantine Angelos and his wife, Theodora Komnene, daughter of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (). In he married, but the name or family of his wife is unknown. He must have had at least one son, whose name and life are unknown apart from his candidacy as heir apparent in 1199 (see below). According to the court poet and megas droungarios tes vigles (senior judicial official) Gregory Antiochos, Constantine served in the wars against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Iconium, an activity that must be placed in the last years of Manuel I Komnenos () or during the reign of Alexios II Komnenos (). Support and opposition to Andronikos I Komnenos In spring 1182, Empress-regent Maria of Antioch and her chief minister, Alexios Komnenos, sent Constantine's father to confront another imperial relative, Andronikos Komnenos, who had rebelled and was marching on Constantinople. Constantine's father had reached the vicinity of Nicomedia, where many local people joined him. In a battle near Charax, Andronikos was defeated by the rebel's army even though that army was a hastily assembled force consisting only, according to Choniates, of \\"farmers unfit for warfare and a contingent of Paphlagonian soldiers\\", led not even by an experienced commander but by \\"a certain eunuch\\". On his return to Constantinople, Constantine's father was faced with accusations that he had misappropriated money meant for the army's salary. Fearing accusations of pro-rebel sentiments, at the advice of his six sons, \\"all young in heart and brave in deed\\" according to Choniates, he barricaded himself and his family in their walled palace at Exokionion, before fleeing the city altogether with his family and joining Andronikos Komnenos in Bithynia. Emboldened by this defection, Andronikos Komnenos moved to Chalcedon, across the Bosporus from Constantinople. Following the defection of the megas doux (commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy) Andronikos Kontostephanos with the navy to the rebel, a revolt broke out in the city and the gates were opened to Andronikos Komnenos, who now became regent of the underage Alexios II. Soon, however, the very same nobles who had aided Andronikos Komnenos in rising to power conspired against him, once it became clear that he did not intend to restore them to the privileged positions they had held under Emperor Manuel, and that he contemplated seizing the throne for himself. Like his brothers, Constantine participated in a conspiracy against Andronikos Komnenos, led by his father, Andronikos Kontostephanos, and the logothetes tou dromou (chief minister) Basil Doukas Kamateros. The conspiracy was quickly discovered by the Emperor's agents, however. Kamateros, Kontostephanos and four of his sons, as well as many other members of the conspiracy, were seized and blinded, but Andronikos Angelos and his sons escaped. According to Choniates, while fleeing from the pursuing imperial soldiers, Andronikos and his sons found a boat laden with empty amphorae; throwing the cargo overboard, they boarded it and sailed to safety in Acre. Constantine quickly grew tired of exile, and returned to Constantinople, making his peace with Andronikos Komnenos. Soon after his arrival, however, Andronikos Komnenos moved decisively to usurp power, by killing first the Empress-mother Maria of Antioch (August 1183), followed by his own elevation to co-emperor (September 1183), and finally the murder of Alexios II (October 1183), which left Andronikos Komnenos as sole emperor. Seeing these events, Constantine's younger brothers Theodore and Isaac launched revolts in Prussa and Nicaea respectively. Probably as a result of these, or due to his participation in some conspiracy, Constantine was blinded by the emperor's agents. Later life and death Following the rise of his brother Isaac II Angelos () to the throne in September 1185, Constantine received the high rank of sebastokrator. He apparently played some role in court‚ÄîAntiochos' laudatory poem was sent to Constantine in hopes of securing a significant official appointment‚Äîbut according to Antiochos most of his time until the end of his life was devoted to charity. His reaction to the overthrow of Isaac II in 1195 by his own brother, Alexios III Angelos (), is unknown. In spring 1199, however, when Alexios fell ill with gout and the issue of his succession arose (Alexios had no son, only daughters), Constantine was among the imperial relatives who ardently competed with one another, either for themselves, or for their sons‚Äîsince Constantine and his other two brothers were blinded, they were barred from the imperial office‚Äîeven though they all were, according to Choniates, insignificant personages. Constantine's subsequent life and date of death are unknown. At some point, he dedicated a rich altar-cloth depicting the archangels, which was looted by the Fourth Crusade and was brought to the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice. A seal of his, with his dignity of sebastokrator, survives in Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum.

The effects of the storm were extremely limited, the electrification of Europe and North America was still in its infancy. This storm's great Aurora was witnessed across Europe and had not been seen since 1709. The storm was remarkable primarily because of how far and wide it was observed, and for the brightness of its red glow, which led many to believe the cause was fire. Eventually collected reports would show that the Aurora was witnessed in far north of Canada, and spread as far south as southern California and on Bermuda in the North Atlantic off of the Carolinas. In Europe, the Aurora was seen in Northern Scotland, East Austria, in southern Sicily, Gibraltar, Portugal, and news reports in Southern Australia had seen it. All transatlantic radio communication was interrupted and Canada suffered a 12-hour-long short-wave radio blackout. Gathered crowds in the Netherlands were awaiting the imminent birth of Princess Juliana's baby Princess Beatrix who was eventually born on 31 January 1938: the Dutch people cheered the aurora as a lucky omen. Canada was witness to the most vivid auroral displays in the nights of 24‚Äì25 and 25‚Äì26 January. The celestial display on 25‚Äì26 January was seen from Canada to Bermuda and from Austria to Scotland. In Salzburg, Austria, some residents called on the fire department as they believed something was on fire in their town. So many alarm bells were rung that the fire departments were constantly moving to new alarms while calming the citizens, the deafening sounds of alarm bells further caused panic causing some residents to flee to rural areas. This same alarm was seen in London where many also believed whole streets were on fire, even the guards of Windsor Castle summoned the fire brigade to put out a non-existent fire. In Switzerland, the Swiss Alps peaks covered in white snow were glowing bright and reflecting some of the Auroral rays causing a reflective disco effect. In San Diego, the National Forest Service was called up in the town of Descanso and routed out of bed on 22 January to respond to a 'great fire in the back country', after they checked out the back roads they discovered it was the Crimson Aurora Borealis in the northern sky, which had not been seen in that region since February 1888. In Bermuda, many people believed that a massive freight ship was on fire at sea too far to see with their naked eyes, Steamship captains believed it so much that they checked in with the wireless stations to learn if there were any S.O.S calls and if they could help. In Scotland, many religious people living in the lowlands were afraid and called the Aurora an ill-omen for Scotland. The electrical side-effects were severely limited only short-wave radio transmissions were shut down for almost 12 hours in Canada. In England where express trains on the Manchester-Sheffield line where the signalling equipment was inoperable due to electrical disturbances. These coal trains who were moving halted and waited at these junctions for safety reasons. Many teletype systems at local Western Union offices were started, spewed out garbage data and suffered electrical shorts. Due to a particularly thick cloud cover at the beginning of January, only London based Royal Observatory Greenwich was able to observe a large sunspot on 15 January due to a short break in the cloud covers on earth. The latitude of the sunspot was on the +19¬∞ N declination on the suns hemisphere, the sunspot at its maximum size covered an area of roughly 3,000 Millionths of the Solar Hemisphere, or 3,000(MSH), the spot resembled a similar spot observed in October 1937. Back then this sunspot became the biggest sunspot observed since records began and trumped the sunspot of the May 1921 geomagnetic storm. The magnetic solar storm was detected on 16 January at around 22:30 GMT by the now defunct Abinger Magnetic Observatory in Surrey, England. A rapid succession of solar flares which created much larger geomagnetic disturbance quickly released towards Earth on 22 January between the hours of 05:00, 09:00 and 10:00, with high frequency, however on 25 January, a day after the massive sunspot had disappeared from direct line of sight over the western side of the Sun, a sudden and rapid barrage of high-frequency waves began at around midday and developed to a new record-breaking highs in the evening. A large movement of the recording magnets at Abinger began at around 17:00 and were extremely noteworthy at 20:00 and 21:30, the geomagnetic disturbance only started calming down at around 03:00 in the morning of 26 January. The Aurora The intensely bright arches of crimson light with shifting spectrum of green, blue white and red radiated from a brilliant Auroral Crown near the Zenith instead of appearing as usual in parallel lines. This Aurora was considered by many Catholics to be related to the F√°tima Prophecies, which were made public in 1941, three years after the event. A witness account by Dr. B. A. Keen, former President of the Royal Meteorological Society had written the following during and after seeing the spectacle: \\"At Harpenden, the display was seen from 18:45 until well after midnight. The early stages appeared as a red glow in the north-west and later in the north-east, with a low broad green arc in between. The area of the luminous sky increased, and by 20:30 the green colour with areas of red extended well south of Orion. Up to 23:00, there seemed to be three periods of brilliant display: the first, and perhaps the best, at 19:45 when a bright red glow in the north-north-east was traversed by many sharply defined green and white shafts, at 20:30 especially in the east; and again at 21:45, when diffuse and rapidly fluctuating green streamers appeared between north-east and north-west, directed towards the Zenith. Thereafter, the luminosity decreased, but as late as 23:00 a broad green arc stretching from north-west to north-east was still clearly visible. About midnight, a fourth display began with red streamers in the north-west, which extended until a broad red band was formed passing through the zenith to the north-east. At 01:00, faint red and green glows were still visible.\\" See also * List of solar storms  References  Category:1938 natural disasters Category:January 1938 events Category:Geomagnetic storms Category:1938 in science ","title":"January 1938 geomagnetic storm"},{"id":"57305855","title":"Ashes (Celine Dion song)"},{"id":"57305857","text":"Haikou Transportation Center (), also known as Haikou Bus terminal, is the main bus station serving Haikou, Hainan, China.

In August 2020, it was revealed that all remaining original programming on the service would eventually move to HBO Max, and the following month, DC announced the service would change its name to DC Universe Infinite and convert to simply a digital comics subscription service in January 2021. History and development In April 2017, DC Universe was announced as an untitled service with original television programming, with its title announced a year later in May 2018. The next month, the features of the service beyond original programming were revealed, including access to older DC live-action and animated films and animated series for a select period of time, a rotating selection of comics, forum discussion space, a merchandise store, and DC encyclopedia. Sam Ades, the general manager and senior vice- president at Warner Bros. Digital Network, manages the service. The service's first slate of programming, Titans and Young Justice: Outsiders, was revealed in April 2017. That November, Harley Quinn, a half-hour animated series, was announced for the service. In January 2018, a Superman prequel series titled Metropolis was announced, focusing on Lois Lane and Lex Luthor. In May 2018, the live-action series Swamp Thing and Doom Patrol were announced, and Metropolis was being redeveloped. That July, a live-action Stargirl series was announced, which would also feature additional members of the Justice Society of America. A month later, the daily news program DC Daily was announced. In June 2020, it was announced that DC Universe would be offering its subscribers the HBO Max streaming service at a discounted price of a month; this applied to new HBO Max subscribers. At the end of July 2020, DC Universe no longer offered the yearly subscription option for the service. In August 2020, DC Comics publisher Jim Lee revealed that all original programming would be migrated over to HBO Max. Speaking to the community aspect of DC Universe, as well as the ability to access the backlog of comics titles, Lee said \\"there is always going to be a need for that\\" and that DC was looking at ways to transform the platform so that content would not go away. In September 2020, DC announced that the service would change its name to DC Universe Infinite and become solely a digital comics subscription service on January 21, 2021. The service would offer currently published DC Comics titles six months after their retail release date (before the change, current comics would arrive a year after their release date), early access to DC Comics' digital first titles, would feature exclusive comics created for the service, and access to 24,000 titles in DC's back catalog. DC Universe subscriptions will automatically transfer over to DC Universe Infinite. Regarding the original programming, Young Justice seasons 1-4, Titans season 1-3, Doom Patrol seasons 1-3, the first season of Stargirl, and Harley Quinn seasons 1-3 will move to HBO Max to become Max Original series, with new DC series and \\"key DC classics\\" also being available on HBO Max. Availability DC Universe launched in the U.S. on September 15, 2018, and is available on iOS, Android, Roku, Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Xbox One in addition to web and mobile web access. Each subscription to DC Universe can be used on two devices at a time. Pre-orders for the streaming service became available starting on July 19, 2018, while an early beta-version was made available to select users in August 2018. Live-action series were streamed in 4K Ultra HD HDR. DC Universe is currently available only in the United States. At Fan Expo Canada 2018, DC editor Dan DiDio claimed the service was being beta tested in Canada with plans to launch at an unspecified date. Meanwhile, several original shows from the service were acquired by Corus Entertainment (for broadcast on its Teletoon, Adult Swim, and Showcase cable networks), while Doom Patrol was acquired by Bell Media for its CTV Sci-Fi Channel. Titans is currently being distributed internationally on Netflix. With the announcement of the change to DC Universe Infinite, it was revealed that the service would expand globally beginning in mid-2021. As well, the service will reduce its device availability, operating on the web and iOS and Android devices.

A new owner in 1822 sailed her to Australia and she then traded in the Pacific until in 1825 she sailed to Chile and was wrecked at Valparaiso. There a new owner salvaged her and returned her to sailing under the name Indefatigable. On Indefatigables first voyage the Chilean members of her crew mutinied, killing her captain. The mutineers sailed to Guam where the authorities took Indefatigable in prize. She was later lost in a typhoon in the China Sea. As Calder Peter Dillon purchased Calder in 1822. In July he sailed her to Hobart Town via Acheh with cargo and four prisoners, and arriving on 28 September. Then on 22 November she stopped at Port Jackson, where she landed her four prisoners. Grounding: In January 1823 Dillon sent Calder to Coal River under the command of his Chief Mate, William Worth, to bring back logs. On 24 January Calder was driven ran aground on a reef off Nobbys Island. Dillon sailed to her assistance in the brig Fame.Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser Thu 6 Feb 1823, p.1, \\"WRECK OF THE BRIG CALDER\\". Lloyd's List reported that part of her cargo was saved,Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5821. though apparently she was in ballast. A few days later she was gotten off with some damage.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5822. In August 1823 Dillon and Calder were at new Zealand. Calder, again visited Sandal Wood Bay (Bua Bay) in late December 1824, searching for sandalwood, only to find the area had been stripped of it two years earlier, and he was able to gather only about 500 pounds. Before he sailed away, Dillon left David Whippey with Vunivalu (Chief) Naulivou at Bau. Whippey was to gather beche de mer for Calders return; Calder then sailed in January 1825, never to return. Dillon sailed via Resolution Bay at Tanna, in the New Hebrides. Loss: Calder arrived back at Port Jackson on 25 February 1825. Dillon sailed Calder on 19 March for Chile and arrived at Valparaiso on 3 or 4 May. About a month later a gale developed that drove both the Chilean frigate Valdivia (ex-Esmeralda) and the Chilean merchantman Valparaiso on shore. As Valparaiso was blown towards shore, her anchor hooked and broke Calders chains, with the result that Calder too wrecked on shore. Lloyd's List reported that Calder and Valparaiso had wrecked on 10 June 1825 at Valparaiso.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ6052. Calders hulk was then auctioned off to the highest bidder. Indefatigable & mutiny By 1828 the vessel that had been Calder was under the ownership of John Duncan, an English merchant at Valparaiso, He named her Indefatigable and appointed Joseph Hunter as her master. On 11 June she sailed from Concepci√≥n, Chile, for Australia with 2500 fanegas (Spanish bushels) of wheat, 60 fanegas of walnuts, and three \\"donkie_\\". The crew, in addition to the captain, consisted of two European officers and two or three seamen, and a Bengali steward who had sailed with the captain for many years, and half a dozen or more Chilenos recruited shortly before Indefatigable left harbour. Reportedly, the Chilenos resented the discipline on the ship and within a weak of her departure were plotting mutiny. On 22 July 1828 was at , about 600 miles from the Paumotu Group. During the mutiny the mutineers killed the captain and wounded the two mates and the steward. They kept Loftgreen (or Loftgren; the First Mate), to navigate Indefatigable and put Mr. Todd (the Second Mate), the carpenter, a Swedish sailor, and the steward in the ship's long boat that they provisioned with food and water for two weeks, and sent her off. Loftgreen had communicated to Todd that Todd should steer for Tahiti while he made for Manila, which he believed was the mutineer's destination, and possibly recapture the vessel with the help of the cook and another seaman, should the opportunity arise. The Second Mate and the three other men reached Tawere Island in the Archipleago on 7 August. They stayed there for about 24 hours and were able to reprovision. On 15 August a sudden squall cost them their compass and damaged the boat and mast. Still, that evening they reached Anaa. They stayed there two days and on the 20th they reached Tahiti. The locals imprisoned them, believing that they were escaped convicts that had recently visited the islands and conducted depredations after having been treated hospitably. Fortuitously the ship , Captain Richards, was in port. Tiger and Indefatigable had been at Concepci√≥n at the same time and the officers had met. Richards vouched for the men and the natives released them. Tiger brought the crew members she had rescued to Port Jackson around 24 September.Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser Wed 24 Sep 1828, p.3., \\"LOSS OF THE SHIP SARACEN, AND THE CHILIAN BRIG INDEFATIGABLE, LATE ENGLISH BRIG CALDER.\\" The mutineers ordered Loftgreen to steer to Guam, not realizing that Spain had actually occupied the island. The mutineers' naive plan was to sell Indefatigable to the islanders and then settle on some Pacific island where they would live \\"eating, drinking, sleeping, and keeping an extensive harem\\". Indefatigable arrived at Guam on 12 December. Throughout the voyage Loftgreen, who understood Spanish, had to listen to the mutineers debating if and when they should kill him. When the mutineers arrived at Guam the Spanish governor arrested them. The British frigate happened to arrive at San Luis d'Apra shortly thereafter. She took Loftgreen and the mutineers to Manila, where they arrived on 9 or 19 January 1829. The trial in Manila lasted from end-January to end-March as the court only convened for two hours a day, with frequent 2-3 day adjournments. The court found all six mutineers guilty of murder. They were then garrotted, or hanged. Eventually Loftgreen was able to secure passage to Macao, and from there to Sydney on board Nimrod.Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser Thu 2 Jul 1829, P.3, \\"THE BRIG INDEFATIGABLE\\". Fate The Spanish government condemned Indefatigable as a prize to the government. She was later lost in a typhoon in the China Sea.

The depot was used for both freight and passenger traffic until the 1960s. In 1972 the depot building was sold with the stipulation it be removed from the original site. The new owner moved the building approximately 1,200 feet to the southeast, flipping the original trackside of the building around to the east, but keeping the depot alongside the railroad tracks. The original site of the depot is just southeast of Layton's Veterans Park on Gentile Street. Following the move, the building housed a number of different businesses until 2010, when the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) purchased the building as part of the construction of a neighboring intersection. UDOT initially planned to demolish the building, but at the request of Layton City, it was decided to rehabilitate it instead. The building was sold and then restored in the years 2016‚Äì2017.

One of the officers was knocked down, with the other victims reported to have suffered \\"psychological trauma\\". The lawsuit was initially conducted by the judge of the Spanish special court Audiencia Nacional Carmen Lamela. As of March 2018, Concepci√≥n Espejel was appointed as magistrate ahead of the trial held in late April. Support from Navarre to the accused opposite the Audiencia Nacional (Madrid)The case was controversial because the public prosecutor described it was a \\"terrorist attack\\" and called for sentences ranging between 12 and 62 years,El fiscal acusa de terrorismo y fascismo a los agresores de Alsasua in elperiodico.com and for the heavy-handed approach of Spanish Justice in the case, amid allegations of irregularities and lack of neutrality in the proceedings. The National Court dismissed the terrorism charges, but convicted them with heavy sentences ranging from 2 to 13 years. The state prosecutor appealed the sentence in June 2018, insisting on the existence of 'terrorism', but it was again dismissed in March 2019. The final decision to the appeal filed by the detainees' parents on the Supreme Court was issued on 9 October 2019. The convictions were further reduced to sentences ranging from one year and a half to nine years and a half prison terms; two judges out of five issued a dissenting opinion, stating that discrimination charges should have been upheld. The relatives of the youngsters condemned and their defense lawyer Amaia Izko, despite saluting the reduction of sentences, considered they did not tie in with the actual circumstances, highlighting the \\"lack of guarantees during the process\\" and the \\"artificial account of the events\\". All along the process, the parents of the defendants led a campaign for solidarity with the defendants and to denounce the circumstances surrounding the detention and the proceedings, with meetings and large demonstrations taking place across Navarre and the Basque Country overall. The Spanish Socialists, Spanish right-wing political parties and media, as well as Covite, an ETA victims' association, harshly criticized the aggressors, signs of support and the people of Altsasu, besides praising the Civil Guard. Evolution of events = Judicial statements and evidence = According to the judge, the two Spanish policemen were dressed in civilian clothes. At the local Altsasu festival, a number of youngsters approached them in the bar, asking them to leave. The policemen asked to be left alone but \\"later on, twenty-five other people approached them, with fifteen or twenty of them insulting and beating them until the patrols arrived\\". I√±aki Abad, one of the convicted youths, recorded a video on his mobile phone showing the Civil Guard officer who, according to the prosecution, had been \\"brutally battered on the ground\\", walking in a clean, white shirt moments after the events; he then walks over to Abad and smacks his phone away, but eventually shakes hands and talks with one of the defendants. The footage, which calls into question the prosecution's case, was initially rejected as evidence by the special tribunal, but was later accepted after it was made public. Besides this evidence, the tribunal dismissed another piece of evidence submitted by the defense, namely witnesses and other footage of the incident of the events and afterwards, as well as pictures depicting the actual dimensions of the bar where the attack took place, as denounced by the defense. = Media attention and build-up = The incident immediately attracted a great deal of attention from the main Spanish media, echoing straight-away the Civil Guard's report, with their headlines highlighting that 50 people had attacked two Civil Guard officers. A convoy of over 20 Civil Guard SUVs rushed into the town, as shown on the media. The alleged aggressors handed themselves in to the regional police and the jurisdictional tribunal in Pamplona. They were subsequently released, having been charged. The interior minister Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az stepped in, labelling it \\"a hate crime\\", but an isolated incident, \\"not kale borroka\\", also stating that the aggression \\"proves the town is gripped by a social pathology\\". Residents for their part protested the media were \\"turning the town into a circus act\\", bitterly criticizing the 'manipulation' of the events. Four days later, the ETA victims' association Covite filed a report in the National Court against the defendants for alleged hate and terrorism offenses, as well as reporting Twitter accounts, the local movement Ospa and the campaign Alde hemendik! (Basque for \\"get out of here\\"). The National Court soon demanded the transfer of the case from its jurisdictional tribunal to the special court in Madrid, a request accepted by the Supreme Court of Spain, despite the regional tribunal's dismissal of terrorism charges. = Initial charges = The eight youths accused (Ohian Arnanz Ziordia, Jokin Unamuno Goikoetxea, Jon Ander Cob Amilibia, Julen Goikoetxea Larraza, Adur Ramirez de Alda Pozueta, Aratz Urrizola Ortigosa, I√±aki Abad Olea and Ainara Urkijo Goikoetxea) were charged with a string of offenses including ‚Äòterrorism‚Äô; three of them were remanded and held under special regulations, with the others being released on bail. One of the group faced a sentence of 62 years in prison, the rest 50 years, except for one defendant liable for 12. The youths were imprisoned under the article 573 of the Penal Code passed in 2015 by Mariano Rajoy's People's Party, which had been designed to crack down on Jihadism, the defense claimed. = Evolution of proceedings = In February 2018, the defense recused the new judge appointed to the case, Concepci√≥n Espejel, for her marriage to a Civil Guard colonel and for holding the Order of Merit of the Civil Guard awarded by the Home Office; the petition was declined for being 'untimely'. The hearings took place from 16 to 27 April. On 1 June 2018, the sentence was announced, with the National Court eventually dismissing the terrorism charges and finding the accused guilty of injuring and attacking an agent of the authority, aggravated with abuse of superiority, discrimination and public disorders and threats. One of the accused was sentenced to 2 years of prison, three with 9 years, two with 12 years and the remaining two with 13 years.La Audiencia Nacional no ve terrorismo en la agresi√≥n de Alsasua in elperiodico.com The families, besides labeling the sentence 'outrageous' and an act of 'revenge', announced their plans to appeal. Four days later, the Civil Guard in Altsasu arrested four defendants and sent them to prison on \\"flight risk\\" grounds. On 14 June 2018, the state prosecutor appealed the sentence, arguing again that \\"there was terrorism\\" involved. Six days later, I√±aki Abad's sentence was reduced by 3 years, \\"due to an error\\", and the verdict was modified, with the judge now accepting he initial evidence given by Mar√≠a Jos√©, N.C., a victim of the attack, who said that Abad was not among the aggressors. On 7 March 2019, the sentence for the appeals made by the defense and the prosecution was leaked to the Spanish radio station Cadena Ser ahead of its official announcement by the National Court to the parts involved, confirming for the most part the initial verdict: no terrorism was involved but heavy sentences were still appropriate, due to aggravating circumstances, like \\"ideological discrimination\\" against the Civil Guard officers and their girlfriends. I√±aki Abad's sentence was reduced to a 6-year prison term. The final decision to the appeal filed by the detainees' relatives on the Supreme Court was issued on 9 October 2019, with the tribunal calling the aggression 'abominable' for having addressed it to Civil Guard officers, but ultimately dismissing \\"ideological discrimination\\" and \\"abuse of authority\\"; the sentence disregards the public prosecutor's statement in mid- September holding that \\"the Civil Guard was being targetted for their commitment to the King and the people of Spain\\". The convictions were further reduced to sentences ranging from one year and a half to nine years and a half; two judges out of five issued a dissenting opinion, stating that discrimination charges should have been upheld. The relatives of the youngsters condemned and their defense lawyer Amaia Izko, despite saluting the reduction of sentences, considered they did not tie in with the actual circumstances, highlighting the \\"lack of guarantees during the process\\" and the \\"artificial account of the events\\".  Statements heard during proceedings  Demonstration at Pamplona in support of the defendants (April 2018) The trial became the centre of media attention for the heavy sentences requested and the circumstances surrounding the trial, including certain statements: > \\"What we are seeing in the 21st century Spain is people asking others whose > job they do not like to get out of town. It is xenophobia, racism, full- > blown fascism, since that is what the supremacist Basque nationalists stand > for, imbued as they are with outmoded nationalism\\". Jos√© Perals, National > Court's prosecutor Early support in Altsasu to the defendants, denouncing their judicial treatment Event in solidarity with the defendants at Vitoria-Gasteiz > \\"We consider that if no terrorism is considered in cases like this, we would > be going back 20 years, when ETA's youth organizations Segi, Jarrai and > Haika roamed unrestrained across the towns of the Basque Country and > Navarre, and some said that it was nothing but the kale borroka, petrol > boys\\". Jos√© Perals, National Court's prosecutor > \\"[The sentence shows] absolute contempt for the principle of justice, it is > completely disproportionate; it is about revenge, with the clear aim of > generating pain\\". Parents of the defendants Reactions =Criticism of the attack= The heavy-handed approach of the public prosecutor and the judge to the defendants has led to a rise in the explicit support of the main ETA victims' associations, Ciudadanos and the Spanish Conservatives in office, as they see a link to an \\"ETA strategy\\" in the alleged assault based on Civil Guard reports. On 22 October 2016, the head of COVITE Consuelo Ordo√±ez visited Altsasu along with three other individuals and a notable media presence next to a local meeting protesting the Civil Guard's presence and the \\"staged police set-up\\" in relation to the assault; Ordo√±ez held placards reading slogans in support of the Civil Guard and against 'fear'. The following day, the Spanish premier Mariano Rajoy intervened, stating that \\"there will be no impunity\\" for the \\"brutal assault\\". On 18 April 2018, approximately 2,500 people attended a meeting held in Pamplona called by several parties (PP, UPN, PSN and Ciudadanos) and two ETA victims associations to show their support to the Civil Guard officers and girlfriends subject of the aggression, also bitterly criticizing the Navarrese government for their stance on the issue. On 1 June, the main Civil Guard association AUGC hailed the sentences imposed on the defendants in the hope that this will \\"reduce hostility\\" towards the paramilitary police body and \\"improve cohabitation\\". It added that \\"it is not acceptable under the rule of law to have public security forces and their families, many of them underage, deprived of leading a peaceful life because of their uniform\\". The Spanish Conservatives (PP) in Navarre held that the motion passed by the Parliament of Navarre, which criticised the alleged lack of proportion seen in the sentencing was \\"supporting the executioners and not the victims\\". Pablo Casado, elected head of the Spanish PP in July 2018, visited the Civil Guard headquarters in Altsasu during the run-up to the party presidency campaign, to show his support for the Civil Guard, declaring that \\"there can be no impartiality between thugs battering innocent people in a bar and public servants who risk their lives battling for our rights and liberties\\". =Criticism of the process= Elsewhere, the case has caused outrage and perplexity among many political, social and institutional sectors in Altsasu, Navarre, and the Basque Country in general, with many calling into question the official account of events. In July 2017, 52 MEPs affiliated to five different parliamentary groups signed a public document requesting the intervention in the case of the president of the European Commission Jean- Claude Junker \\"for the sake of proportionality, equity and justice\\", emphasizing that the state prosecutor's prison term petition was \\"disproportionate, nonsensical and antidemocratic\\". The European Commission in turn announced it would closely watch the developments in the judicial process. Amnesty International, while labelling the incident \\"a very serious offence\\", pointed to the risk of trivialization and ambiguity of the 'terrorism' charge, as well as \\"lack of proportion\\" in the indictments requested. It also voiced its concern that the judicial process may be \\"breaching impartiality\\" and \\"discriminating the defendants based on their ideology\\", also adding that the accusation of 'terrorism' should have never happened. Also in June 2018, the one-time magistrate of the National Court Baltasar Garz√≥n called the whole process an 'embarrassment' spurred by an urge to satisfy the grudges or wishes for revenge held by certain sectors in Spain, using the judiciary for the purpose. Similarly, football coach Pep Guardiola criticized in June 2019 the 900-day imprisonment of the perpetrators and the Spanish state's alleged meddling in this and other cases, like those arrested in relation to the Catalan process. Parents of the defendants in the European Parliament Rally in Pamplona to denounce the final sentence, \\"This is not justice\\" (October 2019) Ahead of the trial hearings in April, a rally was held on 14 April in Pamplona to protest against the conditions in which proceedings were taking place and in support of the defendants and their families. Between 30,000 and 50,000 protesters turned out to the streets of Pamplona. The mayor of Pamplona Joseba Asiron, on behalf of the Local Council, and Maria Solana, the representative of the regional government, attended the protest, which was also supported by the unions LAB, ELA, CC.OO and the parties in office at Navarre. By contrast, the call was opposed by the parties UPN, PSN and PP of Navarre. The unexpected arrests, amid strong security measures, of four defendants in Altsasu on 5 June, raised the level of indignation in Altsasu and Navarre against the judicial peculiarities and 'disproportion' surrounding the case. \\"A court summons would have done\\", the mother of a defendant remarked. The parents of those arrested claimed the whole process was fraught with irregularities, \\"a juridical aberration\\". They announced a demonstration in Pamplona on 16 June in which they expected a greater number of protesters than those who turned out to the demonstration on 14 April. The Government and Parliament of Navarre have also showed their support for the families in \\"their quest for justice\\". On 16 June, between 30,000 and 80,000 people took to the streets in Pamplona under the banner \\"this is not justice\\" and showed solidarity with the young prisoners, who were being held 500 kilometres away from home. The rally, probably the largest held at Pamplona in recent times, received wide support from political personalities (PNV, EH Bildu, Podemos, etc.), a number of unions, and individuals coming from different parts of Spain. On 24 March 2019, 35,000 to 60,000 protesters took to the streets of Altsasu bearing the same slogan; the protest was also attended by a number of high-ranking officials and representatives of Navarre and Altsasu; the organizers denounced the \\"lack of neutrality and rigour\\" during the proceedings. A significant number of demonstrators arrived from other parts of Spain and Catalonia, beyond the Basque region.\\" Following the final sentence on early October 2019, the relatives of the convicts called a demonstration on 26 October in Pamplona to protest the \\"lack of proportionality\\" in the sentence under the banner \\"this is not justice\\"; it was attended by the mayor of Altsasu and several thousands of marchers, 7,500 according to local police forces, 52,000 according to the organizers. On 28 September 2020, Basque goalkeeper Unai Etxebarria was fired from the premier league Granada CF after showing his support to the youths condemned.  Political fallout  The case has become a rallying cry for the Spanish right and far-right, with nationalistic overtones. On 4 November 2018, a group of people led by Albert Rivera from Ciudadanos and Fernando Savater, rode in a bus from Santander Altsasu to stage an event. They were followed by PP and Vox, delivering a hardline message against pro-independence advocates amidst a tense atmosphere and claiming their right to speak in the town. They were escorted by the National Police and Civil Guard deployed in full riot gear throughout, and who established a security cordon. The committee was met by different groups of locals protesting their presence. While addressing a speech to their followers, the town bells started to chime for the whole duration of the event, accompanied at times by a siren and a rock concert which had been staged nearby. On 30 May 2019, a ‚Ç¨3000 fine was given to the youths who entered the church to ring the bells. Ospa movement members claimed that from January to April 2019, police stopped 168 cars in the town or its vicinity at roadblocks, 63 of which were conducted by the Civil Guard and the remaining 105 by the Navarrese Foral Police. On the eve of the National Court's announcement of the sentence in March 2019, Popular Party leader Pablo Casado visited the bar in Altsasu where the assault took place in order to take part in a TV interview. However, it was cut short by the bar owner, who asked them to leave the place as they had not asked permission to shoot. The interviewer, a well-known, controversial Spanish journalist, stated that \\"25 pro-ETA thugs\\" ('proetarras') were lurking outside, with the Civil Guard's intervention eventually saving Casado, him and his crew, although available footage clearly disputes such claims.

Born in DeSoto, Texas, Elizabeth sought training as a nurse at the College of Industrial Arts in Denton, Texas. Upon completing her education, she joined the United States Army as a nurse in 1918, but was discharged due to poor eyesight after two years of service. Elizabeth then spent three years in schools across America teaching blind children, before moving to Guangzhou, China in 1933 to pursue missionary work. She was able to do this due to a government pension. World War II disrupted Elizabeth's missionary work in Asia, causing her to flee or relocate several times. Prior to the break out of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Elizabeth fled in 1938 from Guangzhou to Hong Kong. She moved once more to Macau before settling in Guilin. After spending some time in India, Elizabeth returned to the United States in 1944, during which time she attended the Alhambra Church of Christ.

After World War II ended, Elizabeth was able to return to Guangzhou in 1947 and repair the Canton Bible School damaged during the war. She began caring for orphans, but the communist revolution forced her to leave Guangzhou and settle in Hong Kong, taking several orphans with her. By 1949, Elizabeth was the only Churches of Christ missionary in Hong Kong and she worked alone until 1959 when additional missionaries were sent on short-term assignments. Working with others from the American Churches of Christ, Elizabeth reestablished churches and preaching schools, thus reviving the Hong Kong mission.

Among the members of the audience was Spitalny, who at the time was conductor of the orchestra at the Capitol Theater. Although Kaye's grandmother slammed the door in Spitalny's face when he first tried to contact the girl about auditioning for him, she eventually auditioned for him, and he signed her to be the first member of his planned all-female orchestra.

The etymology is the aspiration to achieve one's goal. Faith's virtues are like a fertile field, a wishing gem, a king who enforces the law, someone who holds the carefulness stronghold, a boat on a great river and an escort in a dangerous place. Faith in karma causes temporary happiness in the higher realms. Faith is a mental state in the Abhidharma literature's fifty- one mental states.According to the Compendium of Abhidharma, it belongs to the subgroup of the eleven virtuous states. In meditation practice, it is the third antidote, from among the eight antidotes, and is laziness' antidote. Perfect faith in the Buddha, his Teaching (Dharma) and the Order of his Disciples (Sangha) is comprehending these three jewels of refuge with serene joy based on conviction. The Tibetan word for faith is day-pa (Tib. ‡Ωë‡Ωë‡ºã‡Ωî‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω¶‡Ω¥‡Ωò‡ºã, d√©pa sum; Wyl. dad pa gsum), which might be closer in meaning to confidence, or trust. According to Chogyam Trungpa (1939 to 1987), faith means \\"accepting what is there\\" or \\"accepting what has been taught\\" unselfishly. It is feeling unshakably steady and confident as well as knowing what to cultivate and what to avoid. It means dedication to and conviction in one's own intelligence, which begins to manifest with one's guru, teacher, spiritual friend; this is awakened faith, real faith based on someone else acknowledging your existence. Genuine faith is without expectations, it is developed with renunciation. Emptiness is based on faith, with the idea of not getting anything in return. Right faith develops trust in all sentient beings who are worthy to be objects of compassion. Faith in knowing the right path based on actual experience, one has a sense of being with forward vision, it also involves delightfulness and the first perception.The five perceptions are 1. Faith, 2. Exertion / energy, 3. Recollection / Awareness, 4. One pointedness / meditation, 5. Intellect / knowledge / prajna In the Nyingma \\"Vast Expanse Heart Essence\\" preliminary teachings, teacher Patrul Rinpoche (1808‚Äì1887) has faith preceding refuge. It is the first step opening the refuge gateway to the three jewels of faith: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. It is also the first of the seven noble signs of wealth (faith with the six perfections). Having the ability to turn to the Dharma is the advantage of faith, among the five individual advantages.Nagarjuna lists the five advantages as: Born a human, in a central place, with all one's faculties, Without a conflicting lifestyle and with faith in the dharma. In the explanation of how difficult it is to find the freedoms and advantages. Lasting and stable faith is important and there are three main kinds: vivid faith, eager faith, and confident faith.According to Patrul Rinpoche and others, reflecting on the teachers' and Buddha's immense compassion inspires vivid faith. Eagerness to be free from suffering inspires eager faith. While confident faith in the three jewels, from the heart's depth, once their blessings and extraordinary qualities are understood. Therefore, faith has been defined as having a vivid and eager mind towards, and have confidence in, that which is authentic and true. Seeking refuge is motivated by these three kinds of faith. A fourth to be aimed for is irreversible faith, when it becomes integral to the person and is refuge's cause, like a house's foundation serving the Dharma's three jewels. While lacking faith is one of the six stainsThe six stains (Wyl. dri ma drug; Tib. ‡Ωë‡æ≤‡Ω≤‡ºã‡Ωò‡ºã‡Ωë‡æ≤‡Ω¥‡ΩÇ‡ºã) are conduct to avoid when listening to teachings. From Vasubandhu‚Äôs Well Explained Reasoning: #Arrogance, #Lack of faith, #Lack of any interest, #Outward distraction #Inward tension, #And discouragement. See Patrul Rinpoche, Preliminary Points to be Explained When Teaching the Buddha‚Äôs Word or the Treatises, translated by Adam Pearcey in which the antidotes are the kinds of faith. Faith is a jewel that comes before all else blossoming in the heart's center. It is the essence of the Three Roots outer support power and it is Dharma's root. Nature, Categories, Forms and Characteristics There are seven parts to developing faith according to Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje's (1904 -1987) preliminary practices of the Profound and Secret Heart Essence of the Dakini.Khandro Nyingtik (Tib. ‡Ωò‡ΩÅ‡Ω†‡ºã‡Ω†‡ΩÇ‡æ≤‡Ωº‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æô‡Ω≤‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡Ωê‡Ω≤‡ΩÇ, Wyl. mkha' 'gro snying thig), 'The Heart Essence of the Dakinis' ‚Äî one of the 'Four Sections of Nyingtik' (Nyingtik Yabshyi). The Khandro Nyingtik cycle of teachings is regarded as one of the main practices of Dzogchen Monastery.The seven parts in the nature and categories of faith, which is what makes one take the entrance of refuge, are: 1. The reason one needs to develop faith, 2. Categories of faith, 3. How to cultivate faith, 4. The causes that increase faith to make it grow, 5. The particular characteristics of faith, 6. The fault in not having faith, 7.The benefits in cultivating faith. Faith's nature is in the root of every kind of virtuous practice. Its nature is a clear, untroubled mind, discriminating and aware of what should be adopted and avoided. Faith is the cause that gives rise to interest and happiness, it is an antidote to laziness.This contrasts to the Geluk three levels of faith which are beginners faith, faith through understanding and irreversible faith according to Thuken Losang Chokyi Nyima. Remedy the five main disturbances (1) laziness, (2) forgetting the instructions, (3) dullness and wildness, (4) lack of effort, and (5) excessive efforts with the eight antidotes (1) inspiration, (2) endeavor, (3) faith, (4) the refined flexibility that comes through training body, speech and mind. Intelligent faith and devotion brings trust when developed from shamatha, vipashyana and tonglen practice. In general, the sutra teachings speak of four faith types: inspired faith, aspiring faith, confident faith and irreversible faith. =Three Categories= #Vivid Faith - A clear fresh feeling of joy and devotion untainted by guile. #Eager Faith - Yearning to rid cyclic existence of suffering and to attain liberation and enlightenment. Comparable to the quest for riches. #Confident Faith - Confident that cyclic existence is to be emptied and Dharma will not fail. Cultivating firm faith through meditation on impermanence, and devotion to a teacher can lead to positive signs. It gives protection and clears away sufferings of cyclic existence as it is the first step on the path to liberation when aroused intensely with the determination to be free.See the Sublime Sutra of the Marks that Inspire the Development of Faith =Six Forms= According to the Nyingma school's Choying Tobden Dorje (1787‚Äì1848), the ennobling positive six forms of faith are: # Yearning faith stimulating renunciation of rebirth desire to attain awakening freedom. Arising from disillusionment from life's suffering. # Devoted faith leading to a dedication to supreme ideals. Arising from disillusionment from evil companion's behavior. # Respectful faith in body, speech, and mind with outstanding conscientiousness. Arising from disillusionment from life's appearances. # Lucid faith that uplifts the mind's positive qualities. Arising from contact with those who represent supreme ideals. # Trusting (confidence) faith that ends doubts concerning the teaching's base, path, and result. Arising from hearing of the principle of karma. # Certainty in faith toward the doctrine, leading to the application, reflecting, and meditating upon it. Arising from hearing and reflecting on Dharma. =Characteristics= Inspired faith is a sublime quality, indestructible, indomitable and an inexhaustible treasure of good qualities. People who have immutable faith in the three jewels are extremely rare and exalted, as the Sutra of the Precious Lamp points out its characteristics: Reflective wisdom in Buddhism says beliefs should not be accepted with blind faith. Such means to consider the evidence of things, and irrefutable proof upon reflection on the intended meaning, so that a conclusion may arrive. Advanced meditation invites faith based on insight. Reflecting on the Dharma's and the teacher's good qualities can remedy lack of faith.Lack of faith is one of the Eight Incompatible Propensities That Leave No Freedom to Practice the Dharma Ardent faith in the Dharma will arise by stressing lineage. Faith comes in the aftermath of doubt and vice versa but, in the end both are abandon. Single-pointed faith in your teacher can burn away ignorance and obscurations (temporary blindness), but if it is inadequate, you can be burned yourself.Bodhisattvas appear as spiritual friends to those with faith. Faith comes because the vajra master is capable of ransacking kleshas. Support Power Gyatrul Rinpoche (b. 1924), a Payul lineage mediator, in a commentary on the work of Chagm√© (Wylie: Kar-ma Chags- med, fl. 17th century) says, faith power enables eliminating the two types of obscurations (i.e. conflicting emotions and obscuration concerning the knowable).The two obscurations (Wylie: sgrib gnyis) are: :The obscuration of conflicting emotions ([Wylie:] nyon-mongs-pa'i sgrib-ma, Sanskrit: kle≈õa- vara·πáa) and the obscuration concerning the knowable ([Wylie:] shes-bya'i sgrib-ma, Sanskrit: j√±eyƒÅvara·πáa). Dorje, Jikdrel Yeshe (Dudjom Rinpoche, author), & translated and edited: Gyurme Dorje and Matthew Kapstein (1991). The Nyingma School of Tibetan Buddhism: Its Fundamentals and History. Boston, USA: Wisdom Publications. , p.107 (Enumerations). Through the power of faith both ontological and phenomenological knowledge arises. Also, both the common and uncommon siddhis arise. He conveys the importance of faith for qualifying disciples who \\"listen\\" to the Dharma.\\"Listening\\" is a literal translation of the first of the three m≈´la praj√±ƒÅ This pertains to teaching MahƒÅyƒÅna, VajrayƒÅna, and to Atiyoga in particular.

Believing that the teacher knows best and arousing sublime bodhichitta is part of the inner power of support - faith, taking refuge and arousing bodhicitta - within the extraordinary or inner preliminaries of the Longchen Nyingthig Ngondro. Singular faith in the teacher seen as Buddha has greater benefit that the actual teaching. Many factors may instill genuine faith, among these, four crucial circumstances are: 1) an authentic spiritual master attendance, 2) wholesome friends, 3) the three jewels and 4) reflection on existence's round of misery, according to Jigme Lingpa. Khenpo Namdrol says the bodhisattva on the accumulation pathsee Bh≈´mi (Buddhism) has faith and so with joining the five powers and five strengthsThe five powers are in the fourth practice group of the Thirty Seven Enlightenment Factors. They are practiced on the first two stages of the joining path. # faith, # diligence, # mindfulness, # concentration, and # wisdom When the bodhisattva reaches the joining path, the five become powers. Once they overcome their opposing factors, they become strengths. In The Thirty-Seven Factors of Enlightenment, a commentary on the Rigdzin Dupa terma (The Gathering of the Vidyadharas revealed by Jigme Lingpa), which is an inner Guru Rinpoche ritual practice from the Longchen Nyingtik. It is easier to have faith in religious instruction when it has a sense of the sacred. The thousand-petaled lotuses of faith and wisdom bloom. Signs that one is on the right track to accomplishment can be known through experiencing: faith, compassion and wisdom, automatically increasing, so that realization will come easily and few difficulties are experienced. Faith in mantra is more important that how it is pronounced. Without faith in an afterlife, people may live lives deprived of ultimate meaning. Students who have emotional faith in the guru instead of understanding wisdom are not properly qualified to take teachings. Enduring faith in the vinaya and the three baskets of the lamrim. Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo states unequivocally that the Great Perfection can be penetrated with faith alone when being shown the nature of mind itself awakening (i.e. bodhicitta). When the Buddha taught, he always began by introducing the wheel of faith, which opens the way to the Dharma, like the precious wheel of a universal ruler's power. Faith is referred to as a precious wheel is because in Veda scriptures there is a legend about a universal ruler who precious golden magic wheel which always preceded him and caused people to fall under his power. Faith and a strong determination to leave samsara develop in places that resemble where the Buddha gained enlightenment. Offering unceasing and unconquerable faith are the greatest offerings.

Early life Philip was born around 1218 and raised in the royal court. He belonged to the influential gens (clan) T√ºrje, which originated from Zala County. His father was Joachim (or Ivachin), who functioned as Count of Hermannstadt around 1210. In this capacity, he commanded an army of Saxons, Vlachs, Sz√©kelys and Pechenegs to assist Boril of Bulgaria's fight against three rebellious Cuman chieftains in that year. Philip's cousin was the powerful baron and soldier Denis T√ºrje, Palatine of Hungary in the 1240s. Philip had a brother Thomas, the isp√°n of Karak√≥ isp√°nate and forefather of the Szentgr√≥ti family. As a young novice, Philip fled together with king B√©la IV and the royal court to the Dalmatian coast after the disastrous Battle of Mohi and stayed there until the withdrawal of the Mongols from Hungary in 1242. He was first referred as provost of D√∂m√∂s in 1246. Additionally, he also functioned as chancellor and confessor for Queen consort Maria Laskarina, holding both offices until 1248. As chancellor, he participated in reparcelling process of lands beyond the Drava. He also judged in favour of the Bakonyb√©l Abbey during a lawsuit, when refused to recognize the social status of abbey's servants as church serfs and maintained their status of udvornici. The narration of a 1250 royal charter recounts Philip was already commissioned to take part in a diplomatic mission to the Kingdom of Bohemia, when he was provost. He also escorted B√©la's daughter Elizabeth to the Duchy of Bavaria in about 1247, where she later married to Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria. Bishop of Zagreb Philip was elected Bishop of Zagreb in 1248, but a sole charter suggests that he held the dignity already since 1247. As he was under the minimum age for a bishop (30 years), a certain Albert, one of the canons of the Zagreb Chapter, challenged his election to Benedict, Archbishop of Kalocsa, who, however maintained the decision. Following that he petitioned to the Holy See. Pope Innocent IV ordered Bulcs√∫ L√°d, Bishop of Csan√°d and two other clergymen to investigate the circumstances of the election and Philip's aptitude. After they have sent the report to the Roman Curia, Pope Innocent confirmed his election on 26 October 1248. According to some reports the king deployed his influence and actively campaigned in favour of his protege through royal envoys in Rome. B√©la IV renewed his father's charter regarding the land donation of Slanje (today Croatia) to the living members of the gens T√ºrje, Philip and his brother Thomas. The fortress of Medvedgrad, built by Philip T√ºrje The two strongest supporters of B√©la in Croatia, Bishop Philip and Stephen Gutkeled, Ban of Slavonia took their positions in the same year. Following the Mongol invasion, the province of Slavonia and Croatia had an important function of border defence, as a result Stephen built several castles (including Jablanac) along the borders as part of B√©la's radical reforms introduced. The city of Zagreb was destroyed and burned to the ground. This prompted the building of Medvedgrad (lit. \\"bear-fort\\"; ). Also encouraged by Pope Innocent IV, Philip built the fortress between 1249 and 1254. During the implementation of B√©la's land reform in the first half of the 1250s, Stephen Gutkeled and Philip T√ºrje frequently acted as co-judges in various lawsuits and border determinations beyond the Drava river. As bishop, Philip remained a skilled diplomat of B√©la IV. Following the first war broke out between the Hungarian monarch and Ottokar II of Bohemia, Philip traveled to Rome regarding a peace agreement in 1254. There he represented B√©la's interests. Pope Innocent IV mediated a peace treaty, which was signed in Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) on 1 May 1254. In accordance with the treaty, Ottokar ceded Styria to B√©la. In recognition of his diplomatic activity in Rome, he was relieved of the summoning for a period of one year by the pope. B√©la IV recalled his diplomatic service in July 1267, when praised Philip, who, \\"in important missions to the Roman Curia and the remote parts of Italy, and in many other countries at his own expense, exposed to weather, sea and road hazards and other inconveniences, he managed all of our cases with success...\\" and \\"raising the honor of Our Crown, he has faithfully and cleverly dealt with all the matters entrusted to him\\". Despite this, when the relationship between B√©la IV and his eldest son Duke Stephen became tense in the early 1260s, the king, when visitied the Slavonian province in the company of his wife Maria in the spring of 1262, B√©la confiscated Medvedgrad from Philip to transfer the crown jewels and royal treasures from Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r to there for safekeeping, protecting from Stephen. Nominally, the couple's youngest and favorite son B√©la ruled the province as duke since 1260. Medvedgrad was never returned to the Diocese of Zagreb, it administered by the bans of Slavonia thereafter. Returning from Rome in 1254, Philip acquired the land of Waska and the surrounding village Szentm√°rton for the Bishopric of Zagreb. He had a long- lasting conflict with the citizens of Petrinja, who enjoyed wide privileges since the Mongol invasion. The town refused to pay tithe for the Diocese of Zagreb. As a result, Philip excommunicated the burghers and their elected magistrate, while placed Petrinja under interdict. It has not achieved success, as a result, Philip contributed in 1253 to Petrinja paying the tax in kind. He lifted the excommunication and interdict against the town in 1255. Philip intended to rebuild the Zagreb Cathedral, which was destroyed by the Mongols in 1242. He gained the contribution of Pope Alexander IV too in May 1258, but the construction works have begun only the episcopate of Timothy following the late 1260s. Archbishop of Esztergom =Mediator and conciliator= Benedict of Esztergom died in the second half of 1261. Pope Urban IV appointed Philip as Apostolic Administrator of the metropolitan see on 11 January 1262. Pope Urban also invited him to Rome. He was styled as postulated (nominated) archbishop on 7 March 1262. His papal confirmation took place by 8 May. Concurrently with his ecclesiastical dignity, B√©la IV appointed him royal chancellor. Philip held the office until the monarch's death in May 1270. Dominican monastery on Margaret Island, where Philip mediated between B√©la IV and his son Stephen Almost immediately, Philip had to make serious efforts to avoid a bloody civil war in Hungary. Although some clashes took place in the autumn between the royal troops and Stephen's forces, a lasting civil war was avoided through the mediation of the Archbishops Philip and Smaragd of Kalocsa who persuaded B√©la and his son to make a compromise. According to the Peace of Pressburg, which was concluded in the autumn of 1262, the two divided the country along the Danube: the lands to the west of the river remained under the direct rule of B√©la, and the government of the eastern territories was taken over by Stephen, who also adopted the title junior king. However the truce, in the long term, could not prevent the outbreak of the civil war. After Stephen routed his father's army in the decisive Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265, the two archbishops ‚Äì Philip and Smaragd ‚Äì conducted new negotiations between B√©la and his son. Their agreement was signed in the Dominican Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island on 23 March 1266. The new treaty confirmed the division of the country along the Danube. A later document issued by B√©la in July 1267, remembers Philip's efforts with a warm heart, \\"in order to make the crown's brighter state and to serve our country's integrity and gladness, [Philip acted] as a mediator, even as a shield and a barrier to create inner peace [...], exposed himself to heavy spending, dangers and tribulation\\". In addition to the peace treaty, B√©la entrusted Philip and Smaragd to warn the baptized Cumans ‚Äì who fought on Stephen's side in the war ‚Äì to keep their faith, otherwise expel them from the kingdom. Simultaneously, Pope Clement IV authorized the two archbishops to lead troops against the Mongols and other pagans. After his appointment, Philip established his own court and chancellery in Esztergom, consisting with highly educated canon jurists and notaries. For instance, one of his chancellors was the illustrious diplomat Sixtus from 1264 to 1268. In late 1262, B√©la IV confirmed the privileges of the Archdiocese of Esztergom on the occasion of Philip's appointment. At the request of the archbishop, the monarch widened the granted privileges on several occasions; for example, the Saxon hospes of Lipcse (today Partiz√°nska ƒΩupƒça, Slovakia), who were subjects of the archbishopric, were granted tax exemption, in addition to the parishes in Korpona and Selmecb√°nya (present-day Krupina and Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica, respectively), which had to pay the tithe to the Esztergom chapter, instead of the royal treasury. In 1263, B√©la also donated the right of patronage to Philip and his successors over the St. Pantleon monastery, which laid in an island on the Danube (today ruins in Duna√∫jv√°ros). The archdiocese was also granted the annual tithe from the chamber's profit (lucrum camerae) beyond the Dr√°va river in March 1272. The parish of Szentistv√°n (named after martyr Saint Stephen) and St. Anne chapel in √ñrm√©ny (former boroughs of Esztergom) were established during Philip's episcopate. During his episcopate, Pope Clement IV confirmed the privileges of the provostry of Titel and the Tihany Abbey in 1268, and assigned them under the supervision of the Archdiocese of Esztergom. Philip was trying to protect his privileges against his suffragan bishops during his 10-year term. For instance, in the 1263 Synod of Buda, he emphasized his exclusive right to wear of pallium, after Job Z√°h, Bishop of P√©cs declared that he was not only entitled to wear the pallium, but his diocese was also independent of the see of Esztergom. For this, Philip and his successors regarded Job as being excommunicated for ignoring their authority. According to a document from 1264, Philip protected the rights of provostry of Szeben (today Sibiu, Romania), which then belonged to Esztergom, even against Gallus, Bishop of Transylvania and his efforts. Philip also bought several lands in Esztergom and Kom√°rom counties to expand the agricultural and economic estate of the archbishopric. He was involved in numerous border conflicts with the provostry of D√∂m√∂s, and several secular authorities, including Dominic, isp√°n of S√°ros County. Stephen V himself acted as a mediator and conciliator in the two cases mentioned. =Last years= St. Margaret in January 1270, a painting by J√≥zsef Moln√°r (1857) B√©la IV died on 3 May 1270 after 35 years of reign. According to his last will and testament, he was buried in the church of the Conventual Franciscans in Esztergom, next to his youngest son B√©la, who predeceased him. However, as 15th-century historian Antonio Bonfini recorded, Philip had his corpse transferred to the Esztergom Cathedral and reburied him amid bright ceremony. Upon the intervention of the Holy See, the Minorites only succeeded in regaining B√©la's remains after a long lawsuit. After B√©la's death, his daughter, Anna, seized the royal treasury and fled to Bohemia, while other lords rebelled against the rightful heir. Arriving from his province in Eastern Hungary, Duke Stephen immediately left Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r for Esztergom to ensure the safety of coronation jewelry. Following that Duke Stephen and Archbishop Philip jointly returned to Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, where Philip crowned him in early June 1270. Although Philip was replaced as royal chancellor by Stephen V's loyal prelate Stephen B√°ncsa, the isp√°nate of Esztergom was granted to the Archdiocese of Esztergom on 18 May 1270, thus Philip became the first perpetual count (or isp√°n) ever in Hungarian history. Since then the archbishops were simultaneously also styled as isp√°ns of Esztergom County with some minor interruptions until the 20th century. Stephen's sister, the Dominican nun Margaret died on 18 January 1270, Philip was present at her deathbed. Steps were taken to procure her canonization shortly after her death, at the request of her brother. Upon Stephen's intercession, Pope Gregory X commissioned Philip to investigate her miracles, but the church committee suspended its work after the death of Philip in late 1272, and resumed investigation process only after a four-year forced break. Archbishop Philip supported Stephen V in his war against Ottokar II and his domestic supporters. When Stephen V and the Bohemian king reached an agreement in Pressburg on 2 July 1271 after their brief war, Philip was among the signatories. Stephen V stated in the document, if he breaks the treaty, archbishops Philip T√ºrje and Stephen B√°ncsa will be given the mandate for excommunication. Thereafter Ottokar signed the treaty in Prague in the presence of Philip, Stephen's emissary. The king died suddenly in August 1272. His death marked the beginning of the era of feudal anarchy, when many groupings of barons fought against each other for supreme power. Ensuring the order of succession and continuity of the strong royal power, Philip crowned the 10-year-old Ladislaus IV king in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r on about 3 September. The minor king, in theory, ruled under his mother's regency, but in fact, baronial parties administered the kingdom. However, the elderly Philip distanced himself from the conflict, and was unable to prevent the spread of anarchy. A few days before his death, Philip was reinstated as royal chancellor. He died on 18 December 1272. His death gave rise to an effective 7-year period of vacancy in the episcopal see of Esztergom.

The building and surroundings were evacuated after the IRA gave a telephone warning 40 minutes prior to the explosion, and thus nobody was wounded. But the bomb's strength blew a 10-foot hole inside the Stock Exchange Tower, and caused massive damage to the visitors' gallery on the first floor. The bomb was placed in the men's toilets behind the gallery. The gallery and public viewing area was forced to close in 1992. Background The bombing came on the eighth anniversary of the 1983 Harrods bombing which killed three people. The IRA launched a renewed campaign in London in 1990. During May, a soldier at an army recruiting centre was killed by a bomb in Wembley, whilst five were injured in a similar explosion in Eltham. In June 1990 bombs at the Honourable Artillery Company and the Carlton Club injured 19 and 20 people respectively. Investigation and aftermath Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist chief George Churchill-Coleman said eight phone calls from the same man with an Irish accent were made between 8:02 am and 8:20 am to the City of London Police, the London Fire Brigade, Reuters, the Financial Times, the Salvation Army and the Stock Exchange itself. The Stock Exchange's chairman however said after the attack \\"If the purpose of this callous act was to bring the City to a halt, they have failed singularly.\\" The explosion had little impact on stock trading since that was being carried out by computers elsewhere.

It was officially announced on May 2, 2018, after about a week of official leaks by LG. It is the second product from LG that uses the ThinQ branding. The device serves as the successor to the 2017 LG G6.  Specifications  = Hardware = The LG G7 ThinQ utilizes a metal chassis with a glass backing, and is IP68-rated for water and dust-resistance. It is available in black, white, and silver-color finishes. The G7 features a 1440p FullVision IPS LCD display, with a diagonal size of 6.1 inches. The display uses a 19:9 aspect ratio that is taller than the 18:9 displays used by the majority of smartphones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S9. The G7 was also designed with slim bezels and a notch, similar to the iPhone X, which LG calls a \\"second screen.\\" Unlike Apple's implementation of the notch, the notch can be blacked out on the G7. The G7 utilizes the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 system-on-chip with 4 GB of RAM. It is offered with 64 GB of internal storage, expandable via SD card. It supports wireless charging, and all models will support Qualcomm Quick Charge 4. All models in all markets will include quad Digital-to-analog converters (DAC) to enhance sound output, unlike the G6, which limited the quad DAC to select Asian markets. There is a button on the side of the phone similar to Samsung's Bixby button; while it cannot be remapped, it launches Google Assistant when held, rather than a different A.I. Double tapping the button launches Google Lens. The camera is a dual setup, with a primary lens and wide-angle lens, both are 16 MP. = Software = The LG G7 ThinQ ships with Android 8.0 \\"Oreo\\" and LG's UX skin. On June 29, 2018 a software update introduced 4K video recording at 60 FPS. In January 2019, LG released an update to Android 9 \\"Pie\\" in South Korea.  Variants  = LG G7 One = The LG G7 One was released in selected markets (such as Canada) in late-2018 as part of the Android One program. It is visually identical to the G7 ThinQ, except the glass backing has a softer, frosted finish, as opposed to the polished appearance of the ThinQ. Its hardware is slightly downgraded from the G7 ThinQ, utilizing a Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip over the 845, 4 GB of RAM and 32 GB of expandable storage, a 3,000 mAh battery, and removing the second, wide-angle rear camera lens. As with all Android One phones, it uses the standard Android user interface and Google apps instead of LG UX (similarly to the former Nexus series, such as the LG-manufactured Nexus 5X); it ships with Android 8.1, and LG committed to releasing at least two major releases of Android for the device, as well as providing three years of security patch support. Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\" was released for the G7 One in November 2018, followed by Android 10 in December 2019. MobileSyrup noted some regressions over the G7 ThinQ due to the differences in hardware, especially in regards to battery life (such as the SoC downgrade resulting in a lack of Quick Charge 4+ support, and the G7 line's use of LCD over OLED as affecting its efficiency), but that the G7 One was \\"mostly fluid\\" and retained much of the ThinQ's hardware features (such as its audio support) whilst excluding LG's often-criticized user experience. Due to its positioning and launch pricing, comparisons were drawn to the OnePlus 6T, but it was argued that although the 6T had a Snapdragon 845, a larger battery and an OLED display, the G7 One did have a sharper display with HDR support, a headphone jack with a DAC, and official IP certification for waterproofing. In December 2018, the G7 One was released in Japan as the LG X5 Android One. In January 2019, it was announced for South Korea as the LG Q9 One, exclusively to LG U+ in a 64 GB model. = LG G7 Fit = The LG G7 Fit was unveiled alongside the G7 One; it is a low-end variant of the ThinQ model, utilizing a Snapdragon 821 SoC with 4 GB of RAM, and featuring a 16 megapixel camera.

She has worked in the federal public service, and has been extensively involved with land claims, First Nation self-government agreements, and Indigenous women‚Äôs rights in the territory. As the founder and former President of the Whitehorse Aboriginal Women‚Äôs Circle and as the Yukon District Director for the Public Service Commission of Canada, Webber's continued work in employment and training for First Nations people has been implemented through several women‚Äôs leadership-training courses, as well as the Northern Careers Program. Webber currently is the Administrator of Yukon Territory.  Early life  Born and raised in Whitehorse, Yukon, Adeline Webber is of Inland Tlingit ancestry. At the age of five years old, Webber was taken from her home and placed at the Whitehorse Baptism Mission School (1947-1960). Although Webber and her sister, Winnie Peterson, stayed together, the residential school system separated her family members, sending her brothers to schools in Northern Alberta and Carcross. Following seven years in residential school, Webber married her husband Bill Webber before landing her first job working in the kitchen and doing laundry in Yukon Hall, the residential school residence that later housed the Council of Yukon First Nations offices for more than ten years.  Career  Adeline Webber's career spans over 30 years lobbying for Indigenous rights in the Yukon. Webber founded the Yukon Indian Women's Association in 1974 as a means to address the inequality Indigenous women faced in the territory. Today, the Whitehorse Aboriginal Women‚Äôs Circle (WAWC) exists as \\"a forum for Aboriginal women to socialize, network, support and address issues of common interest and concern.\\" Webber later joined the Federal public service as the Yukon District Director for the Public Service Commission of Canada In this role, Webber developed the Northern Careers Program, which aimed to educate and assist all First Nations people with seeking employment opportunities in government at the federal level. This program continues to see its impact as many participants continue to work in senior government positions today. Webber also developed a Training Policy Committee and Training Trust program which set aside and distributed monies so that First Nations people could be trained. Webber's work in human resources was also realized in the form of a human resource plan for both territorial and federal governments, which was developed in consultation with the Yukon Government and First Nations. Webber was a force when it came to the implementation of land claims and First Nation self-government agreements in the territory. As a leader in the Teslin Tlingit Council community, Webber has advocated for the finalization of the Teslin Tlingit Council Final and Self-Government Agreements, falling under the negotiation framework of the Umbrella Final Agreement. Webber is an honorary lifetime member of the Skookum Jim Friendship Centre due to her contributions as a board of directors in 1989 and president for ten years. Webber continues to be an active member of her community. Today, as the Administrator of Yukon Territory, Webber acts in the place of the Commissioner of Yukon Territory if they are unable to fulfill their duties during an absence. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated of Webber on March 9, 2018: ‚ÄúAdeline Webber has dedicated much of her career to public service and has proven herself to be a champion of Indigenous Peoples. I know that the territory will benefit greatly from the experience and knowledge she will bring to the table as the Administrator of Yukon.‚Äù  Publications  The book Finding our Faces consists of over sixty pages of photos and stories documenting the residential school system in Whitehorse. Working with archivist Melissa Carlick, Webber sought funding from the Anglican Church Fund and Yukon Government to develop this record of the Whitehorse Baptist Mission School. Webber has said that this project documents \\"my history for my children and grandchildren,\\" and ultimately may be used as a resource for schools to learn of a formerly undocumented history.

On 8 May 1965 she posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.  Early life  Kislyak was born on 6 March 1925 to a Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Lednoe. After graduating from seven grades of school she studied at a medical school in Kharkiv where she trained to be an assistant to paramedics and midwives. She graduated from training the day before the German invasion of the Soviet Union.  Partisan activities  After the first time the Germans invaded her hometown, Kislyak looked after 43 wounded Red Army soldiers who were left behind in the forest. After collecting food, medicine, and supplies for them she guided them across the front lines, helping them meetup with the rest of her unit. In February 1943 the Red Army expelled German forces from the city, but the Germans retook control after launching a counterattack. During the fighting, a wounded Soviet soldier who she had been taking care of and called himself \\"Viktor from Voronez\\" asked her why the city didn't have a strong partisan movement. After Viktor recuperated Kislyak contacted several partisans hiding out in a nearby forest and asked if she could join their cause. She recruited several acquaintances into the movement and even helped kill an SS officer who had kicked an elderly man in the face, blinding him. After flirting with the SS officer she lured him to a bridge where another partisan was awaiting their arrival with a crowbar. The next day she became a suspect in the officer's disappearance; after being beaten severely and undergoing prolonged interrogation she insisted she knew nothing about his disappearance. While recovering from the torture she composed anti-axis pamphlets on her typewriter. When she received word that a Gestapo agent nicknamed \\"the Butcher\\" would be coming to Kharkiv, she and her partisan unit spent two days planning his capture. Kislyak rented a room right next to his at the farm he was staying at. After courting him for a few days she lured him to a riverbank, where her fellow partisans would be waiting nearby. After shooting a bird with his gun the partisans appeared, a struggle ensued, but he was outnumbered and captured by the partisans. After one put a bag on his head they demanded the names of Nazi collaborators and Gestapo agents before \\"sentencing\\" him to death and killing him with a crowbar. That same day more than one hundred villagers, including herself, were collectively arrested by the Gestapo and told they would be killed by a firing squad if the SS man wasn't found alive soon. But the other 97 villagers were let go after the involvement of Kislyak and two other partisans came to light. The three were interrogated and brutally tortured for two weeks straight, as the Gestapo wanted to know who the partisan leader was and didn't believe Kislyak when she said she was the leader; even under torture, she didn't tell the Germans where she stashed the documents the SS man they killed was carrying. Eventually, the trio was hanged in public on 18 June 1943 and their bodies left on display for a day. In 1965 Kislyak was declared a Hero of the Soviet Union.

He is known by his twenty-six US Patents in the fields of radar, electronics, and narrowband television. Doundoulakis is best remembered for the idea of suspending the antenna feed of the Arecibo radio telescope by cables and towers, eventually patented by his brother Helias Doundoulakis. A decorated veteran of World War II, Doundoulakis formed an underground resistance organization in Crete under the Special Operations Executive. He escaped to Egypt and joined the U.S. Army and Office of Strategic Services ‚Äì the OSS. He was sent back to Greece, where he outfitted and unified a leftist rebel army, and was awarded the Legion of Merit from the United States Army and the King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom from Great Britain. Early life George Doundoulakis was born in Detroit, Michigan to Greek- immigrant parents, Demetrios and Evanthia (n√©e Psaroudakis) Doundoulakis. When he was four-years-old, his family immigrated to Crete, Greece to look after their blind grandmother in the village of Archanes. Nearby was the Minoan excavations at Knossos, where British archaeologist ‚Äì later, SOE agent ‚Äì John Pendlebury had been the curator. By 1941, Greece had fallen to the Axis powers except Crete. On May 20, 1941, German paratroopers invaded the island, known as the Battle of Crete. World War II =Battle of Crete and the Cretan Resistance= During the Battle of Crete, Doundoulakis assisted the Greek and British army headquarters in Archanes, translating communiqu√©s from other military posts. After the British had been defeated, those soldiers who could not be evacuated either surrendered or went into hiding. =Special Operations Executive ‚Äì (SOE)= Montague Woodhouse was appointed SOE chief on Crete, replacing John Pendlebury who had been executed by the Germans during the battle. Woodhouse approached Doundoulakis after spotting his savoir-faire as the Greek interpreter in Archanes. He requested that Doundoulakis support the SOE in hiding and evacuating British soldiers who had been left behind on Crete, with full knowledge that his efforts were punishable by death. Undaunted, Doundoulakis formed an underground organization under the command of the SOE's \\"Monty\\" Woodhouse. This would become one of the first Cretan resistance groups. Along with his brother Helias Doundoulakis and friends, they began scouring the island for recruits. Gathering momentum, Doundoulakis rounded up ex-military personnel and civilians from Heraklion and Lasithi. After Woodhouse left Crete, the SOE replaced him with \\"Tom\\" Dunbabin. Risky sabotages under his watch were performed, such as the destruction of the Kastelli Airfield. Along with friend Kimon Zografakis and two British commandos, Doundoulakis was able to set the airfield on fire after they placed explosives on seven German airplanes and hundreds of barrels of aviation fuel. Informants also uncovered German naval intelligence through a paramour of a German officer. After being relayed to Dunbabin, it resulted in the destruction of a German convoy destined to resupply Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps in September 1942. After the war, Doundoulakis was awarded the King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom from Great Britain for his services. Thomas Dunbabin was awarded the Distinguished Service Order by the British military.Ogden, Alan. Sons of Odysseus: SOE Heroes in Greece, Ch. 19, Bene Factum Publishing Ltd, 2013 Dunbabin finally left, and the SOE followed him up with the legendary Patrick Leigh Fermor, known to the Cretans as \\"Mihalis.\\" George's intelligence circle grew exponentially. George and Leigh Fermor, along with guerrilla leader Manolis Bandouvas, would take refuge within the mountainous SOE hideouts of Mount Ida. George Doundoulakis with Patrick Leigh Fermor in Crete, 1943. Courtesy of the National Hellenic Museum, Chicago. After serving under the SOE for two years, Doundoulakis' ever-widening organization became apparent. He was blackmailed by a local Cretan who demanded one million drachmas as hush money. Otherwise, his organization and the SOE's Leigh Fermor would be let known to the Germans. Refusing the blackmail, Doundoulakis sent high school friends Sifis Migadis and John Androulakis to dispose of the traitor. However, they were too late in stopping the betrayal to the Gestapo. Leigh Fermor urged Doundoulakis to take flight at once to Crete's southern shore, and await evacuation by the SOE. They escaped through Mount Ida and the mountain ranges of Rethymno with others in his organization. After hiding in caves for a month, they were rescued by a British torpedo boat south of Tymbaki. Along with thirteen other resistance members, they headed to Mersa Matruh, Egypt. As they were about to board, Doundoulakis reunited with Leigh Fermor and partisan leader Petrakogiorgis. Petrakogiorgis had returned to Crete on the same vessel carrying the Doundoulakis brothers to Egypt on June 7, 1943. They would not see Leigh Fermor for another forty years. Leigh Fermor and \\"Billy\\" Stanley Moss became renowned after the war in the British book and film, Ill Met by Moonlight, for their abduction of German General Kreipe from Crete. After reaching Mersa Matruh, Doundoulakis and his brother, as well as his close circle of friends, were transported to an SOE villa in Heliopolis. They were destined for SOE saboteur training upon the entreaty of Leigh Fermor, while the other escapees went off to the exiled Greek Army in the Middle East. Before leaving Crete, Doundoulakis instructed Mikis Akoumianakis to assume command of the organization that he had begun. Mikis Akoumianakis \\"took over the Allied intelligence network in Heraklion and became the key British agent in the region for the last three years of the war.\\" Later, along with Leigh Fermor and \\"Billy\\" Moss, he would become a key player in the kidnap of General Kreipe from Crete. =Office of Strategic Services ‚Äì (OSS)= Two months of training at the lavish SOE villa in Heliopolis, Cairo, came to an abrupt end when Doundoulakis learned of the Office of Strategic Services, the OSS. Doundoulakis contacted the fledgling American spy service that would become a key player in the Doundoulakis brothers' future. With help from Leigh Fermor, he informed the SOE commander of his intentions to join the American Army. Much to the SOE's dismay, George and Helias ultimately departed as comrade-in- arms and with hopes of defeating their common enemy. George and Helias Doundoulakis in OSS-Cairo's Spy School, 1945. Courtesy of the National Hellenic Museum, Chicago. The OSS dispatched Captain James Kellis to enlist the Doundoulakis brothers into the US Army on September 16, 1943, and were assigned to the OSS. Their Commanding Officer was Major John Vassos, RCA's eminent industrial designer. Agents were trained inside a secluded palace of King Farouk's situated along Cairo's Nile River, known as Ras el Kanayas. Doundoulakis was trained in the Morale Operations (MO) and Special Operations (SO) branches. Special Operations was modeled after the SOE, which included parachute, sabotage, defensive, weapons, and leadership training to support guerrilla or partisan resistance. Morale Operations training included psychological warfare and propaganda. After his training, Doundoulakis was sent to the port city of Volos, Greece in Thessaly. His mission, known as \\"Horsebreeders,\\" was to coordinate some 7,000 Greek leftist rebels into a unified fighting force. Doundoulakis provided the necessary logistic sustainment that included weapons, a printing press, clothing, and materials for his secret army through OSS bases in Turkey. He had printed and distributed leaflets intended for German soldiers and Greek collaborators, to subvert their confidence while encouraging the Greek population to resist. They were able to inflict enough damage to Volos' railroad transportation hub and its maritime shipping, that it contributed to the demise of the German supply line near Athens. The Germans were unable to remove Doundoulakis and the leftist rebels hidden in the impassable Pelion Mountains. Unrelenting attacks upon German communications and railway links led to an overwhelming success. Doundoulakis was promoted to first sergeant and awarded the Legion of Merit in OSS-Cairo. His brother, Helias Doundoulakis, was trained at Cairo's Camp X-type 'Spy School' where he was sent on a mission to Salonica, Greece. There, Helias set up a fake business from a bombed-out factory once owned by Greek Jews who had fled from Nazi persecution. He remained embedded in Salonica from April to December 1944, sending encrypted radio messages to OSS- Cairo on German troop movements. Post war George Doundoulakis spent the remainder of his enlistment at the Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, MD, which had been commandeered by \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan's OSS as a training ground known by its codename \\"Area F\\". Following his discharge, Doundoulakis settled in Brooklyn, NY. =Education= After settling in Brooklyn, New York, Doundoulakis received a bachelor's degree in physics from Brooklyn Polytechnic in 1953 under the GI Bill. He went on to earn his master's of science in physics at Brooklyn Polytechnic under renowned physicist and X-ray crystallographer, Paul Peter Ewald in 1955. =RCA Institutes= After receiving his master's of physics from Brooklyn Polytechnic, Doundoulakis found his metier in electronics, radio physics and the advancing field of radar and television. Tutored by Ira Kamen, one of the preeminent electrical engineers in New York City at the RCA Institutes, Doundoulakis gained a solid foothold in the field. Subsequently, he taught electronics at the RCA Institutes. In 1956, Doundoulakis and Ira Kamen filed their first US patent. =General Bronze Corporation= Seeing the potential of this rising star in a rapidly developing field, Doundoulakis was hired by General Bronze Corporation in Garden City, New York as head of Research and Development (R&D;). At the time, General Bronze was dedicated to pioneering and taking the lead in the commercial market of antenna designs. Along with Stanley Gethin, he copyrighted antenna and radar-related projects for General Bronze. =Arecibo Radio Telescope= As the head of Research and Development for General Bronze, Doundoulakis was notified by Cornell University of their intent to build a radio telescope. Subsequently, he was invited to Cornell the day the project for the design and construction of the antenna at Arecibo, Puerto Rico was announced, by Professor William Gordon. Gordon, who led the project for Cornell, indicated at that time that the support for the antenna feed ‚Äì or \\"eye\\" ‚Äì was envisioned to be a 500-foot tower situated in the center of the 1000 ft. reflector. Doundoulakis, foreseeing a simpler approach with a suspended antenna feed, leapt at the opportunity. Along with Zachary Sears ‚Äì who directed Internal Design at Digital B & E Corporation of New York ‚Äì he received the request for proposal (RFP) from Cornell University for the antenna design. He studied the idea of suspending the antenna feed with his brother, Helias Doundoulakis, a civil engineer who was then working for Emery Roth. Doundoulakis identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, which is the most critical portion of the reflector. Instead, Doundoulakis' proposal of a revolutionary design, by suspending the feed from cables connected to towers, was more practical. Rather than having a massive tower in the center of the reflector, his design would save millions in construction costs. Arecibo Observatory and its suspension system from concrete towers. Courtesy of the Arecibo Observatory, a facility of the National Science Foundation. He presented his proposal to Cornell University for a suspension system of the feed. This suspension system would possess a doughnut or torus-type truss suspended by four cables from four towers, to provide along its edge a rail track intended for azimuthal positioning of the feed. A second truss in the form of an arch was to hang below and rotate on said rails through 360 degrees. The arch also provided rails onto which the unit supporting the feed would move to provide for the elevational positioning of the feed. A counter-weight would move symmetrically opposite to the feed position for overall stability. George informed his brother, Helias Doundoulakis, to design the cable suspension system which was finally adopted for the Arecibo Antenna. A patent was filed on September 11, 1961, by Helias Doundoulakis for \\"A radio telescope having a scanning feed supported by a cable suspension over a stationary reflector\\" who designed the suspension system according to George's specifications. Although the present configuration of the Arecibo Antenna is identical to the original drawings by George and Helias Doundoulakis (except with three towers, instead of the four towers drawn in Doundoulakis' patent ), the United States Patent and Trademark Office finally granted Helias Doundoulakis a U.S. Patent on September 13, 1966 ‚Äì for designing the radio telescope's suspension system. Two other assignees on the patent were close friends William J. Casey, ex-director of the CIA under President Reagan, and attorney Constantine Michalos. =Advancement Devices and William J. Casey= Doundoulakis and his trirotor engine model. Courtesy of the National Hellenic Museum, Chicago. In the 1950s, Doundoulakis began his own company dedicated to pursuing his patent designs and applying them to the market. Advancement Devices was launched, under which William J. Casey first heard of the inventor. In WWII, Casey had been chief of the OSS' Secret Intelligence branch for Europe. He learned that Doundoulakis also served in the OSS, and had secured a contract from the \\"Army Signal Corps to produce a radar that could measure the trajectory of a mortar shell. But he lacked the capital to follow through on his bid.\\" Following this lead, Casey ensured that all the necessary funding would accompany Doundoulakis' future projects. Under Advancement Devices, and with contributions from Casey, Doundoulakis developed a stream of patents for electronics, television, and internal ballistic engines. One patent, the tri-rotor engine, became a matter of contention with the IRS in back taxes owed by Casey to the IRS. Nonetheless, the Doundoulakis/Casey business partnership would beget a life- long friendship from, \\"the inventor who he had long subsidized.\\" Their bond was not only grounded in their prior service with the OSS but in an alliance that continued throughout Casey's Congressional hearings prior to his SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) post. Doundoulakis was called to testify before the United States Congress on Casey's behalf. He eventually was sworn in and became head of the Securities and Exchange Commission under President Nixon. Afterward, under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, Casey was appointed the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Personal George married Chrysanthe \\"Chris\\" (Markomihalakis) in Brooklyn, New York, where they settled after the war, resettling in North Bellmore, New York. They had two sons and one daughter, and three grandchildren. During the 1980s, Leigh Fermor visited and stayed with George at his North Bellmore home. Leigh Fermor visited him during one of the many celebrations for the Battle of Crete and the abduction of Gen. Kreipe, punctuating a friendship which had endured throughout both their lives. Death and Funeral George Doundoulakis died on March 17, 2007, and was buried with military honors in Greenfield Cemetery, Uniondale, New York.

Written by Lali, A.CHAL, Feid, Stiven Rojas, Rolo, Mosty, Nano Novello, Luis Burgio, Peter Akselrad, Kevin Mauricio Jim√©nez, Bryan Snaider Lezcano, Jowan Espinosa, Juan Pablo Piedrahita and Daniel Giraldo, and produced by 3musica and Icon Music, it was released by Sony Music Argentina as the album's third single on April 13, 2018. The song became the Esp√≥sito's third No. 1 hit on the Argentina Lista 40 followed by \\"Besarte Mucho\\" which was her fourth number 1 in the chart. Background and composition \\"100 Grados\\" is a Latin, urban pop song with EDM beats. It was first proposed by Icon Music, who recorded a demo for the song. They travelled to Buenos Aires to work with 3musica, who changed the chorus and re-made it at the compositional level. Together, they modified some aspects on the creative process to achieve its final sound. It was written by Feid, Rolo, Mosty, and Jowan from Icon Music, Nano Novello, Luis Burgio, Peter Akselrad from 3musica, Kevin Mauricio Jim√©nez, Bryan Snaider Lezcano, Juan Pablo Piedrahita, Daniel Giraldo, Lali, A.CHAL and Stiven Rojas. The song title is mentioned only once throughout the whole song. According to Lali, it \\"summarizes the topic [and] represents what happens to a couple when they get to see each other after a long time.\\" Critical reception Diario26.com staff wrote that \\"Lali puts herself in the focus of a mature and infectious composition, different from the traditional formulas and imposing her personal impront.\\" In Diario Show, it was written that in the \\"relentless future hit, Lali and A.CHAL achieve a perfect connection in which the beats are the perfect excuse for a spicy dialogue.\\" American blogger Perez Hilton described the song as \\"a sweet midtempo love song.\\" =Accolades= The song won in the category of Favorite Song at the Kids' Choice Awards Argentina of 2018. Music video Directed by Ariel Winograd and Diego Berakha, the accompanying \\"cinematographic\\" music video for the single made its premiere on Vevo at midnight ART on April 13, 2018. Lali and Winograd had previously worked together on the film That's Not Cheating, in which Lali starred and which Winograd directed. The clip was shot with \\"great technichal accuracy\\" and shows multiples versions of Lali and A.CHAL, who appear and vanish at the rhythm of the beats, \\"creating a fresh, unique experience.\\" By generating an \\"oneiric and full of cadences atmosphere\\", the directors succeed at representing the essence of the song. Live performances The first televised live performance of the song took place on June 3 at the 2018 Martin Fierro Awards. Esp√≥sito performed the song as well as her previous singles \\"Tu Novia\\" and \\"Una Na\\". It was the first ever musical performance in the history of the awards, which award the best in television and radio. Wearing a black leathered bodysuit and boots, Esp√≥sito performed the songs at the Alvear Icon Hotel's terrace in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires. At the end of the performance, Esp√≥sito lifted up a green handkerchief, sign of the pro-abortion movement in Argentina. On July, Esp√≥sito performed the song on the American TV shows ¬°Despierta Am√©rica! and Viva el Mundial y M√°s alongside A.CHAL. On September 5, 2018, Lali performed the song with Anitta at Talento FOX, where they also performed Anitta's song \\"Downtown\\".

Karmsund folkemuseum. Retrieved 2 May 2018 Together with Bertha Torgersen, she founded the shipping company Brummen√¶s & Torgersen in 1909 and with this became the first female shipowners in Norway.  Brummen√¶s & Torgersen  Hanna Brummen√¶s and Bertha Torgersen met each other at Visnes in Karm√∏y as employees of a shop in the mining community there. They had their own shop for a while, but they ended this business. Around 1900 they moved together to Haugesund and began to take an interest in shipping. They invested in shipping stocks, and made enough money to buy a herring steamer in 1909. The boat was called \\"D / S Gouval\\" and they purchased it at an auction. They bought four ships of between 1350 d.w.t. and 3200 d.w.t., three of the ships were built in the 1800s and the latter in 1904. The common denominator that they were mostly in poor condition and slow, causing them to lose all their ships during World War I, except for \\"Gouval\\", which sank before the war. After the war, the ship industry in the city was in poor shape. Brummen√¶s & Torgersen had paid very little for their five ships and ran the shipping company very responsibly, so they went with a huge profit when the war damage claims were paid. Between 1921 and 1927 they bought five old ships, and in 1929 they bought a motor ship. This was \\"Equatore\\" which was in very poor condition and eventually became a grain store on land. Before World War II, they bought several old steamers. During the war, all their ships were sunk or lost. Brummen√¶s died in 1942. When Torgersen died in 1954, about 6 million kroner remained in the estate. Torgensen had the financial responsibility over the company and it was discovered that there was still money left from the war damage claims after World War I.  Other  Brummen√¶s and Torgensen were what was called \\"mannedamene\\", because they dressed in men's clothing and operated in a male-dominated industry. She wore pants and must have signed with \\"Mr.\\". Brummen√¶s spent ten years in the City Council for H√∏yre, the Conservative Party.

Retrieved May 3rd, 2018. = Research on auctions= One major area of Moldovanu's research concerns auction theory, in particular the optimal design of auctions if participation in it subjects (some) participants to externalities. For example, in a study of economic interactions under identity-dependent, asymmetric negative externalities with Philippe Jehiel, Moldovanu finds that some agents' best strategy is to not participate in the market in order to minimize externalities, which may e.g. explain certain features of preemptive patenting.Jehiel, P., Moldovanu, B. (1996). Strategic nonparticipation. RAND Journal of Economics, 27(1), pp. 84‚Äì98.Jehiel, P., Moldovanu, B. (2000). Auctions with downstream interaction among buyers. RAND Journal of Economics, 31(4), pp. 768‚Äì791. Similarly, Moldovanu, Jehiel and Ennio Stacchetti find that for such economic transactions, e.g. the sale of nuclear weapon, the outside options and participations constraints in a revenue-maximizing auction are endogenous, surplus can be extracted from non- acquiring participants, and the seller may be better off by not selling at all (while obtaining some payments) if externalities are much larger than valuations.Jehiel, P., Moldovanu, B., Stacchetti, E. (1996). How (not) to sell nuclear weapons. American Economic Review, 86(4), pp. 814‚Äì829. Later, Moldovanu, Jehiel and Stacchetti have provided a general theory for the design of incentive compatible mechanisms in auctions with buyer-specific externalities.Jehiel, P., Moldovanu, B., Stacchetti, E. (1999). Multidimensional mechanism design for auctions with externalities. Journal of Economic Theory, 85(2), pp. 258‚Äì293. Moreover, Moldovanu and Jehiel have shown that multi-object auctions cannot be reduced to one-dimensional models without loss of generality because, in the presence of informational and allocative externalities, Bayes-Nash incentive compatible mechanisms exist only if private and social rates of information substitution are congruent, which in turn depends on whether signals are mono- or multi-dimensional.Jehiel, P., Moldovanu, B. (2001). Efficient design with interdependent valuations. Econometrica, 69(5), pp. 1237‚Äì1259. Finally, together with Jehiel, Moritz Meyer-ter-Vehn and William R. Zame, Moldovanu has explored the limits of ex post implementation, which requires each agents' strategy to be optimal for every possible realization of other agents' types.Jehiel, P. et al. (2006). The limits of ex post implementation. Econometrica, 74(3), pp. 585‚Äì610. = Research on contests and matching= Another major area of Moldovanu's research regards the design of contests and assortative matching. Studying the optimal allocation of prizes in contests with multiple, nonidentical prizes, private information about participants' cost of effort and prize allocation based on effort together with Aner Sela, Moldovanu finds that the allocation of the prize sum which maximizes expected total effort depends on participants' cost functions: if they are convex, several positive prizes may be optimal, otherwise allocating the entire prize sum to a single \\"first\\" prize is optimal.Moldovanu, B., Sela, A. (2001). The optimal allocation of prizes in contests. American Economic Review, 91(3), pp. 542‚Äì558. In another study with Sela on the architecture of contests, Moldovanu shows that the optimal split of contest participants among tournament-style sub-contests depends on the type of effort maximized and (again) on participants' effort cost functions: if they are linear, then expected total effort is maximized through a single static contest and expected highest effort is maximized through a two-stage contest with two sub-contests (assuming sufficient participants); but if they are convex, effort may be maximized through several sub-contests or the award of prizes to all finalists.Moldovanu, B., Sela, A. (2006). Contest architecture. Journal of Economic Theory, 126(1), pp. 70‚Äì96. If, however, contestants care about their relative positioning into status strata, Moldovanu, Sela and Xianwen Shi find that the optimal partition in status categories depends on the distribution of ability among contests, though the top status category always only contains a single winner; in particular, assuming a concave distribution, a partition with only two strata would already be optimal.Moldovanu, B., Sela, A., Shi, X. (2007). Contests for status. Journal of Political Economy, 115(2), pp. 338‚Äì363. Finally, together with Sela and Heidrun Hoppe, Moldovanu has explored the assortative matching of a finite number of agents in two-sided markets under incomplete information on the basis of costly signals.Hoppe, H.C., Moldovanu, B., Sela, A. (2009). The theory of assortative matching based on costly signals. Review of Economic Studies, 76(1), pp. 253‚Äì281.  Selected publications * Gershkov, A., Moldovanu, A. (2014).

It usually has a single more or less round leaf and a flowering spike with up to seven reddish flowers with a shelf-like labellum. Description Cyrtostylis robusta is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single heart-shaped, kidney- shaped or almost round leaf long and wide. The leaf is light to medium green on the upper surface and silvery on the lower side. Between two and seven pinkish red flowers long and about wide are borne on a flowering stem high. The pedicel is long with a bract at its base. The dorsal sepal is erect and curved forward, linear but tapered, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are linear, long, wide and curve forwards or downwards. The petals are similar in size and shape to the lateral sepals and curve forwards or slightly downwards. The labellum is oblong, long and wide and slopes slightly downwards with a few serrations near its pointed tip. Flowering occurs from May to October. This species is similar to C. huegelii in Western Australia but usually has fewer, more brightly-coloured flowers with a wider labellum. In South Australia is can be distinguished from the similar C. reniformis which has more heavily veined leaves and are green on the lower side. Taxonomy and naming Cyrtostylis robusta was first formally described in 1987 by David Jones and Mark Clements. The description was published in the journal Lindleyana from a specimen collected near Jerramungup. The specific epithet (robusta) is a Latin word meaning \\"oaken\\" or \\"strong like oak\\". Distribution and habitat The large gnat orchid occurs in southern Victoria where it grows in coastal scrub and forest. It is found in south-eastern South Australia including Kangaroo Island and in Tasmania. It is most common and widespread in the south-west of Western Australia where it grows in near-coastal shrubland, woodland and forest between Perth and Israelite Bay. Conservation Cyrtostylis robusta is listed as \\"rare\\" in Tasmania under the Threatened Species Protection Act 1995.

Personal life Van Kinckel Who used the Dutch version of his name in correspondence, though he mainly wrote in French was born the fifth son of August Wolfgang K√ºnckelin, an official of the Duchy of Cleves, and Rosina Elisabetha Pancug (the daughter of a burgomaster of Heilbronn). The father was ennobled in 1752, as Freiherr von Kinckel, and this became the name under which van Kinckel was later known. He married baroness Elisabeth Charlotte Henriette Catherine von Botzheim in Wachenheim an der Pfrimm on 23 September 1789. The marriage remained childless.Van der Horst, pp. 167-168, 174 Career =Navy= Van Kinckel entered the service of the Admiralty of Zeeland as a sub-lieutenant (without first having been an adelborst Cadet or midshipman.) in 1764. He was probably sponsored by Johan Adriaan van de Perre, the representative of the First NobleThe States of Zeeland were the only provincial States in which the stadtholder, in his capacity of Marquis of Veere and Vlissingen, had a vote, as the so-called \\"First Noble\\" of Zeeland (he was supposed to represent the other Zeeland nobles). He usually exercised this right through a representative. in the States of Zeeland, and also a member of the Zeeland Admiralty Board, whose prot√©g√© he would be for many years.Van der Horst, p. 168 His first voyage was on the frigate St. Maartensdijk (24) under captain Cornelis Vis, that left Vlissingen on 27 August 1764 for a cruise against the Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean Sea. After this first voyage he served on De Jonge Prins van Oranje for a number of voyages, in 1765 under captain de Kruijne,Against whom van Kinckel and other officers lodged a complaint after the return of the ship, though the affair came to nothing. and later (between 1767 and 1770) four voyages under captain Hendrik Bernard Lodewijk van Bylandt.Who managed to hit a sandbank in 1769, but was exonerated thanks to favorable testimony from van Kinckel. Van Kinckel had been promoted to lieutenant in 1766, after he passed his lieutenant's exam in September.Van der Horst, p. 169 In 1771 the Dutch navy mounted a larger expedition to the Mediterranean, involving several ships of the line. Zeeland contributed the Zierikzee (captain Nebbens), and van Kinckel became its second lieutenant, charged with keeping the ship's journal. Soon after its departure, according to the journal, the ship's crew experienced health problems, many getting sick and dying, probably because of scurvy. This necessitated several lengthy visits to ports on its route, causing the Zierikzee to miss most of the cruise of the squadron (which was commanded by captain van Goor Hinloopen). Eventually, the ship would also lose captain Nebbens, who died of a stroke while on a shore excursion with van Goor Hinloopen near Livorno. After the ship's return under the second captain, Bonifacius Cau, in 1772, van Kinckel was promoted to commander, but for the next three years he did not have another ship. Only in 1775 did he receive a posting on the frigate Walcheren (captain Bonifacius Cau) for a cruise to again the Mediterranean. He returned home in November 1776, and asked his mentor van de Perre to obtain a promotion to captain for him. He was promoted to extraordinary captain on 11 November 1777.Van der Horst, pp. 169-170 Instead of immediately getting a Dutch command, van Kinckel made a curious excursion to the British Royal Navy during the American Revolutionary War in 1778, where he served under Admiral Keppel against the French on HMS Victory, which provided him with combat experience.Van der Aa; this biographer gives no source, and does not mention whether van Kinckel was present at Ushant. However, in an autobiographical note to the Duke of Portland, van Kinckel himself appears to suggest that he did; Cf. Bakhuizen, p. 76 In June 1779 van Kinckel got his first command, as captain of the ship of the line Zuid Beveland (60). His first problem was to find a crew, as manning a ship was the captain's responsibility. As the Dutch navy at the time had a bad reputation as an employer, it was almost impossible to recruit Dutchmen. Van Kinckel therefore decided to set up four recruiting centers around his native Heilbronn, managed by his brothers. They recruited 250 Germans for the crew that eventually would number 472 men (two-thirds of whom Germans).Van der Hoop, pp. 171-172 This experience motivated van Kinckel to write a report for the stadtholder, who was also Admiral-General of the Dutch Navy, in which he proposed to put the personnel policy of the navy on a new footing. Up to then the five Dutch admiralties had been responsible for manning and victualing their respective fleets, but in his report, entitled Un proj√®t pour la lev√©e d'un certain nombre d'hommes pour la service de la marine de la RepubliqueA project for the raising of a certain number of men for the service of the navy of the Republic. Though both could write and speak Dutch, van Kinckel used French in his correspondence with the stadtholder. (1779), he proposed that there would be organised a corps de marine, especially consisting of specialists like gunners and non-commissioned officers, who were otherwise difficult to recruit or retain, and would function directly under the Admiral-General. He wrote a more detailed proposal along these lines in 1780 with the title Consid√©rations sur la necessit√© et sur I'utilit√© d'un corps de mariniers pour la service de la Republique.Considerations about the necessity and the utility of a corps of mariners (not: marines) for the service of the Republic. The innovation here was that the corps would be organised on the level of the Generality, above the level of the five regional Admiralties. This brought him to attention of the stadtholder, with whom he discussed the proposal for the first time in the Spring of 1781. On 17 April 1781 the plan was formally approved by six of the seven provinces in the States General of the Netherlands, but Zeeland vetoed it \\"for lack of money.\\" In 1782 the stadtholder appointed van Kinckel as one of the two Adjutants of the \\"corps de marine\\" he had proposedThough only after a conflict with his rival Lodewijk van Bylandt, who was originally appointed in the post. Van Kinckel made an appeal to his higher seniority. Also, the fact that van Bylandt was embroiled in the Brest Affair may have rendered him less suitable at the time. The appointment was only nominal, as the corps itself was not founded before 1792.Van der Horst, p. 171, 175Van Kinckel also proposed a number of other reforms in a memorandum to the Admiral General in 1781, that would go nowhere at this time, but would eventually be realized in the naval reforms of the Batavian Navy under the Batavian Republic, such as appointment of a constructor-general to coordinate naval construction; the founding of a \\"widows and orphans fund\\" for the navy; the creation of a budget for the navy within the War Budget of the Republic (up to then the navy was financed exclusively by the five admiralties); and the centralization of the education of naval officers, including limitation of the recruitment of future naval officers (the adelborsten) to people of noble birth. Finally, he helped introduce the Carronade in the Dutch navy in 1780.Cf. Van der Horst, pp. 175-176 The Zuid Beveland was mainly employed to protect the Zeeland coastal waters in the first days of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War that started in December 1780. The ship was intended to join the squadron of rear-admiral Johan Zoutman before it fought the Battle of Doggerbank in August 1781, but the usual \\"adverse winds\\" had prevented it from getting out to sea. Van Kinckel therefore did not share in the glory.Van Kinckel may not have been completely devastated by missing a chance to engage the British, as witnessed by a letter he wrote to the Duke of Portland in April 1795, in which he states: \\"I would have liked to be able to put a veil over an event that took place soon after, the war between England and the Republic. Though I did my duty as an officer, I do not hide that I felt an extreme repugnance to taking part in this fight against (my) nature; a sentiment that I by the way shared with the entire Dutch navy.\\"; Cf. Bakhuizen, p. 76 However, the ship later captured two English ships and van Kinckel shared in the prize money.Van der Horst, p.173 After peace had been concluded in 1784 van Kinckel asked to be promoted to ordinary captain, which request was granted on 26 September 1784. But van Kinckel did not receive a new command. Instead he was given a diplomatic assignment to the Electorate of Bavaria, where he was to report on the developments around the intrigues of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibr√ºcken to exchange Bavaria for the Austrian NetherlandsVan der Horst, pp. 173-174 But van Kinckel in this period embarked on another career, that is only cursorily touched upon in his official biographies. Van Kinckel was clearly a partisan on the Orangist side in the political upheavals of the Patriottentijd in the Dutch Republic. In the period 1785-1787 the opponents of the stadtholder, William V, Prince of Orange, gained more and more influence. The British envoy to The Hague, Sir James Harris saw in this the perfidious hand of the French, and he made it his life's work to reclaim the influence of Great Britain on the Republic, by hook and by crook. One of his first actions was to lure the province of Zeeland away from the other provinces in the Spring of 1786 (a rather harebrained project to have Zeeland secede from the Union of Utrecht). The bait was a promise to save the Zeeland Chamber of the VOC from impending bankruptcy by providing a British loan for that purpose to the States of Zeeland. For the negotiations about this project Harris used van Kinckel as his political emissary, with whom Harris had established a relationship in October 1785, according to a letter from Harris to the British Foreign Secretary Carmarthen. From this moment on, van Kinckel was one of Harris' most trusted confidential agents. In May 1786 van Kinckel wrote a memo for Harris pointing out that instead of a real secession, the threat of it would be more useful to put pressure on the Patriots in the States of Holland. Van Kinckel used his Zeeland contacts to bring Harris in contact with the Zeeland Grand Pensionary Laurens Pieter van de Spiegel shortly thereafter.Van Kinckel writes in his autobiographical note that before that he himself had been sent by van de Spiegel on two diplomatic missions to London. Cf. Bakhuizen, pp. 76-77 Harris managed to convince Van de Spiegel to become his main agent of influence in the Republic.Cobban, pp. 81-83 From this time on, van Kinckel assisted Harris in his projects, like the attempt to \\"flip\\" the States of Friesland to the Orangist side, by offering bribes to the grietmannen;The States of Friesland had been \\"anti-stadtholder\\" in 1784, when the scandal of the Acte van Consulentschap broke, but Harris proposed to bring a different majority about, by manipulating the system of grietenijen (comparable to the Rotten and pocket boroughs Harris was familiar with in England). The grietman needed a certain acreage of land, but would mortgage it immediately, as he only needed the votes. These mortgage loans were usually provided by wealthy Frisian Mennonites, who were very anti-Orangist, and therefore directed the grietmannen to vote against the Orangists. So Harris proposed that the British government would buy mortgages to the amount of 2 million guilders. But the approval by the Cabinet came too late, as the election of February 1787 had already taken place, and the Orangists had already lost. The scheme was therefore not implemented. But the States of Friesland later split into two rival versions (like the States of Utrecht) one in Franeker and the other in Leeuwarden, and the \\"Leeuwarden\\" States were seated in the States General, giving a majority there to the Orangists; Cf. Cobban, pp. 88-89 and an attempt to sabotage the mission of the French diplomat Joseph Matthias G√©rard de Rayneval to mediate between the warring Dutch factions in early 1787. In that context van Kinckel provided useful counter-intelligence on the French agitators in Amsterdam, that had established a kind of \\"parallel\\" French legation there.Cobban, pp. 88-90, 103, 105, 118, 123 Van Kinckel accompanied Harris on his secret visit to the British Cabinet at the end of May 1787, in which Harris managed to convince his superiors to go all out on a campaign of subversion in the Republic. For this he obtained a large secret fund, hat would be used to suborn Dutch States Army regiments that had been loyal to the States of Holland, after those withdrew those troops from the command of the stadtholder in 1786.Cobban, pp. 130-131 When a month later the wife of the Stadtholder, Princess Wilhelmina, was detained by a Patriot Free Corps patrol at Goejanverwellesluis, Harris dispatched van Kinckel post-haste from The Hague, to prevent her capture by the die-hard Patriots in Utrecht under the Rhinegrave of Salm, who might have held her as a hostage.Cobban, p. 150; Van der Aa Finally, van Kinckel played an important \\"bit part\\" in the conclusion of the Anglo-Prussian Treaty of Alliance in June 1788 at Het Loo Palace. King Frederick William II of Prussia was visiting his sister at this palace, when he was \\"waylaid\\" by Harris with the project of the treaty. The king did not have his usual advisers with him, except Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein, who might have advised him against the treaty. But van Kinckel bribed the king's valet de chambre to deny Stein access to the king.Cobban, pp. 205-206 On 16 July 1787 (so while the crisis of the Prussian invasion of Holland was still unfolding), van Kinckel got his next command of a ship: the frigate Tholen (49). But he did not succeed in gathering a crew for this ship, so he had to relinquish this command to another captain. On 9 November 1788 van Kinckel was promoted to rear-admiral of the Zeeland Admiralty. When Vice-Admiral Cornelis Vis died in 1789 van Kinckel asked for his post, and a promotion to Vice-Admiral. But the Admiral-General wanted the advice of the successor of van de Perre in the Zeeland Admiralty Board, and that functionary apparently gave a negative advice, because the promotion was not given. Van Kinckel then left active service and married the baroness von Botzheim.Van der Horst, p. 174 =Diplomacy= Van Kinckel then entered diplomatic service. His first posting was as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the Elector of Bavaria in 1789. He remained here until the Batavian Revolution of 1795. After the War of the First Coalition broke out in 1792, in which the Republic, together with Prussia and Great Britain was part of a coalition of European powers that fought against the French First Republic, van Kinckel attached himself to the campaign headquarters of the Prussian king, again with Harris, who had become the Earl of Malmesbury, but also Sir James Pulteney, Lord Elgin, and the Marquess of Hertford, who were subsequently his colleagues at this mobile court.Bakhuizen, p. 78 In 1795 he was dismissed from the naval service, like all other naval officers, by the new regime, and declined to join the Batavian Navy. Instead he again went into British service. He traveled with Lord Malmesbury to England. After his arrival he attempted to attach himself to the court of the exiled stadtholder, but he was told that there was not enough money to take him aboard. Fortunately, he obtained a pension of ¬£500 annually from the British.Bakhuizen, pp. 78-79 After a whileDuring his stay he apparently started an extramarital affair with one Louise Stuart, a \\"piquante brunette\\". That ended abruptly after the lady applied the epithet insipidement blond (insipid blond) to him after a lover's quarrel. After that the tone of their correspondence changed appreciably, reflecting the hurt feelings of the baron. Cf. Bakhuizen, p. 79 he went back to the Continent, becoming a liaison-officer between the Royal Navy, and the Orangists in Germany, who plotted a return of the stadtholder. He gathered intelligence for both the stadtholder in England, and his son Prince Frederick of Orange-Nassau in Prussia. At this time he bought the house in Mannheim where he would live till his death.Van der Horst, p. 177 From van Kinckel's correspondence it becomes clear that he was very opposed to the Democratic developments of the time in the Batavian Republic and revolutionary France. With ex-stadtholder William V he deplored the \\"... malheur de la R√©volution fran√ßaise.\\" And he stated in another letter \\"je n'ai plus un brin de Patriotisme\\" (I don't have a bit of Patriotism left). His ideological conviction made him apply for a position in the Russian navy around the time of the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799, in which he had hoped to take a part.He had accompanied Lord Grenville on his reconnaissance of the Batavian Republic, that preceded this invasion. Cf. Bakhuizen, p. 79 But his motivation was also: \\"'Les serviles raisons qui pourroit me motiver d'entrer au service de la Russie durant la guerre actuelle servit celle ambition pour me faire connaitre et tacher d'acquerir une reputation ... au service de sa majest√© l'imperatrice de toutes les Russies.\\".The servile reasons that could motivate me to enter the service of Russia during the present war served that ambition to make myself known and to try to acquire a reputation ... at the service of her majesty the Empress of all the Russias. In any case, the appointment did not come through.Van der Horst, p. 177 Until the Peace of Amiens in 1802 he continued his liaison work for the British.Bakhuizen, p. 79 Of his experiences during the years from 1803 to 1813 little specific is known. But the fact that his biographer Van der Aa complains that he was \\"persecuted\\" by \\"French agents\\" indicates that he may still have been active as a British agent.The fact that the biographical note in Bakhuizen says that after the restoration of the Prince of Orange in 1813 \\"...van Kinckel left the British service and put himself at the disposal of the Prince...\\" seems to be a little slip of the pen that gives the game away; Bakhuizen, p. 80. After the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 he joined the headquarters of the Allies. After the return of the Prince of Orange to the Netherlands in 1813 van Kinckel again joined the Dutch diplomatic service. He was appointed envoy at no less than three German princely courts at the same time: the Grand Duchy of Baden, the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, and the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1814. These embassies he would exercise until his death in 1821.Van der Aa; Van der Horst, pp. 177-178 Like other Orangist naval officers, who had been dismissed in 1795, van Kinckel was readmitted to the new Koninklijke Marine and promoted to Vice- Admiral on 1 July 1814. But to his chagrin he was retired from active service in 1817, as an austerity measure. On 18 July 1815 he was made a Commander in the Military Order of William.Van der Horst, p. 178 Van Kinckel died 74 years old in Mannheim on 10 November 1821. His wife inherited 20,000 guilders, and the Will noted that she was also entitled to an annual pension of 1,000 guilders from the Dutch navy \\"widows and orphans\\" fund that van Kinckel had originally proposed.Van der Horst, p. 178 Notes and references =Notes= =References= Sources   Category:1747 births Category:1821 deaths Category:Admirals of the navy of the Dutch Republic Category:Dutch admirals Category:Royal Netherlands Navy personnel Category:Royal Netherlands Navy admirals Category:People of the Patriottentijd Category:Knights Commander of the Military Order of William Category:Dutch diplomats Category:Spies of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars ","title":"Hendrik August van Kinckel"},{"id":"57307323","text":"Ko≈Çodziejczak or Kolodziejczak (Polish pronunciation: ) is an occupational surname derived from the occupation ko≈Çodziej, or wheelwright.

The mansion was divided into two separate properties in the 1910s. The larger, northn part of the mansion is owned by the Danish Association of Pharmaconomists. The southern part (Frederiksgade 17) is owned by Karberghus. History Friedrich Ludwig von Dehn Nicolai Eigtved's masterplan for Copenhagen's new Frederiksstaden district was presented in 1749. The four most prestigious lots were those of the four Amalieborg mansions that would surround the central, octagonal plaza of the new district. Then followed the two lots at the corners of the axially symmetrix street Frederiksgade that marked the entrance to Amalienborg from Norgesgade (now Bredgade). In return for 30 years of freedom from property taxes, the two privy councilors Frederik Ludvig von Dehn and Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff committed themselves to building the two identical town mansions that were called for in Eigtved's masterplan. The Dehn Mansion and the Bernstorff Mansion Dehn and Bernstorff commissioned the architect Johann Gottfried Rosenberg to design and construct the two buildings. Dehn had possibly already used Rosenborg for the design of Gut Ludwigsburg in Schleswig. The plans were approved by Eigtved in 1753 and the Dehn Mansion was completed in 1755. Dehn was appointed to stadtholder in Schleswig-Holstein in 1762 and therefore ended up selling his town mansion in Copenhagen to Ditlev Reventlow in 1766. Reventlow passed it on to his son Fritz Reventlow in 1779. In 1794, it was purchased by Frederick Christian II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. Duke Frederick fell out of favour at the Danish court after the English Wars. The mansion was in 1810 purchased for speculative reasons by a consortium consisting of Frederik Julius Kaas, William Duntzfelt and Niels Rosenkrantz. They divided it into two separate properties bit sold them both to Carl Ludwig von Baudissin in 1811. He died in 1913. Christopher MacEvoy Jr., a merchant and planter from St. Croix in the Danish West Indies, purchased the mansion in 1819. He had recently also purchased the Bernstorff Palace in Charlottenlund north of the city. H. G. F. Holm in circa 1840 The Dehn Mansion changed hands several times after MacEvoy's death in 1838. In 1842, it was acquired by Carl Frederik Blixen Finecke. His brother-in-law, Prince Frederick William of Hesse-Kassel, heir to the Danish throne until 1852, purchased the mansion in 1844. He rented the smaller, southern part of the building out, for instance to the writer Johan Ludvig Heiberg and his wife Johanne Luise Heiberg. Hornung & M√∏ller In 1871 the northern and southern part of the mansion were sold to different buyers. The southern part was acquired by the Knuth family for Christopher Knuth. He owned it until his death in 1942, using it as his winter home while spending the summers on the Lilliendal estate at Vordingborg. The larger northern part of the mansion was acquired by piano manufacturer Frederik M√∏ller and ceded to Hornung & M√∏ller in 1900. The Russian delegation in the process of moving out of their premises, 1919 The Russian diplomatic delegation in Copenhagen was also a tenant in the building but closed down in 1919. The insurance company Nord & Syd acquired both parts of the mansion in 1942. Det Dansk-Franske Dampskibsselskab, a shipping company, acquired the building in 1956. In 1976, the mansion was taken over by the state and put through a major renovation. The northern part was sold to Danish Association of Pharmaconomists in 1980. two parts of the mansion were once again sold to different buyers. The northern part was taken over by the government and used for housing the Ministry of Environmental Affairs. The southern part has for instance housed the Danish Copyright Bureau. Architecture The Dehn Mansion is designed in the Late Baroque/Rococo style. The main facades towards Bredgade consist of three three-storey pavilions with Mansard roofs connected by lower, two-storey sections. The piano nobile has tall, arched windows tp√•√•ed bnu sandstone decorations.

Early word processors were stand- alone devices dedicated to the function, but current word processors are word processor programs running on general purpose computers. The functions of a word processor program fall somewhere between those of a simple text editor and a fully functioned desktop publishing program. However the distinctions between these three have changed over time, and were unclear after 2010.  Background  Word processors did not develop out of computer technology. Rather, they evolved from mechanical machines and only later did they merge with the computer field.Price, Jonathan, and Urban, Linda Pin. The Definitive Word-Processing Book. New York: Viking Penguin Inc., 1984, page xxiii. The history of word processing is the story of the gradual automation of the physical aspects of writing and editing, and then to the refinement of the technology to make it available to corporations and Individuals. The term word processing appeared in American offices in early 1970s centered on the idea of streamlining the work to typists, but the meaning soon shifted toward the automation of the whole editing cycle. At first, the designers of word processing systems combined existing technologies with emerging ones to develop stand-alone equipment, creating a new business distinct from the emerging world of the personal computer. The concept of word processing arose from the more general data processing, which since the 1950s had been the application of computers to business administration.W.A. Kleinschrod, \\"The 'Gal Friday' is a Typing Specialist Now,\\" Administrative Management vol. 32, no. 6, 1971, pp. 20-27 Through history, there have been 3 types of word processors: mechanical, electronic and software.  Mechanical word processing  The first word processing device (a \\"Machine for Transcribing Letters\\" that appears to have been similar to a typewriter) was patented by Henry Mill for a machine that was capable of \\"writing so clearly and accurately you could not distinguish it from a printing press\\". More than a century later, another patent appeared in the name of William Austin Burt for the typographer. In the late 19th century, Christopher Latham SholesSee also Samuel W. Soule and Carlos Glidden. created the first recognizable typewriter that although it was a large size, which was described as a \\"literary piano\\".The Scientific American, The Type Writer, New York (August 10, 1872) The only \\"word processing\\" these mechanical systems could perform was to change where letters appeared on the page, to fill in spaces that were previously left on the page, or to skip over lines. It was not until decades later that the introduction of electricity and electronics into typewriters began to help the writer with the mechanical part. The term ‚Äúword processing‚Äù itself was created in the 1950s by Ulrich Steinhilper, a German IBM typewriter sales executive. However, it did not make its appearance in 1960s office management or computing literatures, though many of the ideas, products, and technologies to which it would later be applied were already well known. But by 1971 the term was recognized by the New York Times W.D. Smith, ‚ÄúLag Persists for Business Equipment,‚Äù New York Times, 26 Oct. 1971, pp. 59-60. as a business \\"buzz word\\". Word processing paralleled the more general \\"data processing\\", or the application of computers to business administration. Thus by 1972 discussion of word processing was common in publications devoted to business office management and technology, and by the mid-1970s the term would have been familiar to any office manager who consulted business periodicals.  Electromechanical and electronic word processing  By the late 1960s, IBM had developed the IBM MT/ST (Magnetic Tape/Selectric Typewriter). This was a model of the IBM Selectric typewriter from the earlier part of this decade, but built into its own desk, and integrated with magnetic tape recording and playback facilities, with controls and a bank of electrical relays. The MT/ST automated word wrap, but it had no screen. This device allowed rewriting text that had been written on another tape and you could collaborate (send the tape to another person for them to edit or make a copy). It was a revolution for the word processing industry. In 1969 the tapes were replaced by magnetic cards. These memory cards were introduced in the side of an extra device that accompanied the MT/ST, able to read and record the work. In the early 1970s, word processing then became computer-based (although only with single-purpose hardware) with the development of several innovations. Just before the arrival of the personal computer (PC), IBM developed the floppy disk. Also in the early 1970s word- processing systems with a CRT screen display editing were designed. At this time these stand-alone word processing systems were designed, built, and marketed by several pioneering companies. Linolex Systems was founded in 1970 by James Lincoln and Robert Oleksiak. Linolex based its technology on microprocessors, floppy drives and software. It was a computer-based system for application in the word processing businesses and it sold systems through its own sales force. With a base of installed systems in over 500 sites, Linolex Systems sold 3 million units in 1975 ‚Äî a year before the Apple computer was released. Linolex Systems, Internal Communications & Disclosure in 3M acquisition, The Petritz Collection, 1975. At that time, the Lexitron Corporation also produced a series of dedicated word-processing microcomputers. Lexitron was the first to use a full-sized video display screen (CRT) in its models by 1978. Lexitron also used 5 inch floppy diskettes, which became the standard in the personal computer field. The program disk was inserted in one drive, and the system booted up. The data diskette was then put in the second drive. The operating system and the word processing program were combined in one file. Another of the early word processing adopters was Vydec, which created in 1973 the first modern text processor, the ‚ÄúVydec Word Processing System‚Äù. It had built-in multiple functions like the ability to share content by diskette and print it. The Vydec Word Processing System sold for $12,000 at the time, (about $60,000 adjusted for inflation). The Redactron Corporation (organized by Evelyn Berezin in 1969) designed and manufactured editing systems, including correcting/editing typewriters, cassette and card units, and eventually a word processor called the Data Secretary. The Burroughs Corporation acquired Redactron in 1976. A CRT-based system by Wang Laboratories became one of the most popular systems of the 1970s and early 1980s. The Wang displayed text on a CRT screen, and incorporated virtually every fundamental characteristic of word processors as we know them today, a true office machine, affordable by organizations such as medium-sized law firms, and easily learned and operated by secretarial staff. The phrase \\"word processor\\" rapidly came to refer to CRT-based machines similar to Wang's. Numerous machines of this kind emerged, typically marketed by traditional office-equipment companies such as IBM, Lanier (AES Data machines - re-badged), CPT, and NBI. All were specialized, dedicated, proprietary systems, with prices in the $10,000 range. Cheap general-purpose personal computers were still the domain of hobbyists.  Japanese word processor devices  In Japan, even though typewriters with Japanese writing system had widely been used for businesses and governments, they were limited to specialists that are required with special skills due to wide varieties of letters, until computer-based devices came into the market. In 1977, Sharp showcased a prototype of a computer-based word processing dedicated device with Japanese writing system in Business Show in Tokyo. World-first Japanese word processor Toshiba JW-10 (Launched in February 1979, Toshiba Science InstituteÔºâ Toshiba released the first Japanese word processor JW-10 in February 1979. The price was 6,300,000 JPY, equivalent to US$45,000. This is selected as one of the milestones of IEEE. Toshiba Rupo JW-P22(K)ÔºàMarch 1986Ôºâ and an optional micro floppy disk drive unit JW-F201 Sharp Shoin WD-J150 The Japanese word processing was made possible with the development of the Japanese input method, which is now widely used in personal computers. Japanese language uses vast numbers of Kanji (Chinese characters) besides Hiragana and Katakana which are 2-byte letters. Oki launched OKI WORD EDITOR-200 in March 1979 with this kana keyboard input system. In 1980 several electronics and office equipment brands entered into this rapidly growing market with more compact and affordable devices. While the average unit price in 1980 was 2,000,000 JPY (US$ 14,300), it was dropped to 164,000 JPY (US$ 1,200) in 1985 . Japanese word processors have been portable so that it has become a substitute of office computers then the size was too large to carry around, and become necessities in offices and academics, even in individuals in the second half of 1980sÊÉÖÂ†±Âá¶ÁêÜÂ≠¶‰ºö Ê≠¥Âè≤ÁâπÂà•ÂßîÂì°‰ºö„ÄéÊó•Êú¨„ÅÆ„Ç≥„É≥„Éî„É•„Éº„ÇøÂè≤„Äè p135-136. The word \\"word processor\\" has been used as the abbreviated form \\"Wa-pro\\" in Japanese.  Word processing software  The final step in word processing came with the advent of the personal computer in the late 1970s and 1980s and with the subsequent creation of word processing software. Word processing systems that would create much more complex and capable text were developed and prices began to fall, making them more accessible to the public. The first word processing program for personal computers (microcomputers) was Electric Pencil, from Michael Shrayer Software, which went on sale in December of 1976. In 1978 WordStar appeared and because of its many new features soon dominated the market. However, WordStar was written for the early CP/M (Control Program‚ÄìMicro) operating system, and by the time it was rewritten for the newer MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System), it was obsolete. WordPerfect and its competitor Microsoft Word replaced it as the main word processing programs during the MS-DOS era, although there were less successful programs such as XyWrite. Most early word processing software required users to memorize semi-mnemonic key combinations rather than pressing keys such as \\"copy\\" or \\"bold\\". Moreover, CP/M lacked cursor keys; for example WordStar used the E-S-D-X-centered \\"diamond\\" for cursor navigation. However, the price differences between dedicated word processors and general-purpose PCs, and the value added to the latter by software such as ‚Äúkiller app‚Äù spreadsheet applications, e.g. VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3, were so compelling that personal computers and word processing software became serious competition for the dedicated machines and soon dominated the market. Then in the late 1980s innovations such as the advent of laser printers, a \\"typographic\\" approach to word processing (WYSIWYG - What You See Is What You Get), using bitmap displays with multiple fonts (pioneered by the Xerox Alto computer and Bravo word processing program), and graphical user interfaces such as ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù (another Xerox PARC innovation, with the Gypsy word processor). These were popularized by MacWrite on the Apple Macintosh in 1983, and Microsoft Word on the IBM PC in 1984. These were probably the first true WYSIWYG word processors to become known to many people. Of particular interest also is the standardization of TrueType fonts used in both Macintosh and Windows PCs. While the publishers of the operating systems provide TrueType typefaces, they are largely gathered from traditional typefaces converted by smaller font publishing houses to replicate standard fonts. A demand for new and interesting fonts, which can be found free of copyright restrictions, or commissioned from font designers, occurred. The growing popularity of the Windows operating system in the 1990s later took Microsoft Word along with it. Originally called \\"Microsoft Multi-Tool Word\\", this program quickly became a synonym for ‚Äúword processor‚Äù.

The Lusitanian Basin is located on both mainland and continental shelf of the west-central coast of Portugal. It covers a 20,000 km2 area and extends from south of Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, to Porto. This north-south oriented Atlantic margin rift basin is approximately 130 km wide and 340 km long and belongs to a family of periatlantic basins such as the Jeanne d'Arc Basin. To the east of the Lusitanian Basin lies the Central Plateau of the Iberian Peninsula and a marginal horst system lies to the west. The Alentejo and Algarve Basins connect to the southern end of the Lusitanian Basin. In the north, it is connected to both the Porto and Galicia Basins via a basement ridge.  Tectonic history  Surrounding geological structures. The Lusitanian Basin results from the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean due to Mesozoic extension. Rifting was initiated between Newfoundland and Iberia and occurred primarily in two phases. The initial phase occurred in the Late Triassic‚Äìearliest Jurassic followed by an episode of faulting and basin subsidence during the early to middle Jurassic south of the Nazare Fault. The second phase of rifting occurred in the late Jurassic‚Äîextension shifted from a wide-rift mode that encompassed future proximal margins, and it focused at distal margins where continental crust eventually. Throughout the complete formation of the basin, from the Late Triassic to the Cretaceous, four phases of rifting can be defined. This first phase occurred during the Late Triassic to the Early Jurassic and is characterized by symmetrical grabens and half- grabens and is concentrated in the central areas of the basin. During the Early Jurassic, the second phase is characterized by minor salt movements along most substantial faults and occurs south of the substantial, centrally- located Nazare fault. The third phase is initiated during the beginning of the Late Jurassic. This phase is defined by the onlapping of the Oxfordian succession on salt pillows that formed in association with fault activity. In between the third and fourth phases, there is a major period of tectonic dormancy. This is most likely due to the opening of the Central Atlantic. During this time, in the Late Jurassic, there is widespread fault-controlled subsidence. The final phase, initiated between the latest Late Jurassic and the earliest Early Cretaceous, triggered salt movement and the development of salt structures. Extensional tectonics ended during the Early Cretaceous.  Structural history  The most significant faults and salt structures throughout the Lusitanian Basin trend north-northeast, parallel to the elongation of the shoreline. The faults that trend northeast to east-northeast are fewer in number. However, they are fairly substantial‚Äîfor example, the Nazare Fault. The north-trending faults are concentrated mainly in the central part of the Lusitanian Basin. These faults are a part of in important structural trend within the Estremadura Trough which highlights the Oxfordian extension within the basin. West-northwest trending faults are scattered throughout the basin. Both thrust faults and normal faults are observed. The thrusting observed is resultant of the basement-attached inversion movements of the pre-existing normal faults during the Miocene. Most of the faults within the basin are fairly high-angle, with some shallowing with depth observed. There is always faulting beneath salt structures and it is speculated that the movement of the salt structures is caused by basement- influenced faulting. = Divisions of Basin = Resultant of diapirism leading to the formation of salt pillows, the Lusitanian Basin can be divided into seven different sub-basins: * Southern Lusitanian Basin (SLB) * Central Lusitanian Basin (CLB) * Northern Lusitanian Basin (NLB) * Arruda Subbasin (ASB) * Turcifal Subbasin (TSB) * Bombarral Subbasin (BSB) * Monte Real Subbasin (MRSB)  Regional stratigraphy  Stratigraphic column of the Lusitanian Basin during the time of its formation. Modified from GEOExPro (2016). The Lusitanian Basin is a late Triassic rift basin is filled with synrift siliciclastics and capped by post-rift evaporites. In the late Triassic, there was deposition of fluvial sand and clay that eventually evolved into deposition of shallow marine dolomites during the lower and middle Jurassic. These sediments are known as the Silves, Dagorda, and Coimbra Formations. Deposition of Carbonates of the Brenha and Candieros Formations are in shelf, ramp, and sub-marine fan environments and filled the basin during the early and middle Jurassic. The carbonate formations are commonly interbedded with shale and there are local turbidite beds also present. Below the halite-bearing evaporites that compose the Dagorda formation are the synrift continental siliciclastics of the Silves formation. Above the Dagorda formation is the post-rift carbonate shelf environment‚Äîthe Coimbra dolomite, Brenha limestone, and Cardieros carbonate grainstone. A substantial unconformity, associated with significant tectonic activity, characterizes the top of the sequence. The carbonate shelf environment is still present in the Upper Jurassic‚Äîcharacterized by the Montejunto grainstone and reef facies, Cabacos organic-rich limestone (capped by anhydrite). Above this sequence, deposition is dominated by the siliciclastics from the Meseta highlands. The Abadia formation is composed of shale, marl, siltstone, and minimal sandstone. The rest of the Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous is dominated by westward- prograding continental clastics.  Hydrocarbon exploration  In the basin, all Jurassic source-rocks could possibly be within the hydrocarbon generation window. However, this is not the case throughout the entire basin. This is due to the highly heterogeneous nature of basin subsidence, especially in the Late Jurassic. Around 100 exploratory wells have been drilled in the basin. 80% of these wells, from Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous strata, had oil and gas shows while drilling and 27% recovered live oil or gas at surface. While there is substantial hydrocarbon potential in this basin alone, Portugal imports 100% of its fossil fuel. There are two major petroleum systems at work within the basin‚ÄîSubsalt and Suprasalt. In the subsalt petroleum system, there are Paleozoic source rocks and synrift Triassic sandstone reservoirs that are sealed by Dagorda evaporites. In the suprasalt system, the oldest source rock is the Lower Brenha formation. The best reservoirs to mention include the Coimbra dolomite and Upper Dagorda carbonates, Candieiros olitic and bioclastic grainstones, and the fractured carbonates of the Brenha formation. Seals are tight or marly carbonates of the Brenha and overlying basal Upper Jurassic.

The artifacts were intended for the Museum of the Bible, funded by the Evangelical Christian Green family, which owns the Oklahoma-based chain of craft stores. Internal staff had warned superiors that the items had dubious provenance and were potentially stolen. In 2017 the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York directed Hobby Lobby to return the artifacts and pay a fine of . U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement returned 3,800 items seized from Hobby Lobby to Iraq in May 2018. In March 2020 the Hobby Lobby president agreed to return 11,500 items to Egypt and Iraq.  Illegal importation of cultural property  United States versus Approximately 450 Ancient Cuneiform Tablets, a court filing from July 2017 Through the 2000s, the entire antiquities marketespecially Hobby Lobby staffhad been widely and publicly warned of the proliferation of fakes, all manufactured with the same cheap flaws that are obvious to expert analysts. Further, the scholar community disparaged the Museum's entire mission, including this statement from Jodi Magness, president of the Archaeological Institute of America: \\"[If] archaeology is being used as a means of proving the historicity and accuracy of the biblical text, that is extremely problematic\\". She generally warned, \\"Many [unprovenanced] antiquities surely come from illegal excavations or looting of archaeological sites\\". As the Justice Department would later reveal, \\"In October 2010, an expert on cultural property law retained by Hobby Lobby warned the company that the acquisition of cultural property likely from Iraq, including cuneiform tablets and cylinder seals, carries a risk that such objects may have been looted from archaeological sites in Iraq. The expert also advised Hobby Lobby to review its collection of antiquities for any objects of Iraqi origin and to verify that their country of origin was properly declared at the time of importation into the United States. The expert warned Hobby Lobby that an improper declaration of country of origin for cultural property could lead to seizure and forfeiture of the artifacts by CBP.\\" Reportedly, \\"dealers across the world were clamoring to sell to the Greens\\" while the family retained world-class master advisors in antiquities. In December 2010, Hobby Lobby purchased $1.6 million worth of Iraqi artifacts from dealers in the United Arab Emirates. The company continued the purchase despite concerns from lawyers over the uncertain origin of the artifacts, and the possibility that they could have been looted. The shipments included tablets inscribed with cuneiform writing, which were misrepresented on declarations as being ceramic and clay tile samples, and contained false designations of origin stating that the objects were from Turkey and Israel. Steve Green told CNN that they'd discovered fragments of the Book of Romans in just the previous 48 hours, which would later be audited to have been actually purchased 18 months prior. The company became subject to investigation by the U.S. government for these actions. Many of the artifacts collected by the Green family, the evangelical owners of the craft-supply chain Hobby Lobby, lacked any supporting evidence of their history or ownership. This raised the possibility that the artifacts had been possibly looted or sold on the black market. Archaeologists say some items may have come from the National Museum of Iraq, which had been looted after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Hobby Lobby made mass purchases with few pieces of vague paperwork and scant descriptions, and \\"having commissioned inexperienced scholars to analyze ancient texts\\" according to Bible scholars in the book Bible Nation. The Museum's chief curator in 2017 summarized \\"We can't even tell sometimes which particular item belonged to which acquisition, because it just wasn't documented either at the acquisition point or at the delivery point. ... So we have no way of knowing where these came from.\\" In early July 2017, US federal prosecutors filed a civil complaint in the Eastern District of New York under the case name United States of America v. Approximately Four Hundred Fifty Ancient Cuneiform Tablets and Approximately Three Thousand Ancient Clay Bullae. On July 5, 2017, Hobby Lobby consented to a settlement requiring forfeiture of the artifacts and payment of a fine of $3 million and the return of more than 5500 artifacts. In the early hours of July 30, 2017, Israeli authorities raided several private residences and storefronts in Jerusalem belonging to five antiquities dealers of Palestinian origin and confiscated several historical artifacts, including a papyrus fragment from the Egyptian Book of the Dead and a Pompeiian fresco, and more than in cash. They also found evidence of money laundering and tax evasion, as well as receipts bearing Christian Green's names. The Israeli Antiquities Authority had been contacted in 2016 by the United States Department of Homeland Security, and provided Israeli authorities with evidence of money transfers between Green and Israeli-licensed antiquities dealers. In all, five individuals were arrested for tax evasion. Biblical scholars in the book Bible Nation: The United States of Hobby Lobby report that the Green family's philanthropic activitiesincluding antiquities donations to its own museumhave always followed a set ratio of 3:1, of the appraised value to the purchase price. This is reportedly with the goal of a large profit margin by way of tax write- off, wherein \\"the government is effectively paying the Greens to amass a collection of dubious antiquities\\". The 2019 book Tablets From the Irisaƒùrig Archive mentions the scandal in its analysis of more than one thousand cuneiform tablets, possibly stolen from Irisaƒùrig, a 4,000-year-old lost city in Iraq. The tablets, purchased by Hobby Lobby, were studied over a four year period while in the company's Oklahoma storerooms. \\"The new find shows that the company Hobby Lobby ‚Äî whose co-owner, Steve Green, helped found the Museum of the Bible in November 2017 in Washington, D.C. ‚Äî had far more cuneiform tablets obtained (possibly illegally) from this city, and other sites in Iraq, than previously believed.\\" Up to 1400 artifacts to be returned to Iraq appear to be missing from the Hobby Lobby collection. Collections management controversy = Counterfeit items = In October 2018, the Museum of the Bible revealed that five of its sixteen Dead Sea Scrolls fragments are counterfeit; and in March 2020, independent art fraud investigators hired by the museum revealed that all sixteen fragments are counterfeit, made from ancient leather and modern inks. The museum removed the display of another disputed artifact, a miniature bible which a NASA astronaut had purportedly carried to the moon. = Stolen items = The Gilgamesh Dream Tablet In October 2019, officials from the British Egypt Exploration Society, a nonprofit organization that manages the Papyri Project, alleged that Oxford academic Dirk Obbink engaged in the theft and sale of \\"at least 11 ancient Bible fragments to the Green family, the Hobby Lobby owners who operate a Bible museum and charitable organization in Washington\\". The museum said it will return the fragments to the Egypt Exploration Society and Oxford University. In March 2020, National Geographic reported that the museum was \\"reevaluating the provenance of all the material in its collection\\" with the intent of returning stolen objects. Steve Green, the museum's board chairman and the president of Hobby Lobby, announced the museum will be returning 11,500 artifacts to Egypt and Iraq, including thousands of papyrus scraps and ancient clay pieces. Green admitted, \\"I knew little about the world of collecting ... The criticism of the museum resulting from my mistakes was justified.\\" Manchester University papyrologist Roberta Mazza stated that the Green family \\"poured millions on the legal and illegal antiquities market without having a clue about the history, the material features, cultural value, fragilities, and problems of the objects\\". This return includes the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet, containing part of the Epic of Gilgamesh, discovered in Iraq in 1853, sold by the Jordanian Antiquities Association to an antiquities dealer in 2003, and sold again by Christie's auction house to Hobby Lobby in 2014 for $1.6 million. The auction house lied about how the artifact had entered the market, claiming it had been on the market in the United States for decades. In September 2019, federal authorities seized the tablet, and in May 2020, a civil complaint was filed to forfeit it.

This includes the zero hour class before the regular class (also called \\"morning self-learning\\" ()) and the night self- learning after the regular class. Since it is a self-learning program, it does not offer educational programs like supplementary classes or after-school programs.  Concept  Usually, the concept of \\"self-learning\\" is not to unilaterally accept learning in the course of the teacher's control according to the teacher's advance plans, as is the case with traditional teaching activities, but instead learner feels the need to learn on its own and studies own poor's subject after self-planning. It is used in the same term as \\"Independent learning\\" as it is opposed to \\"Other-directed learning\\". Also, it is based on spontaneity, creativity and autonomy. However, it is used as a different concept in South Korea. Night self-learning is a strictly passive learning process, and it is enforced under the supervision of a teacher in South Korea. In South Korea, night self-learning for high school students begins at around 6 pm. on average when classes are completed and night self- learning is finished until 9 pm, 10 pm. Depending on the school, students who want to study at night after regular night self-hours will be able to study for an additional hour. The average Korean high school students spend 10 hours 47 minutes studying, and it is believed that the impact of ‚Äòthe zero class‚Äô and ‚Äònight self-learning‚Äô is significant. 330x330px Because of the policy of ‚ÄòThe Ministry of Education and Human Resources Development (MOHRD)‚Äô, the compulsory night self-study was prohibited, but the standardized self-learning continued. Some people argue that self-learning from early morning till late night is detrimental to the health of students and do not help them learn efficiently in the long run. In China, similar to the above education system, self-learning is also being conducted. The government's basic policy is to leave school at 4 p.m., but generally, middle and high school students stay at school from 8 pm to 9 pm. Accordingly, there was an opposite signature on the Internet.  Background and Development  = Background = The night self- learning started in 1980 with the July 30 educational reform measures. The focus of the education reform was the normalization of school education and the elimination of excessive private tutoring. In particular, the college entrance exam and overheating private tutoring were emerging as educational issues and general problems of society at that time. At the time, the education authoritiessaid that over-heating private tutoring not only greatly hampered the normalization of school education, but also created a sense of crisis among the classes. As the private tutoring and supplementary classes were abolished after the educational reform measures, the school judged that the preparation for the college entrance exam was insufficient only with regular classes. It was an origin of the night self-learning. At that time, the education authorities continuously prohibited night self-learning from being directed against the normalization of education measures, but schools in the front line continued to violate the ban, making night free learning secretly. In the past, this had been repeated over and over again. However, as more and more schools implemented night self- learning, the educational authorities admitted that in principle, night self-learning should be done through the free participation of the students. = Development = Since the introduction of high school standardization, high schools in most parts of the country have tried to nurture prestigious schools. The school increased the night self-study to get more students into top universities. However, there are persistent opinions about the abolition of night self-learning. Because they have thought the compulsory night self-learning system ignored the human rights of students and the educational effects were also doubtful. Accordingly, the Ministry of Education banned the uniform supplementary learning at high schools and the night self-learning after 10 p.m.  Present  In present, 1,900 out of 2,258 schools across the Korea are found to be implementing night self-learning. Although there are many schools that make students do night self-learning voluntarily, there are still high schools that force their students to do it compulsorily. However, night self-learning is gradually being abolished in the Greater Seoul area.  Effect  = Negative effects = Under the current system, high schools that have abolished night self-learning accept students to study in classrooms through application. However, students who have no place to study at night eventually study at school. Instead of reading in rooms and private educational institutes, students choose school because of the high financial burden. Some students are having dinner at convenience stores because there is no dinner offered when the night self-learning was conducted. Schools and local governments should make sure that students who participate in night self-study receive a good dinner at school. These are the minimum considerations that an educator can give to students who want to study. It is not the only problem. Private education costs are rising as more student flock to nearby private educational institutes. Furthermore, if all students had similar quality education and private education cost was reduced due to night self-learning, the private education portion increased by the night self-learning abolition, changing the quality of education for each student. For example, innovation schools in Busan have strengthened public education by freely implementing night free learning. Due to that, the number of under-grade students has declined. = Positive effects = Of course, there are positive effects as well. Unconditioned night self-learning is really passionate about studying and involves students who try to get into college. Therefore, the academic atmosphere in classrooms that enforce night self-learning is created. Or, students who want to do physical education or other self-improvement can study or attend private educational institutes. Ultimately, it is meaningful that the great cause of human rights for students has been fulfilled. The majority of people now support the abolition of night self-learning. Unlike regular classes, where all students have to be guided manually, night self-learning is a time when students can self-led their studies. However, there are many people who oppose it. The main reason for this is rising private education costs, followed by a rise in juvenile delinquency and a decrease in learning time. Therefore, a policy to reduce private education expenses is necessary to increase the effectiveness of the abolition of night self-learning. In addition, various programs within the school should be developed and operated considering students ' career path or aptitude.

It is a brief parody story of John Stubbs' rise to power by lying and cheating and switching sides any time it benefits him.  Text  The text of \\"Autobiography of a Scalawag\\" transcribed from the scanned image found at the Library of Congress: AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A SCALAWAG.  I was born in Greene county, going on About forty-odd years ago, having Bin the younffest of 14 children, all of whitch was raised except 6 which dide of the meesles and things. When I was a smart chap my Parents moved to Shifflet's Holler, well known in Albemarle county for sum remarkable murders, in which so fur as I know and Beleav none of our Foax was mixed up. I was as good a suthern man before the war as thar was in our county, and always voted the Democratic ticket as I noad the Whigs was not Sound about the niggers, and my political greed was founded on the Jeffersonian Republican printed by Mr. Alexander on Main st., in Charlottesville near about whar thar now is a very fine Juelry store, and opposite the Flannagin Bank. I jined of a artillery company about the first man, and fit until I lost all taiste for that arjuous lifesay nigh on about 12 months. I was wun of the teamsturs, and had a very ruff time amoving from Manassas to Williamsburg, and particularly bak. About this time I got a detale and held a affice in the Confederit stables in Richmond under Mr. Davis during the balance of the Waw. I was in all the Battles around Richmond, working like a dog physiking and cleaning uv horses, and when we phinally got Gineral McClellan in them swormps, I visited some of the hardest fiting places along with my bossand picked up a good many things. About February, 1865, I became Phully satisfied in my own conshence that I smelt a rat. So wun tolerable clear morning I said, \\"Confederit stables, adu!\\" and struck out for the lower Jeems, when met a Yankee transpote. I giv them all the pints, and told them I was a Union man out of Castle Thunder, whar I had suffered for my principles nigh on two yearsand having lived very thinit was pretty rough in Richmond in them days, particularly the Artikkle of whiskey, my emashated condition give a very gud kind uv color to my story, and so they took me in. I noad a gud deal about the phix in Richmond, and so they took me to Ginral Butler whar give me some very good ale and five or six drinks, and axed me questions. I noad things was up, and told him putty much the truth, tho' bein brung up at Shiffllett's, I mout have lide in some things from the fose of habit, and without any particular intenshun uv telling uv a lie to my new friends. Well, you know the final eend, and about that time I was putty sicdy in Washington, whar all the novelty had woan off uv me, except with Mr. Greeley, who always gave me ten cents and axed me for kruelties to the Federal prisoners, which uv course I gived him, some from real life, others hearn, and others to keep up the interest. I cum back to Virginia in 1866, and jined the scalawags, and in 1867 I begun to attend the nigger meetings and tell 'em uv thar wrongs, and what we was gwine to do for them. I become a right good hand at nigger speeking, and went in strong for manhood suffrage, whar I was posted in the Tribune. Phoaxs phoolishly taxt me with being uv rekreunt to my own people, but I seed very plain it war no time to be centimental, a fuling about what was right, fur I noad we was in a revolution, and nobody was agwine to help him who wuddent help himself, so I sot my mind to help myself to sumthing, and if every dog has his day and the niggers was agwine to have theirs, I seed whar the path uv glory was open to John Stubbs. And this is how I got to the kunventionwhar I waded in. We was obliged to stand by the niggers, for the white foax cut us and we wuts dispised until thar wus nuthen left but to fite it out on that line. It wur nesecerry to be more particular in Virginia than in the other States, because the white people was heavy in the majority, and so we shet down on 'em with the artikkle No. three excluding the most malignant rebbels from the ballot, wharby we killed about phifleen thousand uv the best kind uv votes. We cum at 'em then with fixin' uv the Legislature, and give the niggers a clean majority of 21 thar. And then we phixt the counties so as to git the moast of them, and we A lowed about two hundred officers to a county, so as to have enuff for All. But the worst thing they minded was when we give 'em the Test Oaththat was like a Senter shot, and I noad the dog was certinly Hit by the way he howled when we phixt it. It was a little ruff, but it was the only way we had to Kum at 'em. I am now clerk of  county, worth, I suppose, by fair dealings $2,500 a year. I hav no Reeson to complain uv Fortune, for she has been a kind friend to me. I may have done some thingsEetin say my peck of dirtsome thing-whar under a more orspicious environsment I mout have not liked, but I never has been able to cee my way kleer without sum side cuts, and as for a life of inflecksible ackrawsy it's not a goin to woak, and I never cee it work. We is scinners, and we must leave a margin if we want to be practikkle. I never could sensher the Kummitty of Nine, because I know Jordan is a hard road to travel, and if they don't stop torking about Honnor, these Southern people will jes let the Yankees eat 'em up.We mus bend; everything mus bend at times; and whar is thar any exemption for Conshence different from other artikkles, and settin up to fite against Sirkumstances and the Spirrit of the Age? I winst a little at first when I becum a scalawag, meeting uv old acquaintances, but when a man gets up in the world, people is so tolerunt; and thar is so much rascallity now-a-days that particular cases does not ecsite so much Atentlon as wunst upon a time. My censibility, too, is less akute sents I have made the ackwaintance of the fratunity of carpet-baggers, the Right Bower of our party; I hav seed so much unblushing effrontery in these foax that I frekwently feels a glow of conshus virtue when me and they takes a drink. They makes no pertensions to a strict a course of life; but for the original talunt of smartness and getting all you ken I bows to 'em as my betters. They lets out sometimes a feeling for me that borders too near to my taste of contempt; they has indeed told me I was embarlssed by scrupils, which I am whar thar is smarl game, and I suppose is owing to my being born in this part of the world. But I must finish this chapter as I am called off to swar ina good many is agwIne to jump that fence.Enq. and Ex.

Her most well-known works are large figurative paintings and drawings. Her early paintings were dominated by color, as she was trained when Abstract Expressionism was the dominant American art movement; later she became interested in photography and, as a result, experimented in \\"decolorizing\\" her paintings and drawings. Early life, education, and employment Betty Holliday was the youngest daughter of Gertrude Holliday and George Alvin Holliday (1887‚Äì1970); she had one sister, Priscilla. She earned a BA in Art History at Barnard College (1945), studied painting and drawing at the Art Students League of New York (1942‚Äì47), and earned an MA in Art History at Radcliffe College (1950), now fully merged with Harvard University. After completing her formal education, Holliday worked as an editorial associate for ARTnews (1950‚Äì55), which familiarized her with the works of contemporary artists. This access to the art scene proved instrumental in her recruitment of visiting artists for the Cumberland Center for Continuing Education, the adult education program at the Great Neck School District, where Holliday was a well-respected teacher from 1955 until 1984. She also taught privately and many of her students became professional artists, including Shirley Gorelick, Deborah Katz, Peter Galasso, and Sigrid Somers. Abstract Expressionism Holliday began to explore nonobjectivity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but her figural abstractions attracted the earliest published critical attention. My Father (1960), a monumental abstraction of George Alvin Holliday seated in a chair, was prominently reproduced in Art in America to illustrate how the nontraditional, unsymbolic figurative works of \\"fledgling artists\\" attested to the flexibility of abstraction and representation. Even in her earliest works, Holliday was able to \\"reveal the truth of the figure which is just as well expressed by its stance, its total gesture, as by its individual features\\" through the language of Abstract Expressionism. Her heavy, bold, interpenetrating, and in some cases obliterating, gestural strokes of white, gray, black, and brown invited comparisons to Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning. A few years later, she asserted her expressive independence in a group of paintings and drawings on the theme of figures in striped clothing against a green backdrop, including In the Garden (1964) and On the Grass III (1965), both large canvases. Holliday's command of compositional space and structure, which was already evident in My Father, became more nuanced and her forms more decentralized; her figures were also more enigmatic. As noted by one reviewer, Holliday surpassed \\"factual representation\\" to achieve \\"an expressiveness and concern for human meaning\\" through both the subject and her handling of it. Photography Holliday began to explore photography as an alternative expressive medium in 1967 and 1968, when she focused almost solely on her photographic experiments in \\"decoloration,\\" which led her to create a number of photo-sculptures, including Vertical Broom, Horizontal Broom, and The Farragut Stairs (all 1968). Each features a single photograph, with its abundant repetitions affixed to a large construction, resulting in a visually stimulating, rhythmic arrangement of black and white elements. A similar synthesis of form and content is found in Model for an Improbable Billboard (1967‚Äì69), a photo-sculpture featuring the American poet Marianne Moore, who was photographed by Holliday during a public reading at the Loeb Student Center at New York University in 1967. Later works Around 1972, Holliday reintroduced some limited color and returned to painting large figures, characterized by bold brushstrokes and simple, direct compositions. At this time of renewed emphasis on figurative painting, Holliday was invited to contribute to a feminist collaborative installation called The Sister Chapel, which was conceived by her former student, Ilise Greenstein, and came to dominate Holliday's work for almost two years. Although Holliday vacillated when choosing her subject for the installation, she eventually settled on Marianne Moore, recalling her \\"steel-sharp wit disguised as reticent gentility‚ÄîSocrates hiding out in the person of the local librarian.\\" Holliday's fascination with Moore led to the creation of countless works. When The Sister Chapel premiered in 1978, one reviewer reported that Holliday had executed three hundred drawings and five full-sized paintings of Marianne Moore. Holliday‚Äôs final painting, Marianne Moore (1977), was the outcome of numerous and evolving studies, which included drawings of the head, umbrella, and a bentwood rocker of a type designed by Michael Thonet. When The Sister Chapel was first shown, Marianne Moore was identified by one reviewer as \\"probably the most successful painting‚Äîas a painting‚Äîin the chapel.\\" In the early 1980s, Holliday's attention shifted to sunflowers and dynamic human figures, both of which were executed on a large scale, usually in the form of drawings. In these works, her figures were more energetic than in her earlier, more static paintings. The Flute and Raised Ukelele were among the drawings of \\"a swirling, spinning female form, engulfed in sweeping lines that define a cape or scarf, while holding aloft a flute or ukelele. The entire effect is one of motion, of energy, of playfulness.\\" At the time, Holliday‚Äôs monumental and expressive figures were described by a reviewer in The New York Times as \\"a body of work that restates a classic tradition with marked originality.\\" Holliday's final works were large-scale drawings, including The Judgment of Paris (1990), which was described by Helen Harrison as \\"a witty, geriatric takeoff on the mythological encounter.\\" References Category:1925 births Category:2011 deaths Category:American women painters Category:Painters from New York (state) Category:Feminist artists Category:People from Port Washington, New York Category:20th-century American painters Category:20th- century American women artists Category:Barnard College alumni Category:Art Students League of New York alumni Category:Radcliffe College alumni ","title":"Betty Holliday"},{"id":"57308990","text":"Myiomyrmica is a genus of picture-winged flies in the family Ulidiidae.

They are also known as the \\"Early Chalukyas of Gujarat\\" (as opposed to the later Chalukyas of Gujarat). In the late 660s, the Vatapi Chalukya king Vikramaditya I appointed his brother Dharashraya Jayasimhavarman as the governor of the north-western parts of his kingdom, which included southern Gujarat (Lata), Nashik region, and northern Konkan. Dharashraya's eldest son Shryashraya Shiladitya died before him, and he was succeeded by his younger sons, first Jayashraya Mangalarasa, and then Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin. Avanijanashraya is best known for repulsing an Arab invasion from the Umayyad Caliphate near Navsari, a feat recorded in his 738-739 inscription. After his reign, the history of this Chalukya branch is uncertain: their territory subsequently came under the Rashtrakuta control.  Dharashraya Jayasimhavarman  The Vatapi Chalukya kingdom at its largest extent The Navsari branch of the Chalukyas was established by Dharashraya Jayasimhavarman (IAST: DharƒÅ≈õraya Jaya-si·πÉha-varman), who was a son of the Vatapi Chalukya king Pulakeshin II, and a younger brother of Pulakeshin's successor Vikramaditya I. Sometime before 667-670 CE, Vikramaditya appointed Dharashraya as the governor of the north-western Chalukya territories, which included parts of present-day southern Gujarat, and the Konkan and Nashik region of Maharashtra. Dharashraya is attested by his Nashik inscription, which is dated to 20 or 21 March 685 (year 436 of the Kalachuri era). This Sanskrit-language inscription records the grant of the Dhondhaka village in the Nasikya vishaya (Nashik province) to a Brahmana named Trivikrama. The Nashik inscription states that Dharashraya defeated and routed the army of a king named Vajjada, between the Mahi and the Narmada rivers. Historian V. V. Mirashi theorizes that Vajrata invaded the Gurjara kingdom, whose ruler Dadda III was a Chalukya vassal; the Chalukya emperor dispatched Dharashraya to repulse the invader. However, there is no concrete proof to support this theory. Historian Shyam Manohar Mishra theorizes that Vajjada may have been another name for Dadda III. It is possible that this Vajjada is same as the Vajrata, who according to a Samangad inscription, was defeated by the Rashtrakuta king Dantidurga. It is likely that Dharashraya's campaign against Vajjada was ordered by his overlord and nephew Vinayaditya (the successor of Vikramaditya I), who wanted to expand the Chalukya power in the north. = Shryashraya Shiladitya = Dharashraya's eldest son was Shryashraya Shiladitya (IAST: ≈örayƒÅ≈õraya ≈öilƒÅdtiya). An inscription of Shryashraya, issued by him as the crown prince (yuvaraja), is dated to 23 May 668 (year 420 of the Kalachuri era). Its find spot is unknown. It is written in Sanskrit language using an early form of the Telugu-Kannada alphabet. It records the grant of Mudgapadra village to migrant Brahmana cousins Revaditya and Varasyaka by Dharashraya and Shryashraya. The inscription was issued from Navasarika (Navsari) and its text was composed by Dhananjaya. A Surat inscription of Shryashraya, also in Sanskrit language, is dated to 28 January 671 (Kalachuri year 421). It records the grant of the Asatti village to Bhogikasvamin. Another of his Sanskrit inscriptions, found at Surat, is dated 692-693 (Kalachuri year 443: the date can be read as 2 August 692 CE, assuming that the inscription was issued in the Kalachuri year 443; or as 23 July 693 CE, assuming that it was issued after the expiry of the Kalachuri year 443). The inscription was issued from Kusumeshvara, and records the grant of a field in the Osumbhala village to Matrishvara Dikshita. Shryashraya appears to have died before his father Dharashraya; therefore, Dharashraya was succeeded by his second eldest son Jayashraya Mangalarasa, who was succeeded by Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin, another of Dharashraya's sons. Tribhuvanashraya Nagavardhana, a fourth son of Dharashraya, is attested by an inscription found at Nirpan village of Maharashtra. This inscription records the grant of the Belegrama village to the shrine of the deity Kapaleshvara, but is considered spurious by historians.  Jayashraya Mangalarasa  Jayashraya Mangalarasa (IAST: JayƒÅ≈õraya Ma·πÖgalarasa-rƒÅja) was nominally a vassal of the Chalukya king Vinayaditya, but appears to have been practically independent. The Manor inscription of Mangalarasa is dated to 7 April 691 (year 613 of the Shaka era). This Sanskrit language inscription describes Mangalarasa as a crown prince, and records the grant of some villages and other land to the Sun temple at Manapura. It indicates that Mangalarasa bore the titles Prithvi- vallabha, Yuddhamalla, and Vinayaditya. The Diveagar inscription issued during Mangalarasa's reign is dated to 727-728 (Shaka 649). It records the grant of the Talavallika village by prince Dharashraya Jayasimha to the goddess Katyayani, whose statue was located on the bank of a temple tank in Kadadroho- Votinera. The Valsad (Balsar) inscription of Mangalarasa is dated to 731-732 (Shaka 653). It describes him as \\"Raja Vinayaditya Yuddhamalla Mangalarasa\\". The Rashtrakuta chief Indra I forcibly abducted Bhavanaga, a daughter or niece of Mangalarasa, from a marriage pandal at Kaira. Kaira was located in the traditional Maitraka territory; therefore, historian A. S. Altekar theorizes that Bhavanaga was to be married to a Maitraka prince. On the other hand, historian Shyam Manohar Mishra theorizes that Mangalarasa had conquered Kaira from the Maitrakas by this time.  Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin  Mangalarasa's younger brother and successor Avanijanashraya Pulakeshin (IAST: Avani-janƒÅ≈õraya Pulake≈õi-rƒÅja) ascended the throne sometime between 731 and 739. He is attested by a Sanskrit inscription, which is known as the Navsari inscription, although its exact find spot is not known. The Epigraphical Society of India received it from a resident of Satem village of Navsari district. It is dated to the year 490 of the Kalachuri era; the date can be interpreted as 1 November 738 (assuming current year i.e. it was issued in the 490th year of the Kalachuri era) or 21 October 739 (assuming expired year i.e. it was issued after 490 years of the era had been completed). The inscription records Avanijanashraya's repulsion of an Arab invasion from the Umayyad Caliphate. It states that the Tajikas (the Arabs) had advanced up to Navsari after plundering the kingdoms of the Saindhavas, Kachchhelas, Saurashtra, Chavotkas, Mauryas, the Gurjaras, and others. The forces of Avanijanashraya defeated the invaders after a fierce battle. As a result of this success, Avanijanashraya's overlord conferred several titles upon him, including \\"solid pillar of Dakshinapatha\\" (Dakshinapathasadhara), \\"ornament of the Chalukya family\\" (Challuki-kulalankara), \\"beloved of the earth\\" (Prithvi-vallabha), and \\"the repeller of the unrepellable\\" (Anivartaka-nivartayitri). The overlord was the Vatapi Chalukya ruler Vikramaditya II, although the inscription doesn't mention his name, simply calling him \\"Vallabha Narendra\\". Avanijanashraya appears to have annexed the former Gurjara territory to the Chalukya kingdom after repulsing the Arabs. He became the most powerful ruler of the Navsari Chalukya family, and assumed the title Paramabhattaraka. His use of this title, usually borne by the sovereign rulers, cannot be explained with certainty. It is possible that it signifies his declaration of independence; alternatively, it is possible that he remained a Chalukya vassal, and the assumption of the title was just meant for glorification. The Chalukyas of Navasarika were ultimately supplanted by the Rashtrakutas in the 8th century.

It has a single egg-shaped leaf and a flowering stem with up to four pink or pinkish green flowers with a flat, oblong labellum. It is very similar to Cyrtostylis oblonga and more investigation is required to determine if they are distinct from each other. Description Cyrtostylis rotundifolia is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with a single kidney-shaped, egg-shaped, heart-shaped or almost round leaf long and wide. Up to four pink or pinkish green flowers long are borne on a thin flowering stem up to high. The dorsal sepal is erect, linear to narrow lance-shaped and the lateral sepals are narrow linear and somewhat smaller than the dorsal sepal. The petals are similar in size and shape to the lateral sepals. The labellum is flat, oval, about long wide with two round calli at the base and two parallel longitudinal ridges. The column is shorter than the labellum and has two wings widening towards the tip. Flowering occurs from June to October. This species is very similar to C. oblonga and \\"the status of these two species requires further investigation\\". It has grey-green mostly egg-shaped leaves compared to the yellowish green, oblong leaves of C. oblonga. Taxonomy and naming Cyrtostylis rotundifolia was first formally described in 1853 by Joseph Dalton Hooker and the description was published in Flora Novae-Zelandiae. The specific epithet (rotundifolia) is derived from the Latin words rotundus meaning \\"round\\", \\"circular\\" or \\"spherical\\" and folium meaning \\"leaf\\". Distribution and habitat The winter orchid grows in lightly shaded scrub and open in areas on the northern half of the North Island and the lower two-thirds of the South Island of New Zealand.

History A paleochristian church at the site, dedicated to the Holy Sepulcher (Santo Sepolcro) was located near here, and the first documentation of a monastery here date to 1090. The monastery became associated with the Vallumbrosan Order, and hosted the bishop Lanfranco Beccaria, till his death in 1198. Pope Alexander III elevated Lanfranco to sainthood the next year. This church, which held his relics, was rebuilt starting about this time, and leading to consecration in 1236, with the bell-tower dating to 1237, and the facade to 1257. The small cloister was designed in 1476 by the architect Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. Amadeo also designed and sculpted the elements of the Arca di San Lanfranco which serves as funereal monument and tomb to the saint. Located outside the walls of Pavia, the abbey was frequently requisitioned by armies besieging the town. Over the years a number of events, including floods and fires, damaged the church and abbey. Soon after 1782, the monastery was suppressed. Description Fresco depicting the murder of Thomas Becket, on the left is the figure of San Lanfranco in act of blessing. While the exterior of the church is mainly plain brick, the interior still contains frescoes from the 13th to 15th centuries. Among the most notable, is a fresco depicting the murder of St Thomas Becket, whose life had parallels with San Lanfranco. The remains of the small cloister include Romanesque carvings on the columns. The larger cloister has 15th century Renaissance style decorations in the capitals. The tomb of the Saint (Arca de San Lanfranco) was completed from 1498-1508 with designs by Amedeo, and is notable for the carved bas-reliefs by Amedeo and his followers depicting the life of the Saint.Parrochia di San Lanfranco, history.Lombardia Beni Culturali, entry on church.

History  Ghana became the next country to have internet in the Sub Sahara. Internet services began in Ghana in 1995. This was made possible through the collaborations between Network Computer Systems (NCS), Pipex International, The Ministry of Transport and Communication of Ghana, Ghana Telecom, and British Telecom. NCS had registered ghana.com domain in 1993.  Wireless internet  Ghana has over 15 internet service providers who mostly provide different forms of internet services. Most of these ISPs provide wireless internet. And these include all the telcos in Ghana.  Internet speed  According to bandwidthplace, Ghana's internet speed hovers around an average of 1.46 Mbit/s uploads across most of the internet enabled devices tested.  Internet accessibility  There are over 7.9 million internet users in Ghana who mostly access the internet from mobile devices. File:Ghana Internet Activities.jpgGhana Internet Activities  Internet service providers  There are a number of ISPs in Ghana, apart from the major telecommunication companies like MTN Ghana, Vodafone Ghana, Airtel Africa, Millicom and Globacom there are other companies like Africaonline, ADTech IT and Blue Cloud Network which also provide internet services. There is also Busyinternet and Surfline which offers wireless internet services through their omternet enabled devices. Internet closure during elections  Net neutrality  As it stands now, Ghana does not have any provisions on net neutrality. This has raised concerns and brought together netizens and tech firms to protest for this provision in Ghana Ghana has however faced a net neutrality crisis in the past. This was as a result of the NCA wanting to ban sites like Skype, Whatsapp, Viber and other internet based instant messaging platforms with the excuse of they causing losses to telcos in Ghana. This campaign was led by telecommunication giant MTN which complained of losses due to people's continuous use of these platforms which reduced the number of calls. This brought a huge debate and in the end this never happened. NCA reacted to this that their press statement was taken out of context and the said ban was not going to happen anytime.  Internet censorship  There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without judicial oversight. Individuals and groups engage in the peaceful expression of views via the Internet, including by e-mail.\\"Ghana\\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 25 March 2013. Retrieved 14 February 2014. Although the constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and press, the government sometimes restricts those rights. The police arbitrarily arrest and detain journalists. Some journalists practice self-censorship. The constitution prohibits arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government respects these prohibitions in practice. In 2002 the government of Ghana censored Internet media coverage of tribal violence in Northern Ghana. =Internet shutdown during elections= During the heat of the 2016 election year, there were rumors that the Inspector General of Ghana Police wanted to shut down access to internet. The civil society organizations came out to condemn the intended shutting down of the internet and proferred solutions like tracking of the internet. The then President John Mahama came out to state that the internet won't be shut down on the day of elections.  Data centers  * National Information Technology Agency (NITA)  Cyber Fraud  Cyber fraud has been a major issue in Ghana like most developing countries in the world. A Kenyan IT firm report that Ghana lost over $50 million due to cyber fraud, this was projected to increase to around $100 million in 2018. Several Ghanaians and foreigners have also been arrested for crimes relating to cyber fraud. One notable crime is sim box fraud. In 2017 the National Cyber Security Week was held in Ghana to bring stakeholders together to help address issues of cyber security and cyber fraud.  Internet laws in Ghana  The laws governing internet in Ghana include = Electronic Communication Amendment Act = This Law addresses some technical, regulatory and financial challenges related to interconnection. =Data Protection Act = The Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843) was formulated to protect personal information.

History  Birdcloud was formed in 2010 in Murfreesboro, Tennessee while Kaset and Green were attending Middle Tennessee State University; of their early acquaintance, the pair met at MTSU in 2009 did not initially like each other, but bonded during a barbecue after realizing they shared a mutual dislike of another student. Within a week of first playing together, they were playing shows, and a year later recorded their first EP. Birdcloud developed a signature playing style in which the two women face each other rather than their audience, as described by Kaset: \\"It‚Äôs less about excluding other people than doing what it takes to become Birdcloud.\\" After a tour of Australia in October 2018, the group went silent on official social media channels and then later canceled its remaining shows for the year. On July 1, 2019, Makenzie Green posted on Instagram that she was seeking an opportunity to resume her musical career outside of Birdcloud. On Jan. 20, 2020, the band reactivated social media accounts and stated they were back.  Controversy  In response to their songs \\"Indianer\\" and \\"Black Guys\\", Birdcloud has received death threats and calls for boycott.

He was most known for claiming to discover a 'Stone-Age' tribe called the Tasadays which was later rumored as a hoax. Personal life Elizalde was born in Manila on November 8, 1936 to Manuel \\"Manolo\\" Elizalde Sr. and Mary Cadwallader. He was married, but the couple later divorced. Tasaday hoax In June 1971, Elizalde claimed discovery to a primitive tribe untouched by civilization, who lived in caves and survived by hunting and gathering. The \\"Tasadays\\" were found in a forest in South Cotabato, Mindanao. The story gained traction in international media, some complimenting him as \\"a visionary idealist who cared more about the hard-pressed national minorities than about his family fortune\\". However, all visits from foreign media and scholars were supervised by the Presidential Assistance on National Minorities (PANAMIN) which was led by Elizalde himself. Independent anthropologists were prohibited to enter the Tasaday reservation area, thus at the time there was no scholarly paper published on the Tasaday. It was only after the Marcos downfall that a Swiss journalist, Oswald Iten, entered the area and found the so-called Paleolithic tribe dressed in T-shirts and living in huts. Many other local and foreign anthropologists decried Elizalde's claims, calling it an elaborate hoax. Other controversies Elizalde was regarded as a crony of former President and dictator Ferdinand Marcos. He and his brother Fred J. Elizalde became involved in many businesses such as mining, abaca farming, sugar centrals, tinplate manufacturing, paints, foods, distillery, real estate, rural banking, and agri-business. They both came into conflict with many of his laborers due to exploitation of sugar workers, refusing to pay livable wages and bonuses, and oppression of cultural minorities. Elizalde was the chief executive of several steel companies, which were favored and accommodated by the Marcos regime in funding, and guarantee of lucrative markets. He monopolized sales of tinplate, and raised prices at will, which rippled in the market with price increases. In one instance, Elizalde raised the price for tinplate by 17% in 1980, and threatened to increase it with another 7.5% unless the government continued to charge tax on imported raw materials. Death Elizalde died on May 3, 1997 of leukaemia. His family did not disclose the cause of death.
