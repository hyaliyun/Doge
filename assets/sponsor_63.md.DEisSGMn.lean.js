She was named for Jonqui√®re, Quebec. Jonqui√®re was ordered in June 1942 as part of the 1942‚Äì1943 River- class building program. She was laid down on 26 January 1943 by G T Davie Shipbuilding Ltd. at Lauzon and launched 28 October 1943. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 10 May 1944 at Quebec City. Background The River-class frigate was designed by William Reed of Smith's Dock Company of South Bank-on-Tees. Originally called a \\"twin-screw corvette\\", its purpose was to improve on the convoy escort classes in service with the Royal Navy at the time, including the Flower-class corvette. The first orders were placed by the Royal Navy in 1940 and the vessels were named for rivers in the United Kingdom, giving name to the class. In Canada they were named for towns and cities though they kept the same designation. The name \\"frigate\\" was suggested by Vice-Admiral Percy Nelles of the Royal Canadian Navy and was adopted later that year. Improvements over the corvette design included improved accommodation which was markedly better. The twin engines gave only three more knots of speed but extended the range of the ship to nearly double that of a corvette at at 12 knots. Among other lessons applied to the design was an armament package better designed to combat U-boats including a twin 4-inch mount forward and 12-pounder aft. 15 Canadian frigates were initially fitted with a single 4-inch gun forward but with the exception of , they were all eventually upgraded to the double mount. For underwater targets, the River- class frigate was equipped with a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and depth charge rails aft and four side-mounted throwers. River-class frigates were the first Royal Canadian Navy warships to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter in addition to the irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes. Canada originally ordered the construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was too big for the shipyards on the Great Lakes so all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the west coast or along the St. Lawrence River. In all Canada ordered the construction of 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy. Service history After working up at Bermuda, Jonqui√®re returned to Canada and was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-2 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. She made three crossings with the group before being reassigned to escort group EG 26 based out of Derry. During her time with this unit she performed anti-submarine patrols out of derry, Plymouth and Portsmouth until May 1945. In September 1944, Jonqui√®re collided with in Lough Foyle, requiring Assiniboine to return to port for repairs. Jonqui√®re returned to Canada with the last westbound convoy, ON 305, in June 1945. She was paid off 4 December 1945 and placed in reserve at Shelburne. =Postwar service= Jonqui√®re remained there until she was taken to Lauzon and converted into a Prestonian- class escort. This meant a flush-decked appearance aft, with a larger bridge and taller funnel. Her hull forward was strengthened against ice and the quarterdeck was enclosed to contain two Squid anti-submarine mortars. She was recommissioned in the RCN on 20 September 1954 with the pennant FFE 318 at Lauzon. Following her recommissioning, the frigate transferred to the west coast with and . On 1 January 1955, Jonquiere was assigned to the Second Canadian Escort Squadron of Pacific Command. In November 1955, the Second Canadian Escort Squadron was among the Canadian units that took part in one of the largest naval exercises since the Second World War off the coast of California. Jonquiere was a member of the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron based out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. In June 1960 the Fourth Canadian Escort Squadron performed a training tour of the Pacific, with stops at Yokohama, Japan, Midway Atoll and Pearl Harbor. They returned to Canada in August. She served until 23 September 1966 when she was paid off for the last time. She was purchased by Capital Iron & Metal Ltd. of Victoria, British Columbia and broken up there in 1967.

Fort Valley is located very close to the city of Flagstaff. The population as of the 2010 U.S. Census was 779. Demographics  History  Fort Valley is a historical settlement at the base of Mt. Agassiz in Flagstaff, Arizona. It gained its name as a fort that was established to defend against Apache tribes although it was never actually used. Wagon trains migrating from the east came upon Flagstaff and settled here. Many of the old settlements can still be seen today. The primary motivation for this settlement was logging as was true for the rest of Flagstaff. The ponderosa pine forest supplied abundant amounts of timber which were then transported via railroad. The first Fort Valley settlers were Laura and William Murphy in 1881, they belonged to the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. After these first settlers many more followed. Eventually a small community was developed and Fort Valley became a ranching hub in northern Arizona. As ranching took hold in Fort Valley the effect on the environment was devastating. Water sources such as Leroux spring ran dark with silt and the land was becoming a victim of overgrazing. In 1908 Gustaf Adolf Pearson arrived in Fort Valley as a member of the forest service and began to revive the area. Fort Valley was also a popular hub for the scientific community to collect data on recently obtained land in the Southwest. Because of the unique combination of a desert and a mountain environment the area was particularly interesting for geologists, paleontologists, and scientists alike.  Present  Fort Valley remains a settlement today. The suburb of Flagstaff Arizona still holds a number of small farms and ranches. The Leroux spring has been taken over by the city of Flagstaff and the city is considering it as a potential water source. Fort Valley remains a wide open meadow at the base of what is now Snowbowl Road. Much of the past wildlife such as deer, herons, and elk remain in the area.

Until recently there was little evidence unequivocally supporting one side over the other, and in the past many scientists either believed in shallow subduction or its complete non-existence. However, the past two decades have witnessed the potential beginning of a change in geologic understanding as new evidence is increasingly indicative of episodic, non-shallow subduction. The importance of Archean subduction Subduction is the density-driven process by which one tectonic plate moves under another and sinks into the mantle at a convergent boundary. Gravitational pull from dense slabs provides approximately 90% of the driving force for plate tectonics, and consequently subduction is crucial in changing the Earth's layout, guiding its thermal evolution and building its compositional structure. In particular, subduction zones are the primary sites of present-day continental crust formation, another process of modern Earth that has a mysterious past. Furthermore, subduction is the main mechanism by which surface materials enter the deep Earth and is also largely responsible for the formation of ores. Considering the importance of subduction in many geological processes, it is clear that studying its past and present nature is essential to developing our understanding of the Earth as a dynamic system. The case against Archean subduction Those who favour non-existent subduction in the Archean point to the well-established model that the Archean Earth was significantly hotter than it is today, which would have affected lithospheric density in such a way as to perhaps prohibit subduction. The higher temperatures of the Archean Earth can be attributed to the release of tremendous amounts of energy from the accretion of solar system material and subsequent differentiation into core and mantle. This energy, coupled with a greater concentration of heat- producing elements, led to the Earth being 200 K hotter in the Archean than it is today. Assuming seafloor spreading generated oceanic lithosphere in the Archean, higher temperatures led to greater melting of mantle material rising at oceanic spreading centres. This in turn produced thicker oceanic crust and thicker regions of underlying depleted lithospheric mantle. As such, the density of the lithosphere was reduced due to both differentiation of the crust from the mantle and the ensuing relative depletion of the residual mantle in Fe and Al. These expected properties have led to suggestions that oceanic lithosphere was so light that it subducted very shallowly or not at all. Scientists who favour this hypothesis argue that felsic material formed from hydrous partial melting of thickened oceanic crust in the root zones of oceanic plateaus, and not from subduction zones as generally believed. The case for Archean subduction Those who favour Archean subduction claim that recent modelling has elucidated the following fundamental features of the Archean, which they argue can be used to describe why subduction was occurring: 1) Mantle temperatures were indeed 200 K hotter than they are today. 2) The oceanic crust was approximately 21 km thick, compared to 7 km thick today. 3) The depth to which the mantle was partially melted was 114 km, compared to 54 km today. 4) Heat flow into the base of the tectonic plates was 1.3-2.0 times higher than it is today. Mathematical reasoning based on these constraints led to the conclusion that cooling was sufficient to provide a driving force for subduction. In fact, it is thought that the low flexural rigidity of Archean plates perhaps made subduction initiation easier than it is today. On one hand, the lower density of oceanic plates reduced slab pull, but this effect was likely balanced by delamination of low-density crust as well as the passage of thick crust through the eclogite transition. In addition to modelling, geologic evidence has been discovered that further supports the existence of Archean subduction. Many Archean igneous rocks show enrichment of large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) over high-field-strength elements (HFSE), which is a classic subduction signature commonly observed in volcanic arc rocks. Furthermore, the presence of structural thrust belts and paired metamorphic belts are also hallmarks of subduction dynamics and subsequent environmental changes. While the existence of Archean subduction implies that continental crust likely formed via subduction to an extent, it does not require that subduction was the only way to form continental crust. Thus the continued debate over the origin of continental crust cannot be fully resolved by subduction arguments alone. Conclusion and future directions Though the subject of Archean subduction has long been controversial, the emergence of innovative modelling and geologic evidence has begun to sway some of the scientific community toward favouring the existence of non-shallow, episodic subduction. Moving forward, the rheology of early-earth materials should be emphasized in future research as it is not well understood, and therefore subduction dynamics are poorly constrained. Moreover, the paucity of Archean data requires an even better understanding of the links between the Earth's interior and its surface processes if we plan on gaining additional insight into Archean subduction.

He was the 10th President of the Senate of Jamaica, serving from 18 January 2012 to 10 May 2013. A former Moravian minister and the founder of the New Holland Church, Redwood served in leadership positions within several universities before entering politics. After unsuccessful bids for a seat in the Jamaican House of Representatives in 2002 and 2007, he was appointed to the Senate after the 2011 general election. Redwood's decision to resign from the Senate and emigrate to Canada with his family in May 2013 was controversial, although Redwood promised to return to Jamaica after settling his family abroad. Early life Stanley Redwood was born on 3 March 1965 in Joint Wood, Saint Elizabeth Parish, Jamaica. In 1989 Redwood received a Diploma in Ministerial Studies and a Bachelor of Arts in Theology from the United Theological College of the West Indies, and became a Moravian minister. He was appointed to a leadership position over several Moravian Churches in Manchester Parish, to the east of Saint Elizabeth Parish. Redwood would go on to serve in a number of administrative roles in academia. In 1995 he became the Dean of Studies at the Jamaica Bible College. In 1996 he began tutoring and supervising the studies of theological students at the International University of the Caribbean (IUC). He became a full-time employee of the IUC in 2005, and served at different times as a lecturer, regional dean, and assistant vice-president at the IUC. In the late 1990s Redwood also held positions with the Social Development Commission and the National Youth Service. By the time Redwood began his political career, he had been unaffiliated with the Moravian Church, which has a strict prohibition against pastors entering politics, for several years. Subsequent to his break from the Moravian Church, Redwood founded the New Holland Church in Saint Elizabeth Parish. Political career In 2002 Redwood ran for the Saint Elizabeth North West seat in the Jamaican House of Representatives, one of four seats belonging to Saint Elizabeth Parish, as a member of the People's National Party. Redwood claimed that his social work led him into politics, and he campaigned on a platform of bringing infrastructure and a university to the district. His opponent was incumbent representative William J.C. Hutchinson of the Jamaica Labour Party, a first term representative that won the position by 504 votes in a four-way contest during the 1997 general election. A second opponent, Harold Smith of the National Democratic Movement/New Jamaica Alliance, dropped out of the race, citing a medical condition. Although the People's National Party won the 2002 general election overall, Hutchinson retained his seat, defeating Redwood by 247 votes out of 10,903 cast. In 2003 Redwood was a candidate for one of fifteen seats in the Saint Elizabeth North West local government. The seat, representing Ipswich, had been declared vacant after its previous holder failed to appear for several meetings. After the local election was delayed several times, Redwood withdrew for consideration, citing financial strain caused by the ongoing campaign. In the 2007 general election, Redwood ran for the Saint Elizabeth South West seat. The position was held by Donald Buchanan of the People's National Party, who was not seeking re-election. Redwood openly praised Buchanan, and campaigned on continuing his legacy. Redwood's opponent was the Christopher Tufton of the Jamaica Labour Party. In a March 2007 poll, 62% of respondents held favorable views of Tufton, while only 21% held favorable views of Redwood. More respondents (29%) held unfavorable views of Redwood than held favorable views. Garwin Davis of the Jamaica Gleaner posited that Redwood's support of Buchanan may be detrimental to Redwood's campaign, as 59% of respondents held an unfavorable view of the outgoing representative. Additionally, over twice as many respondents had met Tufton than had met Redwood. The Jamaica Labour Party won the general election, and Tufton defeated Redwood by a margin of 1,825 votes out of 17,973 cast. Following the 2011 general election, which saw the People's National Party regain the majority, Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller named Redwood to the Senate of Jamaica, where he was immediately named President of the Senate. He was one of six new senators, and one of five new senators from the ruling People's National Party. Redwood and 62 other new members to the Parliament were sworn in on 17 January 2012. In April 2013, news broke that Redwood would be resigning from the Senate and emigrating to Canada with his family. Redwood formally resigned on 10 May 2013, ending a sixteen-month term in the Jamaican Parliament. Redwood claimed that he filed the application to emigrate to Canada five years before, following his loss in the 2007 general election, and that he did not know if or when his application would be accepted. He expressed a desire to return to Jamaica after settling his family, and to continue to serve Jamaica from abroad, saying \\"I am cognisant of the fact that this decision will inevitably disrupt my service as president of the Senate. I harbour a great deal of ambivalence and reticence in this regard. I am certain, however, that this move will open new doors and create more opportunities for me to continue to serve my beloved country among the growing Jamaican Diaspora in Canada.\\" His decision to move was criticized, however, from both the opposition Jamaica Labour Party and by members of the media. Alando Terrelonge, the legal adviser for Jamaica Labour Party's youth wing, Generation 2000, called his decision \\"cowardice\\", and continued that \\"It is a cause for great concern that Redwood would run faster than the many university graduates and civil servants, who have similar options, but who instead make the sacrifice to fight for the Jamaica we all believe in\\". The Jamaica Gleaners column \\"The Gavel\\" criticized Redwood for campaigning for a \\"Jamaica- first doctrine\\" which would exclude dual-citizens from Parliament, despite having already filed papers to emigrate from Jamaica. In his farewell address to the Senate, Redwood implored the body to move towards full political independence from Great Britain, hold a discussion on adopting nuclear energy, form a powerful anti-corruption agency, and improve Jamaican productivity.

Although the Federation made several demands of the government during the protestsKing and Cushman, Political Communication, 121.Francis, \\"The Progress of Protest in China,\\" 911. and organized multiple demonstrations in the Square,Tony Saich, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Beijing People's Movement,\\" The Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs, no. 24 (July 1, 1990): 190, .Teresa Wright, \\"State Repression and Student Protest in Contemporary China,\\" The China Quarterly 157 (1999): 155, . its primary focus was to obtain government recognition as a legitimate organization.Francis, \\"The Progress of Protest in China,\\" 907. By seeking this recognition, the Federation directly challenged the Chinese Communist Party's authority. After failing to achieve direct dialogue with the government, the Federation lost support from student protesters, and its central leadership role within the Tiananmen Square protests.Saich, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Beijing People's Movement,\\" 198.  Origin  After former General Secretary Hu Yaobang's death on April 15, students mobilized spontaneouslyCalhoun, Neither Gods Nor Emperors, 67. both to mourn Hu's passing and to demand democratic reform in China.King and Cushman, Political Communication, 117. On April 19, at Peking University (Beida), a meeting was anonymously organized to discuss the ongoing protests in the Square, as well as the prospect of forming an autonomous student organization.Wright, \\"State Repression and Student Protest in Contemporary China,\\" 150. The meeting, in essence, was a \\"democracy salon\\"‚Äîan unofficial student discussion group that students at Beida had founded by the former Beida physics graduate student Liu Gang months before Hu Yaobang's death.Li, Li, and Mark, Culture and Politics in China, 155. The salon decided that an autonomous organization was necessary to coordinate student protesters on multiple Beijing campuses. However, for fear of punishment by the government, few at the meeting were willing to speak out. Those who did, including history student Wang Dan, became the leaders of the newly formed Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.Li, Li, and Mark, Culture and Politics in China, 159.Calhoun, Neither Gods Nor Emperors, 39. Another aim of the new Federation was the rejection of the official student organizations. According to one student announcement, \\"the leadership of the original union is inept, has sold out the students' interests‚Ä¶and is completely unable to represent the students' wishes.\\" In this way, the student protesters saw the Federation as representing the wishes of the entire student body. The Federation planned to seek legitimacy by strict observance of democratic policies such as elections and group decision-making.Calhoun, Neither Gods Nor Emperors, 53. The students hoped these methods would ensure the organization's unity of leadership,Francis, \\"The Progress of Protest in China,\\" 908. and would effectively contrast with the lack of transparency they perceived in the Communist Party. On May 23, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation established officially at Liu Gang's residence near Yuanmingyuan, during the first meeting, the students had elected Zhou Yongjun as the first chairman of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.Eddie Cheng, Standoff at Tiananmen (Sensys Corporation, 2009), 88-99. On April 26, People's Daily published the editorial \\"It is Necessary to Take a Clear-Cut Stand Against Turmoil\\",Wright, \\"State Repression and Student Protest in Contemporary China,\\" 154. attributing the protests to \\"a small minority\\" attempting to \\"poison people's minds\\" and \\"create national turmoil.\\"Francis, \\"The Progress of Protest in China,\\" 909.Li, Li, and Mark, Culture and Politics in China, 158. On the same day, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation was officially established. At their meeting, around 2,000 students elected a seven-person committee to lead the Federation. Concerned by the April 26 editorial, the Federation decided that, as an illegal organization, it needed to reinforce its legitimacy by showing its popular support. To achieve this goal, the Federation organized a demonstration to take place on April 27.  Dialogue and Recognition  Between April 16 and 26, the government had dismissed the autonomous students' demands for recognition and dialogue. The government, unwilling to accept the legitimacy of the independent student unions, had attempted instead to arrange talks with individual student leaders. Although the student protesters believed they were acting patriotically and morally,Saich, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Beijing People's Movement,\\" 191. the Communist leadership saw the students' demands as a threat to political and social order.Francis, \\"The Progress of Protest in China,\\" 915. As a result, the students had difficulty obtaining their goal of direct dialogue with the government.Li, Li, and Mark, Culture and Politics in China, 213. After the April 27 student demonstrations, the government held its first dialogue with the Federation leaders on April 29. However, the government avoided direct contact with the Federation, instead inviting student leaders to meet on an individual basis.Calhoun, Neither Gods Nor Emperors, 56. While some students saw the government's offer as a victory, others felt that they should only attend the dialogue as recognized representatives of the Federation. Wuer Kaixi, a Federation leader, attended the dialogue as a \\"private individual\\", but decided to leave midway through to protest the government's lack of recognition of the Federation.Francis, \\"The Progress of Protest in China,\\" 910. Dissatisfied with the dialogue, Wuer Kaixi later described it as a \\"trick of the government to destroy the student solidarity.\\"King and Cushman, Political Communication, 122. During the meeting, State Council spokesman Yuan Mu insisted that the Communist Party and the student protesters shared the same goals. On May 1, the Federation rejected the legitimacy of the April 29 dialogue in a news conference. The following day, the Federation presented a twelve-point petition, including a demand that future government efforts at dialogue be sincere. Although the government rejected this petition, the petition represented a compromise on the students' part, as Amnesty International researcher Corinna-Barbara Francis suggests.Francis, \\"The Progress of Protest in China,\\" 912. That is, instead of demanding explicit government recognition, the students only asked for dialogue \\"on the basis of full equality between the two parties.\\" By May 29, the students' demands were reduced to two: denunciation of the April 26 editorial by the government and acknowledgement of the federation's democratic nature.  Division and Decline  A photo of Pu Zhiqiang, a student protester at Tiananmen, taken on 10 May 1989. On May 4, the Federation successfully organized a demonstration of over 100,000 protesters in Tiananmen Square, marking the 70-year anniversary of the 1919 May 4 Movement. Also on May 4, the Federation decided to end the boycott on class attendance it had begun on April 24.Francis, \\"The Progress of Protest in China,\\" 905. This sudden and unexpected end to the boycott, and loss of momentum in student-government negotiations, resulted in a loss of student enthusiasm for the protests. As student leader Chai Ling noted \\"the movement dwindled to a low point as more and more students returned to classes.\\"Calhoun, Neither Gods Nor Emperors, 59. In an attempt to reinvigorate the movement, Chai Ling and other students started a hunger strike on the Square. Although the Federation initially opposed the hunger strikers during its May 12 meeting, it eventually decided to support individual strikers, but avoided official endorsement of the Hunger Strike Group. As the protests continued throughout May and into June, the Hunger Strike Group would take control of events in the Square, and would largely displace the authority previously held by the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.Calhoun, Neither Gods Nor Emperors, 83.Dingxin Zhao, The Power of Tiananmen: State- Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement (University of Chicago Press, 2008), 179.  Government Response  Speaking with Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang on May 4, Premier Li Peng voiced his concern over the ongoing protests in the Square.Liang Zhang, Andrew J Nathan, and E. Perry Link, The Tiananmen Papers (New York: PublicAffairs, 2002), 117. While Zhao Ziyang contended that the April 26 editorial had encouraged student protesters, Li Peng contended that this was too simple an explanation for the growth of the protest movement, suggesting that the April 26 editorial \\"did not accuse the vast majority of students of creating turmoil.\\" Li Peng also opposed to the student protester's demands for negotiation.Zhang, Nathan, and Link, The Tiananmen Papers, 118. Voicing concern over the rising prominence of the \\"illegal student organizations,\\" Li objected to the Federation's desire \\"to negotiate with the Party and government as equals\\" and saw the students' twelve-point petition as a \\"threat.\\" In his conversation with Zhao, Li also asserted that the Federation's primary goal was to \\"negate the leadership of the CCP and negate the entire socialist system.\\" On May 13, after the hunger striker's announced their plan, Yan Mingfu, Director of the Party's United Front Work Department, met with a number of intellectuals and student protesters, including Wang Dan, Chai Ling, and Wuer Kaixi.Zhang, Nathan, and Link, The Tiananmen Papers, 158. At the meeting, Yan Mingfu suggested that if the student protesters stopped their hunger strike and instead submitted their \\"demands and suggestions through proper channels,\\" he could assure them that \\"the door to dialogue\\" would remain open.Zhang, Nathan, and Link, The Tiananmen Papers, 159. However, when he later briefed Zhao Ziyang on the meeting, Yan Mingfu shared his unease at the divisions he observed among the student protesters: \\"the AFS [the Federation], the Dialogue Delegation, and representatives of the hunger strikers‚Ä¶are in disagreement among themselves‚Ä¶I'm not sure any of them truly represents the hunger strikers or can exert any influence on them.\\"  See also  * Finances of Student Organizations during the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989  References   Sources Cited  * Calhoun, Craig J. 1994.

History  The \\"Udo the Red Panda\\" mascot officially debuted at the 2011 WHU Euromasters, when Mannheim beat LMU at during the championships. Since then, the mascot has been a fan favorite for Mannheim's athletics fans. As the Mannheim athletics teams do not have a logo on their helmets or uniforms, Udo's likeness appears on much team merchandise and such.  Description and Rationale  The red panda (Latin: Ailurus fulgens), also known as lesser panda or red cat-bear, is a small arboreal mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China that has been classified as Vulnerable by IUCN as its wild population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals. The population continues to decline and is threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression, although red pandas are protected by national laws in their range countries. The Mannheim sports teams have elected the red panda for their favorite athletics mascot to make the problem of the declining population of this mammal more visible; in addition, the red panda is one of the visitor magnets at the Heidelberg Zoo which is the next larger zoo to Mannheim.

Early life and family Johnson was born in Chesterfield, New Hampshire. He became a farmer and farmed near Pomfret, Vermont. In 1818, he moved to Hiram, Ohio, where he purchased land and became a prominent member of the Methodist Church.Luke Johnson, \\"History of Luke Johnson,\\" Millennial Star 26 (31 December 1864): p. 834‚Äì36. He was married to Mary Elsa Jacobs; they were the parents of nine children, including Luke and Lyman.Keith Perkins, \\"A House Divided: The John Johnson Family\\", Ensign, February 1979. Their daughter Marinda married Orson Hyde. Conversion to Mormonism In early 1831, Johnson's sons Luke and Lyman were baptized into the Church of Christ, which had been founded by Joseph Smith the previous year. After their sons were baptized, Johnson and his wife travelled with Methodist preacher Ezra Booth to Kirtland, Ohio to learn more about the church. While in Kirtland, Johnson's wife reported that she experienced a miraculous healing at the hands of Smith: > \\"Elsa Johnson had been afflicted for many years with a rheumatic arm. She > experienced so much pain and difficulty in movement that for two years she > hadn‚Äôt been able to raise her hand to her head. As the Johnsons and others > from the Hiram area visited with Joseph Smith in the Newel K. Whitney home, > they discussed the gifts of the Spirit as held in the early Church. Someone > asked whether God had given power to men today to heal people like Elsa > Johnson. After the conversation had turned to another subject, the Prophet > [Smith] walked up to Elsa and said, 'Woman, in the name of the Lord Jesus > Christ I command thee to be whole,' and then he walked out of the room. Elsa > was instantly healed, and the next day she did her washing 'without > difficulty or pain.'\\" As a result, Johnson, his wife, and Booth were converted to Mormonism and became members of the Church of Christ. Johnson was baptized by Smith. Johnson invited Smith and his wife and children to live at the Johnson farm, which served as the headquarters of the church from September 1831 to March 1832. While living at the farm, Smith recorded a number of revelations which are included in the Doctrine and Covenants and continued his translation of the Bible. Church leadership In 1833, Johnson and his wife moved to Kirtland, Ohio, where they opened an inn next to the store owned by Newel K. Whitney. Johnson was ordained as an elder in the church on February 17, 1833, and as a high priest on June 4, 1833. On February 17, 1834, Johnson was appointed as one of the founding members of the church's first high council in Kirtland. In 1835, Johnson's sons Luke and Lyman were selected as two of founding members of the Quorum of the Twelve. While in Kirtland, Johnson assisted with the building of the Kirtland Temple and allowed his inn to be used for the display of a number of Egyptian mummies that Smith had purchased. Smith used scrolls that accompanied the mummies to produce the Book of Abraham. Disaffection from Mormonism Johnson was a charter member of Smith's Kirtland Safety Society, which failed in the mid-1830s. In 1836 and 1837, Johnson was sued a number of times for non-payment of debts. In the midst of these difficulties, Johnson's presence on the high council was objected to on September 3, 1837, and he was dropped from the body.Joseph Smith (B. H. Roberts ed.), History of the Church 2:510. Some sources report that he was excommunicated from the church.Andrew Jenson, The Historical Record (Salt Lake City, 1889) p. 32. A more recent work indicates that the official position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that Johnson did not lose his membership.Michael R. Caldwell, The John Johnson Family of Hiram, Ohio (Salt Lake City Utah: Outskirts Press, 2016). Death Johnson remained in Kirtland when the Latter Day Saints moved on to Missouri. He died in Kirtland and is buried in the Kirtland Cemetery across the street from the Kirtland Temple.

Born in New York City, Goldsmith's family moved to Cuba for a year in 1938, to aid European Jews seeking to escape antisemitic persecution. Goldsmith studied at the Manhattan School of Music under Robert Goldsand. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in music from the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied with Robert Goldsand as a piano student. His early musical influences included conductors Arturo Toscanini and Guido Cantelli, and he was deeply affected by Cantelli's death in 1956. Goldsmith, known among his peers as an opinionated musician, was recommended by one of his instructors to become a music critic. Goldsmith began writing music criticism as a record reviewer for High Fidelity in 1960,Harris Goldsmith, \\"Young Artists: The Thrill of Discovery\\" MusicalAmerica (2004). where he became an influential voice during the \\"heyday of the classical LP\\". His friends claimed that he could remember \\"every note of music he's ever heard\\". In a 2013 interview with New York City culture critic Sara Fishko, he recalled a performance by Toscanini 60 years earlier: \\"The one that really blew me away is the Eroica he did on December 6, 1953, because I already was well familiar with the piece from his 1949 recording\\". While Goldsmith could be effusive over performances, he became well known early in his criticism career for his barbed reviews. Remembering a review of Chopin preludes performed by Alexander Brailowsky, he said, \\"I really roasted it... I said, 'Alexander Brailowsky indulges in cliches and vagaries of taste. His performance is grotesque, fragmentary and clumsy.'\\" He went on to write for High Fidelitys successor publication, Musical America, as well as contributing to Opus, the New York Post, and The New York Times. He also provided liner notes for many re-releases of classical music recordings, and organized a 12 disc set recordings by Guido Cantelli, which he annotated. He shared a 1995 Grammy Award for Best Historical Album for his liner notes accompanying The Heifetz Collection. Goldsmith played his debut piano performance in April 1965 at New York City's Town Hall. He made a number of recordings for various record labels in the 1970s, including a collection of Beethoven sonatas, and other releases of works by Johannes Brahms, Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann. Goldsmith was also a music teacher himself. He was a visiting professor at Binghamton University, gave classes at the Eastman School of Music, and coached students at the Yale Summer School of Music. He was a professor of music literature and chamber music at Mannes College from 1994 until his death. Students he has worked with include noted pianists Cecile Licad and Jenny Lin.

It was incorporated as a non-profit institution in 1896. The objective of the Avery Memorial Association is the collection and preservation of objects, documents, memorabilia, buildings, and places which have been connected with members of the family of Captain James Avery of Groton, CT, particularly to maintain the site of the home built about 1656 at Poquonnock Plains, which was occupied by descendants of Captain James Avery until completely destroyed by fire on July 20, 1894, and the memorial monument thereon; also, to provide and preserve such further monumental or other memorials or buildings as may fitly commemorate the distinguished services rendered by the said Captain James Avery or his descendants to the Colony or the State of Connecticut, including the Ebenezer Avery House now located on the grounds of Fort Griswold in Groton; also, to explore the historical background of Connecticut, particularly New London County, and to publish or otherwise make available to the public, including schools, such findings as in any way will further enhance public appreciation and knowledge of the local historical heritage and, finally, to do any and all things which relate directly or indirectly to any of the above exclusive purposes which will advance such purposes. The Avery Memorial Association has undertaken two major projects, the first being the raison d'√™tre, preservation of the Avery Monument, and the restoration & operation of the Ebenezer Avery House, a historic house museum. There are two kinds of membership: Regular Members (who are able to prove their lineage linking them to the Groton Avery Clan) and Friends. The Association holds a meeting/reunion every year in the Groton, CT area.  History  The old Avery Homestead, nicknamed \\"The Hive\\" or \\"Avery Hive\\", was built around 1656 at Poquonnock Plains, and was improved upon by the second Captain James Avery who removed \\"the unadorned church and watch-tower of the wilderness\\" in 1684 and carried the materials back to the house and used them in its improvement. Seven generations of the Avery family lived in the house for over 230 years until it was destroyed on July 20, 1894 from a spark from the engine of a passing steam train. The Groton Avery Clan formed the Avery Memorial Association in 1895 to memorialize the beginnings of the Avery Clan in the Connecticut Colony. The following year it was incorporated as a non-profit, charitable, cultural and educational institution for historic preservation.  Presidents  1895 - 1896 James D.

The monument was rededicated on its centennial by Cooper Avery Johnson in front of a crowd of 100 Avery descendants.  Ebenezer Avery House  The Ebenezer Avery House was originally located on the corner of Latham and Thames Streets in Groton, Connecticut. Ebenezer Avery was a tailor. His house is believed to have been constructed in the 1760s. It was the location where the British brought the injured soldiers after the Battle of Groton Heights on September 6, 1781. In 1971, the house was moved from its original location closer to the site of the Battle of Groton Heights to Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park in Groton and restored. Though it stands in a state park, the historic house museum continues to be maintained by the Avery Memorial Association.

Located in Roxburghshire, near to Hermitage Castle, it was probably made between 2000 BC and 1250 BC, during the Late Neolithic or early Bronze Age (Bronze Age technology reached the Borders around 1750 BC). It is a scheduled monument (a nationally important archaeological site given special protections) and is part of a group with two other nearby ancient sites, these being Buck Stone standing stone and another standing stone at Greystone Hill. Settlements appear to have developed in the vicinity of these earlier ritual features in late prehistory and probably earlier. The circle (actually slightly oval in form) consists of eight stones fast in the earth (a ninth stone has fallen inwards and lies flat), but six of these are now just stumps of or less. Of the two large standing stones remaining, one is a regular monolith a little under tall and the other, a pointed stone, is a little over tall. According to the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, a number of similar circles formerly existed in the immediate area; the stones have been removed, but the hollow in the center of each circle and marks in the earth showing the former positions of the stones are still visible. In the immediate area there is also a street of circular pits deep which may have formed the shelters of the people who set up the circles, although this is not certain. Ninestane Rig is actually the name of the low hill ( high, long and broad) atop which the stone circle stands but is also usually used to designate the circle itself (which is also sometimes called Nine Stones, not be confused with the Nine Stones circle near Winterbourne Abbas in Dorset or the Nine Stones at Altarnun in Cornwall, nor Nine Stone Rig in East Lothian or Nine Standards Rigg in Cumbria.) Legendary boiling of William II de Soules According to legend, William II de Soules, who was lord of Hermitage Castle, was arrested and boiled alive by his tenants at the site in 1320 in a cauldron suspended from the two large stones, on account of being a particularly oppressive and cruel landlord. Quoted in (Bartholomew writes of the \\"burning to death\\" rather than \\"boiling\\" of Lord Soulis.) William was also a traitor (he conspired against Robert the Bruce) and, according to Walter Scott, by local reputation a sorcerer. In John Leyden's ballad Lord Soulis, William's mastery of the black arts (provided by his redcap familiar spirit and also learned from Michael Scot) was such that rope could not hold him, nor steel harm him, so (after True Thomas, who was present, had tried and failed to make magical ropes of sand) he was wrapped in a sheet of lead and boiled. According to Leyden's ballad, in his time (1775‚Äì1811) the locals still displayed the supposed cauldron used: However, William II de Soules was not actually boiled alive but died in prison in Dumbarton Castle, probably sometime before 20 April 1321 (and Leyden's kettle was actually a relic of the Old Pretender's rebel army of 1715, according to Walter Scott). Reported in It is believed that an earlier ancestor Ranulf II de Soules was killed in his teens by his servants in 1207 or 1208, on grounds of general vileness and wickedness; whether or not William's fate became commingled with Ranulf's in local oral tradition is now impossible to determine. Scott notes that \\"The tradition regarding the death of Lord Soulis, however singular, is not without a parallel in the real history of Scotland.\\"  See also  * List of stone circles in the Scottish Borders Notes References Category:Stone circles in the Scottish Borders Category:Archaeological sites in the Scottish Borders Category:Scheduled monuments in Scotland ","title":"Ninestane Rig"},{"id":"42394982","text":"Erythronium quinaultense, the Quinault fawn-lily, is a rare plant species endemic to a small region around Lake Quinault in Olympic National Park, Washington state, United States.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesFlora of North America v 26 p 158 Erythronium quinaultense produces egg-shaped bulbs up to 75 mm long.

They set the standards and examinations for medical doctors aiming to become ophthalmologists, and provide surgical skills training, as well as services to those who have completed their training.  History  Historically, treatments for eye diseases were the preserve of much itinerant charlatanry, such as 'couching', or displacement of dense cataract with a needle, which led to brief improvements but very high complications and blindness in more than 70%, although the Sushruta Samhita described improvements to this as far back as 800 BC. The return of many soldiers from Napoleonic campaigns suffering an epidemic of trachoma, however, spurred the foundation of Moorfields Eye Hospital in 1805 by surgeon John Cunningham Saunders, with encouragement from Astley Cooper. This led to institutions in Exeter, Bristol and Manchester, and a second in London, by 1816. This in turn led to the opening of ophthalmology departments in general hospitals during the 19th century. Despite this and the appointment of John Freke back in 1727 as the first surgeon specialising in eye diseases, many ophthalmologists of the day did not fully specialise and ophthalmology remained as a branch of general surgery under the √¶gis of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. As the specialisation of the field increased, the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom was founded in 1890 by Sir William Bowman, which held annual scientific meetings to further ophthalmic practice. The Faculty of Ophthalmologists was founded as a professional body in 1946 by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder as an offshoot of the Royal College of Surgeons. These two institutions merged in 1988 to form the College of Ophthalmologists; royal licence was granted five years later. The college was based in 17 Cornwall Terrace, Regent's Park in London, walking distance from the Royal College of Physicians, but has relocated to larger premises in 18‚Äì20 Stephenson Way near the Royal College of General Practitioners and Euston Station.  Today  The College sets and examines standards for training as an ophthalmologist in the UK and is the only College whose qualification leads to access to the GMC Specialist Register in Ophthalmology (CCST) and publishes the research journal Eye, part of the Nature Publishing Group. It also represents ophthalmologists working and training in the UK. Fulfilling the requirements set by the College entitles doctors to the following post-nominal letters in increasing seniority: * Membership (MRCOphth) * Fellowship (FRCOphth) Membership, once a prerequisite for fellowship, is becoming a separate qualification demonstrating core ophthalmological knowledge, as training in the UK has largely eliminated the SHO/registrar distinction in the field. Fellowship of the college (or its Scottish equivalents) is a necessary (but not sufficient) prerequisite for qualifying from training in the UK. It is also considered broadly equivalent to similar qualifications in the Commonwealth such as FRANZCO and the FRCSI (Ophth). As a surgical speciality, and having originated as part of the Royal College of Surgeons, fellows generally take the title Mr, Mrs, Miss or Ms, rather than Dr, although there are exceptions. The college also offers the Certificate in Laser Refractive Surgery as an additional qualification, and the Duke-Elder Prize Examination, a yearly competitive examination for medical undergraduates in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The president to 2020 was Michael Burdon, who has passed the role on to Bernie Chang. In January 2020 Mike Burdon, the college President at the time, said the specialty was in a ‚Äúpredictable mess‚Äù after it was reported that large numbers of patients had suffered permanent or long-term harm to their eyes after waiting too long for a follow-up appointment. He said ‚Äúfundamentally there are not enough doctors, equipment or space‚Äù. There were 150 vacant posts for consultant ophthalmologists because there not enough training posts. Increases in the number of patients with glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy has led to increased demand of around 6% a year.

The City of El Segundo objected to the sale.

In January 2014 Northrop had moved its employees out of the building and to Redondo Beach. On January 13 of that year, the ownership changed from Douglas Property Holdings Co., LLC. to Continental Development Corp., a company owned by El Segundo landowner Richard Lundquist. On the same day the Wiseburn district assumed ownership, taking it from Continental Development Corp. The renovation will be designed by the architecture company Gensler. The district plans to retain about 66% of the existing building and remove the rest of it. The district plans to use four floors, with each floor the equivalent of one and one half soccer fields. The district plans to establish an atrium inside the building. The Wiseburn School District plans call for building an auditorium and a gymnasium separate from the existing structure. The district offices will also be moving from their current location to offices on the first floor of the new building The 2010 school bond will provide the funding for the construction.

Early life and career  Hudeidi was born in Berbera in 1928 and raised in Yemen, where his father was a police sergeant. Hudeidi was always fascinated by music, and fell in love with the oud when his father took him to a party in Aden where an Arab man was playing the instrument. He learned how to play it from Abdullahi Qarshe, who advised Hudeydi's father to buy his son an oud and a pick as well as books and writing instruments for school. During the 1950s and 1960s, Hudeidi lived in Yemen, Somaliland, and Djibouti, playing the oud and getting into trouble for singing politically rebellious songs as well as from rival musicians. In 1973 he moved to the United Kingdom, where he performed at private functions such as family weddings and taught others how to play the oud.

It is thick and sweet because of its high ratio of sugar to water. Grape syrup is made by boiling grapes, removing their skins, squeezing them through a sieve to extract the juice, and adding sugar. Like other fruit syrups, a common use of grape syrup is as a topping to sweet cakes, such as pancakes or waffles.  Names and etymology  The ancient Greek name for grape syrup is ·ºïœàŒ∑ŒºŒ± (epsima), which translates to 'boiled'.The Online Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek- English Lexicon s.v. The Greek name was used in Crete and, in modern times, in Cyprus. Petimezi is the name for a type of Mediterranean grape syrup. The word comes from the Turkish pekmez, which usually refers to grape syrup, but is also used to refer to mulberry and other fruit syrups.Dictionary of the T√ºrk Dil KurumuA.D. Alderson and Fahir ƒ∞z, The Concise Oxford Turkish Dictionary Vincotto (not to be confused with vino cotto) is the southern Italian term for grape syrup. It is made only from cooked wine grape must (mosto cotto), with no fermentation involved. There is no alcohol or vinegar content, and no additives, preservatives or sweeteners are added. It is both a condiment and ingredient used in either sweet or savory dishes.  History  = Greco- Roman = One of the earliest mentions of grape syrup comes from the fifth- century BC Greek physician Hippocrates, who refers to h√©psƒìma (·ºïœàŒ∑ŒºŒ±), the Greek name for the condiment.Jacques Jouanna Greek Medicine from Hippocrates to Galen: Selected Papers, 2012, p. 190. The fifth-century BC Athenian playwright Aristophanes also makes a reference to it, as does Roman-era Greek physician Galen. Grape syrup was known by different names in Ancient Roman cuisine depending on the boiling procedure. Defrutum, carenum, and sapa were reductions of must. They were made by boiling down grape juice or must in large kettles until it had been reduced to two-thirds of the original volume, carenum; half the original volume, defrutum; or one-third, sapa. Roman general Pliny the Elder states that grape syrup was also referred to as siraion (Greek: \\"œÉŒØœÅŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ\\").The Online Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek-English Lexicon s.v.Pliny the Elder, The Natural History 14:11 The main culinary use of defrutum was to help preserve and sweeten wine, but it was also added to fruit and meat dishes as a sweetening and souring agent and even given to food animals such as ducks and suckling pigs to improve the taste of their flesh. Defrutum was mixed with garum to make the popular condiment oenogarum. Quince and melon were preserved in defrutum and honey through the winter, and some Roman women used defrutum or sapa as a cosmetic. Defrutum was often used as a food preservative in provisions for Roman troops. There is some confusion as the amount of reduction for sapa and defrutum. As James Grout explains in its Encyclopedia Romana, authors informed different reductions, as follows: \\"The elder Cato, Columella, and Pliny all describe how unfermented grape juice (mustum, must) was boiled to concentrate its natural sugars. \\"A product of art, not of nature,\\" the must was reduced to one half (defrutum) or even one third its volume (sapa) (Pliny, XIV.80), although the terms are not always consistent. Columella identifies defrutum as \\"must of the sweetest possible flavour\\" that has been boiled down to a third of its volume (XXI.1). Isidore of Seville, writing in the seventh century AD, says that it is sapa that has been reduced by a third but goes on to imagine that defrutum is so called because it has been cheated or defrauded (defrudare) (Etymologies, XX.3.15). Varro reverses Pliny's proportions altogether (quoted in Nonius Marcellus, De Conpendiosa Doctrina, XVIII.551M).\\" Defrutum is mentioned in almost all Roman books dealing with cooking or household management. Pliny the Elder recommended that defrutum only be boiled at the time of the new moon, while Cato the Censor suggested that only the sweetest possible defrutum should be used. In ancient Rome, grape syrup was often boiled in lead pots, which sweetened the syrup through the leaching of the sweet-tasting chemical compound lead acetate into the syrup. Incidentally, this is thought to have caused lead poisoning for Romans consuming the syrup. A 2009 History Channel documentary produced a batch of historically accurate defrutum in lead-lined vessels and tested the liquid, finding a lead level of 29,000 parts per billion (ppb), which is 2,900 times higher than contemporary American drinking water limit of 10 ppb. These levels are easily high enough to cause either acute lead toxicity if consumed in large amounts or chronic lead poisoning when consumed in smaller quantities over a longer period of time (as defrutum was typically used). However, the use of leaden cookware, though popular, was not the general standard of use. Copper cookware was used far more generally and no indication exists as to how often sapa was added or in what quantity. There is not, however, scholarly agreement on the circumstances and quantity of lead in these ancient Roman condiments. For instance, the original research was done by Jerome Nriagu, but was criticized by John Scarborough, a pharmacologist and classicist, who characterized Nriagu's research as \\"so full of false evidence, miscitations, typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that the reader cannot trust the basic arguments.\\" = Modern =  Cyprus  The ancient Greek name h√©psƒìma (now pronounced √©psƒìma in Cypriot Greek) is still used to refer to the condiment, which is still made in Cyprus.  Greece  Petimezi (Greek: œÄŒµœÑŒπŒºŒ≠Œ∂Œπ ), also called epsima (Œ≠œàŒ∑ŒºŒ±) and in English \\"grapemust\\" or \\"grape molasses\\", is a syrup that is reduced until it becomes dark and syrupy. Petimezi keeps indefinitely. Its flavor is sweet with slightly bitter undertones. The syrup may be light or dark colored, depending on the grapes used. Before the wide availability of inexpensive cane sugar, petimezi was a common sweetener in Greek cooking, along with carob syrup and honey. Petimezi is still used today in desserts and as a sweet topping for some foods. Though petimezi can be homemade, it is also sold commercially under different brand names. Fruits and vegetables that have been candied by boiling in petimezi (epsima) are called retselia. From late August until the beginning of December, many Greek bakeries sell dark crunchy and fragrant petimezi cookies, moustoko√∫loura (Greek: ŒºŒøœÖœÉœÑŒøŒ∫ŒøœçŒªŒøœÖœÅŒ±), are made. Petimezopita (Greek: œÄŒµœÑŒπŒºŒµŒ∂œåœÄŒπœÑŒ±) is a spiced cake with petimezi.  Iran  In Iranian cuisine, grape syrup (in ) is used to sweeten ardeh (tahini), which is consumed at breakfast. An alternative is date syrup, which is also widely used in Middle Eastern cooking.  Italy  Saba, (from the Latin word sapa, with the same meaning), vincotto or vino cotto is commonly used in Italy, especially in the regions of Emilia Romagna, Marche, Calabria, and Sardinia, where it is considered a traditional flavor.  Spain  Honey arrope flask. Arrope is a form of grape concentrate typically produced in Spain. Often derived from grape varieties such as Pedro Xim√©nez, it is made by boiling unfermented grape juice until the volume is reduced by at least 50%, and its viscosity reduced to a syrup. The final product is a thick liquid with cooked caramel flavours, and its use is frequent as an additive for dark, sweet wines such as sweet styles of sherry, Malaga, and Marsala.

Biography He was born in Bologna, Italy, in 1819, where at the age of fourteen he became apprentice of the Bolognese artist Giovanni Battista Frulli. There, he studied art of the antiquity as well as local artists, including the Carracci and Guido Reni. Frulli died in 1837, and Gregori then worked for Prince Pignatelli of Monteleone, and he traveled throughout Italy, including studying in Milan and Naples. In 1840, he moved to Rome and enrolled at the Accademia di San Luca and studied under Tommaso Minardi. Minardi was a major proponent of the Purismo movement, which rejected the popular neoclassicism and aimed to emulate Quattrocento artists such as Fra Angelico and Pietro Perugino. Minardi and Purismo as a whole influenced Gregori greatly, and he intensely studied the fifteenth-century masters. Gregori was also inspired by Purismo's focus on a return to religious and devotional imagery, in contrast to increasingly secular trends. After his training at the academy, he was hired as artist in residence at the Vatican, where he was commissioned a portrait of Pope Pius IX. However, he may have been frustrated by Pius's focus on restoring old Vatican artwork rather than creating new pieces. In 1874 he was invited by Rev. Edward Sorin, who was visiting the papal court, to be artist in residence at the University of Notre Dame, where he stayed for seventeen years. There he produced most of his works, and decorated the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, the Main building, St. Edward's Hall and others. In 1890 he returned to Italy, where he won a golden medal for the arts. He died in Florence in 1896. Works From 1868 to 1892 he worked in the Church of the Sacred Heart (now Basilica of the Sacred Heart) at Notre Dame, painting the nave, the transept, the ceilings and the apse with religious figures featuring mainly Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and the Saints and Doctors of the Church. From 1874 to 1877 he painted the stations of the Cross. In late 1875, Sorin and other passengers were stranded for three weeks on the steamship L'Amerique after its shaft broke. The next January, Sorin commissioned Gregori to make a painting in gratitude for his rescue; Gregori painted a mural depicting Jesus walking on water on the back wall of the church. The artwork was painted over during renovations between 1951 and 1977, however. In 1880 he was commissioned by Rev. Sorin to create the Columbus murals, a series of twelve murals depicting the life and voyages of the Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus inside the Main Building.

Built in 1880, it is a regionally rare example of vernacular Stick/Eastlake style architecture, located in an area that has predominantly even older buildings. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Drewsville Mansion is sited prominently at the southern end of the Drewsville village green, on the east side of Old Cheshire Turnpike. It is a rambling -story wood frame structure, with a clapboarded exterior and hip roof. The main facade is sheltered by a single-story porch with a jigsaw-cut decorative frieze, and a second-story bay projects over the porch above the main entrance. This bay has decorative stickwork and curving brackets. The interior of the house has retained much of its original finish, despite being subdivided into apartments and suffering fire damage in one wing. The mansion was built in 1880 for Bolivar and Sarah Lathrop Lovell. It was probably designed by William P. Wentworth of Boston, Massachusetts, who is credited with a small number of similar Stick-style buildings in Walpole which were built about the same time. Sarah Lathrop Lovell's father was a local sheriff, postmaster, and hotel operator, and was one of Drewsville's wealthiest residents. Bolivar Lovell's father was a prominent lawyer and businessman from Alstead, New Hampshire. The property was sold out of the family by their daughter in 1910, and was subdivided into apartments through the mid-20th century.

The construction date is unknown, but it is believed to be from the 1760s and was the house of Ebenezer Avery. It was the home where the British brought their injured soldiers after the Battle of Groton Heights on September 6, 1781. In 1971, the house was moved to Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park in Groton and restored. The historic house museum is maintained by the Avery Memorial Association.  History  Constructed around the 1760s, the Ebenezer Avery House is a 10-room house was owned by Ensign Ebenezer Avery. It was originally located on Latham Street and Thames Street in Groton, Connecticut. Avery was a tailor that answered the call for battle on September 6, 1781 and went to defend of Fort Griswold from British attack. The Battle of Groton Heights ended with the American defeat and the deaths of its leader, Lieutenant Colonel William Ledyard and resulted in nearly 100 families being left homeless and much of the town's waterfront. Part of the Ebenezer Avery House history is how it came to be used after the battle while its owner was absent. Some of the wounded from the battle, those unable to walk, including Stephen Hempstead, were taken prisoner and placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet. The British men allowed the wagon to run down the hill, where it stopped when it struck a tree, throwing some of the men off the wagon and aggravated their injuries. The wounded were set upon the beach in preparation for the boat trip to New York, but Ebenezer Ledyard, the brother of William Ledyard, offered himself as hostage. The British took the wounded to Ebenezer Avery's house and placed Ebenezer Avery and other wounded inside and had them \\"parolled\\". The house was later set on fire with the men inside and \\"with difficulty extinguished\\". In the battle, Avery was shot in the neck \\"which cut the cords, and left him senseless as one of the dead.\\" Hempstead said that thirty-five men had been laid upon the floor and the British left them, unattended and uncovered, until Dr. Downer and Dr. Prentiss arrived. Ebenezer Avery recovered, but lost his hearing, and continued to live in the house until his death on January 11, 1828 at age 81. The blood stains were still visible at the time of the centennial of the battle in 1881, but no longer are present. In 1896, the Thomas Starr Society placed a memorial tablet on the site.  Move and restoration  In 1970, the Ebenezer Avery House was in danger of being torn down to construct apartments and it was purchased by R. Stanton Avery. R. Stanton Avery purchased the property with the intention of turning it over to the Avery Memorial Association. Edwin Park, an architect, assessed the house as in need of extensive reconstruction and the association discussed the plan to move the house to Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park. A meeting held on the association on July 24, 1971, was held to discuss the movement plan which involved disassembling and reassembling the house at its new location. The project to move the house was a shared cost between R. Stanton Avery and the Avery Memorial Association. By the 1972 meeting, the total cost of the relocation was $43,000 and the act provoked interest from the State of Connecticut. The house was donated to the State of Connecticut for use as a historic house museum. In 1973, the association debated over the sale of land to cover costs of restoring and maintaining the Ebenezer Avery House. The total cost of the move was listed at $80,000 with an expected $3000 per year and the intention was to serve have enough income generated by interest to cover the cost of the house. The Association owned 1.3 acres, but would reserve the .3 acre upon which the Avery Monument is located. In May 1975, the Ebenezer Avery House was opened after being restored to its \\"original condition\\" and filled with period items including Lieutenant Ebenezer Avery's sword, a cousin of Ensign Ebenezer Avery, killed in the Battle of Groton Heights. According to Leary, bricks from the Fitz-John Winthrop house, located in Bluff Point State Park were reclaimed and used to reconstruct the chimney of the Ebenezer Avery House. Fitz-John Winthrop's house was a sixteen room mansion that fell into disrepair before being destroyed by a fire in 1962. As of 2014, the Ebenezer Avery House is opened from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend from 12:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.

Built in 1839, it is an unusually elaborate and sophisticated example of Greek Revival architecture, given its small-town setting. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The Peck-Porter House stands just south of Walpole's small commercial district, on the west side of Main Street at its northwest corner with Middle Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its front facade is three bays wide, sheltered by a two-story portico supported by fluted Doric columns. The columns rise to an entablature and a fully pedimented gable with a rounded fan at its center. The side elevations have matching single story porches supported by fluted columns. The interior retains many original period features, including a particularly fine spiral staircase and six fireplace mantels. An ell extending to the rear of the house contains evidence of older construction, suggesting it may have been at least part of the original c. 1790s house on the property. The main block of the house was built in 1839 for Philip Peck, owner of a local dry goods business.

The Ben Tre Province is nicknamed by Vietnamese as the \\"Land of Coconut\\" (Xu Dua). The Vietnamese term for coconut candy is \\"k·∫πo d·ª´a\\", with k·∫πo = candy and d·ª´a = coconut. Coconut candy was originally associated with Mo Cay, a small township within the Ben Tre province. Manufacturing process The production of coconut candy starts with the grating of fresh coconut flesh. The grated flesh is then pressed to extract coconut milk and coconut cream. The next step is the addition of malt syrup and sugar to this mixture of coconut milk and cream. The ratio of the various ingredients is a closely guarded secret of individual coconut candy manufacturers. The mixing process is often entrusted only to family members of the factory owner. Slight variations in the ingredient ratios can lead to very different texture and taste in the final product. The mixture is then heated to a very high temperature in large woks over fires generated by the burning of coconut shells. While being heated, the mixture is stirred continuously to ensure even heat distribution. Traditionally, this stirring process was done manually with large wooden paddles. In larger modern manufacturing facilities, these paddles have been replaced by electric motors. The mixture eventually caramelises to a thicker texture. Recognising when the mixture has been cooked to the right level is more of an art than an exact science. While it is still hot and soft, the thickened mixture is then stringed out into moulds and allowed to cool. The final step sees the candy strings cut into rectangular lozenges, then wrapped and packaged. Traditionally, coconut candy is wrapped in two layers of wrappings. The inner layer is edible rice paper, and the outer layer is paper soaked in vegetable oil. These measures were necessary to stop the candy from sticking to the paper wrapping. Larger manufacturers now use heat-sealed foil paper, which does not stick to the candy.

However, the market is dominated by a handful of well-known brands, with most manufacturers producing candy under licence for these brands. Coconut candy is sold throughout Vietnam. It is also exported to other Asian countries, Australia, Europe and North America.

The concept has been discussed and put into practice in both the European Union (EU) and in Argentina since 2006. The issue has arisen from desires of individuals to \\"determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically stigmatized as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past.\\" There has been controversy about the practicality of establishing a right to be forgotten (in respect to access of information) as an international human right. This is partly due to the vagueness of current rulings attempting to implement such a right. Furthermore, there are concerns about its impact on the right to freedom of expression, its interaction with the right to privacy, and whether creating a right to be forgotten would decrease the quality of the Internet through censorship and the rewriting of history. Those in favor of the right to be forgotten cite its necessity due to issues such as revenge porn sites appearing in search engine listings for a person's name, as well as instances of these results referencing petty crimes individuals may have committed in the past. The central concern lies in the potentially undue influence that such results may exert upon a person's online reputation almost indefinitely if not removed. Conception and proposal Europe's data protection legislations are intended to secure potentially damaging private information about individuals but instead of a \\"right to be forgotten\\" a more limited \\"right to [data] erasure\\" is implemented. The notion of \\"the right to be forgotten\\" is derived from numerous pre-existing European ideas. There is a longstanding belief in the United Kingdom, specifically under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, that after a certain period of time, many criminal convictions are \\"spent\\", meaning that information regarding said person should not be regarded when obtaining insurance or seeking employment. Similarly, France values this right ‚Äì (the right to be forgotten) ‚Äì it was officially recognized in French Law in 2010. Views on the right to be forgotten differ greatly between the United States and EU countries. In the United States, transparency, the right of free speech according to the First Amendment, and the \\"right to know\\" are typically favored over removing or increasing difficulty to access truthfully published information regarding individuals and corporations. Although the term \\"right to be forgotten\\" is a relatively new idea, the European Court of Justice legally solidified that the \\"right to be forgotten\\" is a human right when they ruled against Google in the Costeja case on May 13, 2014. In 1995, the European Union adopted the European Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) to regulate the processing of personal data.Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. EU Directive 1995. This is now considered a component of human rights law. The new European Proposal for General Data Protection Regulation provides protection and exemption for companies listed as \\"media\\" companies, like newspapers and other journalistic work. However, Google purposely opted out of being classified as a \\"media\\" company, therefore the company is not protected. Judges in the European Union ruled that because the international corporation, Google, is a collector and processor of data it should be classified as a \\"data controller\\" under the meaning of the EU data protection directive. These \\"data controllers\\" are required under EU law to remove data that is \\"inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant\\", making this directive of global importance. Current legal frameworks The right to be forgotten \\"reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them.\\"Weber, Rolf H. \\"The right to be forgotten.\\" More than a Pandora's Box 2 (2011) It has been defined as \\"the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occurring.\\"Pino, G. (2000). \\"The right to personal identity in Italian private law: Constitutional interpretation and judge-made rights\\". In: M. Van Hoecke; F. Ost (eds.). The harmonization of private law in Europe (pp. 225-237). Oxford: Hart Publishing. p. 237. The right to be forgotten leads to allowing individuals to have information, videos, or photographs about themselves deleted from certain Internet records so that they cannot be found by search engines. there are few protections against the harm that incidents such as revenge porn sharing, or pictures uploaded due to poor judgement. The right to be forgotten is distinct from the right to privacy. The right to privacy constitutes information that is not publicly known, whereas the right to be forgotten involves removing information that was publicly known at a certain time and not allowing third parties to access the information. Limitations of application in a jurisdiction include the inability to require removal of information held by companies outside the jurisdiction. There is no global framework to allow individuals control over their online image. However, Professor Viktor Mayer- Sch√∂nberger, an expert from Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, said that Google cannot escape compliance with the law of France implementing the decision of the European Court of Justice in 2014 on the right to be forgotten. Mayer-Sch√∂nberger said nations, including the US, had long maintained that their local laws have \\"extra-territorial effects\\". Recognition =Google and the European Union= In Article 12 of the Directive 95/46/EC the EU gave a legal base to Internet protection for individuals. In 2012 the European Commission disclosed a draft European Data Protection Regulation to supersede the directive, which included specific protection in the right to be forgotten in Article 17.European Commission. Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and On the Free Movement of Such Data (General Data Protection Regulation). 2012/0011 (COD). Article 17. Right to be forgotten and To Erasure A right to be forgotten was replaced by a more limited right of erasure in Article 17 of the version of the GDPR that was adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014 and which became EU law in April 2016. To exercise the right to be forgotten and request removal from a search engine, one must complete a form through the search engine's website. Google's removal request process requires the applicant to identify their country of residence, personal information, a list of the URLs to be removed along with a short description of each one, and attachment of legal identification. The applicant receives an email from Google confirming the request but the request must be assessed before it is approved for removal. If the request is approved, searches using the individual's name will no longer result in the content appearing in search results. The content remains online and is not erased. After a request is filled, their removals team reviews the request, weighing \\"the individual's right to privacy against the public's right to know\\", deciding if the website is \\"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes for which they were processed\\". Google has formed an Advisory Council of various professors, lawyers, and government officials from around Europe to provide guidelines for these decisions. However, the review process is still a mystery to the general public. Guidelines set by EU regulators were not released until November 2014, but Google began to take action on this much sooner than that, which (according to one author) allowed them \\"to shape interpretation to [their] own ends\\". In May 2015, eighty academics called for more transparency from Google in an open letter. The form asks people to select one of the twenty-eight countries that make up the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. \\"The form allows an individual or someone representing an individual to put in a request\\" for the removal of any URLs believed to be a violation of the individual's privacy. Regardless of who is submitting the form, some form of photo identification of the person the form is being submitted for must be present. This is meant to serve as proof that the person for whom the request was made for does in fact approve. If Google refuses a request to delink material, Europeans can appeal to their local data protection agency. As of May 2015, the British Data Protection Agency had treated 184 such complaints, and overturned Google's decision in about a quarter of those. If Google fails to comply with a Data Protection Agency decision, it can face legal action. In July 2014, in the early stages of Google's effort to comply with the court ruling, legal experts questioned whether Google's widely publicized delistings of a number of news articles violated the UK and EU Data Protection Directive, since in implementing the Directive, Google is required to weigh the damage to the person making the request against any public interest in the information being available. Google indeed acknowledged that some of its search result removals, affecting articles that were of public interest, were incorrect, and reinstated the links a week later. Commentators like Charles Arthur, technology editor of The Guardian, and Andrew Orlowski of The Register noted that Google is not required to comply with removal requests at all, as it can refer requests to the information commissioner in the relevant country for a decision weighing the respective merits of public interest and individual rights. Google notifies websites that have URLs delinked, and various news organizations, such as BBC, have published lists of delinked articles. Complainants have been named in news commentary regarding those delinkings. In August 2015 the British Data Protection Agency issued an enforcement action requiring Google to delink some of these more recent articles from searches for a complainant's name, after Google refused to do so. Google complied with the request. Some academics have criticized news organizations and Google for their behavior. In July 2015, Google accidentally revealed data on delinkings that \\"shows 95% of Google privacy requests are from citizens out to protect personal and private information ‚Äì not criminals, politicians and public figures.\\" This data leak caused serious social consequences for Google as the public expressed their outrage and fear over the information that was recently made public. Though only 5% of requests were made by criminals, politicians, and public figures, the content removed was what sparked the most fear. In particular, one request for data removal was from a British doctor requesting to have 50 links removed on past botched medical procedures. Google agreed to remove three search results containing his personal information. The public voiced their outrage stating that removing such information can be used for manipulation and could lead to innocent people making uninformed decisions. Google responded to the public outrage by saying that when removing content they consider both the right of the individual and public interest. The European Union has been pushing for the delinkings requested by EU citizens to be implemented by Google not just in European versions of Google (as in google.co.uk, google.fr, etc.), but on google.com and other international subdomains. Regulators want delinkings to be implemented so that the law cannot be circumvented in any way. Google has refused the French Data Protection Agency's demand to apply the right internationally. Due in part to their refusal to comply with the recommendation of the privacy regulating board Google has become the subject of a four-year-long antitrust investigation by the European Commission. In September 2015, the French Data Protection Agency dismissed Google's appeal. The French Data Protection Agency appealed to the EU courts to seek action on Google for failing to delink across its global servers. In September 2019 the Court of Justice for the EU issued its decision, finding that Google is not required to delink on sites external to the EU, concluding that \\"Currently, there is no obligation under EU law, for a search engine operator who grants a request for de-referencing made by a data subject ... to carry out such a de-referencing on all the versions of its search engine.\\" As of September 2015, the most delinked site is www.facebook.com. Three of Google's own sites, groups.google.com, plus.google.com and www.youtube.com are among the ten most delinked sites. In addition to Google, Yahoo and Bing have also put up forms for making delinking requests. =Spain= In May 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled against Google in Costeja, a case brought by a Spanish man, Mario Costeja Gonz√°lez, who requested the removal of a link to a digitized 1998 article in La Vanguardia newspaper about an auction for his foreclosed home, for a debt that he had subsequently paid. He initially attempted to have the article removed by complaining to the Spanish Agency of data protection, which rejected the claim on the grounds that it was lawful and accurate, but accepted a complaint against Google and asked Google to remove the results. Google sued in the Spanish Audiencia Nacional (National High Court) which referred a series of questions to the European Court of Justice. The court ruled in Costeja that search engines are responsible for the content they point to and thus, Google was required to comply with EU data privacy laws. On its first day of compliance only (May 30, 2014), Google received 12,000 requests to have personal details removed from its search engine. =Germany= On October 27, 2009, lawyers for Wolfgang Werl√© who‚Äîtogether with Manfred Lauber‚Äîwas convicted of murdering Walter Sedlmayr sent the Wikimedia Foundation a cease and desist letter requesting that Werl√©'s name be removed from the English language Wikipedia article Walter Sedlmayr, citing a 1973 Federal Constitutional Court decision that allows the suppression of a criminal's name in news accounts once he is released from custody. Previously, Alexander H. Stopp, attorney for Werl√© and Lauber, had won a default judgment in German court, on behalf of Lauber, against the Wikimedia Foundation. According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Werl√©'s lawyers also challenged an Internet service provider in Austria which published the names of the convicted killers. Wikimedia is based in the United States, where the First Amendment protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press. In Germany, the law seeks to protect the name and likenesses of private persons from unwanted publicity. On January 18, 2008, a court in Hamburg supported the personality rights of Werl√©, which under German law includes removing his name from archive coverage of the case. On November 12, 2009, The New York Times reported that Wolfgang Werl√© had a case pending against the Wikimedia Foundation in a German court. The editors of the German-language Wikipedia article about Sedlmayr removed the names of the murderers, which have since then been restored to the article. The Guardian observed that the lawsuit has led to the Streisand effect, an upsurge in publicity for the case resulting from the legal action. On December 15, 2009, the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) in Karlsruhe ruled that German websites do not have to check their archives in order to provide permanent protection of personality rights for convicted criminals. The case occurred after the names of the brothers were found on the website of Deutschlandradio, in an archive article dating from July 2000. The presiding judge Gregor Galke stated \\"This is not a blank check\\", and pointed out that the right to rehabilitation of offenders had been taken into consideration. =Argentina= Argentina has seen law suits by celebrities against Google and Yahoo! in which the plaintiffs demand the removal of certain search results, and require removal of links to photographs. One case, brought by artist Virginia da Cunha, involved photographs which had originally been taken with her permission and uploaded with her permission, however she alleged that the search results improperly associated her photographs with pornography.Carter, Edward L. \\"Argentina's Right to Be Forgotten.\\" Emory International Law Review. 27 (2013): pg 23. De Cunha's case achieved initial success resulting in Argentina search engines not showing images of the particular celebrity, however this decision is on appeal. Virginia Simari, the judge in favor of De Cunha, stated that people have the right to control their image and avert others from \\"capturing, reproducing, broadcasting, or publishing one's image without permission.\\" In addition, Simari used a treatise written by Julio C√©sar Rivera, a Buenos Aires lawyer, author, and law professor \\"the right to control one's personal data includes the right to prevent others from using one's image.\\" Since the 1990s Argentina has also been a part of the habeas data movement in which they \\"adopted a constitutional provision that is part freedom-of-government-information law and part data privacy law.\\" Their version is known as amparo. Article 43 explains it: \\"Any person shall file this action to obtain information on the data about himself and their purpose, registered in public records or databases, or in private ones intended to supply information; and in case of false data or discrimination, this action may be filed to request the suppression, rectification, confidentiality or updating of said data.\\" Argentina's efforts to protect their people's right to be forgotten has been called \\"the most complete\\" because individuals are able to correct, delete, or update information about themselves. Overall, their information is bound to remain confidential. =United States= Consideration of the right to be forgotten can be seen in US case law, specifically in Melvin v. Reid, and in Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp.Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931); Sidis v F-R Publishing Corporation 311 U.S. 711 61 S. Ct. 393 85 L. Ed. 462 1940 U.S. In Melvin v. Reid (1931), an ex-prostitute was charged with murder and then acquitted; she subsequently tried to assume a quiet and anonymous place in society. However, the 1925 film The Red Kimono revealed her history, and she successfully sued the producer.Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931) The court reasoned that \\"any person living a life of rectitude has that right to happiness which includes a freedom from unnecessary attacks on his character, social standing or reputation.\\"Melvin v. Reid, 112 Cal.App. 285, 297 P. 91 (1931) at 852-853 In Sidis v. FR Publishing Corp. (1940), the plaintiff, William James Sidis, was a former child prodigy who wished to spend his adult life quietly, without recognition; however, this was disrupted by an article in The New Yorker.Sidis v F-R Publishing Corporation 311 U.S. 711 61 S. Ct. 393 85 L. Ed. 462 1940 U.S. The court held here that there were limits to the right to control one's life and facts about oneself, and held that there is social value in published facts, and that a person cannot ignore their celebrity status merely because they want to. There is opposition to further recognition of the right to be forgotten in the United States as commentators argue that it will contravene the right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression, or will constitute censorship, thus potentially breaching peoples' constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression in the United States Constitution. These criticisms are consistent with the proposal that the only information that can be removed by user's request is content that they themselves uploaded.Walker, Robert K. \\"The Right to be forgotten.\\" 64 Hastings Law Journal 257, 2012. Pg 257. In a June 2014 opinion piece in Forbes, columnist Joseph Steinberg noted that \\"many privacy protections that Americans believe that they enjoy ‚Äì even some guaranteed by law ‚Äì have, in fact, been eroded or even obliterated by technological advances.\\" Steinberg, in explaining the need for legislation guaranteeing the \\"right to be forgotten\\", noted that existing laws require adverse information be removed from credit reports after a period of time, and that allowing the sealing or expunging of criminals records are effectively undermined by the ability of prospective lenders or employers to forever find the removed information in a matter of seconds by doing a web search. On March 11, 2015, Intelligence Squared US, an organization that stages Oxford-Style debates, held an event centered on the question, \\"Should the U.S. adopt the 'Right to be Forgotten' online?\\" The side against the motion won with a 56% majority of the voting audience. While opinions among experts are divided in the U.S., one survey indicated that 9 in 10 Americans want some form of the right to be forgotten. The consumer rights organization Consumer Watchdog has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for Americans to obtain the right as well. In March 2017, New York state senator Tony Avella and assemblyman David Weprin introduced a bill proposing that individuals be allowed to require search engines and online speakers to remove information that is \\"inaccurate\\", \\"irrelevant\\", \\"inadequate\\", or \\"excessive\\", that is \\"no longer material to current public debate or discourse\\" and is causing demonstrable harm to the subject. = India = In April 2016, the Delhi High Court began to examine the issue after a Delhi banker requested to have his personal details removed from search results following a marital dispute. In this case, due to the dispute being settled, the banker's request is valid. The High Court has asked for a reply from Google and other search engine companies by September 19, upon which the court will continue to investigate the issue. In January 2017 the Karnataka High Court upheld the right to be forgotten, in a case involving a woman who originally went to court in order to get a marriage certificate annulled, claiming to have never been married to the man on the certificate. After the two parties came to an agreement, the woman's father wanted her name to be removed from search engines regarding criminal cases in the high court. The Karnataka High Court approved the father's request, stating that she had a right to be forgotten. According to the court, its ruling would align with western countries' decisions, which typically approve of the right to be forgotten when dealing with cases \\"involving women in general and highly sensitive cases involving rape or affecting the modesty and reputation of the person concerned.\\" The woman in this specific case was worried that the search results would affect her standing with her husband, as well as her reputation in society. As of February 2017, the Delhi High Court is hearing a case involving a man requesting to have information regarding his mother and wife to be removed from a search engine. The man believes that having his name linked to the search is hindering his employment options. The Delhi High Court is still working on the case, along with the issue of whether or not a right to be forgotten should be a legal standard in India. Currently, there is no legal standard for the right to be forgotten, but if implemented, this would mean that citizens no longer need to file a case in order to request for information from search engines to be removed. This case could have significant impacts on the right to be forgotten and search engines in India. = South Korea = In May 2016, South Korea's Communications Commission (KCC) announced citizens will be able to request search engines and website administrators to restrict their own postings from being publicly accessible. The KCC released \\"Guidelines on the Right to Request Access Restrictions on Personal Internet Postings\\",Guidelines on the Right to Request Access Restrictions on Personal Internet Postings\\" which took effect in June 2016 and do not apply to third party contents. To the extent that the right to be forgotten concerns a data subject's right to limit the searchability of third party postings about him/her, the Guideline does not constitute a right to be forgotten. Also, as to the right to withdraw one's own posting, critics have noted that people have been able to delete their own postings before the Guideline as long as they have retained their login credentials, and that people who have misplaced their login credentials were permitted to retrieve or receive new ones. The only services significantly affected by the Guideline are Wiki-type services where people's contributions make logical sense only in response to or in conjunction with one another's contributions and therefore the postings are made permanent part of the mass-created content, but KCC made sure that the Guideline applies to these services only when the posting identifies the authors. The guidelines created by the KCC include that data subjects can remove content that includes the URL links, and any evidence consisting of personal information. The commission included different amendments to the guideline. This includes describing the Guidelines as a \\"minimum\\" and \\"preliminary\\" precaution regarding privacy rights in vague areas of existing laws. The guideline encompasses foreign Internet companies that provide translation services for South Korean consumers. In order to have a person's information \\"forgotten\\" he or she has to go through a three step process: the issue posted with the URL, proof of ownership of the post, grounds for the request. There are restrictions on each step. When posting the URL, the web operator has the right to preserve the posting issue. The second being that if the post is relevant to public interest, web operators will process this request on the terms of relevance. = China = In May 2016, Chinese courts in Beijing determined citizens do not have the right to be forgotten when a judge ruled in favor of Baidu in a lawsuit over removing search results. It was the first of such cases to be heard in Chinese court. In the suit, Ren Jiayu sued Chinese search engine Baidu over search results that associated him with a previous employer, Wuxi Taoshi Biotechnology. Ren argued that by posting the search results, Baidu had infringed upon his right of name and right of reputation, both protected under Chinese law. Because of these protections, Ren believed he had a right to be forgotten by removing these search results. The court ruled against Ren, claiming his name is a collection of common characters and as a result the search results were derived from relevant words. Nowhere in China's civil code are the concepts of privacy or the right to be forgotten discussed. There is no data protection authority, nor a specific state agency in place to monitor the protection of citizens' personal data. In China today, data protection regulation is aimed at consumers, on an individual level, in contrast to the EU's right to privacy, in which the individual is considered a \\"data subject\\", with the right to be protected. Chinese legislative progress towards supporting the right to be forgotten is slow. The topic has been debated for more than 10 years now, and continues to be a challenge. Small provisions have been implemented related to personal data processing, but do not amount to a comprehensive data protection regime. The European Union Directorate-General for Internal Policies has issued policy recommendations on a realistic, rather than a legalistic basis for data protection as to the transfer of data between the EU and China vis-a-vis the latter's lack of compatible regulation in this area. Connection to international relations The regulatory differences in the protection of personal data between countries has real impact on international relations. The right to be forgotten, specifically, is a matter of EU-US relations when applied to cross-border data flow, as it raises questions about territorial sovereignty. The structure of the Westphalian international system assumes that the reach of a country's jurisdiction is limited to its geographic territory. However, online interactions are independent of geographic location and present across multiple locations, rendering the traditional concept of territorial sovereignty moot. Therefore, the EU and the United States are forced to confront their regulatory differences and negotiate on a set of regulations that apply to all foreign companies processing and handling data of European citizens and residents. The regulatory differences on the right to be forgotten along with numerous other data protection rights have shaped discussions and negotiations on trans- Atlantic data privacy regulations. A case in point is the EU and the United States' endeavors to develop the Safe Harbor agreement, a data transfer pact that enables the transfer of data between the EU and US companies in a manner consistent with the EU's data protection schemes.The Council: Common Position (EC) no. 95 Article 25 of the Data Protection Directive articulates that cross-border transfer of data can take place only if the \\"third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection,\\" meaning that the country meets the EU's minimum standards of data protection. The standards include, among many provisions, a component that protects the right to \\"opt out\\" of further processing or transmission of personal data, under the assumption that data may not be further processed in ways inconsistent with the intent for which they were collected. Given the inconsistencies between the EU and the United States on numerous digital privacy regulations, including the right to be forgotten, Article 25 poses a threat to trans-Atlantic data flows. Therefore, the EU and the United States entered into negotiations to mediate the differences through the Safe Harbor agreement, which as a result of debate and discussion between the two parties, requires companies to provide individuals with the choice or opportunity to \\"opt out\\" and afford other protections. Under the pressures of the mass surveillance carried out by the US government on European citizens' data, the Safe Harbor agreement has been invalidated by the European Union Court of Justice in its Schrems case. The Safe Harbor agreement has now been replaced by the Privacy Shield principles. Draft European Data Protection Regulation The 2012 draft European Data Protection Regulation Article 17 detailed the \\"right to be forgotten and to erasure\\". Under Article 17 individuals to whom the data appertains are granted the right to \\"obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data, especially in relation to personal data which are made available by the data subject while he or she was a child or where the data is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected for, the subject withdraws consent, the storage period has expired, the data subject objects to the processing of personal data or the processing of data does not comply with other regulation\\". The EU defines \\"data controllers\\" as \\"people or bodies that collect and manage personal data\\". The EU General Data Protection Regulation requires data controllers who have been informed that an individual has requested the deletion of any links to or copies of information must \\"take all reasonable steps, including technical measures, in relation to data for the publication of which the controller is responsible, to inform third parties which are processing such data, that a data subject requests them to erase any links to, or copy or replication of that personal data. Where the controller has authorized a third party publication of personal data, the controller shall be considered responsible for that publication\\". In the situation that a data controller does not take all reasonable steps then they will be fined heavily. The European Parliament was once \\"expected to adopt the proposals in first reading in the April 2013 Plenary session\\". The right to be forgotten was replaced by a more limited right to erasure in the version of the GDPR adopted by the European Parliament in March 2014. Article 17 provides that the data subject has the right to request erasure of personal data related to him on any one of a number of grounds including non-compliance with article 6.1 (lawfulness) that includes a case (f) where the legitimate interests of the controller is overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data (see also Costeja). The European Union is a highly influential group of states, and this movement towards the right to be forgotten in the EU is a step towards its global recognition as a right. To support this, in 2012 the Obama Administration released a \\"Privacy Bill of Rights\\" to protect consumers online, and while this is not quite the strength of the EU law, it is a step towards recognition of the right to be forgotten. Response by reputation management firms Businesses that manage their clients' online reputations have responded to the European Court ruling by exercising the right to be forgotten as a means to remove unfavorable information. One technique used by reputation consulting firms is to submit multiple requests for each link, written with different angles in an attempt to get links removed. Google, for example, does not limit the number of requests that can be submitted on the removal of a given link. Criticism Major criticisms stem from the idea that the right to be forgotten would restrict the right to freedom of speech. Many nations, and the United States in particular (with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution), have very strong domestic freedom of speech laws, which would be challenging to reconcile with the right to be forgotten. Some academics see that only a limited form of the right to be forgotten would be reconcilable with US constitutional law; the right of an individual to delete data that he or she has personally submitted. In this limited form of the right individuals could not have material removed that has been uploaded by others, as demanding the removal of information could constitute censorship and a reduction in the freedom of expression in many countries. Sandra Coliver of the Open Society Justice Initiative argues that not all rights must be compatible and this conflict between the two rights is not detrimental to the survival of either.Coliver, Sandra. Editor. \\"Striking a Balance. Hate Speech, Freedom of Expression and Non-Discrimination.\\" Article 19. (1992) International Centre against Censorship. Human Rights Centre. University of Essex. The draft General Data Protection Regulation was written broadly and this has caused concern. It has attracted criticism that its enactment would require data controlling companies to go to great lengths to identify third parties with the information and remove it. The proposed regulation has also attracted criticism due to the fact that this could produce a censoring effect in that companies, such as Facebook or Google, will wish to not be fined under the act, and will therefore be likely to delete wholesale information rather than facing the fine, which could produce a \\"serious chilling effect.\\" In addition to this, there are concerns about the requirement to take down information that others have posted about an individual; the definition of personal data in Article 4(2) includes \\"any information relating to\\" the individual. This, critics have claimed, would require companies to take down any information relating to an individual, regardless of its source, which would amount to censorship, and result in the big data companies eradicating a lot of data to comply with this. Such removal can impact the accuracy and ability of businesses and individuals to carry out business intelligence, particularly due diligence to comply with anti bribery, anticorruption, and know your customer laws. The right to be forgotten was invoked to remove from Google searches 120 reports about company directors published by Dato Capital, a Spanish company which compiles such reports about private company directors, consisting entirely of information they are required by law to disclose; Fortune magazine examined the 64 reports relating to UK directorships, finding that in 27 (42%) the director was the only person named, in the remaining only the director and co-directors were named, and 23 (36%) involve directorships started since 2012. Other criticism revolves around the principle of accountability. There were concerns that the proposed General Data Protection Regulation would result in Google and other Internet search engines not producing neutral search results, but rather producing biased and patchy results, and compromising the integrity of Internet-based information. To balance out this criticism, the proposed General Data Protection Regulation included an exception \\"for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression in order to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the rules governing freedom of expression.\\" Article 80 upheld freedom of speech, and while not lessening obligations on data providers and social media sites, nevertheless due to the wide meaning of \\"journalistic purposes\\" allows more autonomy and reduces the amount of information that is necessary to be removed. When Google agreed to implement the ruling, European Commission Vice- President Viviane Reding said, \\"The Court also made clear that journalistic work must not be touched; it is to be protected.\\" However, Google was criticized for taking down (under the Costeja precedent) a BBC News blog post about Stan O'Neal by economics editor Robert Peston (eventually, Peston reported that his blog post has remained findable in Google after all). Despite these criticisms and Google's action, the company's CEO, Larry Page worries that the ruling will be \\"used by other governments that aren't as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things\\", though has since distanced himself from that position. For example, pianist Dejan Lazic cited the \\"Right To Be Forgotten\\" in trying to remove a negative review about his performance from The Washington Post. He claimed that the critique was \\"defamatory, mean-spirited, opionated, offensive and simply irrelevant for the arts\\". and the St. Lawrence parish of the Roman Catholic church in Kutno, Poland asked Google to remove the Polish Wikipedia page about it, without any allegations mentioned therein as of that date. Index on Censorship claimed that the Costeja ruling \\"allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight. This is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books. Although the ruling is intended for private individuals it opens the door to anyone who wants to whitewash their personal history‚Ä¶ The Court's decision is a retrograde move that misunderstands the role and responsibility of search engines and the wider Internet. It should send chills down the spine of everyone in the European Union who believes in the crucial importance of free expression and freedom of information.\\" In 2014, the Gerry Hutch page on the English Wikipedia was among the first Wikipedia pages to be removed by several search engines' query results in the European Union. The Daily Telegraph said, on 6 Aug 2014, that Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales \\"described the EU's Right to be Forgotten as deeply immoral, as the organisation that operates the online encyclopedia warned the ruling will result in an Internet riddled with memory holes\\". Other commentators have disagreed with Wales, pointing to problems such as Google including links to revenge porn sites in its search results, and have accused Google of orchestrating a publicity campaign to escape the burdensome obligation to comply with the law. Julia Powles, a law and technology researcher at the University of Cambridge, made a rebuttal to Wales' and the Wikimedia Foundation concerns in an editorial published by Guardian, opining that \\"There is a public sphere of memory and truth, and there is a private one...Without the freedom to be private, we have precious little freedom at all.\\" In response to the criticism, the EU has released a factsheet to address what it considers myths about the right to be forgotten. In addition to this, for further clarification of the law, the factsheet provides information about the pivotal court case C-131/12 and frequently asked questions regarding Google, the purpose of the law, and how it works. https://www.inforights.im/media/1186/cl_eu_commission_factsheet_right_to_be- forgotten.pdf Other criticisms involving the right to be forgotten revolves around the policies for data removal regarding minors. The U.S. has laws in place that protect the privacy of minors. The California Minor Eraser Law is a law that allows California residents under the age of 18 to request to have information removed that they posted on an online server. The law \\"applies to websites, social media sites, mobile apps and other online services\\" and follows \\"Europe's recognition of the 'right to be forgotten'\\". This law was put into effect on January 1, 2015 and remains in existence today. Online \\"service\\" operators that have services \\"directed toward minors\\" must update their privacy policies to include the option to remove data if requested by a minor that is posted on a service. In the UK, the 2017 Conservative manifesto included a pledge to allow social media platform users to remove outdated information that was posted when they were under the age of 18. \\"A Tory victory on the 8th of June will lead to those youthful indiscretions on Facebook and Twitter being open to erasure. But there are also plans to fine social media firms for not moving at the speed of political opportunism over extreme content.\\" The United Kingdom has not yet fully adopted the ruling of the European Court of Justice regarding the right to be forgotten and argued to keep it from going into EU law. However, in the upcoming elections in the UK laws could be passed to allow minors to remove embarrassing posts or photos on social media that could come back to affect job applications or public image in later life. Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the UK, has been pushing to extend privacy rights for minors in allowing them to have a right to delete information. The intentions for this extension of privacy are based on the fact that social media sites store years of data that affect minors lives' much later after the information is posted. May gave her stance on privacy when she said, \\"'The Internet has brought a wealth of opportunity but also significant new risks which have evolved faster than society's response to them'\\". The Conservative Party, which is headed by May, has pushed for policies that aggressively removes illegal material from the Internet and fines firms that do not take action in removing said material. In 2015, Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libert√©s (CNIL) asked Google to remove data from all versions available in any part of the world. Google and other entities argued that European data regulators should not be allowed to decide what Internet users around the world find when they use a search engine. Research Conceptual overview of Oblivion Security researchers from CISPA, Saarland University and the University of Auckland proposed a framework, called Oblivion, to support the automation of the right to be forgotten in a scalable, provable and privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion is a program that helps to \\"automate\\" the process of attempting to verify someone's personal information that could be found in a Google search result.\\" Google gets many take-down requests in a short amount of time, and Oblivion might help with this problem. Researchers and authors behind Oblivion say that \\"it is essential to develop techniques that at least partly automate this process and are scalable to Internet size.\\" Oblivion helps the humans who review the forms at Google ensure that antagonistic users cannot \\"blacklist links to Internet sources that do not affect them.\\" For example, tests have proven that Oblivion handles requests at a rate of 278 per second. The software allows Google, the government, and the user to work together to get content removed quickly and for just cause. In order to ensure that the program works quickly, is secure for its users and is impervious to fake take-down requests, Oblivion uses a three-part system. In the first part, Oblivion requires a user to submit identification about themselves ‚Äì not limited to \\"name, age, and nationality.\\" Oblivion then enables a user to automatically find and tag his or her disseminated personal information using natural language processing and image recognition techniques and file a request in a privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion will scan the article for attributes that match information that has been submitted by the user. Second, Oblivion provides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism, asserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online resource. The author of a request is then issued an \\"ownership token\\" that confirms the articles they submitted for evaluation include sensitive personal information. The automated eligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that only legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding links from search results. In the third and last phase, this \\"ownership token\\" is submitted to Google, accompanied by the user's concerns as to what information should be deleted. Google's staff is then allowed to decide for themselves if they want to delete this information or not - but thanks to Oblivion, they know that the information in question is valid. Researchers with Oblivion, however, have noted that it comes with some limitations. The software is lacking a human element, therefore it cannot decide on its own \\"whether or not a piece of information is public interest and should therefore not be removed from Google search results.\\" Researchers have conducted comprehensive evaluations, showing that Oblivion is suitable for large-scale deployment once it is fine-tuned. Data deletion protocols around the death of a user is another consideration.

Consequences of child poverty in New Zealand include: poor health, such as lower rates of immunisation, higher rates of avoidable child mortality, infant mortality, low birth weight, and child injury; reduced participation in early childhood education and young people leaving school with no or low qualifications; and higher rates of youth suicide, teenage imprisonment, and the victimisation of children.Breen, Claire, \\"Chapter 10: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of New Zealand Children: The Challenges of Poverty and Discrimination\\" in Bedggood, Margaret, and Gledhill, Kris (ed) Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand (Thomas Reuters, Auckland NZ, 2011), 206.

The conference was held to allow interested groups to discuss and seek evidence-based solutions to the current crisis. Key talking points were policy development, promoting reform, and publishing relevant articles. This was a three-day event that organised speakers and provided resources to current publications of that time. A full schedule of events and topics can be found on the conference website. The 2014 budget was announced on 15 May 2014.The Treasury (New Zealand) \\"Budget 2014\\" (5 May 2014) =Poverty rates= Using a poverty threshold based on 60% of median disposable household income the child poverty rate was 14% in 1982. This increased drastically and in 1994 the poverty rate for children was 29%. This peaked at 30% in 2001, and saw a decline to 22% in 2007. From 2009 to 2012 the poverty rate held steady at 25%. In 2016 the poverty rate dropped to 20%. From 1984 through 2012 ages 0‚Äì17 remained the most impoverished age group within New Zealand. The pushing factors for the increasing poverty rate were slow wage growth, high unemployment, and a decrease in social expenditures. In 2007 and 2008 the deprivation rate among children was 18%, while it was 3% for those over 65 and 13% for the overall population. This is measured by calculating the proportion of households that lack three or more essential items out of a list of nine. The New Zealand Ministry of Social Development has created its own index to measure poverty based on material hardships: DEP-17, an index utilising 17 items that are considered essential for children. A score of 7+ is indicative of material hardship and a score of 9+ shows severe material hardship. The ministry collected data from 2008 to 2016. The highest rates of material hardship was seen in 2011 with households containing children aged 0‚Äì17 lacked 7+ items an average of 20% of the time and roughly 9% lacked 9+ items. These numbers steadily declined into 2016 where 12% of households lacked 7+ items and 6% lacked 9+ items.  Demographic considerations  Studies have shown the MƒÅori and other Pacific groups consistently rank higher when considering impoverishment compared to other European ethnicities. There is also a consistent finding that poverty rates for younger children were higher than those aged 12‚Äì17. From 2007-2014 income poverty rates remained the highest in households that had multiple children. in 2014 household with three or more children made up 45% of impoverished children. Overview of children's rights in New Zealand A problem often encountered is that the rights of children are entangled with the rights of their parents and caregivers (limitations on which affect children).Breen, Claire, \\"Chapter 10: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of New Zealand Children: The Challenges of Poverty and Discrimination\\" in Bedggood, Margaret, and Gledhill, Kris (ed) Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand, (Thomas Reuters, Auckland NZ, 2011), 203 =Rights in New Zealand law= The Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989 provides help services for children, their parents and family to help with child care responsibilities with the aim of preventing children suffering harm, ill-treatment, abuse, neglect, and deprivation.Dale, M Claire, O'Brien, Mike, and St John, Susan, \\"Left Further Behind: How Policies Fail the Poorest Children in New Zealand\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland NZ, 2011), 115 The Domestic Violence Act 1995, which offers counselling for victims of domestic violence and section 5(2) requires victim protection, access to the court system in a speedy, inexpensive, and understandable way while also appropriate support programs.Dale, M Claire, O'Brien, Mike, and St John, Susan, \\"Left Further Behind: How Policies Fail the Poorest Children in New Zealand\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland NZ, 2011), 118 Parliamentary Counsel Office, Section 5 of the Domestic Violence Act 1995 The Care of Children Act 2004 concerns the best arrangements of guardianship/ care of children, recognising their rights (section 3), and with the best interests of children as paramount (section five). Currently New Zealand is adapting the Vulnerable Children's Bill which is an omnibus bill intended to strengthen child protection, and make sure fewer children are abused and neglected. The resources in the Family Court, and the Department of Child, Youth and Family, are minimal, causing long delays in hearings, investigation, and final cases. =Rights in international law= New Zealand ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCROC) in 1993 with three reservations which still stand: Article 22.1 regarding the rights children with parents who are not legally allowed in New Zealand; Article 32.2 regarding the minimum age of employment; and Article 37 (c) regarding separate detainment facilities for children.Human rights Commission (New Zealand), \\"United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child\\" (2014) Article 24 of UNCROC, which stems from the right to health, requires states to provide measures aiming to reduce infant and child mortality, develop primary health care systems for children, combat disease and malnutrition, ensure pre and post natal care for mothers, spread awareness about child health and nutrition, including the advantages of breast feeding, hygiene and environmental sanitation, prevention of accidents.Breen, Claire, \\"Chapter 10: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of New Zealand Children: The Challenges of Poverty and Discrimination\\" in Bedggood, Margaret, and Gledhill, Kris (ed) Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand, (Thomas Reuters, Auckland NZ, 2011), 207 Ten recommendations from the United Nations Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review addressed child poverty issues in New Zealand.United Nations Human Rights Council, \\"Draft Report of Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: New Zealand\\", (Eighteenth session, Geneva, 27 January ‚Äì 7 February 2014), 128.54-128.63 Child poverty issues in New Zealand In richer countries, such as New Zealand, poverty is not concerned with complete deprivation of essential resources.

This is in accordance with article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Articles 28 and 29 of UNCROC, and Article 4 of UNESCO.Breen, Claire, \\"Chapter 10: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of New Zealand Children: The Challenges of Poverty and Discrimination\\" in Bedggood, Margaret, and Gledhill, Kris (ed) Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand, (Thomas Reuters, Auckland NZ, 2011), 208-209 The Human Rights Commission (New Zealand) reported in 2005 that some state schools were enforcing \\"compulsory donations\\",Breen, Claire, \\"Chapter 10: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of New Zealand Children: The Challenges of Poverty and Discrimination\\" in Bedggood, Margaret, and Gledhill, Kris (ed) Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand, (Thomas Reuters, Auckland NZ, 2011), 210 and there have been other reports of some state schools hiring debt collection agencies to pressure parents to pay these \\"donation fees.\\"Action for Children and Youth, \\"Children and Youth in Aotearoa 2010: New Zealand Non-Governmental Organisations Alternative Periodic Report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child\\" (ACYA, Auckland, 2010), 7.2 The money spent by parents on non-core curriculum activities, stationary and other material costs, and uniforms, is not taken into account. In Michelle Egan-Bitran's project, \\"This is how I see it: Children, young people and young adults' views and experiences of poverty\\", children and young people were found to be aware of these hidden costs of going to school, and the ability to not take part in school trips, for example, was important for those whose families could not afford holidays, as they felt they were missing out on opportunities to be a part of community activities.Egan-Bitran, Michelle, \\"This is How I See it: Children, Young People and Young Adults' Views and Experiences of Poverty\\"(Office of the Children's Commissioner, Wellington, 2010), 17 Lack of access to right of education may result in other human rights abuses and perpetuate the Cycle of poverty.Dwyer, Maire, and Fletcher, Micheal, \\"A Fair Go for All Children: Actions to address child poverty in New Zealand, a Report for the Children's Commissioner and Barnados\\" (Office of the Children's Commissioner, Barnados, Wellington, 2008), 53 From 2009-2016 the number of students leaving school with qualifications increased. The number of children leaving school with NCEA level 1 increased 8.5% and those achieving NCEA level 2 or higher increased 12.8% from 2009-2016. M√§ori and Pasifika children are below the national average for receiving qualifications. However these groups have seen significant improvements over the stated time period. There is a correlation between the level of certification reached and the socioeconomic condition of the school. Schools in the lowest socioeconomic quintile in 2016 had 80% of children leave school with a NCEA level 1 or higher, whereas the highest quintile had about 95% of children reach this achievement. The disparity is much greater when comparing university entrance standards. About 38% of children attending schools in the lowest quintile achieved this while 67% of children attending schools in the highest quintile was able to leave school with this achievement. =Inequality= Differences in child well-being are more extreme in societies with greater income inequality.Hertzman, C, Siddiqi, A, Hertzman, E, Irwin, L.G., Vaghri, Z., Houwelling T., et al. (2010) \\"Bucking the Inequality gradient through early child development.\\" British Medical Journal, at 340 Conversely, countries with lower levels of inequality demonstrate higher levels of child well-being, and lower levels of child poverty. Inequality is known to affect a child's future life chances, health, education, and employment opportunities. Non-material inequality, such as a lack of voice, disrespect, shame, stigma, denial of rights and diminished citizenship, are all condensed for children.Dale, M Claire, O'Brien, Mike, and St John, Susan, \\"Left Further Behind: How Policies Fail the Poorest Children in New Zealand\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland NZ, 2011), 14 =Discrimination against beneficiary families= Of all New Zealand children, 22% live in families where the major caregiver receives income from a social security benefit. That is around 230,000, or one fifth, of New Zealand childrenBryan, Bruce, Richard Thomas, \\"Inside Child Poverty: a special report\\" (video recording) (Red Sky Film and Television, Wellington NZ, 2011) New Zealand has a long history of discrimination against, beneficiaries, especially the non-working poor.St John, Susan, \\"Child Poverty and family incomes policy in New Zealand\\" in Dew, Kevin and Matheson, Anna, Understanding Health Inequalities in Aotearoa New Zealand (Otago University Press, Dunedin NZ, 2008), 112 The Working for Families (WFF) scheme, by lifting a family's income and making housing and childcare more affordable, was able to reduce child poverty. However, children whose parents cannot or will not work, are trapped in poverty and they miss out by association.Breen, Claire, \\"Chapter 10: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of New Zealand Children: The Challenges of Poverty and Discrimination\\" in Bedggood, Margaret, and Gledhill, Kris (ed) Law into Action: Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Aotearoa New Zealand, (Thomas Reuters, Auckland NZ, 2011), 205 Debt collection against beneficiaries intensifies the poverty experienced by their children. When a beneficiary's over-payment charge is taken, be it for genuine fraud or because of a departmental mistake, money is taken from a family's already low income, and traps children, as well as their parents/caregivers, in a poverty cycle.Dale, M Claire, O'Brien, Mike, and St John, Susan, \\"Left Further Behind: How Policies Fail the Poorest Children in New Zealand\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland NZ, 2011), 119 The deduction taken reduces a child's food, clothing, and access to school and the community.Dale, M Claire, O'Brien, Mike, and St John, Susan, \\"Left Further Behind: How Policies Fail the Poorest Children in New Zealand\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland NZ, 2011), 120 In New Zealand, Susan St John explained it is as though, Punishment for beneficiary fraud, often life repayments and in larger cases imprisonment, is a larger penalty suffered than others fraud offences in New Zealand. In the case Osborne v Chief Executive of Ministry of Social Development [2010] 1 NZLR 559, the New Zealand High Court ruled that the 332 years that Linda Osborne would take to repay her debt was not of concern. It was also ruled the time spent she already in jail as punishment did not preclude any civil recovery of money. This system puts children's needs behind the ideologically driven desire to move sole parents (as well as other beneficiaries in the family) into paid work.Wynd, Donna, \\"Benefit Sanctions: Creating an invisible Underclass of Children?\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland, October 2013), 15 Claire Breen explains, Child Poverty Action Group v Attorney General In 2008 the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) took a case against the Attorney-General claiming provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 were inconsistent with freedom from discrimination section 19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act (NZBORA): this was the eligibility for tax credits under the WFF scheme.Joychild, Frances (QC), \\"Child Poverty Action Group v Attorney General ‚Äì what did we gain?\\" (Child Poverty Action Group Inc, Auckland NZ, 2014), 1 CPAG claimed it discriminated against children in families who would be eligible if it were not for the receiving of income benefit, or weekly compensation under the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, by one of the family members. The Human Rights Tribunal found that, The Court of Appeal (CA) recognised as an, It was concluded that as under section 19 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act beneficiaries subject to the off-benefit rule were subject to 'prima facie' discrimination.Child Poverty Action Group Incorporated v The Attorney-General [2013] NZCA 402 at 154 However, the CA also found that it was \\"justified discrimination\\" on the ground of employment status, as dictated by a democratic system. =Neglect and maltreatment= 27% of New Zealand children (over a quarter) have witnessed family violence against an adult in the home.Campbell, Lesley Dr, \\"Peer support: Reframing the journey from lived experience to domestic violence.\\" (Christchurch Women's Refuge, Christchurch, February 2012), 32 Children suffer from stress and disruption when they have to leave home because of domestic violence, and it also disrupts their education. Aviva family violence services explains that, 108 children aged 0‚Äì14 died from intentional injuries from neglect, assault, or maltreatment. From 2010-2014 it was found that 57% of all cases were female. When considering age groups during the same time period 57% of all deaths occurred during the first year of life. Contrary to death from intentional injuries where there was no statistically significant difference found on yearly numbers, hospitalisations due to neglect and maltreatment has seen an overall decrease 2001-2016. The total number of hospitalisations for children 0-14 for injuries resulting from neglect was about 225 in 2001 and there was approximately 160 cases in 2016. The most common injury resulting in hospitalisation was head injury and the highest number of cases were seen in children under the age of 1. Shine's Safe@Home project is one solution that has been set up. It offers security upgrades for homes, allowing children to stay at home, and not have their lives disrupted.Dale, M Claire, O'Brien, Mike, and St John, Susan, \\"Left Further Behind: How Policies Fail the Poorest Children in New Zealand\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland NZ, 2011) , 118 The project limits success to break in-attempts of potential perpetrators by changing locks and providing an alarm system that is linked top the police. The overall goal of the project is to prevent victimisation, increase health and well-being, and make the home a safer place. The project has been seen as an overall success, and Yolanda Meima has advocated for the program to be implemented at the national level. =Health= In 2010, 150 children died because of preventable diseases.Bryan, Bruce, Richard Thomas, \\"Inside Child Poverty: a special report\\" (video recording) (Red Sky Film and Television, Wellington NZ, 2011) In the documentary \\"Inside Child Poverty: a special report\\", Dr Bryan Beatty, a General Practitioner in East Porirua, reported seeing chest infections, skin infections, and upper respiratory infections.Bryan, Bruce, Richard Thomas, \\"Inside Child Poverty: a special report\\" (video recording) (Red Sky Film and Television, Wellington NZ, 2011) The documentary also pictured serious cases of scabies, and school sores.Bryan, Bruce, Richard Thomas, \\"Inside Child Poverty: a special report\\" (video recording) (Red Sky Film and Television, Wellington NZ, 2011) One out of a hundred children in New Zealand have a heart disease which is caused by rheumatic fever, which is caused by an untreated sore throat, and can lead to heart complications.Dale, M Claire, O'Brien, Mike, and St John, Susan, \\"Left Further Behind: How Policies Fail the Poorest Children in New Zealand\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland NZ, 2011), 22 Bryan, Bruce, Richard Thomas, \\"Inside Child Poverty: a special report\\" (video recording) (Red Sky Film and Television, Wellington NZ, 2011) New Zealand immunisation rates were placed 23rd out of 25 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries by UNICEF, there are also higher rates of vaccine preventable diseases than in many similar countries Action for Children and Youth, \\"Children and Youth in Aotearoa 2010: New Zealand Non-Governmental Organisations Alternative Periodic Report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child\\" (ACYA, Auckland, 2010), 6.6 Not only is this preventable harm and pain, but children's health affects their education and their future employment outcomes as adults.Dale, M Claire, O'Brien, Mike, and St John, Susan, \\"Left Further Behind: How Policies Fail the Poorest Children in New Zealand\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland NZ, 2011), 21 The numbers for infant deaths within the first year of life were constant from 2006 through 2013. These numbers remain above the OECD average. In 2014 the infant mortality rate was comparable to the United States. The groups most affected by sudden unexpected death in infancy are the MƒÅori and Pasifika groups. There are several other medical conditions with social gradient within the country: Asthma, bronchiolitis, and gastrointestinal diseases. An average of 28 children aged 0‚Äì14 died each year from 2010-2014 due to such diseases, and an average of 41,000 hospitalisations occurred from 2011-2015 for the same age group. =Housing= In 2010 25,000 children, mostly from lower-income families, where admitted to hospital for preventable respiratory infections aggravated by poor houses.Bryan, Bruce, Richard Thomas, \\"Inside Child Poverty: a special report\\" (video recording) (Red Sky Film and Television, Wellington NZ, 2011) In New Zealand many of the health problems are related to the quality of New Zealand houses and housing standards in New Zealand, and overcrowding.Dale, M Claire, O'Brien, Mike, and St John, Susan, \\"Left Further Behind: How Policies Fail the Poorest Children in New Zealand\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland NZ, 2011), 132 Dr Michael Baker, Associate Professor of Public Health at Otago University, recognises household crowding as the main risk factors for meningocele disease, rheumatic fever, and tuberculosis.Bryan, Bruce, Richard Thomas, \\"Inside Child Poverty: a special report\\" (video recording) (Red Sky Film and Television, Wellington NZ, 2011) This is an issue that greatly affects children as 75-80% of crowded households had children living in them. The highest levels of crowding seen from 2013-2015 were children ages 0‚Äì17 living in social housing. 33% of children living in social housing experienced overcrowding. Other issues of concern include dampness, mold, and having heat during the winter. Approximately 63% of households with children experienced major problems with damp and mold between 2013 and 2015 and approximately 75% of had major issues keeping the home warm during the winter. The greatest amount of all issues were seen in social housing. Housing costs influence directly the poverty experienced in low-income households with children.Dale, M Claire, O'Brien, Mike, and St John, Susan, \\"Left Further Behind: How Policies Fail the Poorest Children in New Zealand\\" (Child Poverty Action Group, Auckland NZ, 2011), 138  Children's Commissioner recommendations 2012  The OCC laid forth 78 separate recommendations in their 2012 report Solutions to Child Poverty in New Zealand evidence for action. These recommendations are grouped into several categories: = Strategy and accountability = The OCC recommended to enact legislation that would help reduce child poverty in the country. This included legislation that would create fiver different measurements of poverty to build an accurate account of the situation, setting short and long term targets that would be reviewed at least every three years, and accelerating the rate of poverty reduction for heavily affected groups such as the M√§ori and Pasifika. = Tax credits and income support = They recommended changing how the family-tax credit is calculated. They want to see a higher tax credit for those aged 0‚Äì5, because research indicates that investing in child development at this age is crucial. This would be done incrementally to avoid financial struggle. They also recommended to eliminate differential payments based on the number of child in each household, and initially provide a flat rate for all children under the age of 16. In order to further help reduce poverty they want experts hired that specialise in child development in relation to the labor supply, all child-related benefits be reviewed to ensure they help in reducing poverty, and in the long-term create a new income support plan that would replace many of the preexisting government subsidies. = Child support = The OCC wished to see child-support payments to single-parent families who were receiving government support to still go to the parent. At the time all child-support payments made to parents in this situation were withheld by the government to offset the cost of government assistance. They also wished to force the government to make advanced child support payments when the non- custodial parent did not make the payments on time. = Employment and training = It was recommended that the government work with current industries to create a pathway for parents with low or no skills to attain training and education. This included a vocational pathway to ease the transition between secondary school and the workforce. They also wish to see a larger collaboration with the government and industry to ensure more family- friendly work environments. This is to ensure that there is a better overall work-life balance than previously existed. The idea of evaluating current unemployment programs for effectiveness was also proposed. The last thing recommended in this category was a low-interest loan be offered by the government for those looking to re-enter the workforce and in dire need of financial support. =Housing= The OCC stresses for a need of government monitoring for all rental units to ensure minimum health and safety standards are being met. Due to a serious lack of affordable housing they said that there needed to be an increase in social housing: They suggested that 2,000 units be added per year until 2020. They wanted better supervision for those companies providing social housing to include government monitoring for quality, accessibility, and financial stability. They wanted the government to create a point of contact separate from the housing agencies to properly assess housing needs. Finally they wished to see further research be funded for housing needs and how it affects children. = MƒÅori and Pasifika children = The recommendation is for the government to take the necessary steps to reduce poverty levels within the MƒÅori and Pasifika ethnic groups. They wanted the housing issues to be addressed for these communities, improved education, more people successfully transitioning to meaningful employment, enhanced health initiatives, and continued investment in research to properly address the issues at hand. = Debt = It was asked that the government consider income levels when enforcing debt payment to government agencies. This is to ensure that necessary funds are taken away from children that are already considered to be in poverty. It was also asked that the government provide education on how to properly budget a household income. Again it is recommended by the OCC that the government help establish a low or zero interest loan to allow low-income families to have affordable debt. =Health= The OCC advocated for a universal health assessment and implementation plan for children 0-5. The goal of this was to increase co- coordination between professionals, and ensure that a child would get the needed level at care no matter what professional they were seen by. It was suggested that there was a need for services to be provided on an as-need basis. Initially all children would receive the basic care that all children require, and if it was determined that if any extra care was required during childhood that it would be provided. It is also stated that there was a need to develop a national nutrition strategy as poor nutrition has historically been an issue within New Zealand. In hopes, these improvements in healthcare would eventually lead to free primary care for all children aged 0‚Äì17. =Education= It was highly encouraged that a food-in-school program be implemented. A survey conducted in 2010 had found that over 20 percent of children did not have enough food for healthy active living. There was also a call for state funded health services within all secondary schools in order to alleviate some issues commonly seen with young people living in poverty including mental health issues, teen pregnancies, and drug and alcohol abuse. The OCC also recommended the government to expand before-school, after-school, and holiday programs for children living in poverty. This initiative would allow children to attain a proper education, while allow parents to competitively be involved in the labor market. = Local communities and families = The OCC recommends to evaluate current poverty-reducing activities already being implemented by communities throughout New Zealand. Once it finds the most effective activities it is encouraged that the government use this as a baseline for future programs. It is also suggested that parks and public spaces need to be welcoming to children. This is to ensure that children living in poverty can find safe space, even if it not available in the home environment. They also advised the government to support parenting programs so that even if individuals find themselves in a low-income situation they can still be positive role models for their children.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The former Walpole Academy building stands on the south side of Walpole's village center, set well back on the east side of Main Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, covered with gabled roof and wooden clapboards. The building has a classic Greek temple appearance, with Doric columns supporting an entablature and a triangular pediment with a fanlight detail. The building is topped by an octagonal, arcaded cupola. Walpole Academy was established as a private secondary school in 1825. The present building was erected in 1831, probably by Aaron Prentiss Howland, a local builder known for many local high quality Greek Revival designs. The academy remained private until 1853, when the town acquired it for use as its high school. It was purchased from the town by the historical society in 1950. The museum now houses items of local interest, including town records and historical artifacts.

Some of their submissions are made in conjunction with other human rights organisations, such as the Equal Justice Project, which is an initiative run by University of Auckland students seeking to provide access to equal justice.The Equal Justice Project \\"About\\" (Retrieved 5 May 2014) The Foundation's submissions have included the Human Rights Amendment Bill,Human Rights Foundation \\"Submission to the Justice and Electoral Committee on the Human Rights Amendment Bill 2013\\" the Crimes of Torture Amendment Bill,Human Rights Foundation \\"Submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Crimes of Torture Amendment Bill 2006\\" the Criminal Procedure (Reform and Modernisation) Bill,Human Rights Foundation \\"Submission to the Law and Order Select Committee on the Criminal Procedure (Reform and Modernisation) Bill 2011\\" the Immigration (Mass Arrivals) Amendment Bill 2012Human Rights Foundation \\"Submission to the Transport and Industrial Relations Select Committee on the Immigration Amendment Bill 2012\\" and recently, the Government Security Bureau (GCSB) and Related Legislation Amendment Bill.Human Rights Foundation \\"Submission to Intelligence and Security Committee on the Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill 2013\\" =GCSB Bill 2013= In May 2013, the Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill was introduced.New Zealand Parliament \\"Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill\\" (Retrieved 5 May 2014) The stated purpose of the bill was to amend the Government Communications Security Bureau Act 2003, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1996 and the Intelligence and Security Committee Act 1996, in order to make the statutory framework around the Bureau clearer.Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill (109-1), Explanatory note, at 1 The bill amended the objectives,Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill (109-1), Explanatory note, at 3 functions, powersGovernment Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill (109-1), Explanatory note, at 4 and limitations provisions. The amendments gave the GCSB the authority to provide assistance to the New Zealand Defence Force, the New Zealand Police and the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service when carrying out their lawful functions. The amendments also clarified when the GCSB‚Äôs powers of interception can be used. Before the amendments, the Act stated that the powers could only be used for the purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence. The bill amended section 13 to say that the powers of interception could also be used for information assurance and cybersecurity. The section stating that GCSB could not conduct foreign intelligence activities against New Zealanders was adjusted so that this only applies to the foreign intelligence function, not the information assurance and cybersecurity functions. The bill was split into three bills, the Government Communications Security Bureau Amendment Bill, the Inspector- General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill and the Intelligence and Security Committee Amendment Bill. They each had their third readings on the 21 August 2013(21 August 2013) 692 NZPD 12689 and each received Royal Assent on the 26 August 2013. The Human Rights Foundation's submission on this bill, made extensive references to the individual's right to privacy.Human Rights Foundation \\"Submission to Intelligence and Security Committee on the Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill 2013\\" at p.2 They expressed concern that the monitoring of individuals would also affect the right to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. These rights are contained in both the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, ss 14, 16 and 17 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 999 UNTS 171 (opened for signature 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976), arts 17, 19, 21 and 22 which New Zealand ratified on 28 December 1978.Ministry of Justice \\"International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\\" (Retrieved 5 May 2014) They argued that the changes to section 14 and the insertion of new sections 15A and 15B mean that New Zealand citizens and permanent residences can be monitored in a wider range of situations. This was previously safeguarded against in the 2003 Act and the Foundation submitted that this deviation was not justified.Human Rights Foundation \\"Submission to Intelligence and Security Committee on the Government Communications Security Bureau and Related Legislation Amendment Bill 2013\\" at p.9 They also stated their concern that the proposed amendments to the Intelligence and Security Committee Act 1996 would not do enough to counter the concerns about the GCSB's compliance, as raised in a report by Secretary of the Cabinet Rebecca Kitteridge.Rebecca Kitteridge Review of Compliance at the Government Communications Security Bureau (March 2013) Shadow reports Part of the Human Rights Foundation's activities is producing shadow and alternative reports. These are reports that are presented alongside official reports to United Nations monitoring bodies.

The three-year gap between the introduction of the Bill into Parliament and assent indicates the extent of the debates that occurred over the proposed extension of search and surveillance powers held by the State. A number of parties were concerned with the effect the Act would have on individual human rights, and the Green Party expressed the view that enforcement agencies were already abusing their powers. Others argued that the Act would make it easier to determine in each situation whether a lawful search had been carried out, as the law would be more clear and accessible if contained in just one instrument. Some parties believed that codification and clarification of the search and surveillance law would result in more compatibility with human rights.Search and Surveillance Bill as reported from the Justice and Electoral Committee (commentary) 4 November 2010. History The creation of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 was considered necessary by the New Zealand Parliament. Previously, both police and non-police powers were found in a myriad of statutesNew Zealand Law Commission's Report Search and Surveillance Powers R97, 2001. and amendments that had developed in a \\"piecemeal fashion over a long period of time\\".New Zealand Law Commission's Report Search and Surveillance Powers R97, 2001 at 14. In many circumstances, the correct legal test was difficult to ascertain, and rules would vary from one instrument to another. The New Zealand Law Commission said that because it is necessary for the State to exercise some coercive powers of surveillance, there must be requirements for regulation. Issues with the previous state of the law are exemplified in the case of Hamed & Ors v R,[2011] NZSC 101, [2012] 12 NZLR 305. where uncertainty arose from the lack of statutory controls on police power in the area of visual surveillance.Simon Collier Search and Surveillance Act (2012) 18 Auckland University Law Review 295. The Law Commission also realised that much of the previous law was out of date; the coercive powers held by enforcement agencies were insufficient to deal with sophisticated organised crime, which often utilised advanced technology. The report focused on the fact that most information is no longer only available in a hard copy, and instead computer and internet networks are increasingly used for communicating information.New Zealand Law Commission's Report Search and Surveillance Powers R97, 2001 at 14-15. New Zealand Law Commission report The Commission discussed at chapter two of the report the balance needed between human rights values and law enforcement values, where a \\"principled, values-based approach to search powers\\" is needed.New Zealand Law Commission's Report Search and Surveillance Powers R97, 2001 at 37. The main Bill of Rights Act provision that was brought into question by the proposed Bill was s21, the right of individuals ‚Äúto be secure from unreasonable search or seizure, whether of the person, property, or correspondence, or otherwise‚Äù.New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 In the Search and Surveillance Act, any decision to exercise a search or seizure must be reasonable, as must the execution of the act. The Commission also recognized New Zealand's international commitment to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights GA Res 2200A XXI (1966) Art 17.1 and Art 17.2. Four human rights values that the Commission felt the Bill potentially conflicted with were:New Zealand Law Commission's Report Search and Surveillance Powers R97, 2001 at 38. *The protection of privacy *The protection of personal integrity *The protection of property rights *The maintenance of the rule of law =Protection of privacy= The degree of privacy to which everyone should be entitled is a well-debated topic. Given modern technologies, encroachments on individual privacy have become much easier, and there is a lot of concern for invasions of privacy by law enforcement activities. The Commission considered the wording of s21 of the Bill of Rights Act with reference to the draft White Paper Bill.New Zealand Law Commission's Report Search and Surveillance Powers R97, 2001 at 39. The protection of s21 was intended to apply to \\"any circumstances where state intrusion...is unjustified\\" and this was to extend to all forms of surveillance.\\"A Bill of Rights for New Zealand: A White Paper\\" [1984-85] AJHR, para 10.152. Section 21 of the Bill of Rights Act partially incorporated the ICCPR, which emphasizes an international right to privacy. Even case law has indicated that the underpinning value in s21 is the right to privacy.R v Jefferies [1994] 1 NZLR 290, 302. (CA) =Protection of personal integrity= In some situations a reasonable search will also involve detaining the individual, which questions the right to be free from restraint. If detention is involved, law enforcement bodies must continue to \\"respect human rights norms directed at personal integrity\\".New Zealand Law Commission's Report Search and Surveillance Powers R97, 2001 at para 2.19. This is also important in situations where body searches and blood tests are required. =Protection of property rights= Enjoyment of property rights is important to New Zealand society, and individuals see the protection of such rights as part of the state's role.New Zealand Law Commission's Report Search and Surveillance Powers R97, 2001 at para 2.21. Although there is no direct reference to property rights in the Bill of Rights Act, s21 states that property cannot be unreasonably searched or seized. =Maintenance of the rule of law= The importance of this is well summarized by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in its General Comment on article 17 of the ICCPR: \\"The term 'unlawful' means that no interference can take place except in cases envisaged by the law. Interference authorized by States can only take place on the basis of law...\\".Human Rights Committee, General Comment 16 (Twenty-third session 1988) para 3. Any search or seizure can only take place if there is a positive law which allows this. Reasonable limits on human rights Human rights norms are only intended to protect against \\"unreasonable\\" search or seizure. This means that in some situations reasonable limits will be placed on rights in order to achieve \\"the functioning of the state and to protect the rights of others\\".New Zealand Law Commission's Report Search and Surveillance Powers R97, 2001 at para 2.24. Difficulties with the application of the right to privacy can be seen in Article 8(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights, where public authorities may interfere with individual privacy rights for reasons including \\"in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\\".Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Rome 4.XI. 1950 To determine reasonableness of an invasion of privacy, the Commission suggests consideration of a range of factors such as: the significance of the right contained in the relevant Bill of Rights Act section, the public interest of the intrusion on the particular right, how effective the invasion is in protecting interests which were provided to justify limitations on a right, and the proportionality of the intrusion.New Zealand Law Commission's Report Search and Surveillance Powers R97, 2001 at para 2. 25. Submission by the Human Rights Commission The purpose of the Human Rights Commission in New Zealand is the protection of human rights in accordance with the United Covenants and Conventions on Human Rights.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 1.2. The Submission agreed with the New Zealand Law Commission Report, in that any new piece of legislation would have to balance law enforcement values and human rights values.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 2.1. The Commission discussed the potential rights violations that might occur if five extensions of power proposed by the Bill were enacted: *Extending search and surveillance powers to other agencies *Consent to search by a minor *Residual warrants *Examination orders *Confidential journalistic sources. =Extension of search and surveillance powers= The Bill consolidated police powers, but also extended search and surveillance powers to non-enforcement agencies.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 5.2. The Commission expressed concern that this extension was unnecessary and that the powers granted were \\"disproportionately invasive\\".Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 5.3. =Consent by minors= As a general rule, minors under 14 are unable to consent to any type of search, however the Bill validates consent when a minor is operating a vehicle and there is nobody over 14 in the vehicle at the time.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 6.2. The age of 14 is used because that is the age when a child can legally be left alone without parental supervision. The Commission felt that it was unnecessary to lower the age to 14 in such circumstances. The Convention on the Rights of the Child specifies that a person is a child until they turn 18, and the Commission considered that this is the age of consent that should be used in all search situations.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 6.4. =Residual warrants= This type of warrant is required when the search proposed by the enforcement agency may result in an invasion of a person's reasonable expectation of privacy.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 7.2. It is up to the agency to make the decision as to whether there might be an intrusion of a person's reasonable expectation of privacy, and the Commission considered that this may conflict with human rights values.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 7.4. =Examination orders= The Bill gives enforcement agencies a limited power of examination in reference to individual persons, as long as the agency has grounds to suspect a specific offence has been or will be committed, and that the person possesses relevant information.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 8.1. This would be contrary to the privilege against self-incrimination in many situations.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 8.5. The Commission wanted the definition of information limited to \\"assessments of complex documents for fraud purposes\\" to try and protect people from unjust self- incrimination.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 8.7. =Confidential journalistic source= Although freedom of expression must always be balanced against other competing public interests, it is an important feature in New Zealand's democracy.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 9.1. The provisions of the Bill conflict most with freedom of expression in relation to the press.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 9.2. Confidentiality of sources is a key journalistic principle, however the Bill warrants searches to determine those sources.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 9.6. The Commission considered that a presumption should be included in the legislation against journalists being subject to the search provisions.Submission by the Human Rights Commission, Search and Surveillance Bill, Justice and Electoral Committee (2009) at 9.9. The Commission also recommended that a provision be added to the legislation which requires all agencies to act only in accordance with human rights values when exercising their search and surveillance powers. A purpose clause was included by the Justice and Electoral Committee to ensure that existing rights found in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, the Privacy Act 1993 and the Evidence Act 2006 are all recognized. This inclusion in the final piece of legislation demonstrates the importance of human rights values \\"in the context of search and surveillance powers\\". Statement of the Attorney-General In the statement issued by the Attorney-General regarding the Bill's consistency with the Bill of Rights Act, it was reported that the Act would not result in any rights violations.Search and Surveillance Bill (45-1): Consistency with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (Statement by the Attorney-General). Search and Surveillance Act The Bill narrowly passed through Parliament by 61 votes to 57, with all of the Opposition voting against, as well as the MƒÅori Party.http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/6625136/Search-and- Surveillance-Bill-passes Case law is likely to determine the scope of the Act in the future, especially in conjunction with s21 of the Bill of Rights Act. Simon Collier wrote in a 2012 article that the Act \\"is a marked improvement on the previous law in the area of surveillance\\" and was necessary to properly safeguard rights. There are still varying views on the expansion of search and surveillance powers within this Act.

The Council has established norms and standards which encourage member states to adopt laws, policies and programmes. The Council of Europe has developed the 1992 European Sports Charter with the view to the promotion of sport as an important factor in human development and provides that Governments should take the steps necessary to apply the provisions of the Charter in accordance with the principles set out in the Code of Sports Ethics set out by the Council.http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/epas/resources/charter_en.asp, http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/epas/resources/texts/code_en.pdf This Charter will help to enable every individual to participate in sport and to ensure that all young people should have the opportunity to receive physical education instruction and the opportunity to acquire basic sports skills.http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/epas/resources/charter_en.asp, http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/epas/resources/texts/code_en.pdf The Council wants to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to take part in sport and physical recreation in a safe and healthy environment and in co-operation with the appropriate sports organisations. It will also look to ensure that everyone with the interest and ability should have the opportunity to improve their standard of performance in sport and reach levels of personal achievement and/or publicly recognised levels of excellence. The Charter will also help to protect and develop the moral and ethical aspects of sport and promote the human dignity and safety of those involved in sport, by safeguarding sport, sportsmen and women from exploitation for political, commercial and financial gain and from practices that are abusive or degrading including the abuse of drugs and the sexual harassment and abuse of children, young people and women. Child Protection Sport is a physical activity which is most readily identified with youth as there has been an increase in youth involvement in high performance sports due to early identification of athletic talent and early specialisation. There is a need for child‚Äôs rights to be protected in organised sports as abuses can take place.Bruce Kidd and Peter Donnelly,International Review for the Sociology if Sport 2000 35, http://irs.sagepub.com/content/35/2/131 The United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace (UNOSDP) has a strategy in place to protect the rights of the child when it comes to abuse. The most commonly abused human rights in relation to youth sport recognised by the UNOSDP found in conjunction with 1990 Convention on the Rights of the Child are the right to health (Article 24), the right to protection from all forms of violence and maltreatment (Article 19), the right to protection from trafficking (Article 11), the right to education (Article 23) and the right to rest (Article 31.1).https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf The World Health Organization report in 1999 defined child abuses as \\"all forms of physical and/or emotional ill treatment, sexual abuses, neglect or negligent treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child‚Äôs health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power.‚Äù The most common forms of abuse in youth sport are child trafficking and labour, physical abuse, peer violence, physical violence by adults including physical punishment, violence due to participation in competitions, sexual abuse and harassment.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf Also emotional and psychological abuse such as neglect and bullying.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf Abuse can lead to other problems which can have lifelong effects on the child such as physical injuries, sexual health problems, depression, low self- esteem, eating and sleeping disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf Abuses in youth sport can happen for numerous reasons. Abuses can occur because children feel a sense of dependency.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf Children find themselves in unique situations where they often train with those who are older or with an adult coach therefore the environment they are in creates a pseudo family within which there are certain expectations and pressures placed on them which can create strong emotions and they form a dependency to the adults in charge.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf Training to please, the psychological development of the child often impulses them to train excessively and do almost anything to please adults and achieve in their chosen sport which can make them vulnerable to the possibility of abuse.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf Lack of qualified trainer‚Äôs, often trainers are sports people who may have gone through a professional sports career but may not have the necessary coach training required to deal with children.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf Lack of international standards, the UNOSDP is working to develop international standards with respect to human rights to protect children in sports as the lack of international standards can lead to human rights abuses of children in sport.http://www.righttoplay.com/International/news-and- media/Documents/Final%20Report%20revised%202010.pdf Combating Human Rights Violations In order to move forward to prevent human rights violations the UNOSDP International Working Group propose that States should implement policies that educate children, parents and coaches, along with developing policies and international standards to combat human rights abuses in youth sport.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf Educating children about the risks of abuse in sport, their rights and whom to ask for help will help combat breaches of human rights and abuse. The Canadian Red Cross RespectedED teaches children and adults how healthy relationships look and feel, detecting signs of abuse or harassment and how to get help.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf Raising awareness of abuse to parents by informing parents of the possible harms that intensive training can do to their children, their role and responsibilities, and how they can contribute to the prevention of child abuse in sport.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf Targeting coaches by providing training and education to coaches on ethics in sport and acceptable training techniques as well as screening for potential offenders which should help to mitigate child abuse.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf This provides children with the appropriate direction and guidance and allows for competent supervision.Paulo David, Human Rights in Youth Sport: A critical review of children's rights in competitive sports, (Routledge, London and New York, 2005). Developing practices to protect children and youth, and also developing policies that concern sport participation, training and competition should help recognise and prioritise the needs and interests of the child or youth at all times.https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/SDP%20IWG/2011-08-16_Child_Protection_in_Sport.pdf The development of a child-centered sports system which aims at developing competitive talent among athletes and fulfilling their human rights and dignity is a way of enabling children to develop holistically in a sports system.Paulo David, Human Rights in Youth Sport: A critical review of children's rights in competitive sports, (Routledge, London and New York, 2005). A child sensitive system to combat human rights violations would look at promoting equality, non-discrimination and fairness.Paulo David, Human Rights in Youth Sport: A critical review of children's rights in competitive sports, (Routledge, London and New York, 2005). Addressing the best interests of the child which allows them to be included in any decisions being made but also allows others to focus on the impact the potential situation may have on the child.Paulo David, Human Rights in Youth Sport: A critical review of children's rights in competitive sports, (Routledge, London and New York, 2005). Also recognising the child as the subject of rights and their ability to exercise rights makes them less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.Paulo David, Human Rights in Youth Sport: A critical review of children's rights in competitive sports, (Routledge, London and New York, 2005). Evaluating the evolving capacities of the child as children are constantly developing therefore consideration has to be given to age, maturity and capacity for discernment.Paulo David, Human Rights in Youth Sport: A critical review of children's rights in competitive sports, (Routledge, London and New York, 2005). All young athletes are different and cannot compete at the same levels therefore the developmental capacities need to be addressed.Paulo David, Human Rights in Youth Sport: A critical review of children's rights in competitive sports, (Routledge, London and New York, 2005).

In this process, the 'packed' cellular products are released/secreted outside the cell across its plasma membrane. However, this vesicular membrane is retained and recycled by the secretory cells. This phenomenon has a key role in synaptic neurotransmission, endocrine secretion, mucous secretion, granular-product secretion by neutrophils, etc. The scientists behind this discovery were awarded Nobel prize for the year 2013. In the prokaryotic gram-negative bacterial cells, membrane vesicle trafficking is mediated via bacterial outer membrane bounded nano-sized vesicles, called bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). In this case, however, the OMV membrane is secreted as well, along with OMV-contents to outside the secretion-active bacterium. This phenomenon has a key role in host-pathogen interactions, endotoxic shock in patients, invasion and infection of animals/plants, inter-species bacterial competition, quorum sensing, exocytosis, etc.  Movement within eukaryotic cells  Here a vesicle forms as cargo, receptors and coat proteins gather. The vesicle then buds outwards and breaks free into the cytoplasm. The vesicle is moved towards its target location then docks and fuses. Once vesicles are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum and modified in the golgi body they make their way to a variety of destinations within the cell. Vesicles first leave the golgi body and are released into the cytoplasm in a process called budding. Vesicles are then moved towards their destination by motor proteins. Once the vesicle arrives at its destination it joins with the bi-lipid layer in a process called fusion, and then releases its contents. = Budding = Receptors embedded in the membrane of the golgi body bind specific cargo (such as dopamine) on the lumenal side of the vesicle. These cargo receptors then recruit a variety of proteins including other cargo receptors and coat proteins such as clathrin, COPI and COPII. As more and more of these coating proteins come together, they cause the vesicle to bud outward and eventually break free into the cytoplasm. The coating proteins are then shed into the cytoplasm to be recycled and reused. = Motility between cell compartments = For movement between different compartments within the cell, vesicles rely on the motor proteins myosin, kinesin (primarily anterograde transport) and dynein (primarily retrograde transport). One end of the motor proteins attaches to the vesicle while the other end attaches to either microtubules or microfilaments. The motor proteins then move by hydrolyzing ATP, which propels the vesicle towards its destination. = Docking and Fusion = As a vesicle nears its intended location, RAB proteins in the vesicle membrane interact with docking proteins at the destination site. These docking proteins bring the vesicle in closer to interact with the SNARE Complex found in the target membrane. The SNARE complex reacts with synaptobrevin found on the vesicle membrane. This forces the vesicle membrane against the membrane of the target complex (or the outer membrane of the cell) and causes the two membranes to fuse. Depending on whether the vesicle fuses with a target complex or the outer membrane, the contents of the vesicle are then released either into the target complex or outside the cell. = Examples In eukaryotes = # Intracellular trafficking occurs between subcellular compartments like Golgi cisternae and multivesicular endosomes for transport of soluble proteins as MVs. # Budding of MVs directly from plasma membrane as microvesicles released outside the secretory cells. # Exosomes are MVs that can form inside an internal compartment like multivesicular endosome. Exosomes are released eventually due to fusion of this endosome with plasma membrane of cell. # Hijacking of exosomal machinery by some viruses like retroviruses, wherein viruses bud inside multivesicular endosomes and get secreted subsequently as exosomes. All these types (1-4) of modes of membrane vesicle trafficking, taking place in eukaryotic cells have been explained diagrammatically.  In prokaryotes  Unlike in eukaryotes, membrane vesicular trafficking in prokaryotes is an emerging area in interactive biology for intra-species (quorum sensing) and inter-species signaling at host-pathogen interface, as prokaryotes lack internal membrane-compartmentalization of their cytoplasm. For more than four decades, cultures of gram negative microbes revealed the presence of nanoscale membrane vesicles. A role for membrane vesicles in pathogenic processes has been suspected since the 1970s, when they were observed in gingival plaque by electron microscopy. These vesicles were suspected to promote bacterial adhesion to the host epithelial cell surface. Their role in invasion of animal host cells in vivo was then demonstrated. In inter-bacterial interactions, OMVs released by Pseudomonas aeruginosa microbes were shown to fuse with outer membrane of other gram negative microbes causing their bacteriolysis; these OMVs could lyse gram-positive microbes as well. Role of OMVs in Helicobacter pylori infection of human primary antral epithelial cells, as model that closely resembles human stomach, has also been confirmed VacA-containing OMVs could also be detected in human gastric mucosa, infected with H. pylori.. Salmonella OMVs were also shown to have direct role in invasion of chicken ileal epithelial cells in vivo in the year, 1993 (ref 4) and later, in hijacking of defense macrophages into sub-service for pathogen replication and consequent apoptosis of infected macrophages in typhoid-like animal infection. These studies brought the focus on OMVs into membrane vesicle trafficking and showed this phenomenon as involved in multifarious processes like genetic transformation, quorum sensing, competition arsenal among microbes, etc., and invasion, infection, immuno- modulation, etc., of animal hosts. A mechanism has already been proposed for generation of OMVs by gram negative microbes involving, expansion of pockets of periplasm (named, periplasmic organelles) due to accumulation of bacterial cell secretions and their pinching off as outer membrane bounded vesicles (OMVs) on the lines of a 'soap bubble' formation with a bubble tube, and further fusion or uptake of diffusing OMVs by host/target cells (Fig. 2). Fig.2 Membrane vesicle trafficking Mechanism (A-E), proposed for release (stages A-C) of outer membrane vesicles,OMVs from gram-negative bacteria in analogy of soap-bubble formation from a bubble-tube assembly ( RC in stage C) of rivet complexes, RC, and their translocation (stage D) to animal host/target cell, TC. General secretory pathway (GSP) secretes proteins across bacterial cell membrane (CM) to bulge out lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-rich outer membrane (OM) above peptidoglycan (PDG) layer into pockets of inflated periplasm, called periplasmic organelles (PO) to pinch off OMVs containing outer membrane proteins (OMPs), secretory proteins (SP) and chaperons (CH). OMVs signal epithelial host cells (EHC) to ruffle (R) aiding macropinoctosis of gram negative (G-) microbe (stage E) Fig.3 Transmission electron micrograph of human Salmonella organism bearing periplasmic organelles, (p, line arrow) on its surface and releasing bacterial outer membrane vesicles (MV) being endocytosed (curved arrow) by macrophage cell (M) in chicken ileum in vivo. In conclusion, membrane vesicle trafficking via OMVs of Gram-negative organisms, cuts across species and kingdoms - including plant kingdom \\\\- in the realm of cell-to-cell signaling.

French troops under Joseph Souham fended off three relief attempts by the corps of Fran√ßois S√©bastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt. Meanwhile, the French besiegers led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau compelled the Coalition defenders to surrender the city. The fighting occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of the Wars of the French Revolution. In 1794 Ypres was part of the Austrian Netherlands, but today it is a municipality in Belgium, located about west of Brussels. In the Flanders Campaign of 1794, the Coalition army made its main drive against the French center while the French attacked on the two flanks. The Coalition was successful at first but the French soon seized the initiative with persistent attacks. When the Coalition forces shifted east to defend the line of the Sambre River at the end of May, the left wing of Pichegru's Army of the North laid siege to Ypres. Clerfayt's outnumbered corps found itself unable to defend the western flank. A week after Ypres fell, the French won a critical victory on the eastern flank at the Battle of Fleurus.  Background  On France's northeast frontier in March 1794 the Army of the North fielded 126,035 troops or 194,930 if all the garrisons were added. The subordinate Army of the Ardennes numbered only 6,757 soldiers ready for action but 32,773 men when all its garrisons were counted. The combined total was 227,703 men, far too large a number for any one general to manage at that time. Against these, the Coalition fielded 150,000 troops to defend the Austrian Netherlands and the Dutch Republic and 20,000 more to hold Luxembourg. The Coalition plan was to press hard against the French defenses and perhaps open the way to Paris. General of Division Jean-Charles Pichegru commanded the Army of the North which held the frontier from Dunkirk on the west, through Lille, Douai and Cambrai to Maubeuge on the east. The Army of the Ardennes was posted on its right. The French armies were more numerous but lacked the discipline of the Coalition armies. Lazare Carnot drew up the French strategic plan which was to attack on the two flanks, a \\"pet theory\\" of his. Meanwhile, the Coalition armies under Austrian Feldmarschall Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld struck in the center with 85,000 soldiers. After repelling two fumbling attempts at relief, Coburg successfully concluded the Siege of Landrecies on 30 April 1794. Meanwhile, Pichegru's forces drove back Feldzeugmeister Fran√ßois S√©bastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt's corps on the west flank, in the area of Kortrijk (Courtrai) and Menen (Menin) at the end of April and early May.Dodge (2011), p. 120 On the east flank, Pichegru simplified his command problems in mid-April by placing three divisions between Cambrai and Maubeuge under General of Division Jacques Ferrand.Phipps (2011), p. 287 A few weeks later, the French started attacking the line of the Sambre River, but were beaten on 13 and 24 May. These were the battles of Grandreng and Erquelinnes.Smith (1998), p. 81 Coburg's main army attacked the Army of the North on 17 and 18 May. Because the attacking columns were poorly coordinated, the French repelled the Coalition army with heavy losses at the Battle of Tourcoing.Dodge (2011), p. 121 General of Division Joseph Souham led the French army in Pichegru's absence. Pichegru was bloodily repulsed by Coburg at the Battle of Tournay on 22 May. Relations between Coburg and the British Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany became strained and the two could not decide on a common strategy. On the east flank, the French attacked across the Sambre for the third time at the end of May but were forced to pull back in the Battle of Gosselies.Smith (1998), p. 83  Operations  = Siege = When he placed his right wing divisions under a single leader in mid-April, Pichegru moved his left wing forward. From left to right, the divisions were led by General of Division Pierre Antoine Michaud at the port of Dunkirk with 13,943 men, General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau at Cassel with 15,968 troops and Souham at Lille with 31,865 soldiers. The 7,822-strong brigade of General of Brigade Pierre-Jacques Osten held Pont- √†-Marcq.Phipps (2011), pp. 291‚Äì292 In early May, General of Division Jacques Philippe Bonnaud's division arrived from the right wing and absorbed Osten's brigade, making a total of 23,000 men.Phipps (2011), p. 294 These were unusually large divisions. In the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse at a later period the divisions numbered between 8,000 and 12,000 men. As late as 1 September 1794, Souham's division counted 20,000 soldiers, Moreau's had 13,000, Bonnaud's numbered 11,800 and General of Division √âloi Laurent Despeaux's had 6,600.Smith (1998), p. 69 Jean-Charles Pichegru Worried about the persistent French attacks along the Sambre, the Coalition high command shifted their weight to the east to cover Charleroi, taking troops from the Duke of York's force at Tournai. Encouraged by his enemies' weakness, Pichegru invested Ypres on 1 June 1794. Moreau's division was employed in the siege operations. Souham covered the siege with Michaud's division on his left and Despeaux's division on his right. Instead of concentrating their forces to crush one of the French wings, the Coalition forces shifted back and forth ineffectively. Meanwhile, the Duke of York was left uselessly guarding TournaiPhipps (2011), pp. 312‚Äì313 with 30,000 Austrians.Phipps (2011), p. 317 Austrian General-major Paul von Salis commanded the 7,000-man Coalition garrison of Ypres. The Austrian contingent was made up of two battalions of the Stuart Infantry Regiment Nr. 18, the 3rd Battalions of the Schr√∂der Nr. 7 and Callenberg Nr. 54 Infantry Regiments and one company of the O'Donnell Freikorps. The Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel units consisted of two battalions each of the Erbprinz, Lossberg and Prinz Karl Infantry Regiments, the Leib Squadron of the Gendarmes and 12 field pieces. The Hessians were led by Generals-major Heinrich von Borcke and Georg von Lengerke. Pichegru had about 50,000 troops in the vicinity of Ypres.Smith (1998), p. 85 Ypres became a cloth trading center in the Middle Ages and was first fortified in the period 1200‚Äì1400. The Spanish strengthened the medieval defenses early in the 1600s. The French captured the city but handed it back to Spain in the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. The Walloon engineer Jean Boulengier greatly improved the works in 1669. Nevertheless, in a 1678 siege the city was captured by the French. The military engineer S√©bastien Le Prestre de Vauban immediately set about making extensive changes to the defenses that year and later in 1682. The modernizations made Ypres a fortress of the first class. Ironically, Ypres was handed over to the Dutch Republic by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, along with Veurne (Furnes), Fort Knokke, Menen, Tournai, Mons, Charleroi, Namur and Ghent. Though the fortresses were in the Austrian Netherlands, they were intended to serve as a barrier to protect Holland. Emperor Joseph II slighted the defenses of Ypres though they were later partly restored. = Relief efforts and surrender = On 6 June 1794 there was a skirmish at Vry-Bosch (Vrijbos) near Houthulst north of Ypres between 5,500 Coalition troops and an unknown number of French soldiers. General-major Rudolf von Hammerstein led the 3rd and 4th Hanoverian Grenadier Battalions, two battalions of the 14th Hanoverian Infantry Regiment, one squadron of the Hanoverian Leib Cavalry Regiment, the British 12th Foot and 38th Foot, three squadrons of the British 8th Light Dragoons, two battalions of French Royalists, one squadron of Hesse-Kassel Gendarmes and 11 Hanoverian guns. The Coalition lost about 80 casualties, including four killed, 33 wounded and nine captured among the Hanoverians. Aside from 30 men captured, French losses are not known. This was the first unsuccessful attempt to relieve Ypres. When Clerfayt took a position at Roeselare (Roulers), Pichegru attacked him with three divisions on 10 June. After some fighting the Coalition corps withdrew to Tielt (Thielt).Phipps (2011), p. 312. Presumably these were the divisions of Souham, Bonnaud and Despeaux which Phipps mentions elsewhere. Souham was in tactical control of approximately 20,000 soldiers of whom about 1,000 were killed and wounded in the fighting. In this second attempt to break the siege, the Coalition lost 600 killed and wounded plus 400 captured out of the 20,000 men under Clerfayt. The Austrian troops engaged were two battalions of the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment Nr. 3, two grenadier battalions, eight squadrons of the Latour Chevau-l√©ger Regiment Nr. 31 and two batteries of foot artillery. Soldiers from the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt involved in the action were the 1st Battalions of the Leib- Grenadiers and Landgraf Infantry Regiments, two companies each of j√§gers and light infantry, four squadrons of chevau-l√©gers and one foot artillery battery. Evidently, the Austrians suffered most of the losses because the Hessians reported only one killed and 16 wounded.Smith (1998), p. 84 Roeselare is located about northeast of Ypres. Jacques MacDonald At 7:00 AM on 13 June 1794, Clerfayt launched a sudden assault on Despeaux's division. General of Brigade Philippe Joseph Malbrancq's brigade was routed and General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Salme's brigade was pushed back to the south in the direction of Menen. The weight of the Coalition attack next fell on General of Brigade Jacques MacDonald's brigade at Hooglede, supported by an additional regiment on its left. MacDonald's men held their ground for six hours, fighting off repeated cavalry charges. Finally, General of Brigade (and later Admiral) Jan Willem de Winter's brigade advanced on MacDonald's left and Salme's rallied brigade came forward on his right. At this, the worn-out Coalition soldiers withdrew. Hooglede is northwest of Roeselare. At Hooglede Clerfayt brought 19,000 troops into action of whom 900 became casualties. These included British losses of 28 killed, 70 wounded and 13 missing and Hanoverian losses of 35 killed, 113 wounded and five missing. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Anton Szt√°ray led the Austrian forces, which included two battalions each of grenadiers, the Archduke Charles Nr. 3, Sztaray Nr. 33 and Wurttemberg Nr. 38 Infantry Regiments, six battalions of reinforcements under General-major Wilhelm Lothar Maria von Kerpen and three foot artillery batteries. General von Hammerstein led the Hanoverian contingent, the 1st, 3rd and 4th Grenadier Battalions, two battalions of the 14th Infantry Regiment, two squadrons of the Leib Cavalry Regiment and two foot artillery batteries. Other engaged troops included the British 38th and 55th Foot Regiments and two squadrons of the 8th Light Dragoons, the French Royalist Loyal Emigrants Battalion and one squadron of Hessen-Kassel Gendarmes. Altogether, the 24,000-strong French force under Souham and MacDonald suffered 1,300 casualties and lost one field piece. Hooglede was the third and final Coalition attempt to lift the siege. Ypres surrendered on the 17thSmith (1998), p. 85 or 18 June. The surviving members of the garrison marched out with the honors of war and surrendered their weapons, 30 Hessian colors, four Austrian colors and 12 field guns. During the siege 400 defenders were killed. French losses are unknown.  Results  Digby Smith called Ypres the key to the province of Flanders, while Ramsay Weston Phipps remarked that the Austrians never realized the significance of the fortress. Clerfayt immediately retreated to Ghent, chased by Souham's covering force. Part of the victorious Army of the North came into contact with the Duke of York's corps at Oudenaarde on 26 June, but were called away to drive northeast along the coast. Also on the 26th, General of Division Jean Baptiste Jourdan's army defeated Coburg's main army at the Battle of Fleurus. On 1 July, Pichegru's army was at Bruges and by 11 July Pichegru and Jourdan's armies were linked on an east-west line through Mechelen (Malines), Brussels and Namur. The divergent purposes of the Coalition allies now came into the open. The Dutch and British positioned their forces to defend Holland while the Austrians fell back to Louvain and Tienen (Tirlemont) in order to cover Maastricht and their communications with Cologne and Koblenz.Phipps (2011), pp. 318‚Äì320  Notes   References   Source for first names of Hessian and Hanoverian generals.

Pacific Pathways have developed into operations to both increase readiness of US, Allied, and Partnered forces while shaping the security environment in support of an open and free Indo-Pacific and providing options to the combatant commander.

Pacific Pathways 2.0  In October 2018, General Robert Brooks Brown announced changes to the Pacific Pathways program to utilize the Pathways to compete with rivals in the Indo-Pacific area by spending longer time periods in priority nations to build deeper relationships. This design will mean that units will be in hubs in treaty nations for 4‚Äì6 months, and will be positioned west of the international date line. The Pathways forces will be able to also provide options to the INDOPACOM commander to assist partner nations in times of need or if needed to transition from competition to conflict.

For the old western shooter laserdisc video game by Konami, see Badlands (1984 video game). For the 1989 racing game by Midway, see Badlands (video game) Badland (stylized BADLAND) is a mobile video game developed by Frogmind Games and released on the iOS and Android platforms. It was released on Windows Phone 8 in June 2014. There is also a Game of the Year Edition that was released in May 2015 for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox One, Wii U and Steam for Linux, Microsoft Windows and OS X. In December 2015, its sequel named Badland 2 was released on iOS and Android. For the same platforms, was released in September 2018, its real-time strategy spin-off named Badland Brawl, where rules are mixed between Angry Birds and Clash Royale. Gameplay The player flies around a little black creature called a Clone through the woods of the game. Beginning in Day I, the game progresses through four stages which consist of Dawn, Noon, Dusk, and Night, each with a separate color scheme and new theme of traps. As the player goes through Day I, egg-shaped machines begin to come out of the water of the background. Heading into the night, the machines begin to turn on and the game becomes harder as the machines become part of the dangers of the forest. Eventually, the character succeeds in disabling the machines and the machines become dormant once again until Day II begins it all over. Most of Day II is similar in plot structure, but smaller octopus-like machines begin to make themselves known and the animals in the forest begin to disappear. The last level includes saving a rabbit that was hanging by its foot and eventually coming to fly in front of a giant eye of one of the machines, leaving a cliffhanger into possible future updates. Also included in the game are possible in-app purchases that continue the story with some of Clony's friends, including ones nicknamed Snorf and Fury, featured in their own level packs. In early 2014, level pack Doomsday was released, featuring Fury and his escape from the machine infested woods. Also included is the Daydream level pack in which Snorf escapes finding the magic of the forest makes the woods not all as it seems to be. In 2015 a new multiplayer feature was released which allowed up to 4 players to play at the same time. = Level World = Another new feature, \\"Level World\\" was introduced, in which players could make their own levels and release it in the \\"Level World\\" for other players to explore.

One of the founders of the House of Castro, he was the second son of Fernando Garc√≠a de Hita and Tegridia (or Trigidia), sister or aunt of Count Rodrigo Mart√≠nez and relative of the Ans√∫rez family. His paternal grandfather may have been Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez, who died at the battle of Ucl√©s in 1108. Military career In April 1126 Rodrigo and his elder brother Gutierre made submission to the new king (later emperor), Alfonso VII, along with the rest of the Castilian nobility. Rodrigo served as the king's alf√©rez the summer of 1130 until spring the next year. (His predecessor‚ÄîPedro Alfonso‚Äîis last recorded on 10 June 1130 and he was in office by 26 August, while the last record of him there is dated 15 May 1131 and his successor‚ÄîPedro Garc√©s‚Äîwas in place by 29 May.) In June and July 1137 he and Gutierre participated in the royal expedition to Galicia, where Tuy was reconquered from the Portuguese and they visited Santiago de Compostela. Rodrigo subscribed royal charters of 26‚Äì27 June at Tuy and 17 July and 29 July at Santiago. In October he rejoined the royal court as it travelled through Castile. On 9 October he subscribed a royal charter at Burgos, on the 20th the court was on the Ebro and on 29 October they were at N√°jera. Most of Rodrigo's subsequent military career took place on the southern frontier, in the Reconquista against the Almoravids. In 1137 Rodrigo succeeded Count Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Lara as governor (alcaide) of Toledo. Shortly after this he raided the environs of C√≥rdoba and defeated an army under Tashfin ibn Ali, the future sultan, at a place called Almont (perhaps Almonacid) on his return. According to the Chronicle of Emperor Alfonso, \\"the military experiences of Rodrigo Gonz√°lez and Rodrigo Fern√°ndez against the Moors were indeed great, but they have not been described in this book.\\"Chronicle, book I, ¬ß47. In 1138 Rodrigo Fern√°ndez joined King Alfonso and Count Rodrigo Mart√≠nez in a plundering expedition along the river Guadalquivir, which brought back a host of slaves. He was present at the unsuccessful siege of Coria in July, where Rodrigo Mart√≠nez was killed in action. In April 1139 Rodrigo and his brother were ordered to besiege Oreja with their own knights assisted by the local cavalry and infantry units of the frontier towns. By 25 July the king had taken command of the siege, which he brought to a successful conclusion in October. Rodrigo was probably present with the royal court throughout, following Alfonso on detours to Toledo on 14 August and 26 October. In 1142, according to the Anales toledanos, he raided a town called Silvia in the Algarve and brought back 10,000 captives. On 22 February 1140 Rodrigo and Gutierre were at Carri√≥n de los Condes to witness the treaty between Alfonso VII and Count Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona. In 1142 he was the royal tenente holding the town of √Åvila in fief from the crown. He is last recorded at court in 1144 and disappears from the record after that. He was dead by 1148, when his widow married Count Ramiro Fr√≥ilaz. Marriage and children According to the 14th- century genealogist Pedro de Barcelos, Rodrigo had a daughter, Aldonza Ruiz de Castro, who married Lope D√≠az de Haro. According to the modern genealogist Luis de Salazar y Castro, Aldonza was the daughter of Rodrigo and Elo Mart√≠nez Osorio. These genealogies are false. Rodrigo's wife was Elo (also spelled Eilo or Eylo) √Ålvarez, daughter of √Ålvar F√°√±ez, and he had no daughter named Aldonza, according to near-contemporary historian Rodrigo Jim√©nez de Rada. Rodrigo and Elo had at least five sons and one daughter. The eldest son, Fernando, \\"the Castilian\\", became the leader of the House of Castro after the death of his uncle Gutierre. Two of Rodrigo's children married children of Rodrigo Mu√±oz de Guzm√°n. His daughter Sancha married √Ålvaro Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n, tenente of Mansilla, and his son Pedro married Urraca Rodr√≠guez de Guzm√°n. A third son, √Ålvaro, became the majordomo of King Ferdinand II of Le√≥n. A younger son, Gutierre el Escalabrado (\\"the head-wounded\\"), married Elvira Osorio.

The creator posted the game on Indiegogo to help crowdfund the development. The game takes place on a derelict spaceship used to mine caffeine, and it is inspired by Condemned: Criminal Origins, F.E.A.R., and Doom 3. Caffeine was released in five episodes for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux on 5 October 2015, although it has yet to release any episodes after the first. Caffeine was negatively received by the majority of the public and almost all of the critics. While it has not been canceled, the second episode has been on a four-year hiatus and there is not information on when it will be released.  Story and gameplay  Caffeine is set in a universe where the Earth has run out of its caffeine supplies, so big companies invest in mining ships that go into space to mine caffeine. In Caffeine, the player takes the role of a young boy aboard a caffeine mining ship that has an extreme addiction to caffeine. The boy wakes up with no memory of why he is on the ship and decides to explore the ship. The boy runs into multiple characters throughout his journey on the mostly abandoned ship. There are no combat mechanics and the gameplay mostly involves wondering around the empty halls. The horror aspect of the game comes from what the player can't see and the eerie sound design that makes the atmosphere frightening. The main draw of the game is the player finding their way through the ship by solving various puzzles to let them progress the game. The puzzles are environmental and memory-based in which the player has to travel to many different locations and memorize different information in order to get through blocked areas. There is also a lot of lore to find throughout the game in the form of sticky notes, audio logs, whiteboards, etc. The goal of this aspect is to make the game feel more lived-in.  Development and marketing  Caffeine was developed by Incandescent Imaging, which is a small indie video game developer company. Their only two releases are the first episode of Caffeine and a mobile game called Boxed In. The game was developed mostly by the head of the company, Dylan Browne. He is the creative mind behind most of the game. Other important figures are Composer Adam Klingman and Sound Designer Jonathan Wachoru, who were responsible for all of the sound and music in the game. Over the years preceding its release, Caffeine made appearances in popular video game news sites, such as IGN and Kotaku. All of this led to there being some hype surrounding the game, but it died out with a lackluster launch of episode one and no follow-up for further episodes.  Release and reception  Caffeine was released on October 5, 2015 on Steam for PC players as well as being playable on many virtual reality systems. The game was never released to any other system. It can be bought on a per episode basis or one could buy the season pass and receive all of the episodes whenever they come out. As of now, there is no information on when the next episode for the game will be released. Caffeine was mostly negatively received upon release and did not grow enough to hit a mainstream audience or even garner an audience of its own.

Khushbagh hosts the graves of the Nawabs of Bengal of the Afshar dynasty and their family members; while Jafarganj Cemetery hosts the graves of the later Nawabs and their families, starting from Mir Jafar, who belonged to the Najafi dynasty. Khushbagh is the resting place of Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah, his wife Lutf-un-nisa, Nawab Alivardi Khan, and his mother, amongst others. History left The garden-cemetery was built by the first Nawab of Bengal, Nawab Alivardi Khan. It consists of walled enclosures. The outer walls had looped holes for musketry and used to be flanked by octagonal bastions. The garden hosts the graves of Siraj ud-Daulah and Alivardi Khan, inside a square, flat-roofed mausoleum surrounded by an arcade verandah. It also hosts a mosque, built by Nawab Alivardi Khan, on the lines of the Jama Masjid of Delhi, built on a plinth of area. After the death of Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah, in the Battle of Plassey in 1757, his wife Lutf-un-nisa refused to join Mir Jafar's harem and fled to Dacca (present day Dhaka, in Bangladesh).

As per the tenets of the sect each predecessor is required to nominate his successor prior to his death. Following his death, a question on succession arose where two rival claimants emerged for the title of 53rd DƒÅ'ƒ´ al-Mutlaq: his son, Mufaddal Saifuddin, and his half-brother, Khuzaima Qutbuddin, who was previously Mazoon of the Dawoodi Bohra. The challenge created a divide in the community with the vast majority aligning with Mufaddal Saifuddin whilst a small but not insignificant number aligned with Khuzaima Qutbuddin. Mufaddal Saifuddin assumed control of the Dawoodi Bohra administration and infrastructure. He is largely accepted as the Bohras' leader by government and other public bodies. The UK Charity Commission has stated in writing, that \\"our view is that His Holiness Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin is the current incumbent of the office of Dai al-Mutlaq.\\"  Overview  Prior to 2014, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin suffered a stroke in a London on 1 June 2011 and on 4 June 2011, Mufaddal Saifuddin was named his successor. Following this, Mufaddal Saifuddin assumed this role as the successor and his appointment was welcomed by the Dawoodi Bohra community. In the Dawoodi Bohra Mithaq (oath of allegiance), Mufaddal Saifuddin's name was taken alongside Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's. Together, Mohammed Burhanuddin and Mufaddal Saifuddin traveled the globe looking after the affairs of the community up until 2014. Following the Syedna's death, Mufaddal took up the office of Da'i al-Mutlaq, as per the appointment by Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin. Khuzaima Qutubuddin claiming to have been appointed heir 50 years earlier in secrecy, challenged Mufaddal's right to be Dai in court.http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-claimant-to-syedna-seat-declares- official-challenge-1968682, 'but this has been challenged by Khuzaima'  Mufaddal Saifuddin's Position  Mufaddal Saifuddin's position is that he has been appointed a number of times in presence of multiple witnesses. These incidences are: * On 27 January 1969 (corresponding to the night of 11th Zil Qa'dah 1388 H) ‚Äì in the presence of Sh Ibrahim Yamani, Sh Abdulhusain Tambawala & Sh Abdulhusein Sh Ibrahim Abdul Qadir, in Mumbai. This appointment is noted in a diary entry that was shown to the public on 4 February 2014 (4 Rabi al Akhar 1435H) by Mufaddal Saifuddin. * On 24 October 1994 (corresponding to 20 Jumada al Ula 1415H) in the presence of Sh Abdulhusain Yamani, in Karachi. * In October/November 2005, during the month of Ramadan 1426H, in the presence of Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's eldest son Qaidjoher Ezzuddin and Malek al Ashtar Shujauddin, in Bonham House, London. * On 4 June 2011 (corresponding to 3 Rajab al-Asab 1432H) in Cromwell Hospital, London, in the presence of 6 witnesses. * On 20 June 2011 (corresponding to 19th Rajab 1432H) in Raudat Tahera, Mumbai in the presence of thousands of community members. This video was live broadcast worldwide to the entire Dawoodi Bohra community. For three years from 2011 to 2014 Mufaddal Saifuddin assumed the role of Syedna's successor. In the Dawoodi Bohra Mithaq (oath of allegiance), Mufaddal Saifuddin's name was taken alongside Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's as the successor. Together, Mohammed Burhanuddin and Mufaddal Saifuddin traveled the globe looking after the affairs of the community up until Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's death in 2014. Henceforth, he assumed the role of the 53rd Da'i al-Mutlaq. = Khuzaima Qutbuddin's Claim = In 2011 up to 2014, Khuzaima Qutbuddin and his family had publicly declared and congratulated Mufaddal Saifuddin as the successor. On a few occasions, Khuzaima Qutbuddin was seen participating in public gatherings seated below Mufaddal Saifuddin. Until the Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's death, there wasn't any indication of objection from Khuzaima Qutbuddin. Following the Syedna's death in January 2014, Khuzaima Qutbuddin, claimed the title of the 53rd DƒÅ'ƒ´ l-Mu·π≠laq of the Dawoodi Bohras. Khuzaima Qutbuddin claims that Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin performed nass on him 49 years ago in 1965 a ritual during which he appointed him as his successor in private without any witnesses. Qutbuddin states that Syedna Burhanuddin told him that this was because otherwise, 'swords would be crossed'. The rift between the two claimants started to appear even before the death of Burhanuddin, with followers of Khuzaima Qutbuddin rallying support for Khuzaima. A group formed in 2013 in support of Burhanuddin's half-brother Khuzaima Qutbuddin, who was Mazoon, serving second under Dai al Mutlaq. Khuzaima has denied formation of any separate sect by publishing a public affidavit. Khuzaima Qutbuddin died on 30 March 2016. On 31 March 2016 the family of Khuzaima Qutbuddin released a statement that Khuzaima Qutbuddin had conferred nass (announcement of successor) on his son Taher Fakhruddin.  Chronological Account of the events in 2011  = The Events of 4 June 2011 = On 4 June 2011 (corresponding to 3 Rajab al-Asab 1432H), His Holiness Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin gathered three of his sons (commonly referred to as Shehzadas), namely Qusai, Idris and Ammar; his daughter Husaina; son in law Dr Moiz, and grandson Abdul Qadir to his room at Cromwell Hospital. He made a declaration appointing his son Mufaddal Saifuddin as his successor, and instructed them to inform the Dawoodi Bohra community. Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin then summoned Mufaddal Saifuddin and his eldest son Qaidjoher Ezzuddin to Cromwell Hospital, where a short Majlis was held in Cromwell Hospital, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was congratulated on his appointment, drank sherbet and everyone present performed salaam to Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin and Mufaddal Saifuddin. These sequence of events were cited in a Majlis held by Qaidjoher Ezzuddin in al Masjid ul Husseini in Northolt; London on 5 June 2011. The video of this Majlis was recorded and was broadcast on the same day in Dawoodi Bohra community centers worldwide. These events were also documented in an official report (Arabic: ŸÖÿ´ÿßŸÑ) by the office of His Holiness, Alvazaratus Saifiyah. This document was published and distributed to entire Dawoodi Bohra community during the month of Ramadan in 2011. Khuzaima Qutbuddin challenged this ascension and claimed that Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was too ill to have spoken coherently, and medically unfit to move or drink sherbet. In reply to these allegations, an audio recording of the appointment, and a video recording of the Majlis in Cromwell Hospital was shown to the entire Dawoodi Bohra community on 18 May 2014 (corresponding to 19 Rajab al Asab 1435H). This video confirmed Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin speaking coherently to his family, drinking sherbet and presiding over the Majlis, therefore affirming the events described by Qaidjoher Ezzuddin and the Alvazaratus Saifiyah document. Qutbuddin has not responded to this video.  Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's Medical Condition  At the time of Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's stroke his sons, attendant physician and son-in-law, Dr Moiz bhaisaheb and surviving daughter were present in London with him along with other close family members. Neither Qutbuddin nor his family were present before or subsequently. The medical report presented by Khuzaima Qutbuddin explicitly ruled out the possibility of the Syedna having any ability to coherently speak or move. The review was done by Dr Daniel Mankens, chairman of Neurology Beaumont Hospital, Michigan. Based on this review report, Qutbuddin claimed that 'the succession was not done in London Hospital' as Mohammad Burhanuddin suffered from a 'full stroke at the age of 100 that made it difficult for him to write, speak, or move'. The doctors behind these reports had never met nor treated Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin at any time and gave their opinions based on medical reports and the explanations provided by Khuzaima Qutbuddin. Meanwhile, the specialists who actually treated, attended to Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin and who wrote the medical reports do not agree with these opinions. Dr John Francis Costello; Consultant in Respiratory Medicine, and Neurologist Dr Omar Malik, both of whom had attended to Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin at Cromwell Hospital in London have stated, in writing, that His Holiness was capable of making the declaration and of conducting a ceremony, even though his speech was slurred. Further, Dr Costello stated that he believes the report provided by the USA doctor Dr Daniel Menkes is incorrect. He confirmed that his patient, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin indeed did communicate his wishes on a variety of issues during his admission. On 4 June, the day of the Nass in question, Dr Costello noted that there was evidence of continued improvement in Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's health. He confirmed that although he did not witness the said Nass, there was no doubt that Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was able to effectively communicate his wishes whilst at Cromwell Hospital, particularly in his mother tongue Lisan al-Dawat. In regards to His Holiness's intellectual state, both Dr Costello and Dr Malik confirmed that he was of sound cognitive state, and that he was able to clearly communicate with his family and medical staff. In regards to the reports by the U.S. doctors, Dr Omar denied there was any evidence of a receptive speech problem. Dr Costello further expressed that he felt a special connection with His Holiness as he often greeted him with a smile of recognition, looked him in the eye, interacted in English, and even become lively at times. A year later in 2012, Dr Costello was invited on stage to meet Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin. In his medical report he notes that Syedna instantly smiled at him with recognition, and shook his hand for a lengthy time. These reports were submitted in court in the sworn affidavit submitted by Shehzada Qaidjoher Ezzuddin, the eldest son of Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin before the Bombay High Court. = The Raudat Tahera Ceremony = On 8 June 2011, Dr John Francis Costello noted improvements in His Holiness's health and there were discussions about his wishes to travel to Mumbai for to attend the death anniversary of his father Syedna Taher Saifuddin which was to be held on 20 June 2011. By 15 June 2011, there was further improvement. Dr John Francis Costello approved of sending His Holiness to Mumbai in an air ambulance as it was deemed safe and appropriate. On this day, Dr Costello recalls having a short coherent conversation in English with His Holiness about his journey to Mumbai. On 17 June 2011, His Holiness was discharged from Cromwell Hospital and traveled to Mumbai, as planned, in an air ambulance. These sequence of events, His Holiness's wishes to travel and the doctor's approval are of paramount significance because the group loyal to Qutbuddin allege that His Holiness was forced to travel against his own will despite suffering a stroke. Dr Costello's letter proves otherwise. A ceremony was arranged in Raudat Tahera Mumbai on 20 June 2011 (corresponding to 19th Rajab 1432H) to declare Mufaddal Saifuddin as the DƒÅ'ƒ´. The entire ceremony was recorded and was broadcast on the same day to Dawoodi Bohra community centers worldwide. This video was posted by Qutbuddin's website and re-posted by another YouTube user.

Until the Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's death, there wasn't any indication of objection from Khuzaima Qutbuddin.  Events following Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's death  Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin died on 17 January 2014 [1] (corresponding to 16 Rabi al Awwal 1435H) in Mumbai, India. Mufaddal Saifuddin, who had already been publicly appointed and accepted as the successor, assumed the position of the 53rd Da'i al-Mutlaq of the Dawoodi Bohra community. Saifuddin was in Colombo at the time and immediately traveled to Mumbai via Chennai. He conducted his first Jumu'ah Salah in Sri Lanka and arrived in Saify Mahal, Mumbai that evening to conduct and lead the Janaza and funeral rites. Khuzaima Qutbuddin, who at the time was already in Saify Mahal, Mumbai, left for his residence in Thane prior to Mufaddal Saifuddin's arrival. Mufaddal Saifuddin led the Janaza rites throughout the night. and thousands of mourners attended the funeral on Saturday 18 January 2014 led by Mufaddal Saifuddin. On the morning of Saturday 18 January, as the Janaza left Saify Mahal en route to Raudat Tahera for burial, Khuzaima Qutbuddin sent out an email campaign to Dawoodi Bohra Community members attaching a PDF letter addressed to Mufaddal Saifuddin stating his claim. That evening, around 36 hours after Syedna's death, Qutbuddin posted a YouTube video of himself on his website claiming that he was the 53rd Da'i al-Mutlaq, having been appointed in total secrecy in 1965. On 20 January 2014, Khuzaima Qutbuddin's name was removed Dawoodi Bohra from all official community records as the Mazoon. Following that, on 24 January 2014, Khuzaima Qutbuddin issued a Public Notice claiming that he was the sole Trustee of all the Wakfs/Trusts of the Dawoodi Bohra Community. On 30 January 2014, thousands of Dawoodi Bohras gathered at Azad Maidan, Mumbai in support of Mufaddal Saifuddin as the 53rd Da'i al- Mutlaq, pledged their allegiance to him and dissociated from the breakaway faction formed by Khuzaima Qutbuddin. Mufaddal's elder brother Qaidjoher Ezzuddin stated that \\"nass was performed on Mufaddal not once but a number of times\\". Similarly peace marches were organised in community centers worldwide where resolutions were signed handed over to Government officials. A number of prominent personalities offered their condolences to Mufaddal Saifuddin as Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's son and successor. These personalities include Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Narendra Modi, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Nawaz Sharif, Uhuru Kenyatta, Cardinal Oswald Gracias, Mohammad Hamid Ansari, Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Salman Khurshid, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Consulates, representatives of religious communities, prominent citizens, professionals and intellectuals. In April 2014, Khuzaima Qutbuddin filed action in the Mumbai High Court against the succession of Mufaddal Saifuddin.  Court cases  In January 2014, Qutbuddin published a public affidavit on his website declaring his position and legal status of properties, claiming to be the sole trustee of all the trusts in the Dawoodi Bohra community. Qutbuddin filed petitions against Saiffudin concerning the succession controversy in Bombay High court and Gujrat High Court. Khuzaima published a public affidavit on his website declaring his position and legal status of properties = Gujarat High Court case = Gujarat High Court issued an interim order on 16 April 2014 prohibiting Saifuddin from acting as the 53rd DƒÅ'ƒ´ and his supporters from dealing with the trust properties. Khuzaima filed eight writ petitions before Gujarat High Court pertaining to the succession controversy. This order was rescinded to allow Mufaddal Saifuddin full control over and use of all properties in Gujarat, provided that as the sole trustee, nothing is done to degenerate the value of the trust, effectively allowing him to operate as the 53rd Dai, but without granting such recognition. This situation was to remain pending the outcome of the Bombay High Court. = UK Charity Commission = In May 2014, Khuzaima Qutbuddin approached the UK Charity Commission claiming that there was no valid appointee as the Da'i al-Mutlaq. On 15 August 2014, the UK Charity Commission altered their position in favour of Mufaddal Saifuddin. The Commission established that there is someone in office, albeit that their position is being challenged. They also stated in writing, that \\"our view is therefore that His Holiness Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin is the current incumbent of the office of Dai al-Mutlaq.\\" They further stated that Mufaddal Saifuddin can continue to administer the Charity until the outcome of the Bombay High Court case is known. = Bombay High Court case = The late Syedna's half-brother Qutbuddin went to the High Court claiming the position of 53rd and to restrict Saifuddin from discharging the duties as the 53rd DƒÅ'ƒ´. The prime contention of the 700-page petition to the High Court was to have Qutbuddin, the half-brother, legally declared as the 53rd DƒÅ'ƒ´ al-Mutlaq of the 1.2-million-strong Bohra community, while simultaneously preventing his nephew, Mufaddal Saifuddin, from acting as the DƒÅ'ƒ´. Justice SJ Kathawala of the Bombay High Court recused himself from hearing the suit filed by Qutbuddin as he had appeared for the late Syedna in the past, creating a conflict of interest. The Lawyers appearing for Saifuddin had no objection to Justice SJ Kathawala from hearing the suit, however Qutbuddin's lawyer Mr Kadam requested the judge to recuse himself from the case. This delayed the suit before being placed before Justice Gautam Patel at the High Court. Qutbuddin sought relief including entry to Saify Mahal, the house of the community leader,filed a 700-page suit asking the court to restrain Mufaddal Saifuddin to act as the Da'i al-Mutlaq. In reply to the suit, defendant Mufaddal Saifuddin filed a detailed 494-page affidavit on 23 April 2014. Justice Gautam Patel said it would be better to hold the trial rather than decide on interim relief. The Bombay High Court later agreed that it is willing to conduct a speedy, day-to- day trial  Framing of Issues  In September 2014, the court had framed issues in the matter, where each side will have to prove he was conferred valid nass, or the official declaration of succession. The matter was then fixed for 11 December 2014, to determine the admissibility of the documents placed on record by both sides. The issues framed on 15 September 2014 in Suit No. 336 of 2014 were: * What are the requirements of a valid Nass as per the tenets of the faith? * Whether the Plaintiff proves that a valid Nass was conferred/pronounced on him as stated in the Plaint? * Whether a Nass once conferred cannot be retracted or revoked or changed or superseded? * Whether the Defendant proves that a valid Nass was conferred on him by the 52nd Dai: On 28 January 1969, in the year 2005, on 4 June 2011, On 20 June 2011 as stated in the written statement and if the answer is in the negative then whether any Nass proved on the Defendant as above consequently amounts to a retraction or revocation or change or supersession of any Nass previously conferred on the Plaintiff by the 52nd Dai? The case began with the new judge asking Qutbuddin, what requirements had to be fulfilled for \\"pronouncing a Syedna's successor\\", such as witnesses, publicity and acceptance by the community. He also asked Qutbuddin to spell out what he did to establish his right as the spiritual head since 2011 when his nephew was publicly pronounced the successor by the late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin. This followed a reply from Saifuddin's attorney and the late Syedna's eldest son Qaidjoher Ezzuddin, which contested Qutbuddin's claim. On behalf of Mufaddal Saifuddni, Ezzuddin stated that there was \\"overwhelming evidence\\" that Saifuddin was chosen by the late Dai to be his successor and between 2011 when he was appointed the successor and in January 2014 when the 52nd Dai died ‚Äì Saifuddin \\"operated within the community as the successor designate\\". Also, after his father's demise, Saifuddin was given misaq (oath of allegiance) by 500 Jamaats all over the world and high dignitaries. \\"As per court proceedings, Qutbuddin's lawyer pointed out that Saifuddin's earlier pleading of succession was only referring the pronouncement done in year 2011 at London hospital, but after demise of late Syedna, now the case is put up in different way and now it refers that pronouncements were 'made in 1969, 1994 and 2005 and only reconfirmation was done in 2011'.\\" Qutbuddin alleged that \\"[s]ince 1980, defendant (Saifuddin) and his family implemented a devious scheme to malign him\\" Justice Patel declined Kadam's plea to pass an order for access to Qutbuddin to his office in Saify Mahal and his apartment at Al Azhar. \\"They say they are not preventing you,\\" said Justice Patel.  Cross Examintation of Khuzaima Qutbuddin (Plaintiff)  The cross examination of Qutbuddin commenced on 27 April 2015. with Qutbuddin taking to the witness box eight times until his death. 1) 27 April 2015: Qutbuddin claimed that there were indications of support from his siblings, however none of his 20 siblings openly supported him, nor did they give their Mithaq to him. Saifuddin's counsel Iqbal Chagla questioned Qutbuddin on the meaning of various terminologies used in the community and degrees for knowledge of scriptures awarded by Al Jamea tus Saifiyah and conferred by the Dai. Qutbuddin admitted to being conferred the degree of Al Aleem Al Bare (The Outstanding Scholar) by his father, Syedna Taher Saifuddin but denied he was conferred any degree by his late brother Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin. This was to bring forth his knowledge of Islamic studies and degrees being conferred by the principal of the Dawoodi Bohra community's educational institute. Qutbuddin also told the court that the highest title is the Umdat al Ulama al Muwahhadeen (support of unparalleled scholar), which was given to Burhanuddin by the 51st dai. Qutbuddin claimed that he did not challenge Saifuddin's claims at the time because he (Qutbuddin) had been asked to maintain his appointment in confidence by Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin. He prayed and hoped that \\"Syedna Burhanuddin Saheb would recover and set the position right in the manner he deemed appropriate\\". 2) 28 April 2015: Qutbuddin admitted to being informed that a majlis was to be held on 6 June 2011 at Saifee Masjid and the reason for it. When asked what the reason for the majlis was, Qutbuddin replied,\\"The majlis was because His Holiness' health was not good and an announcement was to be made of the alleged nass conferred on the defendant (Saifuddin).\\" He admitted to drinking the celebratory sherbat offered. \\"That was routine, said Qutbuddin. When asked if the majlis had been convened for condolence, would sherbat have been offered, he replied,\\"No. He added that the majlis was not a condolence meeting. \\"I did, in fact, pray for the long life of the Syedna, he said. Qutbuddin also said that two attempts were made to kill him; first in Indore during Muharram and the second in Yemen, however, he named no suspects, nor dates, in court. 3) 29 July 2015: Qutbuddin said that he was referred to as al Walad al Ahabb, meaning the 'beloved son'. According to him, this carried the meaning that he was the successor. Counsel Iqbal Chagla, however, suggested to him that one Hussain Dawoodbhai of Sri Lanka was also referred to as al Walad al Ahabb. Qutbuddin alleged that the meaning may be the same but the context was different. Qutbuddin also confirmed that shortly after Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's stoke in 2011, he had called Qaidjoher Ezzuddin in London to wish the Syedna and his successor. 4) ‚Äì 31 July 2015: Qutbuddin told Court he was very hurt at being prevented from visiting Raudat Tahera. Chagla asked him if there has been a single instance when he was prevented. Qutbuddin replied that he had sent his sons to visit the mausoleum a few months ago. \\"They were actually beaten and pushed away. he said. But Chagla asked, \\"Have you personally been prevented from visiting the Raudat Tahera?. He replied \\"I did not go because my security advised me not to do so.\\". When Chagla asked if the statement that he was prevented from visiting is incorrect, Qutbuddin said, \\"I don't agree. I stand by my statement. Counsel Iqbal Chagla, showed several documents to Qutbuddin and sought his reply on whether those were written by the 52nd Dai and whether he recognized it. To some he accepted and to some he replied in the negative or sought to study them. 5) ‚Äì 3 August 2015: Qutbuddin claimed that even his father, Syedna Taher Saifuddin, had viewed him as a successor. In an earlier hearing, he alleged that Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin had appointed him as the Mazoon and gave a sermon, at that time he said 'I was a beloved son', and this carried the meaning that he was his successor. He again reiterated the same thing by saying that it is correct that his appointment as Mazoon was done in a public sermon by the 52nd Dai. 6) ‚Äì 4 August 2015: Qutbuddin was asked about the exact phrase used by Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin in his sermon on 10 December 1965 and when according to him, he said that you are his beloved son? Qutbuddin replied, \\"Al-waladul- ahabb.\\" Chagla asked him whether the translation of Al-walad ul-ahabb meant the beloved son or my beloved son. Qutbuddin maintained it meant my beloved son. He was then shown paragraph 28 (a) at page 64 of his plaint where it stated \\"my [lit. 'the'] beloved son\\". Qutbuddin was questioned as to what the meaning of [lit. 'the'] was and whether he agreed that the meaning of the phrase was in fact the beloved son. Qutbuddin said that he was confused as to why he said \\"my\\" when the translation provided by his son in the plaint stated the words \\"[lit. 'the']\\". When asked whether the translation done in the plaint was incorrect, he said he was confused. Around more than 400 questions were asked in which the examination centered around the sermon of 52nd Dai which mentioned the word \\"beloved son\\". 7) 24 August 2015: Chagla asked Qutbuddin whether Mufaddal Saifuddin and his brothers were his pupils in matters of \\"spiritual guidance \\". He replied, \\"Not regularly. But only once in a while\\". When asked how often, he replied, \\"They were regular during one period of time but not later.\\" He said Burhanuddin sent his sons to him and this was for about ten years during his reign. While he could not remember the exact period they were his pupils, Qutbuddin added that they came to him from the time of his father, the 51st Dai. Qutbuddin later stated that \\"if not all then many\\" persons of higher spiritual value knew he was made the mansoos (successor) and even offered him sajda (prostration). He alleged that Saifuddin and his brothers used to offer him sajda. When asked whether sajda (physical prostration) could be offered to a person other than a dai, Qutbuddin said, \\"Sajda is offered only to a dai or the mansoos or to a person known as one who will succeed the dai.\\" \\"I remember my sisters would sometimes do so (offer him sajda). I do not remember if my brothers did it\\". 8) 25 August 2015: Qutbuddin stated that in the last years of his life, late Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was not as mentally alert as he used to be. When advocate Iqbal Chagla asked whether Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was in full control of his mental and physical faculties till the end, Qutbuddin answered, \\"I felt and believed that his health had deteriorated during the last two and a half years of his life.\\" He said Syedna Burhanuddin was \\"unable to function and carry out his activities as before.\\"  Status of case following the death of Khuzaima Qutbuddin (Plaintiff)  The hearings were later fixed from 22 April to 2 May 2016, however, after Khuzaima Qutbuddin's death on 30 March 2016, the Bombay High Court cancelled these two dates. According to Indian law, upon the death of a plaintiff a suit will not abate immediately upon death but rather after 90 days if no action is taken by the legal heirs or representatives of the plaintiff. As Fakhruddin intends to continue the case, it is likely that such an application would be made and the case would not abate. Accordingly, Justice Patel also said if Fakhruddin decides that he would like to be substituted as plaintiff he will have to file a chamber summons to set aside the abatement of the suit, and that \\"Nobody requires an order that that the suit has abated\\". On 4 July 2016, Taher Fakhruddin reported that he has written a letter to Mufaddal Saifuddin in which he mentions that he has filed a Chamber Summons in the Bombay High Court as the plaintiff in place of his late father Khuzaima Qutbuddin. A senior counsel commented that the Da'i al-Mutlaq is not a hereditary title that can be passed on from a father to a son; it is an appointment that is made. This is the basis on which Khuzaima Qutbuddin had challenged the naming of Mufaddal Saifuddin as the 53rd Syedna. Taher Fakhruddin will have to prove that his father had been appointed as the Syedna, and only then can he claim the same. On 7 March 2017, Justice Gautam Patel allowed Taher Fakhruddin's plea to be substituted as plaintiff in this suit, stating that although Taher Fakhruddin was free to file a separate suit, including him in the current suit would save judicial time, money and valuable amounts of paper. The matter was set for direction on 25 April 2017. The court then fixed the dates of 8, 11 and 12 December 2017 for the cross examination of Taher Fakhruddin.  Cross Examination of Taher Fakhruddin (Petitioner)  The cross examination of Taher Fakhruddin commenced on 8 December 2017. 8 December 2017: Anand Desai appeared for Taher Fakhruddin. The petitioner submits letters as evidence. Examination-in-chief of Fakhruddin, Anand Desai cross examined Fakhruddin aasking him the function of the mazoon mutlaq and mukasir, to which he replied that \\"Mazoon administers the oath to the believers, shows them the position of the Dai\\" and the \\"mukasir does what the Dai wants them to do and that they don't have absolute authority\\". On the subject of nass, Fakhruddin said there was no one prescribed method, but there must be a clear communication of nass in the form of a direct statement by the preceding dai to the one he confers the nass, or there must be an indication from the Dai. He further claimed that no witnesses were needed during nass, and there were historical precedents for a private nass. He stated that a nass is irrevocable and final, \\"It can't be changed or superseded\\". He was also asked as to what happens when a successor passes away before the dai. He added that 6th Dai told 7th dai whom to appoint as 8th Dai; and the 28th Dai appointed the 29th Dai in accordance with the wishes of the 27th Dai. 22 March 2018: Justice Gautam Patel commented on what appeared to be contradictions between Taher Fakhruddin's written submissions and his court testimony in regard to Taher Fakhruddin's statements that Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi was 'to be the single witness to the nass he conferred via the Sijil-ul-Bisharat.' This contradiction was pointed out three times, following which Justice Patel expressed his impatience with the slow pace of this case into its fourth year. 27 November 2018: The Plaintiff Taher Fakhruddin, filed Case No.2:18-cv00043-BCW in the United States District Court for the District of Utah Central Division on 16 January 2018. The Defendant filed a Notice of Motion for an anti-Suit injunction against the Plaintiff.

CORAM: G.S. PATEL, J DATED: 6 December 2019 = Cross-examination of the Defendants = On 27 January, Justice Gautam Patel asked Senior Counsel Mr. Iqbal Chagla to submit the Defendant‚Äôs list of witnesses, with a view to beginning cross-examination of the Defendant and their witnesses in April 2020. The lawyers appearing for Mufaddal Saifuddin confirmed that he will not be appearing as a witness. The first witness would be Dr Omar Malik, the neurologist who treated Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin in London after he suffered a stroke. His cross- examination is scheduled for 22-24 April 2020. = Support for the claimants = = Saifuddin = * The 52nd Syedna died in January 2014. Mufaddal Saifuddin led the last rituals in which hundreds of thousands of Bohras joined. It is reported that when he made his first public appearance on a temporary bridge connecting Saifee Masjid and Raudat Tahera mausoleum after Syedna's demise, hundreds of thousands of Dawoodi Bohras' standing gave an \\"indication of who they have believed to be their 53rd DƒÅ'ƒ´ al-Mu·π≠laq\\". Indian Express further reports that \\"Many Bohras have accepted Burhanuddin's second son Syedi Mufaddal Saifuddin as Syedna\\". * Around 90% majority of the community support Mufaddal Saifuddin as the rightful leader of 2.5 million Dawoodi Bohras living in 100 countries. * The Indian foreign minister, Salman Khurshid, on 28 Rabi' al-thani 1435 AH (28 February 2014 CE) arrived to offer condolences to Mufaddal Saifuddin at the late Syedna's residence Saifee Mahal, Mumbai. It is reported that he presented a letter of good wishes from Sonia Gandhi as Saifuddin left for his first trip abroad, after \\"accession to the.. DƒÅ'ƒ´ office\\". * A number of prominent personalities offered their condolences to Mufaddal Saifuddin as Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin's son and successor. These personalities include Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Narendra Modi, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Nawaz Sharif, Uhuru Kenyatta, Cardinal Oswald Gracias, Mohammad Hamid Ansari, Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi, Salman Khurshid, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Consulates, representatives of religious communities, prominent citizens, professionals and intellectuals. * Around 50,000 followers of Mufaddal Saifuddin gathered at a public ground in Mumbai to \\"endorse their solidarity and offer their condolences\\" to their \\"new spiritual leader\\". According to the official association handling the affairs of Dawoodi Bohras in Mumbai, Qutbuddin's \\"wrongful claim\\" has aggrieved community members, as they had witnessed \\"nass\\" in 2011 in Mumbai which \\"had [been] reaffirmed ‚Ä¶ on many occasions\\". * Followers of Mufaddal Saifuddin staged peace marches and submitted a memos protesting his half brother's claim in Bhopal, Surat, and 'in various parts of the country'. * Professors and students and teachers of the 200-year-old Arabic teaching academy in Surat and its branches and various state heads have recognized Mufaddal Saifuddin as the successor. = Qutbuddin = * The former Chief Justice of India, AM Ahmadi, in his personal stand, accepted Khuzaima Qutbuddin as the rightful successor. As per report, the former Chief Justice of India, AM Ahmadi also said that he \\"examined the documents and believe that Syedna Qutbuddin's stand of the 53rd DƒÅ'ƒ´ is principled\\" in his opinion. * Abdeali Qutbuddin, son of Khuzaima Qutbuddin, claimed that they have around 450,000 (450,000) followers. * Other sources state that his support ranges from as much as 500 people. * The faction supporting Mufaddal Saifuddin as the DƒÅ'ƒ´, has excommunicated Qutbuddin and his followers. However, there is no official confirmation from the community on the alleged ex-communication while the progressive members have called a ban on this practice citing it illegal. = Un-decided = The Progressive Dawoodi Bohra took a neutral stance in wake of the succession controversy, citing dubious claims of both the would-be successors and the wealth accumulated by the late Syedna's family. The Progressives' Central Board warned the claimants that they would be \\"consigned to the dustbins of history\\" if they do not adapt and act more fairly. Several community members interviewed welcomed the court action as they looked forward to corruption in the community being exposed. The Times of India reported that \\"most Dawoodi Bohra back Syedna Burhanuddin's second son, Syedna Mufadda Saifuddin, and hold him as its 53rd spiritual leader\\". There were reports that some Bohras who support Qutbuddin have been forced to swear allegiance to Saifuddin through social isolation and threats of divorce between married couples. A cover story on the Bohra survey revealed that most Bohras (46%) support Khuzaima over Mufaddal and many are in the community due to fear and force Disquiet among Bohras However, the neutrality of this survey poll has been disputed citing reasons that it was carried out by an anonymous group, where the majority of the respondents were not Bohras, and it did not get any statistics from the Dawoodi Bohra head office in Mumbai. The survey was carried out by 399 respondents (0.0004% of community) from which a majority of respondents did not belong to the Dawoodi Bohra community, thus questioning the bias and validity of the report. Further, the article that was published in the Hindustan Times and the Mumbai Mirror had contradictory results with glaring dissimilarities among poll statistics, whereas the same media outlets had previously published that hundreds of thousands had gathered in support of Mufaddal Saifuddin, once again questioning the validity of the survey.  Historical significance  The issue is also historic in the sense that similar case was put up in the court of Mughal emperor Akbar, in year 1591AD, where succession was challenged.; Unique case: From Akbar‚Äôs court in 1591 to Bombay HC There is also a unique case (Chandabhoy Galla Case) filed in the British time court in Mumbai, in 1917 and decided in 1921, where claim was based on modality of succession earlier done. In the both of these case challenger were defeated, Syedna Dawood Bin Qutubshah remained Dai in 1591AD; History of Duat Mutlakin's of Ahmedabad and, ownership of the Chandabhoy Galla remained with Syedna Taher Saifuddin.; History A Modern History of the Ismailis: Continuity and Change in a Muslim Community; edited by Farhad Daftary 2010 ‚Äì Social Science; 'legal battle with dissidents:-chandbhai case, internal dissent: legitimacy of nass on abdul qadi nazmuddin ‚Äìnazim dai 50 yearts'  References  Category:Dawoodi Bohras Category:Dawoodi Bohra da'is Category:Ongoing legal cases Category:Islam-related controversies Category:Controversies in India Category:Bohra Category:Rival successions ","title":"Succession to 52nd Dai al-Mutlaq"},{"id":"42397293","text":"Barile may refer to: * Barile, a town and comune in the province of Potenza, in the Southern Italian region of Basilicata * Xavier J.

The structure is a log building under a protective shelter situated in the Trinity Lutheran Church maple grove. It served as the first college for the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod and was first Lutheran college west of the Mississippi River. Today, it commemorates the German Lutheran migration of 1838/1839 and the founding of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod, and features two log cabins from that era.Waymarking.com http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMHZK2_Concordia_Log_Cabin_College_Altenburg_Missouri The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Construction The log cabin dates to the first settlement of Altenburg, being constructed in 1839, to serve as the first school for the new community. It is now located in the maple grove across from the Trinity Lutheran Church and contains museum exhibits relevant to the history of Altenburg. It was moved to its present location in 1912; and the vertical oak timbers were attached to the walls to stabilize the structure. The chimney was removed from the cabin at that time; the shelter over the cabin was constructed in 1915. The cabin is constructed of logs which are only crudely shaped, and have only slight notching. The chinking between the logs is mainly mortar and bricks, with also some stone.Mississippi River Valley Architecture =Exterior= Concordia Cabin College The cabin measures and has a ground floor and a loft. The building rests on a concrete foundation. The floor consists of logs, running east-west, flattened on top to receive the floor boards and notched where they rest on the foundation walls. The building itself is constructed of logs which are crudely shaped and vary in diameter from . They show only slight notching and no attempt was made at dovetailing. The chinking between the logs is primarily mortar and bricks. The cabin is ten logs high to the top log. Above the logs, the gable ends consist of unpainted clapboards. The medium pitched ridge roof is sheathed with shake shingles. The cabin possesses one four panel door, located in the center of the north facade. The centers of the remaining facades are occupied by double-hung sash windows. Each window has six over six lights. Directly above the windows on the gable ends are two additional window openings. A six light fixed window fills the opening on the east end; a board and batten shutter closes the opposite opening. The cabin has no chimney. =Interior= An east-west running floor of random width tongue and groove oak boards occurs on the ground floor. The walls are not plastered, leaving the logs directly exposed. The cabin has undergone relatively few alterations. It has been moved at least once, perhaps twice. The first time, if it could be agreed upon (refer to Item 8), in 1840-1841 from Dresden to Altenburg‚Äîa distance of approximately one mile, in order to be closer to Pastor Loeber's parsonage; the second time in 1912 when it was transported from there a few hundred yards to where it now stands in the church grove of Trinity Lutheran Church in Altenburg. At that time, a chimney was removed and two oak beams were placed under the cabin to assist in transporting it; these remained to become the bottom logs of the cabin after it was permanently in place on the concrete foundation prepared for it in the church grove. It was also at this time that oak timbers were vertically attached to the walls to stabilize the building during the move. History 1839 Woodcut Concordia Cabin College The Concordia Log Cabin College is significant as the first college and seminary of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod educational system. It is also believed to be where the Altenburg Debates were held. Missouri was the destination of the Saxon or Stephanite Immigration of 1838. This unique migration was made up of Germans, principally from the Kingdom of Saxony, who had embraced the teachings and leadership of Martin Stephan. From his pulpit in St. John's Church in Dresden, Stephan preached an orthodox brand of Lutheranism that ran counter to the trend towards rationalism that for various reasons was increasingly dominating the religious life of Saxony. Stephan was not a great pulpit orator, but he did possess an unusual sensitivity to the spiritual needs of people and between 1823-1837 he attracted a large following. His adherents included not only farmers and craftsmen, but also lawyers, teachers, merchants, high ranking government officials and clergy. The log cabin was constructed in 1839 to serve as the first school for the new community. The school served 11 students - seven boys and four girls ‚Äì and was styled after the German Gymnasium schools. During the years 1841-1843, Gotthold Heinrich Loeber and Theodor Brohm conducted the affairs of the school. Brohm was then called to New York leaving Loeber to carry on responsibility for half a year. In 1841, the school's enrollment had dropped to eight pupils; two years later, it had dwindled to five. Loeber managed somehow to keep the school alive. It had become obvious by 1843 that the school must be placed on a sound financial basis if it was to survive. An agreement was made that the Trinity congregation and the Perry County congregations would assume joint responsibility for the maintenance of the school. Trinity was to pay the bills, Perry County would provide food and firewood. Seven dollars monthly was provided by St. Louis to sustain the college. Trinity also recommended John Goenner as a prospective teacher to relieve Loeber. In late April, 1847, at a meeting in Chicago, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio and Other States was organized with C. F. W. Walther as its first president. Control of the seminary then passed to the synod, having been relinquished by the Trinity congregation, with the understanding that the school be moved to St. Louis. In Altenburg, Loeber and his congregation had no quarrel with synodical control of the college, but they were reluctant to see it taken away from them. At the synod's third convention in 1849, however, it was insisted that the transfer be made. Loeber did not live to see the move. While the college during these ten years was small and always on the verge of collapse, it persevered and produced five pastors. It was also a unifying factor, giving the ministers and congregations of St. Louis and Perry County a common objective and contributing to the formation of the Missouri Synod. As for the cabin, it was sold at auction in 1855 by the heirs of Gotthold Loeber. This sale was probably confirmed by an 1859 quit claim deed transferring the cabin and 4.3 acre lot from the Loeber heirs to Gottlieb Funke for $80.00. Funke lived there for the next 38 years. His will in 1893 provided that the cabin and lot be donated to the church in consideration of the Altenburg congregation's having cared for him during his illness. In 1912, at the suggestion of Rev. H. Schmidt, the cabin was moved to the church grove in Altenburg. A fund raising drive throughout the synod paid for the protective shelter erected three years later. Education December 9, 1839, was the first day of classes. The eleven students who reported that day seven boys and four girls were greeted with an ambitious and rich educational program. Their teachers received no compensation for the school had no finances, but they were well trained in European universities and deeply convinced of the importance and necessity of a sound education. Their institution was patterned after the gymnasium, the Latin grammar school of Saxony, and their program was that advocated for centuries by Christian humanists. The subjects taught were: Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German, French, English, History, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Natural History, Philosophy, Music and Drawing.

Trishna is the Eighth Nidana, spiritual love. Meaning The Sanskrit root of the word T·πõish·πáƒÅ (‡§§‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§æ) is T·πõish (‡§§‡•É‡§∑‡•ç) meaning to be thirsty, to thirst, to thirst for (metaphorically), strong desire or long for. In the Vedas the accent is on the first syllable as in - T·πõishyƒÅ (to be thirsty), T·πõish·πáƒÅkshaya (cessation of desire, tranquillity of mind, resignation, patience, content), T·πõishnƒÅghna (quenching the thirst), T·πõish·πáƒÅmaya (ill with thirst), T·πõish·πáƒÅmƒÅra (dying of thirst), T·πõish·πáƒÅri (enemy of thirst), T·πõishƒÅlu (thirsting much, very thirsty), T·πõishyat (thirsting) or T·πõishya (thirst). Trishna in Pali (tanha) means thirst for life. Vedic relevance The word Trishna appears in the Rig Veda in a few mantras where it refers to greed, craving, hankering or longing, and the like. In mantra Rig Veda (I.XXXVII.6), Rishi Ghora Kanva states: :‡§Æ‡•ã ‡§∑‡•Å ‡§£‡§É ‡§™‡§∞‡§æ ‡§™‡§∞‡§æ ‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§ã‡§§‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§¶‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§π‡§£‡§æ ‡§¨‡§ß‡•Ä‡§§‡•ç  :‡§™‡§¶‡•Ä‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü ‡§§‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§∏‡§π  He speaks about the (unfavourable ) wind (‡§®‡§ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§ã‡§§‡§ø‡§É) which flows on greedily (‡§§‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§Ø‡§æ). And, in mantra Rig Veda (I.LXXXV.11), Rishi Rahugano Gotama stating - :‡§ú‡§ø‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§®‡•Å‡§®‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Ω‡§µ‡§§‡§Ç ‡§§‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§¶‡§ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§∏‡§Ç ‡§ó‡•ã‡§§‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§§‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§ú‡•á  :‡§Ü ‡§ó‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§µ‡§∏‡§æ ‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§≠‡§æ‡§®‡§µ‡§É ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§§‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§ ‡§ß‡§æ‡§Æ‡§≠‡§ø‡§É  speaks about the wise ones craving (‡§§‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§ú‡•á) for opportunities to sate the thirst of those hankering (‡§§‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§ ) for knowledge. Buddhist relevance Gautama Buddha said that the cause of sorrow ‚Äì the second of the Four Noble Truths ‚Äì is desire; and the cause of desire is tanha or trishna. Buddhism teaches the doctrine of inaction, i.e. cessation of activity, desiring or doing little. The extinction of craving of the desire for existence in all its forms and the consequent cessation of suffering is Nirvana (Nirvana is grasping nothingness and possessing nothing which state is reached through the knowledge of impermanence and voidness). Vivekananda holds that the Buddhist doctrine of giving up trishna ('greed') is an offshoot of Advaita Vedanta. Puranic relevance According to the Puranas, Trishna is the daughter of Kamadeva or Kama, the god of love and husband of Rati; Aniruddha is her brother.Vishnu Purana tells us that Anrita ('falsehood') married his own sister, Nikritti ('immorality') and had two sons, Bhaya ('fear') and Naraka ('hell'), and two daughters, Maya ('illusion' or 'deceit') and Vedana ('torture') who again married each other. The son of Bhaya and Maya is Mrityu ('death'), and Dukha ('sorrow' or 'pain') is the son of Naraka and Vedana. From Mrityu descended Vyadhi ('disease'), Jara ('decay'), Shoka ('sorrow' or 'grief'), Trishna ('desire' or 'greed') and Krodha ('anger'). Trishna ('Greediness') is the wife or mistress of Lobha ('Greed'). Vedantic relevance Shankara explains that the intellect (buddhi) of those who perceive the Being as affected with difference of space etc., cannot be brought immediately to an intuition of the highest reality; Brahman is to be realized as attributeless. He states that even if the knowers of Brahman of themselves abstain from objects of sensual enjoyment yet the thirst (trishna) caused by being addicted to sensuality in different births cannot at once be converted. Renunciation is brahmacƒÅryam or stri-vishaya-tyƒÅga. Trishna, that causes dukkha, the philosophical translation of which is unsatisfactoriness rather than pain, is immoderate desire as such; Trishna is the will-to-live. Upanishadic relevance In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (IV.iv.6) in the passage ‚Äì :‡§á‡§§‡§ø ‡§®‡•Å ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§É; ‡§Ö‡§•‡§æ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§É ‚Äì ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ω‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ã ‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§Ü‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡•ã ‡§® ‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§£‡§æ ‡§â‡§§‡•ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø, ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§µ ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‡§™‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§§‡§ø  the word KƒÅma (‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ) refers to desires ‚Äì the man who desires migrates, but the man who is without desires never migrates; of him who is without desires, who is free from desires, the objects of whose desire have been attained, and to whom all objects of desire are but the Self ‚Äì the organs do not depart, being Brahman, he is merged in Brahman. It is held that the main fundamental Buddhist thought, Nirvana i.e. the removal of suffering by removal of trishna, is an echo of the afore-cited Upanishadic doctrine of union with Brahman by the removal of KƒÅma. The truth is - that deeds come from upƒÅdƒÅna (clinging to existence), upƒÅdƒÅna comes from trishna (craving), trishna comes from vedana (torture), the perception of pain and pleasure, the desire for rest; sensation (contact with objects) brings desire for life or the will to live. In the Bhagavad Gita(Sloka XIV.7), Krishna tells Arjuna :- :‡§∞‡§ú‡•ã ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ó‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ï‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§ø ‡§§‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§æ‡§Ω‡§Ω‡§∏‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Å‡§¶‡§≠‡§µ‡§Æ‡•ç  :‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§ø‡§¨‡§ß‡•ç‡§®‡§æ‡§§‡§ø ‡§ï‡•å‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Ø ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡•á‡§® ‡§¶‡•á‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç  : \\"Know that Rajas is essentially attachment; it is the source of craving and passion.\\" : \\"O Son of Kunti! It binds the embodied Spirit with attachment to works.\\" Here, the word RƒÅga refers to attachment, and Trishna, refers to the craving for what is unattained. Implication From the Chandogya Upanishad (VIII.viii.5, VIII.ix.1,VIII.xii.1-3) we learn that the term Asura (‡§Ü‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞) signifies the natural and impulsive ('demonical') actions of the senses which are promoted by the desire for an object of pleasure called Asu (‡§Ö‡§∏‡•Å), and that the term Deva (‡§¶‡•á‡§µ), which is derived from the verb Div (‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ) signifying 'illumination', stands for the functions of the senses illuminated by reason. Prajapati tells Indra that the body which is mortal because it is covered by death is the seat of the self which is immortal and bodiless; anything embodied is within the range of the desirable and the non-desirable which two aspects cannot affect one who has become unembodied. The tranquil one having become established in his own nature after rising up from his body reaches the supreme Light and becomes Brahman. Vishnugupta (Chanakya) in his Chanakya Niti tells us that \\"anger is personification of Yama, ('the demi-god of death'), thirst is like hellish river Vaitarani, knowledge is like Kamadhenu ('the cow of plenty'), and contentment is like Nandanavana ('the garden of Indra')\\".

Each color represents the spatial extent of a distinct genotype in a microscale model using stochastic cellular automata. Each curve on the graph represents the population level of a corresponding genotype in a macroscale differential equation model. Microscale models form a broad class of computational models that simulate fine-scale details, in contrast with macroscale models, which amalgamate details into select categories. Microscale and macroscale models can be used together to understand different aspects of the same problem.  Applications  Macroscale models can include ordinary, partial, and integro-differential equations, where categories and flows between the categories determine the dynamics, or may involve only algebraic equations. An abstract macroscale model may be combined with more detailed microscale models. Connections between the two scales are related to multiscale modeling. One mathematical technique for multiscale modeling of nanomaterials is based upon the use of Multiscale Green's function. In contrast, microscale models can simulate a variety of details, such as individual bacteria in biofilms, individual pedestrians in simulated neighborhoods, individual light beams in ray-tracing imagery, individual houses in cities, fine-scale pores and fluid flow in batteries, fine-scale compartments in meteorology, fine-scale structures in particulate systems, and other models where interactions among individuals and background conditions determine the dynamics. Discrete-event models, individual-based models, and agent-based models are special cases of microscale models. However, microscale models do not require discrete individuals or discrete events. Fine details on topography, buildings, and trees can add microscale detail to meteorological simulations and can connect to what are called mesoscale models in that discipline. Square-meter-sized landscape resolution available from images allow waterflow across land surfaces to be modeled, for example rivulets and water pockets, using gigabyte-sized arrays of detail. Models of neural networks may include individual neurons but may run in continuous time and thereby lack precise discrete events.  History  Ideas for computational microscale models arose in the earliest days of computing and were applied to complex systems that could not accurately be described by standard mathematical forms. Two themes emerged in the work of two founders of modern computation around the middle of the 20th century. First, pioneer Alan Turing used simplified macroscale models to understand the chemical basis of morphogenesis, but then proposed and used computational microscale models to understand the nonlinearities and other conditions that would arise in actual biological systems. Second, pioneer John von Neumann created a cellular automaton to understand the possibilities for self-replication of arbitrarily complex entities, which had a microscale representation in the cellular automaton but no simplified macroscale form. This second theme is taken to be part of agent-based models, where the entities ultimately can be artificially intelligent agents operating autonomously. By the last quarter of the 20th century, computational capacity had grown so far that up to tens of thousands of individuals or more could be included in microscale models, and that sparse arrays could be applied to also achieve high performance. Continued increases in computing capacity allowed hundreds of millions of individuals to be simulated on ordinary computers with microscale models by the early 21st century. The term \\"microscale model\\" arose later in the 20th century and now appears in the literature of many branches of physical and biological science.  Example  Figure 1 represents a fundamental macroscale model: population growth in an unlimited environment. Its equation is relevant elsewhere, such as compounding growth of capital in economics or exponential decay in physics. It has one amalgamated variable, N(t), the number of individuals in the population at some time t. It has an amalgamated parameter r=\\\\beta-\\\\delta, the annual growth rate of the population, calculated as the difference between the annual birth rate \\\\beta and the annual death rate \\\\delta. Time t can measured in years, as shown here for illustration, or in any other suitable unit. The macroscale model of Figure 1 amalgamates parameters and incorporates a number of simplifying approximations: #the birth and death rates are constant; #all individuals are identical, with no genetics or age structure; #fractions of individuals are meaningful; #parameters are constant and do not evolve; #habitat is perfectly uniform; #no immigration or emigration occurs; and #randomness does not enter. These approximations of the macroscale model can all be refined in analogous microscale models. On the first approximation listed above‚Äîthat birth and death rates are constant‚Äîthe macroscale model of the Figure 1 is exactly the mean of a large number of stochastic trials with the growth rate fluctuating randomly in each instance of time. Microscale stochastic details are subsumed into a partial differential diffusion equation and that equation is used to establish the equivalence. To relax other assumptions, researchers have applied computational methods. Figure 2 is a sample computational microscale algorithm that corresponds to the macroscale model of Figure 1\\\\. When all individuals are identical and mutations in birth and death rates are disabled, the microscale dynamics closely parallel the macroscale dynamics (Figures 3A and 3B). The slight differences between the two models arise from stochastic variations in the microscale version not present in the deterministic macroscale model. These variations will be different each time the algorithm is carried out, arising from intentional variations in random number sequences. When not all individuals are identical, the microscale dynamics can differ significantly from the macroscale dynamics, simulating more realistic situations than can be modeled at the macroscale (Figures 3C and 3D). The microscale model does not explicitly incorporate the differential equation, though for large populations it simulates it closely. When individuals differ from one another, the system has a well defined behavior but the differential equations governing that behavior are difficult to codify. The algorithm of Figure 2 is a basic example of what is called an equation-free model. When mutations are enabled in the microscale model (\\\\sigma>0), the population grows more rapidly than in the macroscale model (Figures 3C and 3D). Mutations in parameters allow some individuals to have higher birth rates and others to have lower death rates, and those individuals contribute proportionally more to the population. All else being equal, the average birth rate drifts to higher values and the average death rate drifts to lower values as the simulation progresses. This drift is tracked in the data structures named beta and delta of the microscale algorithm of Figure 2\\\\. The algorithm of Figure 2 is a simplified a microscale model using the Euler method. Other algorithms such as the Gillespie method and the discrete event method are also used in practice. Versions of the algorithm in practical use include efficiencies such as removing individuals from consideration once they die (to reduce memory requirements and increase speed), and scheduling stochastic events into the future (to provide a continuous time scale and to further improve speed). Such approaches can be orders of magnitude faster.  Complexity  The complexity of systems addressed by microscale models leads to complexity in the models themselves, and the specification of a microscale model can be tens or hundreds of times larger than its corresponding macroscale model. (The simplified example of Figure 2 has 25 times as many lines in its specification as does Figure 1.) Since bugs occur in computer software and cannot completely be removed by standard methods such as testing, and since complex models often are neither published in detail nor peer-reviewed, their validity has been called into question. Guidelines on best practices for microscale models exist but no papers on the topic claim a full resolution of the problem of validating complex models.  Future  Computing capacity is reaching levels where populations of entire countries or even the entire world are within the reach of microscale models, and improvements in census and travel data allow further improvements in parameterizing such models. Remote sensors from Earth- observing satellites and from ground-based observatories such as the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) provide large amounts of data for calibration. Potential applications range from predicting and reducing the spread of disease to helping understand the dynamics of the earth.  Figures  Figure 1. Macroscale equations Figure 1\\\\. One of the simplest of macroscale models: an ordinary differential equation describing continuous exponential growth. N(t) is the size of the population at time t, dN(t)/dt is the rate of change through time in the single dimension N. N(0) is the initial population at t=0, \\\\beta is a birth rate per time unit, and \\\\delta is a death rate per time unit. At the left is the differential form; at the right is the explicit solution in terms of standard mathematical functions, which follows in this case from the differential form. Almost all macroscale models are more complex than this example, in that they have multiple dimensions, lack explicit solutions in terms of standard mathematical functions, and must be understood from their differential forms.

It is located on the third floor of Academic One, in a prominent position next to the university library. The original Democracy Wall, from 1978, was a focal point for democratic discourse in Beijing. It was demolished by the Communist authorities. The Democracy Wall is a public bulletin board that allows students, alumni and teachers to freely express their personal opinions, exchange their views on school policies, political point of views or academic theories. The school will also post official responses on the wall according to some particular issues. It acts as a public forum for the university community. There are also tables in front of the wall with various leaflets and books on display, providing further information for those interested in particular issues. There are also other Democracy Wall at other public-funded universities, including the University of Hong Kong, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The famed Lennon Wall of the 2014 Hong Kong protests also played a similar role, but was removed by the government when the Admiralty protest site was cleared.  History In 2003, the Democracy Wall was moved to its present location.  Users  The Democracy Wall of CityU is managed by the City University of Hong Kong Students' Union. Equality, mutual respect, judge on the facts rather than the people, and being responsible for what they have said are the rules of speaking. It is common for different societies to post declaration on the wall. =Staff= Faculty of the university are free to post posters and statements on the wall. For example, Dr.Priscilla Leung Mei-fun (Priscilla Leung), an associate professor of City University of Hong Kong School of Law, once posted a statement about the Legislative Council using Powers and Privileges to investigate the progress justice of examining the TV licence of HKTV. It is her right to post on the democracy wall. However, there are lots of critics because she used the member of Legislative Council but not the staff of CityU.Opinions of Priscilla Leung about TV license =Students= Students are allowed to post on the wall with their student ID. The content can be anything such as posters, comments or slogan. For example, many societies or clubs of the student‚Äôs union post declaration to allow the public, especially to the students of CityU to read. It is also possible for students to write comments on posted items, along with their student ID again.  Aims  =Exercising Hong Kong's rights= In Hong Kong, freedom of speech is an essential right codified in the Basic Law. It is also considered as a core value in Hong Kong society. The Democracy Wall is a place for people to express their opinions and share their views, especially on some political issues. It is not compulsory for the issues being related to only CityU or Hong Kong society, it can also be related to some international issues. People concerned about matters that are conflicting justice. Since justice is one of the core values in Hong Kong, the behaviours of government should follow justice, regardless of the process or results. = Student awareness of societal issues= The Democracy Wall aims to raise students‚Äô attention towards different kinds topics and problems surrounding them. It is located in an eye-catching area where University students can easily view different kinds of opinions when they pass by. People can quickly get to know different kinds of issues in CityU, Hong Kong and the world. It can build up students‚Äô attention towards caring our world, especially for some political issues. = The role of a university= Nowadays, money is very important in this world. The concept of economic-oriented in a society has a vital place in Hong Kong people‚Äôs minds, including the University students. People may not focus on political issues because they think it does not directly affect their lives. However, University students should not have this misconception. University is a platform for exchanging different kinds of opinions and knowledge. University students should have a rise of attention to show the role of a University. Therefore, Democracy Wall of economic-oriented provides a way for University students to connect to the world.  Management  The democracy wall is owned by the Student‚Äôs Union of the City University of Hong Kong, directly related to the Executive Committee of the Students' Union. The committee has the ability to put down the poster on the wall. Therefore, it raises a question about the fairness. If the executive committee can put down the poster when they want, the committee with different background may have a different interpretation.  Significant incidents  =Libel lawsuit= In 1994 a City Polytechnic law student sued an accountancy student for libel after the defendant posted two posters to the Democracy Wall that claimed the plaintiff was a criminal, biased, and dishonest. The law student had sat on an arbitration committee that ruled over a case in which the accountancy student was part of a party that felt aggrieved. The accountancy student was ordered to pay $75,000, but claimed that she had allowed a fellow student to use her student number on the posters. = Orientation camp conduct = In September 2013, there was a post on the Democracy Wall of CityU talking about one of the games in MCS orientation camps in Hong Kong torturing group leaders (students of Year 2 or above) in front of freshmen. This post was posted by a freshman who had joined the orientation camp, saying they could not accept the game they played in the camp because it was immoral: throwing noodles, water, and even leftover onto group leaders to punish the freshmen for not participating inactively in the camp. A few days later, the designer of the game posted a proclamation to clarify the meaning of the game was wanting freshmen to devote more in the camp, and only water and wetted paper were used to throw on group leaders. The ‚ÄúInsulting Groups leaders in Orientation Camp‚Äù issue The ‚ÄúInsulting Groups leaders in Orientation Camp‚Äù issue =Taiwan Anti-Cross- Strait Service Trade Agreement= In March 2014, there are some posts about the Anti-Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement to China issues which are happening in Taiwan. Students compare the situation in Hong Kong and Taiwan. They express their views of supporting Taiwan citizens to against the trade pact with China of holding Sunflower Student Movement. Rather than objecting the unfair situation of a trade pact with China, this is also showing that justice is being affected. This can show the inappropriate way of the Taiwan government when handling this issue. Through the views of Hong Kong students, they are also objecting to the way of Taiwan government. CityU Democracy Wall is a way to show social justice.Taiwan Anti-Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement =Censorship attempts = In November 2015 a Mainland Chinese exchange student tore down part of a banner reading \\"Hong Kong is not China\\" and put up new text, changing it to read \\"Hong Kong is just a part of China of course\\". She struck and injured a student who filmed her actions. The footage went viral on Facebook, with commentators criticising the student for not respecting Hong Kong‚Äôs freedom of speech, which is codified in the Hong Kong Basic Law. A male student was also seen ripping messages from the wall the same month. He was also filmed and the video uploaded to Facebook. =Vandalism of Goddess of Democracy statue= A replica of the Goddess of Democracy stands beside the Democracy Wall at City University. The original statue was erected by students at the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing, but was destroyed by the People's Liberation Army during the massacre of the protesters on 4 June 1989. On 23 July 2019, against the backdrop of protests against the Hong Kong government's proposal to introduce a China extradition law, a young man was filmed tearing posters from the Democracy Wall and tipping the Goddess of Democracy over. The man was confronted by CityU students and university security, who called police. The suspect was taken away in a police van. The Mandarin-speaking suspect was reportedly a mainland Chinese graduate of the university. The statue, though badly damaged, was subsequently righted by students. The students' union, which owns the statue, said it had contacted the original artist in hopes of repairing it. The university said it would set up a committee to investigate the incident.

It features levels that are randomly created from a pool of possible elements, making each playthrough unique. The game was officially released on March 4, 2014 to generally positive reviews. Gameplay Tower of Guns is a first-person shooter that takes place in a tower filled with a variety of guns. The player must ascend the tower by advancing through a series of randomized areas. Each area contains a number of arenas and a boss fight that the player must clear to advance. At the beginning of every run, one of several \\"stories\\" is selected at random, ranging from a soldier ordered by his superiors to climb the Tower of Guns, to a gun-toting barbarian guide protecting an evil priest on his way to a dark ritual at the top of the tower, to an \\"inebriated scholar\\" trying to get to a friend's home who has confused the Tower of Guns for his friend's apartment building. Aside from on-screen text appearing at the beginning and ending of every level, these stories do not impact the gameplay in any significant way, and can in fact be toggled off completely at the beginning of a run. At the outset of a run, the player may choose one gun and one perk before they enter the Tower of Guns. The tower is filled with randomly placed robots and sentry turrets that fire projectiles at the player. These projectiles can produce a variety of effects, such as area of effect damage, fire damage, or launching the player into the air. When an enemy is destroyed, blue tokens are produced that the player can pick up to increase their gun's level. The tower also contains various power-ups that alter gameplay and upgradable guns that the player can unlock. The game is intended to be completed within one to two hours, and has been described as a \\"lunch-break experience.\\" Development Joe Mirabello, the founder and sole member of Terrible Posture Games, began production on Tower of Guns after the collapse of 38 Studios, where he had been working on Project Copernicus, an unreleased massively multiplayer online game based on Kingdoms of Amalur. Mirabello said that \\"after working on a game with hundreds of people made for thousands of people, I wanted to work on a single-player game made by just one person.\\" A pre-alpha version of the game debuted at IndieCade booth at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The completed build of the game was released on March 4, 2014 through a number of online clients, including Steam, GOG.com, GamersGate and IndieGameStand. Reception The game received positive reviews upon release, garnering a score of 78 out of 100 on the review aggregation website Metacritic.

Silver Mountain Fort) is a former military fort, now a monument and a museum, located in the town of Srebrna G√≥ra (lit. Silver Mountain), Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Poland. It was constructed in 1765-1777 when the territory was part of the Kingdom of Prussia. The fort is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated May 1, 2004. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland. It has been declared a rare example of a surviving European 18th century mountain stronghold. The fort has been called a \\"Gibraltar of Prussia\\", or \\"Gibraltar of Silesia\\", a reference to its foundation in solid bedrock. History Map of the fort The fortress in Srebrna G√≥ra was built in 1764-1777 by the order of Frederick II, the King of Prussia. It was designed by Prussian architect Ludwig Wilhelm Regeler, aided by a number of Prussian military engineers. Minor additional works took place in the following years, but no major alterations were made; construction of a nearby flanked fort was begun but was quickly abandoned. The complex is composed of six forts, several bastions, and associated elements. The main fort of the complex is the central Don≈ºon Fort on the Warowna G√≥ra hill. Fort in the winter Fort in the summer The complex is located on the heights of the Sudety Mountains, a body which forms a natural border between the K≈Çodzko Valley and the Silesian Lowlands. It controls the passage through the Silver Valley (Polish: Prze≈Çƒôcz Srebrna, German: Silberbergpass). The fort spans three hills: Ostr√≥g (627 meters above sea level), Warowna G√≥ra (686m), and Wielki Chocho≈Ç (740m). The fort could shelter a garrison of 4000 soldiers, supplied to survive a year-long siege. It was defended by 264 artillery pieces. The fortress was intended to guard a route linking Prussian territories with Bohemian lands in the south, and thus help repel any possible incursions from Austria. The cost of the construction was reported as 4.5 million Prussian thalers. The fortress was never captured by the enemy while besieged. On 28 June 1807 it successfully resisted a siege by Napoleonic forces during the War of the Fourth Coalition; this was the only time the fortress was the site of an active battle. By 1860 it was declared obsolete and the garrison reduced in size; it was abandoned as an active military stronghold in 1867. The fortress has survived till modern day with relatively little modernization or damage, contributing to its valuable status as a historical monument of its era. It served as a military training grounds, and by the end of the 19th century was already a tourist attraction, with a restaurant opened in the fort by 1885. A youth hostel opened there in 1913, a museum in 1931, and by the 1930s it was visited by 50,000 tourists each year. During World War II the fortress served as Prisoner-of-war camp (Oflag VII ‚Äûb‚Äù 1939-1941, Stalag 367 1941-1945). It was used as a prison for Polish officers imprisoned by the Germans. Notable prisoners included Counter Admiral Stefan Frankowski, General Tadeusz Piskor and Rear-Admiral J√≥zef Unrug. After the war, the fortress was parts of the lands transferred from Germany to Poland. In 1961 it was added to the Polish register of objects of cultural heritage. In 1973 a military museum was opened in the Fort. In 2002 it was declared a culture park, and in 2004 it was recognized as a Historic Monument (Pomnik historii).  Current status  The fort is open to tourists. A historical reenactment group in the region continues the tradition of the Prussian infantry unit station in the fort.

It was created in 2000 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to be the global standard reference system for objects located outside the gravitational vicinity of Earth: planets, moons, and other Solar System bodies, stars and other objects in the Milky Way galaxy, and extra-galactic objects. The geocentric celestial reference system (GCRS), also created by the IAU in 2000, is a similar standard coordinate system used to specify the location and motions of near-Earth objects, such as satellites. These systems make it easier for scientists and engineers to compile, share, compare, and convert accurate measurements worldwide, by establishing standards both of measure and of methodology, and providing a consistent framework of operations. The focus of the BCRS is on astronomy: exploration of the Solar System and the universe. The BCRS is the system currently used for expressing positional data in astronomical references, such as the Hipparcos star catalog. The focus of the GCRS is somewhat more on the navigation of Earth satellites and the geophysical applications they support. The proper functioning of the Global Positioning System (GPS) is directly dependent upon the accuracy of satellite measurements as supported by the GCRS. Purpose and implementation The BCRS was designed to support the extremely-high-precision measurements of position and motion required in astrometry. One critical factor in achieving that precision lies in how general relativistic effects are determined and measured. Both systems incorporate standards that enable the consistency and ready comparability of the resulting spacetime coordinates among astrometric measurements taken worldwide. They provide a metric tensor to establish a consistent frame of reference for observations. The tensor achieves consistency in part through its standardization of the reference point for gravity. The geocentric system is simpler, being smaller and involving few massive objects: that coordinate system defines its center as the center of mass of the Earth itself. The barycentric system can be loosely thought of as being centered on the Sun, but the Solar System is more complicated. Even the much smaller planets exert gravitational force upon the Sun, causing it to shift position slightly as they orbit. Those shifts are very large in comparison to the measurement precisions that are required for astrometry. Thus, the BCRS defines its center of coordinates as the center of mass of the entire Solar System, its barycenter. This stable point for gravity helps to minimize relativistic effects from any observational frames of reference within the Solar System. Relationship to other standards =ICRS= The orientation of the BCRS coordinate system coincides with that of the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS). Both are centered at the barycenter of the Solar System, and both \\"point\\" in the same direction. That is, their axes are aligned with that of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), which was adopted as a standard by the IAU two years earlier (1998). The motivation of the ICRF is to define what \\"direction\\" means in space, by fixing its orientation in relation to the Celestial sphere, that is, to deep-space background. Speaking casually, it does not move in relation to the stars and galaxies; it does not rotate. Determining perfect immobilization of direction is not possible in practice, but we can get much closer than it is even possible for us to measure. The more distant an object is, the less its direction appears to move in relation to us (the parallax effect). The ICRF thus uses very distant objects, well outside our galaxy, to establish its directional points of reference. The chosen objects also emit radio wavelengths, which are less subject than other wavelengths to being obscured by celestial gas in front of them. The ICRF adopts coordinates for 212 defining objects, mostly quasars, fixing its orientation with respect to them. =HCRF= The Hipparcos Celestial Reference Frame (HCRF) was a reference frame similar to ICRF, but earlier, used in association with the Hipparcos satellite, which functioned between 1989 and 1993. That satellite took copious stellar parallax measurements at accuracies exceeding anything otherwise available at the time, thus producing a catalog of stars still in wide use today. No such extensive mapping has yet been completed based upon subsequent improvements in measurement capability. With lower precision then, and at optical wavelengths, the ICRS and BCRS can also be specified using the HCRF. That is the means by which BCRS can be used in relation to the Hipparcos star catalog. Conversion of coordinates The BCRS and GCRS were also designed so as to make transformations of their coordinates between themselves and other reference systems possible, though the conversions are not by any means straightforward. There are two software libraries of IAU-sanctioned algorithms for manipulating and transforming among the BCRS and other reference systems: the Standards of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) system and the Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Subroutines (NOVAS). The orientation of the BCRS/ICRS axes also align within 0.02 arcsecond of the Earth's mean equator and equinox for the Fifth Fundamental Catalog (FK5) J2000.0 epoch.

Life Born on 20 September 1775 in Exeter, Devon, he was the son of John Leakey, who was in the wool trade. At the time of Sir Joshua Reynolds's death he was about to become his pupil. Leakey established himself at Exeter, painting portraits, miniatures and landscapes. He also produced small interiors with groups of rustic figures and Sir Francis Baring purchased one of those for ¬£500. With the exception of time in London from 1821 to 1825, during which he was intimate with Thomas Lawrence, David Wilkie, and other leading painters, Leakey's life was mostly passed at Exeter. He died there on 16 February 1865. Works Devonshire Landscape by James Leakey Leakey exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1821 The Marvellous Tale, in 1822 The Fortune Teller, in 1838 portraits and landscapes, and in 1846 The Distressed Wife. Leakey was best known for his delicate miniatures, painted in oils on ivory. These brought him a local celebrity. In the Exeter Guildhall there is a portrait by him of Henry Blackhall, mayor of Exeter; also a copy by him of Reynolds's portrait of John Rolle Walter. His portrait of John Haddy James, surgeon, is in the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. In 1846 Leakey published a plate by Samuel Cousins, from his portrait of John Rashdall, minister of Bedford Chapel, Exeter. Family By his marriage in 1815 with Eliza Hubbard Woolmer, Leakey had eleven children. They included Caroline Leakey the writer. He is the founding member of the Leakey family dynasty with branches specialising in archaeology and the military.

The six highways take Gordon Highway to the east-northeast and intersect the northern terminus of Doug Barnard Parkway (former SR 56 Spur) and the southern terminus of Molly Pond Road. Gordon Highway curves to the north-northeast and intersects Laney Walker Boulevard, thus effectively entering downtown. It travels just to the northwest of Magnolia Cemetery, Cedar Grove Cemetery, and May Park and southeast of the James Brown Arena. A short distance later, they travel to the east of Old Medical College and the Old Government House, then have an interchange with US 25 Bus./SR 28 (Broad Street). Here, US 25 Bus. meets its southern terminus. Just after this interchange, the highway crosses over the Savannah River into South Carolina. At the state line, SR 10/SR 121/Gordon Highway end, while US 1/US 25/US 78/US 278, concurrent with SC 121 travel on the Jefferson Davis Highway to the northeast toward North Augusta.

The house was built in the 1760s by builders funded by Joseph Mawbey and to designs by Kenton Couse. The elevated site once bore a 14th-century manor house seized along with all the other manors of Chertsey from Chertsey Abbey, a very rich abbey, under Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries and today much of its land is owned by two hospitals, one public, one private and the local authority. The remaining mansion and the near park surrounding were used for some decades as a colony hospital and as a private care home. The building is owned and used by Bijou Wedding Venues Limited. It is a Grade II* listed building. History The history of the site is unclear. The building standing today was built in the 1760s as a replacement of an old manor. The mansion's ownership was transferred often throughout its history. The Metropolitan Asylums Board was dissolved in 1930 and responsibility of caring for the mentally deficient was passed to the (local government) Councils. Surrey County Council decided set up new buildings to house patients while the mansion housed the hospital staff becoming designated from 1932 Botley's Park hospital, which specialised in patients with psychiatric disorders. The first section of the new hospital was opened on 24 June 1939 by Lady Henriques, wife of then chairman of the Council Sir Philip Henriques. In September of the same year, many of the hospital's patients were moved to Murray House in nearby Ottershaw so that Botleys could receive wounded soldiers from the war. During this time, the mansion was adapted into a nurses' home. In 1995, a fire severely damaged the building, and within two years, most of the nurses' home closed down. Architecture In architecture it is Grade II* listed, the middle category of listing, which as with the top category (Grade I) applies to less than one third of listed buildings. It is a Couse stone-built house in simple Palladian architecture without wings, surrounded by park land and iron gates. The stone came from quarries at Headington, Oxfordshire and Barrington, Cambridgeshire. The house is almost cubic in form, and the estate was about two miles in circumference, today about a mile; and approximately square, thus . A double flight of steps leads to the marble-paved entrance hall of the house. The entrance hall ceiling is supported by Scagliola columns and Ionic pilasters. Ownership In 1319, the original Botleys Mansion was either owned by John de Butteley or John Manory of Chertsey. In 1505, de Butteley's son Thomas gave the mansion to Richard Merland, Thomas Pervoche, and Henry Wykes; soon after though, Wykes became the sole owner of the mansion, then called Botlese Mansion. Ownership of the mansion changed hands several times and was owned by King Henry VIII in 1541, after he purchased it from Sir Roger Cholmeley. In 1763, the mansion was transferred to Joseph Mawbey, the man responsible for the house's reconstruction. The mansion was passed around after Mawbey's death until it was purchased by Robert Gosling in 1822. The Gosling family lived in the mansion until 1931, when the London County Council purchased the building for ¬£30,000. The mansion was bought and restored by a company, Bijou Wedding Venues, in 2010 and is used to host weddings and events.

It was built during the 14th century to control the road between Bourges and Sancoins. The estate was bought by the Babou family in 1546; during the rest of the 16th century they made significant alterations. The castle was acquired by the noted Baroque architect, Jules Hardouin Mansart, in 1699 and he made important alterations in the early 18th century. The castle was broken up during the French Revolution and its contents and materials sold. The enceinte originally comprised eight towers and two gateways. Wanting a more panoramic view, Mansart demolished the curtain walls on the east and created gardens. The west and north sides of the enceinte still exist. Also still visible are the pillars supporting the base of the bartizans (watch towers), parts of the portcullis in its housing and door panels from the 16th century. Under the Gothic arch vault can be seen the start of the staircase leading to the upper floors. Four towers remain. The facade looking onto the courtyard dates from the 15th century and has moulded windows as well as the openings made in the 18th century at the end of the building. Most of the doors still have their original decorative moulding. All of the buildings were covered with plafonds √† la fran√ßaise (French-style ceilings: joists the same width as the spaces between them; see Plafond √† la fran√ßaise in French Wikipedia). It has been listed since 1914 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. The castle is privately owned and is open to the public from June to September.

Biography Daniel Peter Layard was the son of Pierre Raymond de Layard (1666-1747), a Huguenot of good parentage of Monflanquin in Guienne (Lot et Garonne), who fled from France following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Pierre Raymond came to England as a member of the Corps of Noble Cadets of William III, and rose to the rank of Major in the British army in 1710, at which time he was in General Vezey's Regiment of Foot.The best summary is a printed pamphlet based on the researches of Lieutenant General Frederick Peter Layard, c. 1890, an OCR scan of which is reproduced on the King's Candlesticks website.

In April 1747 he was appointed physician-accoucheur at Middlesex Hospital, but shortly afterwards he resigned on account of ill health and travelled abroad. In 1750 Layard settled at Huntingdon, practising there for twelve years. On 3 July 1752 he was admitted a Licentiate of the College of Physicians (now the Royal College of Physicians of London). In c. 1762 he returned to London, where he soon obtained an extensive practice as an accoucheur. Layard was physician to Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, Princess, and Dowager Princess, of Wales. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Sciences of G√∂ttingen (now the G√∂ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities). Layard was a founder of the British Lying-in Hospital, of which he was later appointed a Vice President. On 20 June 1792 he was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Civil Law honoris causa at the University of Oxford. Layard died at Greenwich in February 1802, leaving a will, and requested burial in a private crypt in St Benet's, Paul's Wharf, and that his late wife's remains should be brought there from their original burial-place at St Martin in the Fields. He refers to the King's pleasure his wish that his unpublished manuscripts should be published for the financial benefit of his children; he refers particularly to the national services he has performed for the prevention and cure of afflictions of black cattle in Great Britain and other European countries between 1769 and 1793, for which he anticipates reward or compensation of not less than ¬£20,000; and he appoints Brownlow Bertie, 5th Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven to be his executor.Will of Doctor Daniel Peter Layard, Doctor of Laws and of Physic of Saint Alphege (P.C.C. 1802).

Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c.1800‚Äì1550 BC, Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, vol. 20. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997, excerpts available online here. Reign As a pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty, Merkare would have reigned either over Upper Egypt from Thebes or over Middle and Upper Egypt from Memphis. At the time, the Eastern Nile Delta was under the domination of the 14th Dynasty. According to the egyptologist Kim Ryholt, no less than 17 kings of the 13th Dynasty reigned in the short time period from 1663 BC until 1649 BC. Scholars, such as Manfred Bietak and Ryholt proposed that this instability is a consequence of a prolonged famine and perhaps a plague which struck at least the Delta region and lasted until the end of the 13th and 14th Dynasty states c. 1650 BC.Manfred Bietak, Egypt and Canaan During the Middle Bronze Age, BASOR 281 (1991), pp. 21-72 see in particular p. 38 The weakened state of both kingdoms may explain, in part, why they fell rapidly to the emerging Hyksos power c. 1650 BC. Attestation Merkare's only attestation is the Turin canon, a king list compiled in the early Ramesside period. According to the egyptologist Kim Ryholt, the canon gives his prenomen on the 8th column, 18th line (Gardiner entry 7.23 Alan H. Gardiner: The Royal Canon of Turin, Oxford 1959, Vol. III, 6.14, Warminster 1987, .). The Turin papyrus is damaged on the section covering the late 13th dynasty and Merkare's reign length is lost in a lacuna. The exact chronological position of Merkare is not known for certain as the damaged state of the Turin canon only allows for conjectural reconstructions of the late 13th Dynasty. According to Ryholt he was the forty-eighth ruler of the dynasty, while Baker and von Beckerath see him as the forty-seventh.Darrell D.

The melodramatic novel is centered on Nirmala, a young girl who was forced to marry a widower of her father's age. The plot unfolds to reveal her husband‚Äôs suspicion of a relationship between her and his eldest son, a suspicion that leads to the son‚Äôs death. A poignant novel first published in 1927, Nirmala's reformist agenda is transparent in its theme which deals with the question of dowry, and consequently mismatched marriages and related issues. The story uses fiction to highlight an era of much needed social reform in 1920s Indian society. Nirmala was serialized in 1928 in Chand, a women‚Äôs magazine in which the novel‚Äôs feminist character was represented. Nirmala is somewhat like Godaan (published in 1936) in that it deals with the exploitation of the village poor, and was translated by multiple scholarly translators. It was first translated in 1988 as The Second Wife by David Rubin, and in 1999 as Nirmala by Alok Rai, Premchand's grandson. Plot Udayabhanu Lal, a lawyer, arranged to marry off his 15-years-old daughter Nirmala to Bhuvanmohan Sinha, son of Bhalchadra Sinha. Kalyani, Nirmala's mother advises Lal not to spend too much money on Nirmala's marriage as he also has the duty of getting her second daughter, Krishna married. Angered by Kalyani's words, he decides to teach her a lesson by leaving his old dresses along the riverbank and going out to the next village for sometime to make Kalyani believe that he is dead. Lal was later murdered by his rival Mathayi, who was once tried in court by Lal and sentenced to jail. The death of Lal caused the Sinhas to withdraw from the arranged marriage since there was no longer a large dowry as anticipated prior to Lal's death. Kalyani writes a letter to Rangili bai, Bhuvanmohan sinha's mother telling about her pitiful situation. Rangili bai's effort of making her husband and son understand ends up in vain. With the help of Pandit Motaram, Kalyani searches a groom for Nirmala. Financial hardship forced Nirmala's mother, Kalyani, to marry her off to Totaram, a lawyer 20 years her senior. Totaram tried his best to seduce his beautiful young wife but to no avail. He once tells a false story that he killed two thiefs who had big swords with them to make her feel that her husband is full of bravery. But Nirmala who knows that it is a false story, still smiles and acts as though she's happy. She had no feelings for him other than respect and a sense of duty, which fell short of the love he expected to receive from his wife. Totaram had 3 sons from his first marriage. His eldest son Mansaram was only a year older than Nirmala. It wasn't long before Totaram grew suspicious of Nirmala due to his widow sister, Rukmini's words and her relationship with his son Mansaram. Jealousy and suspicion caused him to send Mansaram away to live in a hostel, a decision they all soon came to regret. Mansaram's health soon deteriorated in the hostel environment. It was Bhuvanmohan who treated Mansaram at the hospital. When Mansaram was in need of blood it was Nirmala who donated her blood after which Totaram realises his mistake. Bhuvanmohan learned about Nirmala, he arranged for his brother to marry Nirmala's sister, Krishna, as penance. Bhuvanmohan was haunted by his thoughts of Nirmala and her distress. Mansaram eventually died of tuberculosis. Totaram was heartbroken and guilt ridden over his role in his son's death. Rukmini fuels the fire in Jiyaram and Siyaram that Nirmala was the reason for their brother's death. They believe in Rukmini's false words. It wasn't long thereafter when his second son, Jiyaram absconded with Nirmala's jewels and fled from Totaram's house. He later committed suicide. Totaram's third son Siyaram also fled, having been lured away by a false saint. Depressed over the loss of his sons, Totaram set off on a mission to find his only living son, Siyaram. Meanwhile, Bhuvanmohan was back in Nirmala's life as the husband of her friend, Sudha. He tried to seduce Nirmala, but his wife learned of it and criticized him harshly. Bhuvanmohan became emotionally distressed, and out of sorrow and his love for her, he committed suicide. Depressed by the sad turn of events and her own failing health, Nirmala gave her daughter Asha to Rukhmini and died. A much older Totaram returned home to discover Nirmala had died. Rukmini realised her mistake. Characters * Nirmala, the protagonist; a 15-year-old girl, married off to Totaram who is 20 years her senior. * Totaram, Nirmala's husband, a lawyer of 35. * Mansaram, Totaram's eldest son from his first wife; suspected of having a relationship with Nirmala, and forces him out of the house to live in a hostel where he eventually dies. * Jiyaram, Totaram's second son from his first wife; he blames his father for the death of his older brother and flees from home after absconding with Nirmala's jewelry. He eventually commits suicide. * Siyaram, Totaram's third son from his first wife; he is lured away from his father's house by a false saint. * Asha, Totaram and Nirmala's daughter. * Rukhmini, Totaram's widowed sister. * Udayabhanu Lal, Nirmala's father. * Kalyani, Nirmala's mother. * Krishna, Nirmala's younger sister. * Bhuvanmohan Sinha, former fiance of Nirmala.

Background Set against a background of pre-independent India, Nirmala depicts a realistic and picturesque portrait of the 1920s, the language and milieu of the era. It characterizes the evils of the dowry system, and in doing so reflects the author's desire to bring about social reform and raise the status of women in society. The author's words illustrate his country's poor, and paints a picture of rural India consisting largely of a static society, the clashes of castes, its poverty and exploitation, and the rich character of its people. The novel covers a time span of about six years during which time Nirmala transitions from student to wife and thereafter, a mother. It was an era when self-respect and public image were of fundamental importance in the society. Eating meals was observed with an extreme ritualistic importance. In traditional homes, women did not eat with the men, and waited for them to finish before they were permitted to eat. There was also a fear of hospitals [and also of blood transfusion] which explains the hesitation of the character Totaram and his guilt over sending his son to a hospital. The generations that have passed since the novel was first written have seen dramatic changes in \\"attitude, sensibility and aspiration.\\" Nirmala is a reflection of a time in Indian society when a young girl's \\"greatest sin was to require a husband who would accept her without a dowry.\\" Publication Nirmala was one of Premchand's most popular novels of its time in India, a time of oppression for women in Indian society that drew increasing attention from writers and poets. Prior to being published in its entirety, Nirmala was serialised in the magazine Chand over the course of a year, beginning in November 1925. It was during the time when Premchand first embarked on writing fiction based on contemporary social issues. Unlike his other works, Nirmala has a darker tone and ending, and its characters are less idealised. It was translated into English for the first time in 1988. Amruta Subhash played Nirmala in Tehreer Munshi Premchand Ki by Gulzar Legacy Francesca Orsini called it a prime example of Premchand‚Äôs combination of social realism and drama. Gulzar believed the novel was a little outstretched, and had a tendency to repeat many emotions, but also had its diversions and contradictions. He further explained that Premchand specialised in subjects that revolved around a young girl under 18 years old who suddenly becomes a woman after marrying a man who is much older. Many films based on the story's theme were also produced, such as Tehreer Munshi Premchand Ki directed by Gulzar and shown in Doordarshan. Nirmala's role was played by the Marathi actress Amruta Subhash who received many accolades. Ananya Khare played the lead role in the Doordarshan TV serial Nirmala in 1987.

History Bethlehem Lutheran Church gathering, Pimpama Island (Carl Heinrich Heck is centre of the middle row) Woongoolba state school, 2014 In the late 1800s, the farming district located between the Pimpama River and the Logan River called Pimpama Island and encompasses the modern localities of Jacobs Well, Norwell, Steiglitz and Woongoolba. It was referred to as an island because there were a number of lagoons and swamps that isolated the area during the wet season; however, this disadvantage made it good land for growing sugar cane. The name Woongoolba is believed to be an Aboriginal word for the geebung tree. The district was predominantly settled by German immigrants who arrived in the period 1864‚Äì1900. The Pimpama Island Provisional School opened on 17 April 1876 under the direction of teacher Joseph Schindler with 13 pupils (of German parentage). It became Pimpama Island State School on 7 September 1898. It was renamed Woongoolba State School in 1930. Additional classrooms and a library were built in 1941, with further expansions in 1991, 1997 and 2010. Rocky Point Sugar Mill, Woongoolba and Steiglitz, 2014 The Rocky Point Sugar Mill was established by Carl Heinrich Heck in 1878 on Mill Road (and crosses the boundary between Woongoolba and Steiglitz). Despite being one of the oldest sugar mills in Australia, it is still privately owned by the Heck Group. There were once other sugar mills in the area, but they have now closed and Rocky Point has expanded to replace their lost capacity. Bethlehem Lutheran Church, Woongoolba, 2014 The Bethlehem Lutheran church was established in 1882; it is still operating in 2014. In the , Woongoolba had a population of 460 people. Amenities Cecil Zipf Park, 2014 Accessed via a causeway through the mangroves, the Cecil Zipf Park at Little Rocky Point offers views of Moreton Bay, off-leash dog area, BBQ and toilets.

Set on the planet Aelion, Skyforge fuses elements of Science fiction and fantasy in its visuals and storytelling, and sees players exploring the world as an immortal who must strive to become a god and defend the planet from alien invasion from other worlds. The project started development in 2010 and received an open release for Microsoft Windows in July 2015, with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One releases following in 2017. The latest major content update, \\"Ignition\\", was released on all platforms in September 2019. A Nintendo Switch version is set to released in Q4 2020. Gameplay In Skyforge, players assume the role of an immortal with incredible celestial powers who must protect the planet Aelion from invaders who threaten the world and its population. Character progression within the game is not level based; instead of a traditional leveling format, Skyforge features a 'prestige' system, which allows a player to advance based on the sum total of their stats and progression. This allows players to develop and switch between 17 different classes at any time, rather than being locked into a class choice made earlier in the game. As a player gains more prestige, additional content, gear, and followers are unlocked. Once the player becomes a god is achieved Skyforge includes an additional progression system which allows users to manage their followers to increase their character's overall power. Aelion has a lot of missions to take on and locations to visit. The capital of Aelion serves as the game's hub, with three core locations. The Divine Observatory is where the player can take on missions and visit different locations through a hologram globe. The Divine Observatory allows players to travel to different locations around Aelion, and also participate in player versus player battles. Each location, including Dankit Island, Lanber Forest, and Isola Digs, has multiple objectives, enemies, and storylines. At the Research Center, the player can train, try out different classes, and change the appearance of their character. In the Park, players explore and occasionally hosts events, such as seasonal pumpkin lighting and gift opening events for Halloween and Christmas. Players can team up with friends and random players online to take on missions and larger raids and instances. Story In the universe of Skyforge, gods derive their powers from their followers. The planet of Aelion was once a free world protected by the Greater God named Aeli, who helped civilization flourish. When the story begins, Aeli has vanished, leaving behind a world of followers which is only protected by immortals (the player characters) and a few remaining lesser gods, leaving it under attack by hostile gods and invading alien forces from neighboring planets. The player starts in the capital of Aelion as an immortal, and after talking to Herida, a goddess and advisor to the immortals, discovers that they were brought back to life after a devastating attack by the Reapers of Death. After choosing a starting class and undergoing combat guides, training, tutorials, and character customization, the player can tackle combat missions around Aelion, fighting off invaders such as the diabolical Reapers of Death, the mechanical Mechanoids, the floral Phytonides, the amphibious Oceanids, the serpentine Gorgonides, and the astral Demons. The update New Horizons, released on April 9, 2019, introduced the planet Terra, new story content, and the Draconids, a new enemy race. Development Allods Team, who previously developed the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Allods Online, started developing Skyforge for PC in 2010. It was confirmed that My.com would publish the game. In May 2013, it was announced that Obsidian Entertainment, known for their work on western role-playing video games such as Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords, Neverwinter Nights 2, and Fallout: New Vegas, would be collaborating with Allods Team on the development of Skyforge. The game entered closed beta in 2015, and received an open public release for Microsoft Windows on 16 July, 2015. On April 11, 2017, Skyforge was released for PlayStation 4. It was also released for Xbox One on November 29, 2017, and is set to released for Nintendo Switch in Q4 2020. = Business model = Skyforge is free-to-play but allows players to pay for certain in-game content, including an optional premium status. A store also allows players to purchase certain items, including cosmetics and equipment that gives small stat boosts. Reception Upon its release in 2015, MMORPG.com said that Skyforge was \\"easily the best new MMO in recent months.\\" Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer Richard Cobbett said the game was \\"one of the more pleasant F2P MMOs I've played of late\\", and praised the differences between Skyforge and competitors, including its hub world, the scattered quests in open areas, and the \\"genuine sense of trying to be a good game first and a profitable one second\\". = Awards = * 'MMORPG of the Year' from MMOs.com's 2015 Game of the Year Awards *'Best of Show' from TenTonHammer's Best of E3 2014 Awards = Nominated = * 'Best PC Game' from Destructoid's Best of E3 2014 Awards References External links * Category:2015 video games Category:Active massively multiplayer online games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Obsidian Entertainment games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games developed in Russia Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Skyforge"},{"id":"42398834","text":"Alangium kurzii is a tree in the family Cornaceae.

Most of the hoard is now in the British Museum's collection, although a few items can be found in museums in Paris and Istanbul too.British Museum Collection Discovery The Lampsacus Treasure was accidentally found in 1847 by farmers digging in a field near the village of Lapseki (ancient Lampsacus) in north-west Turkey. Dating to 6th and 7th centuries AD, the hoard of largely silver objects provides a significant catalogue of design and fashion from the early Byzantine period. Soon after its discovery, the bulk of the treasure came into the possession of Henry Richard Charles Wellesley, Earl of Cowley, who donated it to the British Museum in 1848. Two other institutions also have objects from the treasure: the Istanbul Archaeological Museum possess two bowls; the Louvre a further two spoons. Description of the treasure The hoard includes a wide range of ecclesiastical objects that may have originally belonged to a church or a wealthy individual connected with the church. It includes a silver tripod lamp-stand with five imperial control stamps that date from the reign of Justinian I (527-65AD). In the British Museum there are also twelve pear-shaped spoons, six of which bear inscriptions and verse in Greek and/or Latin, a (slightly damaged) silver chalice, two silver dishes with nielloed monograms in the centre, an ornate silver polycandelon, part of a folding stool, and various jewellery and furniture/vessel fittings.

It saw Perth, after having won only two premierships in its first sixty-six seasons, win its third consecutive flag under captain-coach Mal Atwell and champion rover Barry Cable ‚Äì all three Grand Finals having been won against East Perth with Cable taking the Simpson Medal. Among numerous highlights, champion Subiaco full-forward Austin \\"Ocker\\" Robertson broke by one goal the 1953 record of Bernie Naylor for the most goals in a WANFL home- and-away season, doing so with a whopping twenty-six scoring shots against East Fremantle in the final round. Perth achieved the best record for a full season since South Fremantle's champion 1953 team with only two losses ‚Äì which Barry Cable missed due to a broken hand and then interstate duties ‚Äì whilst West Perth, under former East Perth champion ‚ÄúPolly‚Äù Farmer as captain-coach lost only three home-and-away matches to equal the Cardinals‚Äô 1953 record.Kennedy, Tom; ‚ÄòWest Equal 15-Year Club Record‚Äô; The Sunday Times, 1 September 1968, p. 86 East Perth were to have a slow start and were in danger of missing the finals until July, but three last-kick wins ‚Äì the last two after surrendering big leads ‚Äì took the Royals to the Grand Final. In contrast, Swan Districts ‚Äì who had at the beginning of the decade risen from a long period as a chopping block to a hat-trick of premierships ‚Äì fell to become the first WANFL team to win only one match in a season since they themselves did so in 1951, owing to extreme weakness in the ruckCasellas, Ken; ‚ÄòIseger Lifts Perth Attack‚Äô; The West Australian, 10 June 1968, p. 28 where expected top follower Dave Dalgarno moved to QAFL club Western Districts under an ANFC coaching scheme without playing a league match,Wilkinson, Colin; ‚ÄòDalgarno Off To Plead His Own Cause‚Äô; The Sunday Times, 28 April 1968, p. 86 major injuries to key players Ken Bagley, John Turnbull and Peter Manning,Wilkinson, Colin; ‚ÄòBig Game a Flop: Subiaco Humbled by Merciless West‚Äô; The Sunday Times, 12 May 1968, p. 104 and the retirement of numerous key players of between 1961 and 1965.

Their solitary win, by one point with a kick after the siren, made Swans the closest club to a winless season in open-age WA(N)FL competition between 1918 and 1998. East Fremantle, after falling to seventh in 1967, had their worst season since the club's first year in 1898, in the process setting a still-standing club record of thirteen consecutive defeats, whilst Subiaco, coached by Haydn Bunton Jr., rose from last to fourth aided by Robertson's prolific goalkicking. However, in the most uneven season in a major Australian Rules league, they won all 12 games against the four teams that missed the finals, but lost all 9 matches against the three Perth clubs that finished above them on the ladder.Spillman, Ken; Diehards: The Story of the Subiaco Football Club 1946-2000, pp. 124-127.

Their brass section, Horns of Contempt, consisted of Jack Howard on trumpet, Jeremy Smith on French horn, and Michael Waters on trombone.

It specifically concerned a case where the latter person received no formal wages and had entered no formal ownership nor partnership agreement nor directly or indirectly contributed in money to the purchase price. Facts Mrs Geary and Mr Rankine had been in a relationship since 1990. In 1996, Rankine purchased a guest house with his own savings. The parties had not intended to live in the property or run it themselves; instead having it run by a manager. Difficulties with the manager led Rankine to run the business himself. He realised that he could not run it alone. Geary became involved in the business: cleaning, cooking and looking after guests. Rankine did not pay Geary wages, and she asked for money when she needed it. The relationship deteriorated. Geary brought a claim for an interest in the guest house. She claimed she either had a business Partnership (as defined under the Partnership Act 1890) or a constructive trust as defined by case law. Judgment At first instance, the Judge rejected Geary's claim. She appealed. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal,[2012] EWCA Civ 555 holding that the legal title was solely in Rankine's name and so the burden of establishing a constructive trust was on Geary. The relevant question was whether there was a common intention for Geary to have a beneficial interest in the property, applying Jones v Kernott [2011] UKSC 53, which must be determined objectively from the parties' conduct. Geary had shown there was a common intention to run the business together, but it was not correct to therefore reach a conclusion of a common intention that the property in which the business was run, bought by only one of them, would if so belong to both of them. The judge at first instance had not erred in probing the evidence and concluding there was no constructive trust.

The film stars Akshay Oberoi, Parvathy Omanakuttan and Dipannita Sharma in the lead roles, while Arunoday Singh, Rajesh Sharma, Omkar Das Manikpuri and Sonali Sachdev play supporting roles. The film is a remake of 2012 Tamil film, Pizza, directed by Karthik Subbaraj and was released on 18 July 2014. The film was declared \\"Average\\". Produced by Siddharth Roy Kapur and Bejoy Nambiar, the film is the last production from UTV Spotboy. Plot Kunal Malkholkar (Akshay Oberoi) is a pizza delivery boy who lives with his wife Nikita (Parvathy Omanakuttan). She is an aspiring novelist and is researching for writing a horror story, whereas Kunal does not believe in supernatural powers, and is afraid of anything supernatural. Nikki, keeps telling him that he would soon realize the presence of supernatural beings. At first, Kunal is confused and scared, and his fears are confirmed when he comes to know his boss, i.e., the Pizza restaurant owner Mr. Kapoor's (Rajesh Sharma) pregnant wife is possessed by a spirit. Meanwhile, Nikki becomes pregnant. One particular day, Kunal goes out to deliver a pizza to a customer and returns to the restaurant in a state of shock while covered in blood; he is apparently injured, keeps constantly muttering Nikkis name, and seems to be worried about her. When his boss questions him, Kunal explains that he had been to deliver a pizza to a customer named Smitha (Dipannita Sharma) in a bungalow and recounts the events that happened at the bungalow. Smitha requests Kunal to wait downstairs while she goes upstairs to retrieve change. Almost immediately, there is power failure, which alarms Kunal. While waiting downstairs completely alone in the dark, Kunal hears a loud unidentifiable noise from the bedroom upstairs. Going up to investigate, he finds Smitha murdered suspiciously and notices one slice the pizza he had delivered to be missing, suggesting that there may be somebody else in the house. Horrified, Kunal makes a dash for the door only to realize that it has been locked from the outside. Further more when the murdered woman's husband (Arunoday Singh) arrives, he at first believes he stumbles upon his wife having an affair. Through his cellphone Kunal communicates with him and explains his situation thoroughly instigating Mr. Ghost to aid him on how to get out of the house. Moreover, Mr. Ghost suddenly disappears from the front entrance, and is found by Kunal inside the house mysteriously murdered in the same room as his wife, with two slices of the pizza now missing. Also, Kunal encounters the couple's child \\"Anjali\\", identical to the name of the spirit allegedly possessing Mr. Kapoor's wife. Kunal tries everything he can to get out of the house including trying to break down the sealed doors leading outside, to using the house phone which happens to work even though the line is dead. Kunal manages to contact Nikki using the phone and gets her to contact to the local police to come and rescue him. The door bell rings, and Kunal finds Nikki outside. He sees the ghost couple behind Nikki and asks her to move, but is attacked by the ghosts. When a couple of policemen arrive at the bungalow, Kunal believes that Nikki had requested them to help him, but they reveal that four people had been killed in that house - Smitha, Mr. Ghost, their young daughter and a girl named Nikki, implying that she is Kunal's girl friend, Nikki. The police disclose that Kunal is a suspect regarding the murder case and attempt to arrest him. Confused and in tears, Kunal does not believe the policemen and attempts to escape the clutches of these police men in order to go in search of Nikki. While trying to escape, Kunal witnesses the police getting dragged into the house and being killed. At this juncture, Kunal, in a horrified state, runs back to the restaurant. His friends at the restaurant and Mr. Kapoor visit the bungalow themselves and see Nikki apparently possessed by Anjali. Further, it is revealed that the bungalow had previously witnessed the untimely deaths of a married couple, their daughter, and two policeman, whose ghosts Kunal had earlier interacted with. Meanwhile, Kunal seems to continue his search for Nikki, has constant health issues, and seems to be disturbed by ghosts and supernatural entities. As Kunal during a delivery stops and calls Nikki, the true story of what had happened is disclosed. The Income Tax department had planned on a raid at the restaurant owner Mr. Kapoor's house. Mr. Kapoor who has diamonds worth around 20 million hidden in his restaurant hides it in a box of candies and asks Kunal to deliver it to his house. but he goes his house first to deliver pizzas to his wife, she notices the candy box. She decides to take few candies, when she notices the packet containing diamonds. Kunal and Nikki decide that stealing those diamonds would improve their life style and support their baby. So, they concoct a clever story in which Kunal convincingly \\"forgets\\" the Pizza bag at the \\"haunted\\" bungalow which Mr. Kapoor would never enter into, thanks to his fear of supernatural powers. Meanwhile, Nikki packs and plans to go somewhere away from that city and decide to settle abroad. Kunal says that before going away from there he wants to deliver the last pizza of his life and gets a phone call. Kunal, after the phone call, goes to deliver a pizza to a house and he encounters a series of events similar to the story he had narrated. Inside, he meets a little girl identical to the \\"Anjali\\" he had described in his story. Kunal is locked inside the home with \\"Anjali\\" curiously looking at him. The door to the house then locks shut, ending the movie.

Members of the Church, through lobbying of Axis officials, provision of false documents, and the hiding of people in monasteries, convents, schools, among families and the institutions of the Vatican itself, saved hundreds of thousands of Jews. The Israeli diplomat and historian Pinchas Lapide estimated the figure at between 700,000 and 860,000, although the figure is contested.Vincent A. Lapomarda; The Jesuits and the Third Reich; 2nd Edn, Edwin Mellen Press; 2005; p.3 The Catholic Church itself faced persecution in Hitler's Germany, and institutional German Catholic resistance to Nazism centered largely on defending the Church's own rights and institutions. Broader resistance tended to be fragmented and led by individual effort in Germany, but in every country under German occupation, priests played a major part in rescuing Jews. Aiding Jews met with severe penalty and many rescuers and would-be rescuers were killed including St Maximilian Kolbe, Giuseppe Girotti and Bernhard Lichtenberg who were sent to the concentration camps. In the prelude to the Holocaust, Popes Pius XI and Pius XII preached against racism and war in encyclicals such as Mit brennender Sorge (1937) and Summi Pontificatus (1939). Pius XI condemned Kristallnacht and rejected the Nazi claim of racial superiority, saying instead there was only \\"a single human race\\". His successor Pius XII employed diplomacy to aid the Jews, and directed his Church to provide discreet aid. While the overall caution of his approach has been criticised by some, his 1942 Christmas radio address denounced the murder of \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of innocent people on the basis of \\"nationality or race\\" and he intervened to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries. When the Nazis came for Italy's Jews, some 4715 of the 5715 Jews of Rome found shelter in 150 Church institutions, 477 in the Vatican itself and he opened his Castel Gandolfo residence in January 1944, which eventually took in 12 thousands Jews and non-Catholics. Catholic bishops in Germany sometimes spoke out on human rights issues, but protests against anti- Jewish policies tended to be by way of private lobbying of government ministers. After Pius XII's 1943 Mystici corporis Christi encyclical (which condemned the killing of the disabled amid the ongoing Nazi euthanasia program), a joint declaration from the German bishops denounced the killing of \\"innocent and defenceless mentally handicapped, incurably infirm and fatally wounded, innocent hostages, and disarmed prisoners of war and criminal offenders, people of a foreign race or descent\\".Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; 2008 pp. 529‚Äì30 Resistor priests active in rescuing Jews include the martyrs Bernard Lichtenberg and Alfred Delp, and laywomen Gertrud Luckner and Margarete Sommer used Catholic agencies to aid German Jews, under the protection of Bishops such as Konrad von Preysing. In Italy, the popes lobbied Mussolini against anti-Semitic policies, while Vatican diplomats, among them Giuseppe Burzio in Slovakia, Filippo Bernardini in Switzerland and Angelo Roncalli in Turkey rescued thousands. The nuncio to Budapest, Angelo Rotta, and Bucharest, Andrea Cassulo, have been recognised by Yad Vashem. The Church played an important role in the defence of Jews in Belgium, France, and the Netherlands, encouraged by the protests of leaders such as Cardinal Jozef- Ernest van Roey, Archbishop Jules-G√©raud Sali√®ge, and Johannes de Jong. From his Vatican office, Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty operated an escape operation for Jews and Allied escapees. Priests and nuns of orders like the Jesuits, Franciscans and Benedictines hid children in monasteries, convents and schools.Martin Gilbert; The Righteous: the Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Holt Paperback; New York; 2004; Preface Margit Slachta's Hungarian Social Service Sisterhood saved thousands. In Poland, the unique ≈ªegota organisation also rescued thousands and Mother Matylda Getter's Franciscan Sisters sheltered hundreds of Jewish children who escaped the Warsaw Ghetto. In France, Belgium, and Italy, Catholic underground networks were particularly active and saved thousands of Jews, particularly in northern Italy where groups like the Assisi Network were active, and in southern France. Inside the Third Reich While the Catholic Church in Germany was one of the few organizations that offered organised, systematic resistance to some policies of the Third Reich;Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p.210 the considerable energies expended by the German church in opposing government interference in the church was not matched in public by protests against the anti-Jewish policies of regime.Ian Kershaw; The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation; 4th Edn; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000\\"; pp. 210‚Äì11 According to Ian Kershaw, while the \\"detestation of Nazism was overwhelming within the Catholic Church\\", traditional Christian anti-Judaism was \\"no bulwark\\" against Nazi biological antisemitism.Ian Kershaw; The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation; 4th Edn; Oxford University Press; New York; 2000; pp. 211‚Äì212 The Church in Germany was itself facing Nazi persecution.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 136 German bishops feared protests against the anti-Jewish policies of the regime would invite retaliation against Catholics.Hamerow, 1997, p. 138 Such protests as were made tended to be private letters to government ministers. The relationship of the Church to Jews had a chequered history, entailing both suspicion and respect. Geoffrey Blainey wrote, \\"Christianity could not escape some indirect blame for Holocaust. The Jews and Christians were rivals, sometimes enemies, for a long period of history. Furthermore, it was traditional for Christians to blame Jewish leaders for the crucifixion of Christ... At the same time, Christians showed devotion and respect. They were conscious of their debt to the Jews. Jesus and all the disciples and all the authors of the gospels were of the Jewish race. Christians viewed the Old Testament, the holy book of the synagogues, as equally a holy book for them...\\".Blainey, 2011, pp. 499‚Äì502 Hamerow writes that sympathy for the Jews was common among Catholics in the German Resistance, who saw both Catholics and Jews as religious minorities exposed to bigotry on the part of the majority. This sympathy led some lay and clergy resistors to speak publicly against the persecution of the Jews, as with the priest who wrote in a periodical in 1934 that it was a sacred task of the church to oppose \\"sinful racial pride and blind hatred of the Jews\\". The leadership of the Catholic Church in Germany, however, was generally hesitant to speak out specifically on behalf of the Jews.Hamerow, 1997, p. 74 Church resistance to the Holocaust in Germany was generally left to fragmented and largely individual efforts. German bishops such as Konrad von Preysing and Joseph Frings were notable exceptions for the energy and consistency of their criticism of the government's treatment of Jews.Phayer, Michael. 2000. The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930‚Äì1965. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press. ; p 77 Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber gained an early reputation as a critic of the Nazi movement.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Michael von Faulhaber; web Apr. 2013. Soon after the Nazi takeover, his three Advent sermons of 1933, entitled Judaism, Christianity, and Germany, affirmed the Jewish origins of the Christian religion, the continuity of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, and the importance of the Christian tradition to Germany. Though Faulhaber's words were cautiously framed as a discussion of historical Judaism, his sermons denounced the Nazi extremists who were calling for the Bible to be purged of the \\"Jewish\\" Old Testament as a grave threat to Christianity: in seeking to adhere to the central tenet of Nazism, \\"The anti- Semitic zealots...\\" wrote Hamerow, were also undermining \\"the basis of Catholicism. Neither accommodation, nor acquiescence was possible any longer; the cardinal had to face the enemy head on.\\"Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 140 During the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom, Faulhaber supplied a truck to rabbi of the Ohel Yaakov Synagogue, to rescue sacred objects before the building was torn down. Following mass demonstrations against Jews and Catholics, a Nazi mob attacked Faulhaber's palace, and smashed its windows.Martin Gilbert; Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster; HarperPress; 2006; p.143 The Bishop of Munster, August von Galen, though a German conservative and nationalist, criticised Nazi racial policy in a sermon in January 1934, and in subsequent homilies spoke against Hitler's theory of the purity of German blood.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.59 When in 1933, the Nazi school superintendent of Munster issued a decree that religious instruction be combined with discussion of the \\"demoralising power\\" of the \\"people of Israel\\", Galen refused, writing that such interference in curriculum was a breach of the Reich concordat and that he feared children would be confused as to their \\"obligation to act with charity to all men\\" and as to the historical mission of the people of Israel.Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 139 In 1941, with the Wehrmacht still marching on Moscow, Galen denounced the lawlessness of the Gestapo and the cruel program of Nazi euthanasia and went further than just defending the church by speaking of a moral danger to Germany from the regime's violations of basic human rights: \\"the right to life , to inviolability, and to freedom is an indispensable part of any moral social order\\", he said - and any government that punishes without court proceedings \\"undermines its own authority and respect for its sovereignty within the conscience of its citizens\\".Theodore S. Hamerow; On the Road to the Wolf's Lair - German Resistance to Hitler; Belknap Press of Harvard University Press; 1997; ; p. 289‚Äì90 =Response to Kristallnacht and increasing brutality= Kristallnacht, shop damage in Magdeburg. Pope Pius XI joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom. In response, the Nazis organised mass demonstrations against Catholics and Jews in Munich. On 11 November 1938, following Kristallnacht, Pope Pius XI joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom. In response, the Nazis organised mass demonstrations against Catholics and Jews in Munich, and the Bavarian Gauleiter Adolf Wagner declared before 5,000 protesters: \\"Every utterance the Pope makes in Rome is an incitement of the Jews throughout the world to agitate against Germany\\". A Nazi mob attacked Cardinal Faulhaber's palace, and smashed its windows. On 21 November, in an address to the world's Catholics, the Pope rejected the Nazi claim of racial superiority, and insisted instead that there was only a single human race. Robert Ley, the Nazi Minister of Labour declared the following day in Vienna: \\"No compassion will be tolerated for the Jews. We deny the Pope's statement that there is but one human race. The Jews are parasites.\\" Catholic leaders including Cardinal Schuster of Milan, Cardinal van Roey in Belgium and Cardinal Verdier in Paris backed the Pope's strong condemnation of Kristallnacht.Martin Gilbert; Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster; HarperPress; 2006; p.172 At his Berlin Cathedral, Fr. Bernhard Lichtenberg closed each evening service with a prayer \\"for the Jews, and the poor prisoners in the Concentration camps\\".Martin Gilbert; Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster; HarperPress; 2006; p.40 From 1934, forced sterilisation of the hereditarily diseased had commenced in Germany. Based on eugenic theories, it proposed to cleanse the German nation of \\"unhealthy breeding stock\\" and was taken a step further in 1939, when the regime commenced its \\"euthanasia\\". This was the first of the regime's infamous series of mass extermination programmes, which saw the Nazis attempt to eliminate \\"life unworthy of life\\" from Europe: first the handicapped, then Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and others deemed \\"subnormal\\". Ultimately, the Jews suffered most in numerical terms, while Gypsies suffered the greatest proportional loss. The Jews later termed the tragedy The Holocaust (or Shoah).Mary Fulbrook; The Fontana History of Germany: 1918‚Äì1990 The Divided Nation; Fontana Press; 1991; pp. 104‚Äì5 Hitler's order for the T4 Euthanasia Program was dated 1 September, the day Germany invaded Poland. As word of the program spread, protest grew, until finally, Bishop August von Galen delivered his famous 1941 sermons denouncing the program as \\"murder\\". Thousands of copies of the sermons were circulated across Germany. Galen denounced the regime's violations of basic human rights: \\"the right to life , to inviolability, and to freedom is an indispensable part of any moral social order\\", he said - and any government that punishes without court proceedings \\"undermines its own authority and respect for its sovereignty within the conscience of its citizens\\". The words had profound resonance for the mass extermination programs yet to come, and forced the euthanasia program underground. Unlike the Nazi euthanasia murder of invalids, which the church led protests against, the Final Solution liquidation of the Jews did not primarily take place on German soil, but rather in Polish territory. Awareness of the murderous campaign was therefore less widespread. Such protests as were made by the Catholic bishops in Germany regarding anti- Semitic policies of the regime, tended to be by way of private letters to government ministers. But the Church had already rejected the racial ideology. The Nazi Concentration Camps had been established in 1933, as political prisons, but it was not until the invasion of Russia that the death camps opened, and techniques learned in the aborted euthanasia program were transported to the East for the racial exterminations. The process of gassing commenced in December 1941.Mary Fulbrook; The Fontana History of Germany: 1918‚Äì1990 The Divided Nation; Fontana Press; 1991; pp. 104‚Äì110 During the pontificate of Pope John Paul II, the Catholic Church reflected on the Holocaust in We Remember: A Reflection on the Shoah (1998). The document acknowledged a negative history of \\"long-standing sentiments of mistrust and hostility that we call anti-Judaism\\" from many Christians towards Jews, but distinguished these from the racial antisemitism of the Nazis:Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews: We Remember: A Reflection of the Shoah; presented 16 March 1998 =Vatican diplomacy in Germany= Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) served as Pius XI's diplomatic representative in Germany (1917‚Äì1929) and then as Vatican Secretary of State (1929‚Äì1939), during which period he delivered multiple denunciations of Nazi racial ideology. Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) served as Pius XI's diplomatic representative in Germany (1917‚Äì1929) and then as Vatican Secretary of State (1929‚Äì1939), during which period he delivered multiple denunciations of Nazi racial ideology. As Secretary of State, Pacelli made some 55 protests against Nazi policies, including its \\"ideology of race\\". As the newly installed Nazi Government began to instigate its program of anti-antisemitism, Pope Pius XI, through Cardinal Pacelli, who was by then serving as Vatican Secretary of State, ordered the successor Papal Nuncio in Berlin, Cesare Orsenigo, to \\"look into whether and how it may be possible to become involved\\" in their aid. Orsenigo generally proved a poor instrument in this regard, concerned more with the anti-church policies of the Nazis and how these might effect German Catholics, than with taking action to help German Jews.Paul O'Shea; A Cross Too Heavy; Rosenberg Publishing; p. 232 In the assessment of historian Michael Phayer, Orsenigo did intervene on behalf of the Jews, but only seldom, and apart from his attempt to halt a plan to \\"resettle\\" Jews married to Christians, when directed by the Holy See to protest against mistreatment of Jews, he did so \\"timidly\\".Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930‚Äì1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.45 The 1937 papal anti-Nazi encyclical Mit brennender Sorge was part drafted by Pacelli as Vatican Secretary of State. It repudiated Nazi racial theory and the \\"so-called myth of race and blood\\". Pacelli became Pope in 1939, and told Vatican officials that he intended to reserve the all important handling of diplomacy with Germany for himself.Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930‚Äì1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.44 He issued Summi Pontificatus with spoke of the equality of races, and of Jew and Gentile. Following a 21 June 1943 Vatican Radio broadcast to Germany which spoke in defence of Yugoslav Jews, Pius XII instructed the papal nuncio to Germany, Cesare Orsenigo to speak directly with Hitler about the persecution of the Jews. Orsenigo later met with Hitler at Berchtesgaden, but when the subject of the Jews was raised, Hitler reportedly turned his back, and smashed a glass on the floor.The Record of Pius XII's Opposition to Hitler; by Inside the Vatican Staff; published at CatholicCulture.Org; retrieved 16 October 2013 =German Catholic efforts to save Jews in Germany= Mary Fulbrook wrote that when politics encroached on the church, Catholics were prepared to resist, but that the record was otherwise patchy and uneven, and that, with notable exceptions, \\"it seems that, for many Germans, adherence to the Christian faith proved compatible with at least passive acquiescence in, if not active support for, the Nazi dictatorship\\".Mary Fulbrook; The Fontana History of Germany: 1918‚Äì1990 The Divided Nation; Fontana Press; 1991; pp. 80‚Äì81 Cardinal Bertram of Breslau, the chairman of the German Conference of Bishops, developed a protest system which \\"satisfied the demands of the other bishops without annoying the regime\\". Firmer resistance by Catholic leaders gradually reasserted itself by the individual actions of leading churchmen like Joseph Frings, Konrad von Preysing, August von Galen and Michael von Faulhaber. Bishop Konrad von Preysing was Bishop of Berlin, the capital city of Nazi Germany. He provided aid to the city's Jews and had links to the German Resistance. Among the most firm and consistent of senior Catholics to oppose the Nazis was Bishop Konrad von Preysing. Preysing was appointed as Bishop of Berlin in 1935.Richard Bonney Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936-1939; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 ; pp. 29-30 Preysing was loathed by Hitler, who said \\"the foulest of carrion are those who come clothed in the cloak of humility and the foulest of these Count Presying! What a beast!\\".Richard Bonney Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936‚Äì1939; International Academic Publishers; Bern; 2009 ; pp. 29‚Äì30 Von Preysing opposed the appeasing attitudes of Cardinal Bertram towards the Nazis and spoke out in public sermons and argued the case for firm opposition at bishops' conferences. He also worked with leading members of the resistance Carl Goerdeler and Helmuth James Graf von Moltke. He was part of the five-member commission that prepared the papal encyclical Mit brennender Sorge anti-Nazi encyclical of March 1937.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; pp. 58‚Äì59Konrad Graf von Preysing; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 In 1938, he became one of the co- founders of the Hilfswerk beim Bisch√∂flichen Ordinariat Berlin (Welfare Office of the Berlin Diocese Office). He extended care to both baptised and unbaptised Jews and protested the Nazi euthanasia programme. While Bishop von Preysing was protected from Nazi retaliation by his position, his cathedral administrator and confidant Bernard Lichtenberg, was not.Bernhard Lichtenberg; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 Fr. Bernard Lichtenberg served at St. Hedwig's Cathedral from 1932, and was under the watch of the Gestapo for his courageous support of prisoners and Jews. Lichtenberg ran Bishop von Preysing of Berlin's aid unit (the Hilfswerke beim Bisch√∂flichen Ordinariat Berlin) which secretly assistance to those who were being persecuted by the regime.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; From the Kristallnacht pogrom of November 1938 onward, Lichtenberg closed each nightly service with a prayer for \\"the Jews, and the poor prisoners in the concentration camps\\", including \\"my fellow priests there\\".Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.60 On 23 October 1942, he offered a prayer for the Jews being deported to the East, telling his congregation to extend to the Jew's the commandment of Christ to \\"Love thy neighbour\\". For preaching against Nazi propaganda and writing a letter of protest concerning Nazi euthanasia, he was arrested in 1941, sentenced to two years penal servitude, and died en route to Dachau Concentration Camp in 1943. He was subsequently honoured by Yad Vashem as Righteous among the Nations. Among the German laity, Gertrud Luckner, was among the first to sense the genocidal inclinations of the Hitler regime and to take national action.Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930-1965; Indiana University Press; p.116-117 A pacifist and member of the German Catholics' Peace Association, she had been supporting victims of political persecution since 1933 and from 1938 worked at the head office of the German Association of Catholic Charitable Organizations, \\"Caritas\\". Using international contacts she secured safe passage abroad for many refugees. She organized aid circles for Jews, assisted many to escape.Gertrud Luckner; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 She cooperated with the priests Lichtenberg and Alfred Delp. Following the outbreak of the war, she continued her work for the Jews through Caritas' war relief office - attempting to establish a national underground network through Caritas cells. She personally investigated the fate of the Jews being transported to the East and managed to obtain information on prisoners in concentration camps, and obtain clothing, food and money for forced labourers and prisoners of war. Caritas secured safe emigration for hundreds of converted Jews, but Luckner was unable to organise an effective national underground network. She was arrested in 1943 and only narrowly escaped death in the concentration camps. Margarete Sommer had been sacked from her welfare institute for refusing to teach the Nazi line on sterilization. In 1935, she took up a position at the Episcopal Diocesan Authority in Berlin, counselling victims of racial persecution for Caritas Emergency Relief. In 1941 she became director of the Welfare Office of the Berlin Diocesan Authority, under Bernhard Lichtenberg.Margarete Sommer; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 Following Lichtenberg's arrest, Sommer reported to Bishop Konrad von Preysing. While working for the Welfare Office, Sommer coordinated Catholic aid for victims of racial persecution - giving spiritual comfort, food, clothing, and money. She gathered intelligence on the deportations of the Jews, and living conditions in concentration camps, as well as on SS firing squads, writing several reports on these topics from 1942, including an August 1942 report which reached Rome under the title \\"Report on the Exodus of the Jews\\". Josef Frings became Archbishop of Cologne in 1942. In his sermons, he repeatedly spoke in support of persecuted peoples and against state repression. In March 1944, Frings attacked arbitrary arrests, racial persecution and forced divorces. That autumn, he protested to the Gestapo against the deportations of Jews from Cologne and surrounds.Josef Frings; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013 In 1943, the German bishops had debated whether to directly confront Hitler collectively over what they knew of the murdering of Jews. Frings wrote a pastoral letter cautioning his diocese not to violate the inherent rights of others to life, even those \\"not of our blood\\" and even during war, and preached in a sermon that \\"no one may take the property or life of an innocent person just because he is a member of a foreign race\\". The Papacy =Pius XI and the prelude to the Holocaust= In the 1930s, Pope Pius XI urged Mussolini to ask Hitler to restrain the anti- Semitic actions taking place in Germany.Paul O'Shea; A Cross Too Heavy; Rosenberg Publishing; p. 230 In 1937, he issued the Mit brennender Sorge () encyclical, in which he asserted the inviolability of human rights.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.58 It was written partly in response to the Nuremberg Laws, and condemned racial theories and the mistreatment of people based on race.William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p234-5 It repudiated Nazi racial theory and the \\"so- called myth of race and blood\\". It denounced \\"Whomever exalts race, or the people, or the State ... above their standard value and divinizes them to an idolatrous level\\"; spoke of divine values independent of \\"space country and race\\" and a Church for \\"all races\\"; and said \\"None but superficial minds could stumble into concepts of a national God, of a national religion; or attempt to lock within the frontiers of a single people, within the narrow limits of a single race, God, the Creator of the universe.Mit Brennender Sorge; papal encyclical of Pius XI The document noted on the horizon the \\"threatening storm clouds\\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany.

Spiritually we are Semites.\\"Martin Gilbert; Kristallnacht - Prelude to Disaster; HarperPress; 2006; p.137 Following the November Kristallnacht of that year, Pius XI condemned the pogrom, sparking mass demonstrations against Catholics and Jews in Munich, where the Bavarian Gauleiter Adolf Wagner declared: \\"Every utterance the Pope makes in Rome is an incitement of the Jews throughout the world to agitate against Germany\\". The Vatican took steps to find refuge for Jews. On 21 November, in an address to the world's Catholics, Pius XI rejected the Nazi claim of racial superiority, and insisted instead that there was only a single human race. The Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo, the Pope's summer residence, was used to shelter Jews fleeing the Nazi roundups in Italy =Pius XII and the war= Pius XII succeeded Pius XI on the eve of war in 1939. He was to employ diplomacy to aid the victims of the Holocaust, and directed his Church to provide discreet aid to Jews. His encyclicals such as Summi Pontificatus and Mystici corporis spoke against racism ‚Äîwith specific reference to Jews: \\"there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision\\".Pius XII, Summi Pontificatus; 48; October 1939. Summi Pontificatus Summi Pontificatus first papal encyclical followed the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland, and reiterated Catholic teaching against racism and anti-Semitism and affirmed the ethical principles of the \\"Revelation on Sinai\\". Pius reiterated Church teaching on the \\"principle of equality\\" - with specific reference to Jews: \\"there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision\\". The forgetting of solidarity \\"imposed by our common origin and by the equality of rational nature in all men\\" was called \\"pernicious error\\". Catholics everywhere were called upon to offer \\"compassion and help\\" to the victims of the war. The letter also decried the deaths of noncombatants. Local bishops were instructed to assist those in need. Pius went on to make a series of general condemnations of racism and genocide through the course of the war.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: Pius XII; web Apr 2013 Pope's 1942 Christmas address After the invasion of the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany commenced its industrialised mass murder of the Jews, around late 1941/early 1942. Pius XII employed diplomacy to aid the victims of the Holocaust, and directed his Church to provide discreet aid to Jews. At Christmas 1942, once evidence of the mass slaughter of the Jews had emerged, Pius XII voiced concern at the murder of \\"hundreds of thousands\\" of \\"faultless\\" people because of their \\"nationality or race\\" and intervened to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, he refused to say more \\"fearing that public papal denunciations might provoke the Hitler regime to brutalize further those subject to Nazi terror ‚Äî as it had when Dutch bishops publicly protested earlier in the year‚Äîwhile jeopardizing the future of the church\\". Regardless, the Nazi authorities were distressed by the papal intervention. The Reich Security Main Office, responsible for the deportation of Jews, noted:Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.308 Italy In Italy, where the Pope's direct influence was strongest, under Mussolini, no policy of abduction of Jews had been implemented in Italy. Following the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Nazi forces invaded and occupied much of the country, and began deportations of Jews to extermination camps. Pius XII protested at diplomatic levels, while several thousand Jews found refuge in Catholic networks, institutions and homes across Italy - including in the Vatican City and Pope Pius' Summer Residence. Anti- Semitism had not been a founding principle of Italian Fascism, although Mussolini's regime moved closer to Hitler with time. On 27 June 1943, Vatican Radio is reported to have broadcast a papal injunction: \\"He who makes a distinction between Jews and other men is being unfaithful to God and is in conflict with God's commands\\". In July 1943, with the Allies advancing from the south, Mussolini was overthrown, and on 1 September, the new government agreed an armistice with the Allies. The Germans occupied much of the country, commencing an effort to deport the nation's Jews.Italy Historical Background; Yad Vashem; retrieved 1 September 2013 According to Sir Martin Gilbert, when the Nazis came to Rome in search of Jews, Pius had already \\"A few days earlier... personally ordered the Vatican clergy to open the sanctuaries of the Vatican City to all \\"non-Aryans\\" in need of refuge. By morning of October 16, a total of 477 Jews had been given shelter in the Vatican and its enclaves, while another 4,238 had been given sanctuary in the many monasteries and convents of in Rome. Only 1,015 of Rome's 6,730 Jews were seized that morning\\".Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; pp.622-623 The Pope had helped the Jews of Rome in September, by offering whatever amounts of gold might be needed towards the 50 kg ransom demanded by the Nazis. Upon receiving news of the roundups on the morning of 16 October, the Pope immediately instructed Cardinal Secretary of State, Cardinal Maglione, to make a protest to the German ambassador to the Vatican, Ernst von Weizsacker: \\"Maglione did so that morning, making it clear to the ambassador that the deportation of Jews was offensive to the Pope. In urging Weizsacker 'to try to save these innocent people,' Maglione added: 'It is sad for the Holy Father, sad beyond imagination, that here in Rome, under the very eyes of the Common Father, that so many people should suffer only because they belong to a specific race.'\\" Following the meeting, Weizsacker gave orders for a halt to the arrests. Pius assisted various noted rescuers. From within the Vatican, and in co-operation with Pius XII, Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, operated an escape operation for Jews and Allied escapees. In 2012, the Irish Independent Newspaper credited him with having saved more than 6,500 people during the war.Vatican's 'Scarlet Pimpernel' honoured; Majella O'Sullivan Irish Independent; 12 November 2012 Pietro Palazzini was an assistant vice rector in a pontifical seminary during the war, and is remembered by Israel for his efforts for Italian Jews during the war. He hid Michael Tagliacozzo on Vatican property for in 1943 and 1944, when the Nazis were rounding up Italian Jews and was recognised by Yad Vashem in 1985. Giovanni Ferrofino is credited with saving 10,000 Jews. Acting on secret orders from Pope Pius XII, Ferrofino obtained visas from the Portuguese Government and the Dominican Republic to secure their escape from Europe and sanctuary in the Americas. Pius provided funds to the Jewish refugees of Fiume saved by Giovanni Palatucci and to other rescue operations - to the French Capuchin Pierre-Marie Benoit of Marseille and others. When Archbishop Giovanni Montini (later Pope Paul VI) was offered an award for his rescue work by Israel, he said he had only been acting on the orders of Pius XII. Direct diplomatic interventions Pius XII allowed the national hierarchies of the Church to assess and respond to their local situation under Nazi rule, but himself established the Vatican Information Service to provide aid to, and information about, war refugees. He gave his blessing to the establishment of safe houses inside the Vatican and in monasteries and convents across Europe and oversaw a secret operation for priests to shelter Jews by means of fake documents - with some Jews made Vatican subjects to spare them from the Nazis. On papal instructions, 4000 Jews were hidden in Italian monasteries and convents, and 2000 Hungarian Jews given fake documents identifying them as Catholics. Pius' diplomatic representatives lobbied on behalf of Jews across Europe, including in Nazi allied Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovakia, Vichy France and elsewhere. The papal nuncios most active in the rescue of rescue of Jews included Angelo Roncalli (the future Pope John XXIII); and Angelo Rotta, Nuncio to Budapest, who enabled many Jews to survive and was recognised as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem; and Archbishop Andrea Cassulo, Nuncio in Romania, who appealed to the Antonescu regime to stop deportations of Jews, and received the same honour from Yad Vashem. Pius protested the deportations of Slovakian Jews to the Bratislava government from 1942. Giuseppe Burzio, the Apostolic Delegate to Bratislava, protested the anti- Semitic and totalitarianism of the Tiso regime.The Churches and the Deportation and Persecution of Jews in Slovakia; by Livia Rothkirchen; Vad Yashem. Pius made a direct intervention in Hungary to lobby for an end to Jewish deportations in 1944, and on July 4, the Hungarian leader, Admiral Horthy, told Berlin's representative that deportations of Jews must cease, citing protests by the Vatican, the King of Sweden and the Red Cross for his decision. The pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic Arrow Cross seized power in October, and a campaign of murder of the Jews commenced. The neutral powers led a major rescue effort and Pius' representative, Angelo Rotta took the lead in establishing an \\"international Ghetto\\", around which the Swiss, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish and Vatican legations affixed their emblems, providing shelter for some 25,000 Jews.Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.337 Vatican diplomats Vatican neutrality through the war permitted the Holy See's network of diplomats to continue to operate throughout the occupied territories of the Nazi Empire, enabling the dissemination of intelligence back to Rome, and diplomatic interventions on behalf of the victims of the conflict. Pius' diplomatic representatives lobbied on behalf of Jews across Europe, including in Nazi allied Vichy France, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovakia, Germany itself and elsewhere.Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust: 1930‚Äì1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p85 Many papal nuncios played important roles in the rescue of Jews, among them Giuseppe Burzio, the Vatican Charg√© d'Affaires in Slovakia, Filippo Bernardini, Nuncio to Switzerland and Angelo Roncalli, the nuncio to Turkey.Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930‚Äì1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.83 Angelo Rotta, the wartime Papal Nuncio to Budapest and Andrea Cassulo, the Papal Nuncio to Bucharest have been recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority. ;Vichy France With the Nazi Empire around its full extent in late 1942, the Nazis sought to extend their roundups of Jews, and resistance began to spread. In Lyon, Cardinal Gerlier had defiantly refused to hand over Jewish children being sheltered in Catholic homes, and on 9 September, it was reported in London that Vichy French authorities had ordered the arrest of all Catholic priests sheltering Jews in the unoccupied zone. Eight Jesuits were arrested for sheltering hundreds of children on Jesuit properties, and Pius XII's Secretary of State, Cardinal Maglione informed the Vichy Ambassador to the Vatican that \\"the conduct of the Vichy government towards Jews and foreign refugees was a gross infraction\\" of the Vichy government's own principles, and \\"irreconcilable with the religious feelings which Marshal Petain had so often invoked in his speeches\\".Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; p.451 ; Croatia Germany, Italy, Bulgaria and Hungary dismembered Yugoslavia in April 1941.Hebblethwaite, 1993, p .153 In regions controlled by Italy, the Italian authorities protected Jews from Nazi roundups, as occurred throughout Italian territory. Martin Gilbert wrote that when negotiations began for the deportation of Jews from the Italian zone, General Roatta flatly refused, leading Hitler's envoy, Siegfried Kasche, to report some of Mussolini's subordinates \\"apparently been influenced\\" by opposition in the Vatican to German anti-Semitism.Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; p. 466. Most of Croatia fell to the new Independent State of Croatia, where Ante Paveliƒá's Usta≈°e were installed in power. Unlike Hitler, Pavelic was pro-Catholic, but their ideologies overlapped sufficiently for easy co-operation.Phayer, 2000, p. 32 The Vatican refused formal recognition of the new state, but sent a Benedictine abbot, Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone, as apostolic visitor. Gilbert wrote, \\"In the Croatian capital of Zagreb, as a result of intervention by [Marcone] on behalf of Jewish partners in mixed marriages, a thousand Croat Jews survived the war\\". While the Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, who in 1941 welcomed Croat independence, \\"subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and saved a group of Jews in an old age home\\". A number of Catholic Croat nationalists collaborated in the anti-Semitic policies of the regime. Pavelic told Nazi Foreign Minister Ribbentrop that, while the lower clergy supported the Ustase, the bishops, and particularly Stepinac, were opposed to the movement because of \\"Vatican international policy\\".Hebblethwaite, 1993, p.157 In the spring of 1942, following a meeting with Pius XII in Rome, Stepinac declared publicly that it was \\"forbidden to exterminate Gypsies and Jews because they are said to belong to an inferior race\\".Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930‚Äì1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.38 The Apostolic delegate to Turkey, Angelo Roncalli, saved a number of Croatian Jews - as well as Bulgarian and Hungarian Jews - by assisting their migration to Palestine. Roncalli succeeded Pius XII as Pope John XXIII, and always said that he had been acting on the orders of Pius XII in his actions to rescue Jews.Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust: 1930‚Äì1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p86 ;Slovakia Slovakia was a rump state formed by Hitler when Germany annexed the western half of Czechoslovakia.Shirer, 1990, pp. 358‚Äì59 The small agricultural region had a predominantly Catholic population, and became a nominally independent state, with a Catholic priest, Jozef Tiso as president and the extreme- nationalist Vojtech Tuka Tuka as Prime Minister.Evans, 2008, p. 395 Slovakia, under Tiso and Tuka had power over 90,000 Jews. Like the Nazis other main allies, Petain, Mussolini, and Horthy - Tiso did not share the racist hardline on Jews held by Hitler and radicals within his own government, but held a more traditional, conservative antisemitism.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; pp.393 His regime was nonetheless highly antisemitic.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; pp.394 Giuseppe Burzio, the Apostolic Delegate to Bratislava, protested against the anti-Semitic and totalitarianism of the Tiso regime. In February 1942, Tiso agreed to begin deportations of Jews and Slovakia became the first Nazi ally to agree to deportations under the framework of the Final Solution.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; p.394 Later in 1942, amid Vatican protests as news of the fate of the deportees filtered back, and the German advance into Russia was halted, Slovakia became the first of Hitler's puppet states to shut down the deportations.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; p.395 Pope Pius XII protested the deportations of Slovakian Jews to the Bratislava government from 1942. Burzio also lobbied the Slovakian government directly.Phayer, p. 89 The Vatican called in the Slovak ambassador twice to enquire what was happening. These interventions, wrote Evans, \\"caused Tiso, who after all was still a priest in holy orders, to have second thoughts about the programme\\".Evans, 2008, pp. 397 Burzio and others reported to Tiso that the Germans were murdering the deported Jews. Tiso hesitated and then refused to deport Slovakia's 24,000 remaining Jews. When the transportation began again in 1943 Burzio challenged Prime Minister Tuka over the extermination of Slovak Jews. The Vatican condemned the renewal of the deportations on 5 May and the Slovakian episcopate issued a pastoral letter condemning totalitarianism and anti- Semitism on 8 May 1943. Pius protested that \\"The Holy See would fail in its Divine Mandate if it did not deplore these measures, which gravely damage man in his natural right, mainly for the reason that these people belong to a certain race.\\" Mark Mazower wrote: \\"When the Vatican protested, the government responded with defiance: 'There is no foreign intervention which would stop us on the road to the liberation of Slovakia from Jewry', insisted President Tiso\\".Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire - Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; p.396 Distressing scenes at railway yards of deportees being beaten by Hlinka guards had spurred community protest, including from leading churchmen such as Bishop Pavol Jantausch.Evans, 2008, pp. 396‚Äì397 According to Mazower \\"Church pressure and public anger resulted in perhaps 20,000 Jews being granted exemptions, effectively bringing the deportations there to an end\\". \\"Tuka\\", wrote Evans, was \\"forced to backtrack by public protests, especially from the Church, which by this time had been convinced of the fate that awaited the deportees. Pressure from the Germans, including a direct confrontation between Hitler and Tiso on 22 April 1943, remained without effect.\\"Evans, 2008, p. 397 When in 1943 rumours of further deportations emerged, the Papal Nuncio in Istanbul, Msgr. Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII) and Burzio helped galvanize the Holy See into intervening in vigorous terms. On April 7, 1943, Burzio challenged Tuka, over the extermination of Slovak Jews. The Vatican condemned the renewal of the deportations on 5 May and the Slovakian episcopate issued a pastoral letter condemning totalitarianism and antisemitism on 8 May 1943. Roncalli saved thousands of Slovakian Jews by signing visas for immigration to Palestine, crediting this work to the orders of Pope Pius XII. In August 1944, the Slovak National Uprising rose against the People's Party regime. German troops were sent to quell the rebellion and with them came security police charged with rounding up Slovakia's remaining Jews. Burzio begged Tiso directly to at least spare Catholic Jews from transportation and delivered an admonition from the Pope: \\"the injustice wrought by his government is harmful to the prestige of his country and enemies will exploit it to discredit clergy and the Church the world over.\\" ;Bulgaria Bulgaria signed a pact with Hitler in 1941 and reluctantly joined the Axis powers. Mgr Angelo Roncalli - then Papal Nuncio in Turkey, later Pope John XXIII - was among those who lobbied King Boris for the protection of Jewish families. The King effectively thwarted Hitler's plans for the extermination of Bulgaria's Jews, and at war's end, Bulgaria had a larger Jewish population than it had had at the outset. In 1943, Pius instructed his Bulgarian representative to take \\"all necessary steps\\" to support Bulgarian Jews facing deportation and his Turkish nuncio, Angelo Roncalli arranged for the transfer of thousands of children out of Bulgaria to Palestine. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church lobbied firmly against the deportations of Jews, and in March 1943, the King rescinded the order to deport them, and released Jews already in custody - an event known in Bulgaria as the \\"miracle of the Jewish people\\". ;Romania Andrea Cassulo served as Papal nuncio in Romania during the period of World War II. While the country was never occupied by Nazi Germany, the regime of Marshall Ion Antonescu aligned itself with Hitler, and assisted the Nazi Holocaust. Cassulo has been honoured as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. In his study of the rescuers of Jews, Gilbert wrote that, Cassulo \\"appealed directly to Marshall Antonescu to limit the deportations [of Jews to Nazi concentration camps] planned for the summer of 1942. His appeal was ignored; hundreds of thousands of Romanian Jews were transported to Transnistria.\\" Angelo Roncalli advised the Pope of Jewish concentration camps in Romanian occupied Transnistria. The Pope protested to the Romanian government and authorised for funds to be sent to the camps. In 1944, the Chief Rabbi of Bucharest praised the work of Cassulo and the Pope on behalf of Romania's Jews: \\"the generous assistance of the Holy See ... was decisive and salutary. It is not easy for us to find the right words to express the warmth and consolation we experienced because of the concern of the supreme Pontiff, who offered a large sum to relieve the sufferings of deported Jews ‚Äî sufferings which had been pointed out to him by you after your visit to Transnistria. The Jews of Romania will never forget these facts of historic importance.\\" ;Italy Following the Nazi occupation of Italy, when news of the 15 October 1943 round-up of Roman Jews reached the Pope, he instructed Cardinal Maglione to protest to the German Ambassador to \\"save these innocent people\\". On 16 October, the Vatican secured the release of 252 children. ;Hungary Memorial plaque to Papal Nuncio to Hungary, Angelo Rotta. Honoured as a Righteous Gentile, he was active in saving Hungarian Jews. Hungary joined the Axis Powers in 1940. Its leader, Admiral Horthy later wavered in support for the Nazi alliance. The Nazis occupied Hungary in March 1944, soon after Horthy, under significant pressure from the church and diplomatic community, had halted the deportations of Hungarian Jews. In October, they installed a pro-Nazi Arrow Cross Dictatorship. In 1943, the Hungarian resistor, Margit Slachta, of the Hungarian Social Service Sisterhood, went to Rome to encourage papal action against the Jewish persecutions. In Hungary, she had sheltered the persecuted and protested forced labour and antisemitism. In 1944 Pius appealed directly to the Hungarian government to halt the deportation of the Jews of Hungary and his nuncio, Angelo Rotta, led a citywide rescue scheme in Budapest. The Jews of the Hungarian provinces were decimated by the Nazis and their Fascist Hungarian allies, but many of the Jews of Budapest were saved by the extraordinary efforts of the diplomatic corps. Angelo Rotta, Papal Nuncio from 1930, actively protested Hungary's mistreatment of the Jews, and helped persuade Pope Pius XII to lobby the Hungarian leader Admiral Horthy to stop their deportation. Like the celebrated Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Rotta became a leader of diplomatic actions to protect Hungarian Jews. With the help of the Hungarian Holy Cross Association, he issued protective passports for Jews and 15,000 safe conduct passes - the nunciature sheltered some 3000 Jews in safe houses. An \\"International Ghetto\\" was established, including more than 40 safe houses marked by the Vatican and other national emblems. 25,000 Jews found refuge in these safe houses. Elsewhere in the city, Catholic institutions hid several thousand more Jewish people.Hitler's Pope? ; by Sir Martin Gilbert, The American Spectator According to Gilbert, \\"With Arrow Cross members killing Jews in the streets of Budapest, Angelo Rotta, the senior Vatican representative in Budapest, took a lead in establishing an \\"International Ghetto\\", consisting of several dozen modern apartment buildings to which large numbers of Jews - eventually 25,000 - were brought and to which the Swiss, Swedish, Portuguese, and Spanish legations, as well as the Vatican, affixed their emblems.\\" Rotta also got permission from the Vatican to begin issuing protective passes to Jewish converts - and was eventually able to distribute more than 15,000 such protective passes, while instructing the drafters of the documents not to examine the recipients credentials too closely. A Red Cross official asked Rotta for pre-signed blank identity papers, to offer to the sick and needy fleeing the Arrow Cross, and was given the documents, along with Rotta's blessing. Rotta encouraged Hungarian church leaders to help their \\"Jewish brothers\\", and directed Fr Tibor Baranszky to go to the forced marches and distribute letters of immunity to as many Jews as he could. Baranszky, was executive secretary of the Jewish Protection Movement of the Holy See in Hungary, and was also honoured by Yad Vashem as a Righteous Gentil for saving over 3,000 Jewish lives, acting on the orders of Pope Pius XII. On 15 November, the Hungarian Government established the \\"Big Ghetto\\" for 69,000, while a further 30,000 with protective documents went to the International Ghetto. On 19 November 1944, the Vatican joined the four other neutral powers - Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland - in a further collective protest to the Hungarian Government calling for the suspension of deportations. The government complied, and banned the \\"death marches\\" - but Budapest was by that stage near anarchy, and deportations continued from 21 November. The Arrow Cross continued their orgy of violence, raiding the international Ghetto and murdering Jews, as Soviet forces approached the city. Rotta and Wallenberg were among the few diplomats to remain in Budapest. Following the Soviet conquest of the city, Wallenberg was seized by the Russians and taken to Moscow, from where he was never released. Gilbert wrote that of the hundred and fifty thousand Jews who had been in Budapest when the Germans arrived in March 1944, almost 120,000 survived to liberation - 69,000 from the Big Ghetto, 25,000 in the International Ghetto and a further 25,000 hiding out in Christian homes and religious institutes across the city. =Assessments of Pius XII= According to Paul O'Shea, \\"The Nazis demonised the Pope as the agent of international Jewry; the Americans and British were continually frustrated because he would not condemn Nazi aggression; and the Russians accused him of being an agent of Fascism and the Nazis.\\"Paul O'Shea; A Cross Too Heavy; Rosenberg Publishing; 2008; pp. 40‚Äì41 Pinchas Lapide, a Jewish theologian and Israeli diplomat to Milan in the 1960s, estimated in Three Popes and the Jews that Pius \\"was instrumental in saving at least 700,000 but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands.\\"Lapide, Pinchas. Three Popes and the Jews, 1967, quoted in Dalin, 2005, p. 11 Some historians, like Gilbert, have questioned this. Upon the death of Pius XII in 1958, the Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir said: \\"When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, the voice of the Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict. We mourn a great servant of peace.\\" Leading historian of the Holocaust, Sir Martin Gilbert, has said that Pope Pius XII should be declared a \\"righteous gentile\\" by Yad Vashem. But his insistence on Vatican neutrality and avoidance of naming the Nazis as the evildoers of the conflict became the foundation for contemporary and later criticisms from some quarters.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: \\"Roman Catholicism - the period of the world wars\\". Hitler biographer John Toland, while scathing of Pius' cautious public comments in relation to the mistreatment of Jews, concluded that nevertheless, \\"The Church, under the Pope's guidance, had already saved the lives of more Jews than all other churches, religious institutions and rescue organizations combined...\\".John Toland; Hitler; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; p. 760 In 1999, journalist John Cornwell's controversial book Hitler's Pope criticised Pius XII for his actions and inactions during the Holocaust. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica described Cornwell's depiction of Pius XII as anti-Semitic as lacking \\"credible substantiation\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online - Reflections on the Holocaust; web 26 Apr 2013 In specific riposte to Cornwell's moniker, American Rabbi and historian, David Dalin, published The Myth of Hitler's Pope: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews from the Nazis in 2005. He reaffirmed previous accounts of Pius having been a saviour of thousands of Europe's Jews. Dalin's book also argued that Cornwell and others were liberal Catholics and ex- Catholics who \\"exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today\\" and that Pius XII was responsible for saving the lives of many thousands of Jews.Dalin, 2005, p. 3 Susan Zuccotti's Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy (2000) and Michael Phayer's The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930‚Äì1965 (2000) and Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War (2008) provided further critical, though more scholarly analysis of Pius's legacy. Daniel Goldhagen's A Moral Reckoning and David Kerzer's The Pope Against the Jews denounced Pius, while Ralph McInery and Jos√© Sanchez wrote more nuanced critical assessments of Pius XII's pontificate.The Pope was wrong; by Andrew Roberts; The Spectator; 16 July 2008 A number of other scholars replied with favourable accounts of the Pius XII, including Margherita Marchione's Yours Is a Precious Witness: Memoirs of Jews and Catholics in Wartime Italy (1997), Pope Pius XII: Architect for Peace (2000) and Consensus and Controversy: Defending Pope Pius XII (2002); Pierre Blet's Pius XII and the Second World War, According to the Archives of the Vatican (1999); and Ronald J.

Ecclesiastical historian William Doino (author of The Pius War: Responses to the Critics of Pius XII), concluded that Pius was \\"emphatically not silent\\".Sparks fly at Pius XII debate in London; Catholic Herald; 23 November 2012. Episcopal protests Various bishops protested the Nazi mistreatment of Jews. =The Netherlands= On July 11, 1942, the Dutch bishops, joined all Christian denominations in sending a letter to the Nazi General Friedrich Christiansen in protest against the treatment of Jews. The letter was read in all Catholic churches against German opposition. It brought attention to mistreatment of Jews and asked all Christians to pray for them: The protest angered the Nazi authorities and deportations of Jews only increased - including Catholic converts. Many Catholics were involved in strikes and protests against the treatment of Jews, and the Nazis offered to exempt converts and Jews married to non-Jews if protests ceased. The Archbishop of Utrecht and other Catholics refused to comply, and the Nazis commenced a round up of all ethnically Jewish Catholics. Some 40,000 Jews were hidden by the Dutch church and 49 priests killed in the process. Among the Catholics of the Netherlands abducted in this way was Saint Edith Stein who died at Auchwitz. =France= The French bishops were initially cautious in speaking out against mistreatment of Jews. Cardinal Gerlier said that the treatment of the Jews was bad, but did not take effective action to pressure the Vichy Government.Lucien Steinberg, Jewish Rescue Operations in Belgium and France; published by Yad Vashem. Following the Velodrom d'Hiver roundup of Jews of July 15, 1942, the Northern assembly of cardinals and archbishops sent a protest letter to P√©tain. With the free press silenced, Charles Lederman, a Jewish Communist approached the Archbishop of Toulouse, Jules-G√©raud Sali√®ge, to alert public opinion to what was being done to the Jews. He told Sali√®ge of the arrests, kidnappings and deportations. Sali√®ge read his famous Pastoral letter the following Sunday. Other bishops - Monseigneur Th√©as, Bishop of Montauban, Monseigneur Delay, Bishop of Marseilles, Cardinal Gerlier, Archbishop of Lyon, Monseigneur Vansteenberghe of Bayonne and Monseigneur Moussaron, Archbishop of Albi - also denounced the roundups from the pulpit and through parish distributions, in defiance of the Vichy regime. The protest of the bishops is seen by various historians as a turning point in the formerly passive response of the Catholic Church in France. Archbishop Sali√®ge of Toulouse wrote to his parishioners: \\"The Jews are real men and women. Not everything is permitted against these men and women, against these fathers and mothers. They are part of the human species. They are our brothers like so many others. A Christian should not forget this\\". The words encouraged other clerics like the Capuchin monk P√®re Marie-Beno√Æt, who saved many Jews in Marseille and later in Rome where he became known among the Jewish community as \\"father of the Jews\\". Marie-Rose Gineste transported a pastoral letter from Bishop Th√©as of Montauban by bicycle to forty parishes, denouncing the uprooting of men and women \\"treated as wild animals\\", and the French Resistance smuggled the text to London, where it was broadcast to France by the BBC, reaching tens of thousands of homes. =Belgium= Cardinal van Roey, the head of the Catholic Church in Belgium intervened with the authorities to rescue Jews, and encouraged various institutions to aid Jewish children. One of his acts of rescue was to open a geriatric centre in which Jews were housed, at which kosher Jewish cooks would be required who could therefore be given special passes protecting them from deportation. =Croatia= In Croatia, the Vatican's apostolic visitor Giuseppe Marcone, together with Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac of Zagreb pressured the Paveliƒá regime to cease its facilitation of race murders.Phayer p85 In the Spring of 1942, following a meeting with Pius XII in Rome, Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac of Zagreb declared publicly that it was \\"forbidden to exterminate Gypsies and Jews because they are said to belong to an inferior race\\". In July and October 1943, Stepinac denounced race murders in the most explicit terms, and had his denunciation read from pulpits across Croatia.Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust 1930‚Äì1965; Indiana University Press; 2000; p.46 When Schutzstaffel chief Heinrich Himmler visited Zagreb in 1943, indicating the impending roundup of remaining Jews, Stepinac wrote Pavelic that if this occurred, he would protest for \\"the Catholic Church is not afraid of any secular power, whatever it may be, when it has to protect basic human values\\". When deportatation began, Stepinac and Marcone protested to Andrija Artukovic. According to Phayer, the Vatican ordered Stepinac to save as many Jews as possible during the upcoming roundup. Though Stepinac personally saved many potential victims, his protests had little effect on Paveliƒá. =Slovakia= Bishop Pavel Gojdic protested the persecution of Slovak Jews. Gojdic was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2001 and recognised as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in 2007. Bishop Pavel Gojdic; published by Yad Vashem =Hungary= In Hungary, the Vatican and the Papal Nuncio Angelo Rotta lobbied the Horthy government to protect the country's Jews, while leading church figures involved in the 1944 rescue of Hungarian Jews included Bishops Vilmos Apor, Endre Hamvas and √Åron M√°rton. Primate J√≥zsef Mindszenty issued public and private protests and was arrested on 27 October 1944. Following the October 1944 Arrow Cross takeover of Hungary, Bishop Vilmos Apor (who had been an active protester against the mistreatment of the Jews), together with other senior clergy including J√≥zsef Mindszenty, drafted a memorandum of protest against the Arrow Cross government. Cardinal Jusztini√°n Gy√∂rgy Ser√©di also spoke out against the Nazi persecution. Catholic networks Direct action by Catholic institutions saved hundreds of thousands of Jews during the Nazi Holocaust. Priests and nuns of orders like the Jesuits, Franciscans and Benedictines hid children in monasteries, convents and schools. In Poland, the unique Zegota organisation rescued thousands, while In France, Belgium, and Italy, underground networks run by Catholic clergy and lay people were particularly active and saved thousands of Jews - particularly in southern France, and in northern Italy. =Netherlands = Edith Stein (ca. 1938-1939) During the Nazi Occupation of the Netherlands, when Jewish deportations began, many were hidden in Catholic areas. Parish priests created networks for hiding Jews and close knit country parishes were able to hide Jews without being informed upon by neighbours, as occurred in the cities. Gilbert wrote, \\"as in every country under German occupation, so in Holland, local priests played a major part in rescuing Jews\\". Archbishop De Jong played a major role in the resistance against the Nazis. He kept address info on hidden Jewish children in the vaults of his palace. Also, the RC church protested regularly against the persecution of Jews in Holland. That sometimes led to persecution of converted Jews, such as sister Edith Stein. In the province of Limburg, 88 priest were deported and killed - more than from the Dutch other provinces together. https://www.1limburg.nl/oud-bisschop-88-priesters-door-nazis-gedeporteerd. Some priests were killed during their arrests, such as father in Den Bosch. Relatively, the Dutch received the most recognitions per capita from Yad Vashem for saving Jews compared to all other occupied countries, namely some 5,900 on a total of 26,000 (the Poles received more with 6,200). =Belgium= Dislike of Germans and Nazism was strong in Belgium, and self-help by Jews was well organised. Following the occupation of Belgium, the Belgian Catholic Church played an important role in the defence of Jews. About 3000 Jews were hidden in Belgian convents during the Nazi occupation. 48 Belgian nuns have been honoured as Righteous among the Nations. Others so honoured include the Superior General of the Jesuits, Jean-Baptiste Janssens. Many Belgian convents and monasteries sheltered Jewish children, pretending that they were Christian - among them the Franciscan Sisters in Bruges, the Sisters of Don Bosco in Courtrai, the Sisters of St Mary near Brussels, the Dominican Sisters at Lubbeek and others. Fr Joseph Andre of Namur found shelter for around 100 children in convents, returning them to Jewish community leaders after the war. Andre was very active in the rescue of Jews, handing over his own bed to Jewish refugees, and finding families to hide them, and distributing food as well as communications between families. He is credit with saving some 200 lives, and was forced into hiding in the final stages of the war. The Benedictine monk, Dom Bruno (Henri Reynders), was active with the Belgian Resistance and organised escape routes for downed allied pilots and for Belgian Jews. Jews were hidden in monasteries, schools and the homes of Catholics at Dom Bruno's request. He was declared Righteous Among the Nations by Israel in 1964. He is credited with finding refuge for 320 Jewish children, and developed a disdain for Nazi anti-Semitism when exposed to it on a 1938 visit to Germany. He was captured as a prisoner of war while serving as an army chaplain in 1940, and in 1942 was sent by the head of the Benedictines to a Home for the Blind, operating as a front for hiding Jews. From small beginnings assisting families, assisted by Albert Van den Berg Dom Bruno's rescue efforts grew, dispersing hundreds. Van den Berg secured refuge for the Grand Rabbi of Liege and his elderly parents at the Cappuchin Banneux home, cared for by monks. Bruno rejoined the Belgian Army as a chaplain after Liberation. The Belgian Resistance viewed the defence of Jews as a central part of its activities. The Comit√© de D√©fense des Juifs (CDJ) was formed to work for the defence of Jews in the summer of 1942, and of its eight founding members, seven were Jewish and one, Emile Hambresin was Catholic. Some of their rescue operations were overseen by the priests Joseph Andr√© and Dom Bruno. Among other institutions, the CDJ enlisted the help of monasteries and religious schools and hospitals. Yvonne N√®vejean of the Oeuvre Nationale de l'Enfance greatly assisted with the hiding of Jewish children. According to Gilbert, over four and a half thousands Jewish children were given refuge in Christian families, convents, boarding schools, orphanages and sanatoriums because of the efforts of N√®vejean. Among them were the sisters, (Rosa) Regina and (Stella) Estelle Feld of Antwerp. Their father, Abraham Feld, was arrested and sent directly to Auschwitz where he was murdered and cremated immediately on arrival. Their mother, Leah (Leni) Schwimmerova Felt, placed her daughter's in the care of nuns who helped hide them for the entire course of the war with farm families, in Catholic orphanages and schools. Leah was later arrested and taken to Auschwitz where she too was murdered. After the war, they were reunited with an uncle, Samuel Feld, who came from Scranton, PA to adopt them and bring them to the USA. The Queen Mother Elizabeth and L√©on Platteau of the Interior Ministry also made a stance to protect Jews. Fr. Hubert C√©lis of Halmaal was arrested for harbouring Jewish children, but was released after confronting his interrogator with the following words: \\"You are a Catholic, and have forgotten that the Virgin was a Jewess, that Christ was Jewish, that He commanded us to love and help one another... That He told us: 'I have given you an example so that you do as I have done'... You are a Catholic, and you do not understand what a priest is! You do not understand that a priest does not betray!\\". =Hungary= The Hungarian Regent, Admiral Horthy, though allied to Hitler, did not adopt Nazi racial ideology, and Hungarian Jews were not subject to deportations to death camps through 1942-3. The Nazis occupied Hungary in 1944, and commenced widescale deportations of Jews. The process began in with Jews sent to Ghettos, and though local leaders of the Catholic, Protestant Reform Churches tried to help the Jews, Jews from all across Hungary outside of Budapest were deported to Auchwitz. Blessed Sr S√°ra Salkah√°zi was shot for sheltering Jews in 1944. She was a member of Margit Slachta's Hungarian Sisters of Social Service As rumour spread of the murder of the deportees, the Hungarian Ministry for the Interior criticised clergymen for issuing fake baptismal certificates. On June 26, 1944, confirmation of the mass murder at Auchwitz spurred the neutral powers in Budapest - including the Vatican - into action, and sought to thwart Nazi efforts to exterminate the Jews, by issuing protective visas. The virulently anti-Semitic Arrow Cross seized power in October, and the murderous campaign against the Jews was re- opened. Papal Nunico Angelo Rotta led the neutral diplomats in establishing an \\"international Ghetto\\" under their protection. Rotta also encouraged Hungarian church leaders to help their \\"Jewish brothers\\", and directed Fr Tibor Baranszky to go to the forced marches and distribute letters of immunity to as many Jews as he could. Local church men and women were also prominent in rescue efforts. Jesuit Prior Jakab Raile is credited with saving around 150 in the Jesuit residence of the city. Margit Slachta of the Hungarian Social Service Sisterhood, told her sisters that the precepts of their faith demanded that they protect the Jews, even if it led to their own deaths. Slachta responded immediately to reports in 1940 of early displacement of Jews. When in 1941, 20,000 Jewish labourers were deported, Slachta protested to the wife of Admiral Horthy. Following the Nazi occupation, Slachta's sisters arranged baptisms in the hope it would spare people from deportation, sent food and supplies to the Jewish ghettos, and sheltered people in their convents. One of Slachta's sisters, The Blessed S√°ra Salkah√°zi, was among those captured sheltering the Jews, and executed. Slachta herself was beaten and only narrowly avoided execution. The sisters rescued probably more than 2000 Hungarian Jews. In his study of the rescuers of the Jews, Martin Gilbert recounts that the monks of the Champagnat Institute of the Order of Mary in Budapest took in 100 children and 50 parents as boarders. Discovered, the Jews were killed, and six monks tortured, but released. Similar numbers were protected and then discovered in the convents of the Sisters of the Divine Saviour and the Order of the Divine Love, with many of the Jews dragged out and murdered by the Arrow Cross. The prioress of the Sisters of the Eucharistic Union was captured and tortured for sheltering Jews in her hospital. Despite warnings, she resumed her rescue efforts in the apartment of the Prelate Arnold Pataky. Hundreds more Jews were saved at the Convent of the Good Shepherd, the home of the Sisters of Mercyof Szatmar and the Convent of Sacre Coeur. =Baltic States= In Lithuania, priests were active in the rescue of Jews, among them Fr Dambrauskas of Alsedziai (who acted against the wishes of his bishop), the Jesuit Bronius Paukstis, Fr Lapis from Siauliai and Fr Jonas Gylys of Varena, who delivered sermons against the killing of Jews, and sought to comfort Jews marked for murder. In Scandinavia, the Catholic presence was small, but here the Christian Churches firmly opposed the deportations of Jews - Church of Norway bishops gave stern warnings, and the Danish Churches published strong protests and urged their congregations to assist Jews. A unique operation in Denmark saw almost all of Denmark's Jews smuggled into Sweden and safety. = Poland and the Zegota Council to Aid Jews= Irena Sendlerowa, headed the children's section of ≈ªegota, the Council to Aid Jews, founded by Catholics Poland had the largest Jewish population in Europe before World War II. There were 3,500,000 Jews living in the Second Republic, about 10% of the general population. Between the German invasion of Poland in 1939, and the end of World War II, over 90% of Polish Jewry perished. Nevertheless, more Jews were rescued by Catholic Poles, than in any other nation. According to Davies, the number of Jews saved by Poles is conservatively estimated at 100,000‚Äì150,000. The number of sheltered Jews according to Lukas was \\"as high as 450,000\\" at one time. Professor Tomasz Strzembosz put the total number of Catholic Poles saving Jews at 1 million. Among the 108 Martyrs of World War II beatified in 1999 by Pope John Paul II,Terry Jones, Listing of the names of all 108 martyrs beatified 13 June 1999 by Pope John Paul II at Warsaw, Poland; CatholicForum.com via Internet Archive. prominent place belongs to religious people murdered by Nazi Germany for saving Jews. Several hundred Christian Poles were summarily shot in open pits for sheltering Jews in the vicinity of the S≈Çonim Ghetto along with their priest, Adam Sztark (pl). Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary were arrested and executed the following day for hiding Jewish children in their convent. Marta Kazimiera Wo≈Çowska (pl), the superior of the convent, and Ewa Bogumi≈Ça Noiszewska (pl), a doctor, were beatified by Pope John Paul II together with priest Adam Sztark. They were killed at the same time. In 2001, Sztark became the first Jesuit ever awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations by the state of Israel. He used to deliver food to the ghetto, purchased with cash donations from his parishioners. He also issued false certificates, personally sheltered Jewish refugees, and called upon all his congregation to help to save the ghetto residents.Rafa≈Ç Harlaf, O≈õwiadczenie z≈Ço≈ºone w 1946 r. dla ≈ªydowskiego Instytutu Historycznego (Deposition from 1946 for the Jewish Historical Institute, Warsaw). Info.Kalisz.pl via Internet Archive. The memorial at Belzec death camp commemorates 600,000 murdered Jews, and 1,500 Poles who tried to save Jews. To date, Catholic Poles have been honoured as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem - constituting the largest national contingent.Davies (2003), Rising '44, p. 594. Hundreds of clergymen and nuns were involved in aiding Poland's Jews during the war, though precise numbers are difficult to confirm. From 1941, such aid carried the death penalty. Up to 50,000 Poles were executed by Nazi Germany solely as penalty for saving Jews. Gilbert notes that, in relation to the development of Poland's Jewish rescue networks, Yisrael Gutman wrote that \\"One particular sector of the intelligentsia - comprising both men of progressive views and devout Catholics who worked with unrelenting devotion to rescue Jews - was of singular importance\\" and from these circles grew Zegota, the Council for the Assistance to the Jews. Blessed Sister Kratochwil tortured to death by Gestapo for trying to protect Jewish prisoners A number of Bishops provided aid to Polish Jews, notably Karol Niemira, the Bishop of Pinsk, who cooperated with the underground organization maintaining ties with the Jewish Ghetto and sheltered Jews in the Archbishop's residence. Oskar Schindler, a German Catholic businessman came to Poland, initially to profit from the German invasion. He went on to save many Jews, as dramatised in the film Schindler's List. Gilbert notes various Polish nuns honoured by Yad Vashem for sheltering Jews in their convents, and of the work of Polish priests in supplying fake baptismal certificates, of the work of parish priests like one of Nowt Dyor, who was tortured and beaten to death for protecting a Jewish girl, and Fr. Marceli Godlewski, who opened his crypt to Jews escaping the Ghetto. In Kolonia Wilenska, Sister Anna Borkowska hid men from the Jewish underground from the Vilna ghetto.A litany of World War Two saints; Jerusalem Post; 11 April 2008. The Jews of Warsaw, who prior to the war numbered some half a million people, were forced into the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940. By November 1941, the Nazi governor of the city had decreed that the death penalty would be applied with utmost severity to those sheltering or aiding Jews in any way. Matylda Getter, mother superior of the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary took the decision to offer shelter to any Jewish children who could escape the Ghetto. Getter's convent was located at the entrance to the Ghetto. When the Nazis commenced the clearing of the Ghetto in 1941, Getter took in many orphans and dispersed them among Family of Mary homes. As the Nazis began sending orphans to the gas chambers, Getter issued fake baptismal certificates, providing the children with false identities. Living in daily fear of the Germans, the Family of Mary rescued more than 750 Jews.Michael Phayer; The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930-1965; Indiana University Press; p.117- When AK Home Army Intelligence discovered the true fate of transports leaving the Jewish Ghetto, the Council to Aid Jews - Rada Pomocy ≈ªydom (codename Zegota) was established in late 1942, in co-operation with church groups. The organisation saved thousands. Emphasis was placed on protecting children, as it was near impossible to intervene directly against the heavily guarded transports. False papers were prepared, and children were distributed among safe houses and church networks.Davies (2003), Rising '44, p. 200. Jewish children were often placed in church orphanages and convents. Poland was the only country in occupied Europe where such an organisation was established. Zegota was instigated by the writer Zofia Kossak-Szczucka and Catholic democrat activists. Two women founded the movement, the Catholic writer and activist, Zofia Kossak-Szczucka, and the socialist Wanda Filipowicz. Some of its members have been involved in Polish nationalist movements who were themselves anti-Jewish, but who were appalled by the barbarity of the Nazi mass murders. In an emotive protest prior to the foundation of the Council, Kossak wrote that Hitler's race murders were a crime of which it was not possible to remain silent. While Polish Catholics might still feel Jews were \\"enemies of Poland\\", Kossak wrote that protest was required. Zofia Kossak-Szczucka, co-founder of Zegota. Wladyslawa Choms, \\"The Angel of Lvov\\", headed Zegota in Lvov, helped by the Church and the Home Army. She described the Catholic clergy as \\"invaluable\\" to the effort, for they supplied blank baptismal certificates from which to create false documents. Wladyslaw Bartoszewski (aka \\"Teofil\\"), a co-founder of Zegota, had worked with the Catholic underground movement, the Front for the Rebirth of Poland, and was arrested in a 1940 Nazi purge of the intelligentsia, and sent to Auchwitz. Freed seven months later following pressure from the international Red Cross, Bartoszewski helped Zegota in its rescue efforts. Explaining his motivation, he later said: \\"I was raised a Catholic and we were taught to love our neighbour. I was doing what the Bible taught.\\"‚ÄòI just did what the Bible said‚Äô, Catholic Herald, 25 February 2005. He was recognised as Righteous Among the Nations in 1963. As head of Zegota's children's section, Irena Sendlerowa placed more that two thousands five hundred Jewish children in convents, orphanages, schools, hospitals and homes. She was captured by the Gestapo in 1943, and crippled by torture. In the 1948-9 Zegota Case, the Stalin-backed regime established in Poland after the war secretly tried and imprisoned the leading survivors of Zegota, as part of a campaign to eliminate and besmirch Catholic resistance heroes who might threaten the new regime.Davies (2003), Rising '44, pp. 566, 568. Bartoszewski was imprisoned until 1954. =France= Many French clergy and religious have been honoured by Yad Vashem, and, wrote Gilbert \\"Many priests and nuns, and Catholic institutions throughout France did what they could to save Jews from deportation\\". The first deportation of Jews from Paris occurred on 27 March 1942. Mostly Polish-born, they were taken to Auchwitz. Deportations continued through the following months, and intensified in August. Gilbert wrote that, \\"Senior church figures took a leading role: just south of Lyons, Protestant and Catholic clerics, including Cardinal Gerlier, the Archbishop of Lyons, joined forces with Jewish resistance groups to ding hiding places for five hundred adults and more than a hundred children... Not only Cardinal Gerlier, but also his Secretary, Monsieigneur Jean-Baptiste Maury... were honoured [by Yad Vashem] for their acts of rescue.\\" Thousands of priests, monks, nuns, and lay people performed acts of charity toward the persecuted Jews of France. On 28 August 1942, the Germans ordered the arrest of all Catholic priests sheltering Jews. The Times reported that Cardinal Gerlier had defiantly refused to surrender Jewish children being sheltered in Catholic homes, and that multiple arrests had been made, including of Jesuits who had been sheltering hundreds of children. The Vatican denounced the treatment of Jews in France to the Vichy French ambassador to the Holy See. Monsignor Gabriel Piguet, the Bishop of Clermont- Ferrand, allowed Jewish children to be hidden from the Nazis at the Saint Marguerite Catholic boarding school in Clermont-Ferrand and was arrested in his Cathedral on 28 May 1944. He was deported to Dachau Concentration Camp in September. At Dachau, Piguet presided over the secret ordination of The Blessed Karl Leisner.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933-1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p.154-5. Two thirds of the 300,000 Jews living in France at the outbreak of war survived the Nazi holocaust. Thousands of priests, nuns and lay people acted to assist French Jews. The majority of French Jews survived the occupation, in large part thanks to the help received from Catholics and Protestants, who protected them in convents, boarding schools, presbyteries and families. The Amiti√©s Chr√©tiennes organisation operated out of Lyon to secure hiding places for Jewish children. Among its members were the Jesuit Pierre Chaillet and Alexandre Glasberg, a priest formerly of the Jewish faith. The influential French theologian Henri de Lubac was active in the resistance to Nazism and to antisemitism. He assisted in the publication of T√©moinage chr√©tien with Pierre Chaillet. He responded to Neo- paganism and antisemitism with clarity, describing the notion of an Aryan New Testament standing in contradiction to a Semitic Old Testament as \\"blasphemy\\" and \\"stupidity\\". In 1988, Lubac returned to writing about the era in R√©sistance chr√©tienne √† l'antis√©mitisme, souvenirs 1940-1944 (Christian Resistance to Antisemitism: Memories from 1940-1944) Mother Superiors of many convents provided safe haven to many French Jews. Agnes Walsh, a British Daughter of Charity who spent the war in occupied France was recognised as Righteous among the Nations for her sheltering of a Jewish family in her convent from 1943. The Archbishop of Nice Paul Remond, who facilitated underground activities hiding Jewish children in convents till they could be given safely to Christian families. The Carmelite monk, Lucien Bunel (Jacques de Jesus), who was sent to the Mauthausen Death Camp for sheltering three Jewish boys at his school (dramatised in the 1987 film Au revoir les enfants, made by Louis Malle, one of his former pupils). Bunel had opened his church to refugees fleeing Nazi persecution and hired a Jewish teacher fired under discriminatory laws. He died of exhaustion days after Liberation. Although Bunel was able to inform his senior students of the Jewish identity of the boys and the secret was kept, a former pupil who had joined the resistance revealed under torture that it was Bunel who had put him in contact with the resistance. On the Swiss border, various priests and parishes helped Jews escape to safety. Raymond Boccard and other priests assisted hundreds of refugees, including many Jews across the border into Switzerland. Abb√© Simon Gallay hid Jews at Evian-les-Bains, and assisted passage to Switzerland, until arrested and deported to Germany never to return. =Italy= Despite the Italian Dictator's Mussolini's close alliance with Hitler's Germany, Italy did not adopt Nazism's genocidal ideology towards the Jews. The Nazis were frustrated by the Italian forces refusal to co-operate in the round ups of Jews, and no Jews were deported from Italy prior to the Nazi occupation of the country following the Italian capitulation in 1943. In Italian occupied Croatia, Nazi envoy Siegfried Kasche advised Berlin that Italian forces had \\"apparently been influenced\\" by Vatican opposition to German anti- Semitism.Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; p.466 As anti-Axis feeling grew in Italy, the use of Vatican Radio to broadcast papal disapproval of race murder and anti-Semitism angered the Nazis. Mussolini was overthrown in July 1943, and the Nazi moved to occupy Italy, and commenced a round-up of Jews. Though thousands were caught, the great majority of Italy's Jews were saved. As in other nations, Catholic networks were heavily engaged in rescue efforts. Assisi Cathedral. The Bishop of Assisi established the Assisi Network, in which the churches, monasteries and convents of Assisi served as a safe haven for several hundred Jews during the German occupation. According to Martin Gilbert, the Pope had helped the Jews of Rome in September 1943, by offering whatever amounts of gold might be needed towards the 50 kg ransom demanded by the Nazis. At the same time, wrote Gilbert, the Capuchin Father Benoit had saved large numbers of Jews by providing them with false identification papers, helped by the Swiss, Hungarian, Rumanian and French embassies, and a number of Italian officials. A few days before the October 15/16 roundup, Pius XII personally directed Vatican clergy to open the sanctuaries of the Vatican to all \\"non-Aryans\\" in need of refuge.Martin Gilbert; The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy; Collins; London; 1986; pp.622-623 4715 of the 5715 Roman Jews listed for deportation by the Nazis were sheltered in 150 institutions - 477 in the Vatican itself. As German round-ups continued in Northern Italy, the Pope opened his summer residence, Castel Gandolfo, to take in thousands of Jews and authorised institutions across the north to do the same. Gilbert wrote that, in October 1943, with the SS occupying Rome and determined to deport the city's 5000 Jews, the Vatican clergy had opened the sanctuaries of the Vatican to all \\"non-Aryans\\" in need of rescue in an attempt to forestall the deportation. \\"Catholic clergy in the city acted with alacrity\\", wrote Gilbert. \\"At the Capuchin convent on the Via Siciliano, Father Benoit, under the name of Father Benedetti, saved a large numbers of Jews by providing them with false identification papers [...] by the morning of October 16, a total of 4,238 Jews had been given sanctuary in the many monasteries and convents of Rome. A further 477 Jews had been given shelter in the Vatican and its enclaves.\\" Gilbert credited the \\"rapid rescue efforts\\" of the Church as saving over four fifths of Roman Jews that morning.Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.314 Il Collegio San Giuseppe - Istituto De Merode, like other Roman Catholic schools, hid numerous Jewish children and adults among its students and Brothers. From his Vatican office, and in co-operation with Pius XII, Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, an Irishman, operated an escape operation for Jews and Allied escapees. The Irish Independent credited him with having saved more than 6,500 people during the war. From 1943, he began to offer shelter to allied servicemen seeking sanctuary in the Vatican. Using fake documents and a clandestine communications network, O'Flaherty defied the Gestapo's war criminal commander of Rome, Herbert Kappler, and evaded capture through the German occupation of Rome. O'Flaherty's '\\"Rome Escape Line\\" hid British and American soldiers and Jews in safe houses around the city. Kappler had a white line drawn around the boundary of the Vatican and offered a bounty on O'Flaherty's head. O'Flaherty forgave Kappler after the war, and became a regular visitor to his prison cell - eventually presiding at his conversion to Catholicism. O'Flaherty's story was dramatised in the 1983 film The Scarlet and the Black and Ireland honours his work with the Hugh O'Flaherty International Humanitarian Award.The priest who converted his enemy; by Stephen Walker, Catholic Herald; 13 April 2011. Swedish born Elisabeth Hesselblad was listed among the \\"Righteous\\" by Yad Vashem for her religious institute's work assisting Jews. She and two British women, Mother Riccarda Beauchamp Hambrough and Sister Katherine Flanagan have been beatified for reviving the Swedish Bridgettine Order of nuns and hiding scores of Jewish families in their convent during Rome's period of occupation under the Nazis. The churches, monasteries and convents of Assisi formed the Assisi Network and served as a safe haven for Jews. Gilbert credits the network established by Bishop Giuseppe Placido Nicolini and Abbott Rufino Niccaci of the Franciscan Monastery, with saving 300 people. When the Nazis began rounding up Jews, Monsignor Nicolini, Bishop of Assisi, ordered Father Aldo Brunacci to lead a rescue operation and arranged sheltering places in 26 monasteries and convents, and providing false papers for transit. Respect for Jewish religious practices saw Yom Kippur celebrated at Assisi in 1943, with nuns preparing the meal to end the fast. Other Italian clerics honoured by Yad Vashem include the theology professor Fr Giuseppe Girotti of Dominican Seminary of Turin, who saved many Jews before being arrested and sent to Dacau where he died in 1945; Fr Arrigo Beccari who protected around 100 Jewish children in his seminary and among local farmers in the village of Nonantola in Central Italy; and Don Gaetano Tantalo, a parish priest who sheltered a large Jewish family. Of Italy's 44,500 Jews, some 7,680 were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust.

It is named after the yellow mastic and black mastic trees which occur in the reserve. Description Mastic Reserve is an 834 ha tract of mainly forested land. It is bounded on the south and west by the Central Mangrove Wetland, and on the north by farmland. It encompasses the largest tract of contiguous native dry forest in the Cayman Islands, as well as the highest part of the low-lying island, with an elevation of 18 m. It also includes stands of royal and silver thatch palms as well as abandoned agricultural land, now grassland. =Mastic Trail= left The Mastic Trail is based on a traditional footpath that had fallen into disuse. In 1994 and 1995 it was restored and reopened as a 4 km walking track that passes through the reserve, traversing the central part of Grand Cayman from south to north. The southern part includes a 170 m hand- built rock causeway, known as the ‚ÄúMastic Bridge‚Äù, through black mangrove forest. =Birds= The IBA was identified as such by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of white-crowned pigeons, Cuban amazons, Caribbean elaenias, thick-billed vireos, Yucatan vireos and vitelline warblers. Other birds found in the reserve include West Indian woodpeckers and Caribbean doves.

In Scotland, he was sufficiently noteworthy as to be commissioned by Queen Victoria to remodel Balmoral Castle In later life he worked in Canada and is best remembered for the Manitoba Legislative Building. Life He was born in Darmstadt, Germany, the son of Dr David Worthington Simon. He was educated at Tettenhall College in Wolverhampton and King Edward VI Grammar School in Birmingham before being articled to John Cotton in Birmingham in 1879. In 1882 he briefly worked with Jethro Anstice Cossins before going to Paris to study at the Ecole des Beaux- Arts under Jean-Louis Pascal in 1883. He spent one year here sharing rooms with John Keppie and Stewart Henbest Capper and also befriending Alexander Nisbet Paterson. He then returned to Scotland to work with Burnet Son and Campbell in 1886 and later moved to Wardrop & Anderson. From around 1885 he also had his own studio at 8 York Place in Edinburgh. In 1887 he formed his own practice in partnership with his friend Stewart Henbest Capper. In 1890, under the guidance of Robert Rowand Anderson he became one of the founding fathers of Edinburgh College of Art and he and Capper shared the role of teaching architecture there. In 1898 he brought Alexander Hunter Crawford, who was connected to the Edinburgh company of Crawfords Biscuits, into partnership and the practice moved to 36 Hanover Street. In 1899 this merged with Robert Rowand Anderson‚Äôs practice to create Anderson, Simon & Crawford which lasted until 1902 until reverting to its former form and moved to 10 Randolph Place. In 1903 the partnership with Crawford ended and Simon moved to Liverpool where he formed a new partnership with Huon Arthur Matear. Jointly they created the huge Liverpool Cotton Exchange in 1905 (remodelled 1960). In 1910 Henry Boddington, of the Boddingtons Brewery family, was brought into the partnership. In 1912 the partnership won the hugely important competition for the Manitoba Legislative Building in Winnipeg, Canada and Simon began regular visits to Canada. He employed Septimus Warwick specifically to help on the Manitoba job and act as job architect on site, a role required until 1920. Simon married Lavinia Florence Colefax of California and died in Mentone, California in 1933.

He is remembered more for his numerous publications than for his buildings, which are limited in number. He was a particular expert on Early Canadian and French-Canadian architecture. Life He was born of distinguished parents. His mother was Phoebe Anna Moss, an important artist, best remembered under her married name of Phoebe Anna Traquair. His father was Dr Ramsay Heatley Traquair. Traquair was born in Edinburgh and educated at Edinburgh Academy 1884‚Äì1891 with his younger brother Harry Moss Traquair. He attended both the University of Edinburgh and Bonn University 1891‚Äì1892 but did not stay to take a degree. Architecture He trained under Stewart Henbest Capper and also studied in the newly formed Edinburgh College of Art in 1892 under both Capper and his partner Frank Worthington Simon. He then joined the office of John More Dick Peddie and George Washington Browne, also giving occasional assistance to Robert Lorimer, all providing him an excellent architectural pedigree. He worked here from 1892 to 1899. He then briefly worked in London for Samuel Bridgman Russell before qualifying as a full architect in early 1900. Academic life Immediately following qualification as an architect he began pursuing an academic career rather than practice architecture. He was employed by the Turkish government to study and record the lesser Byzantine churches of the Constantinople area, working with Professor Alexander van Millingen. He returned to Edinburgh in 1904 taking up the post of a lecturer in architecture and architectural history at the College of Art. Although he set up a private practice in 1905 his work was both limited and highly interrupted by numerous returns to the east where he was also highly involved in work for the British School of Archaeology in Athens. In 1909 Gerard Baldwin Brown proposed Traquair as successor to Percy Erskine Nobbs at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. This decision was delayed and he eventually took up this role in 1913. His final years in Edinburgh were spent at 4 Forres Street, a huge Georgian House on the Moray Estate.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1910 While at McGill, Traquair wrote a classist and racist article in The Atlantic titled The Caste System of North America.The Caste System of North America, The Atlantic Monthly, Volume 131, page 417. He worked at McGill until retirement in 1939 concentrating on studies in early Canadian and French-Canadian architecture. He was a regular contributor of papers for journals, in particular that of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. He died in Guysborough in Nova Scotia on 26 August 1952.

It is mostly active in Asia Pacific, Bulgaria and Romania. It is headquartered in Berlin, Germany. The service allows users to select from local restaurants and place orders via its mobile applications as well as its websites. The company has partnered with over 115,000 restaurants in 246 cities and works with over 80,000 delivery riders. The firm was acquired by Delivery Hero in early December 2016. Foodpanda's business in India was acquired by Indian cab- aggregator Ola on 29 December 2017 for an undisclosed amount. History Foodpanda was founded in 2012 by Lukas Nagel and Rico Wyder in South-East Asia and launched across Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and in 2014 in the Philippines. Shortly after, global expansion of the Foodpanda business was lead by Ralf Wenzel, Felix Plog, and Ben Bauer. In February 2014, Foodpanda acquired its main rival in Pakistan, Eat Oye. It afterwards went through three management changes until 2019. In early 2015, the company made an all-stock purchase of TastyKhana.in, and the portal Just Eat India. Cofounder Rohit Chadda stepped down from roles at the company in the middle of 2015. In the end of 2015, the company laid off around 300 employees in India. By 2016, none of the original managing directors or cofounders were present with the company. Also at that time, there was a news expose alleging malpractice at foodpanda India, including non-payments to restaurants, and fake listings. Earlier that July, it was also revealed that the Singapore police raided their offices in the country for signs of malpractice concerning foreign interns. The company was based in Gurgaon at the time and active in 200 cities. By 2016, Rocket India was seeking a buyer for the company, listing relatively low prices such as $10 to $15 million. In November 2016 the company sold its Delivery Club business in Russia to mail.ru for $100 million. In December 2016, the Foodpanda group was acquired by the German competitor Delivery Hero. Also that year in December 2016, Foodpanda's once largest investor Rocket Internet sold Foodpanda to Delivery Hero. Foodpanda's business in India was acquired by Ola for all share deal on 11 December 2017, for the price of $40-$50 million. Ola said it would invest around $200 million additional funds in Foodpanda. On November 1 2017, Foodpanda re-branded from Orange to Pink with updated logo across all the countries. The rebrand follows its acquisition by tech giant Delivery Hero in December 2016, changing its brand color from orange to pink. The company began offering discounts to increase usage, and at its peak, in August 2018 it had around 200,000 daily orders. That dropped to around 5,000 daily orders by the middle of 2019. Ola suspended Foodpanda India's food delivery business in the middle of 2019 and fired most of its 1,500 \\"food delivery executives.\\" The Foodpanda brand was said to continue in-house brands or \\"cloud kitchens.\\" The cloud kitchen concept had started for the company when it had acquired the company Holachef in October 2018. In 2019, however, it only had three private label brands under its cloud kitchen business, among them FLRT and Great Khichd experiment. Platform Foodpanda processes and sends orders directly to partner restaurants, then delivers the meals by delivery riders to the customers. The service is available via its websites and mobile applications. It connects customers with restaurants that offer food delivery in their area and lets them choose, order and pay online. Customers order food by entering their postcodes on the site and browsing for food from a list of restaurants. They can create meals by browsing restaurant menus and selecting items they want to order before entering an address and proceeding to the checkout. Food panda sends out an SMS to confirm orders and their estimated delivery time. Foodpanda also has a review section on restaurant pages, where customers can comment on sales process, delivery, taste and overall impression of restaurants.  Investments  The company raised a total of $318 million in venture capital. Foodpanda raised $20 million in initial funding from Investment AB Kinnevik, Phenomen Ventures and Rocket Internet in April 2013. In September 2013, iMENA Holdings invested $8 Million. In February 2014, there was another funding round of $20 million from a group of investors, including Phenomen Ventures. On August 11, the company announced that it has collected another $60 million in financing from a group of investors. In March 2015, the company announced it has raised over $110 million from Rocket Internet, as well as other investors.

Tania died during transit, as a result of a motor vehicle accident at age 14, on the property and is buried in the station cemetery.

While attempting to escape together, Joong-won fell off a cliff, and Ehwa gave him her blood to save him from dying. Thus, Joong-won was also transformed into a vampire. In modern-day Seoul, the 350-year-old Joong-won runs a luxurious wine bar in Gangnam District with Ehwa. Though she holds a torch for him, Ehwa can only observe and protect her friend from afar, as he has long closed himself to any new emotion. One day, Joong-won receives a letter from a former lover, a human he had broken up with 20 years ago without telling her the truth about himself. In her letter, the dying woman asks Joong-won to look after her daughter, Ji- woo. After her mother's funeral, Ji-woo finds a photograph her mother treasured very much, and she searches for the man in the photo, her mother's long-lost lover. When she finds Joong-won, she assumes that he is the son of the man in the photo. As Joong-won spends time with Ji-woo, all his emotions which were frozen by time start to melt away, and the two fall in love. Ehwa has difficulty dealing with this turn of events.

Located in the parish of Compton, the historical farm is currently a controversial issue as part of the Guildford Borough Council‚Äôs Local Plan consultation. History A farm already stood at Blackwell in the 17th century while the estate was included in the Down Place estate (also called Down Farm). =Notable owners= Bought by the railway engineer William Frederick Faviell in 1859, the area of Blackwell Farm was then 345 acres. Faviell decided to farm the land himself and hired Henry Peak to design his Model Farm in an industrial form unusual for this part of the country. In 1905, the estate was 636 acres. It became the property of John Cawsey Dennis, co-founder of Dennis Specialist Vehicles, a vehicle manufacturer in Guildford. =The property during the Second World War= After 1940, the Royal Army Service Corps which trained at Aldershot occupied the building. Also used by the Canadian Army, the farm was finally converted into flats for wartime evacuees by the Guildford Rural District Council. =Aircraft crash= In 1952 a United States Air Force North American F-86 Sabre and a Royal Air Force Gloster Meteor collided at 25,000 ft over Guildford. The two Cold War jet fighters were exercising when the collision occurred. The Sabre had taken off from Soesterberg in the Netherlands and was simulating a Soviet bomber attacking London. The Sabre crashed into a field of growing rye at Blackwell Farm about 150 yards from the nearest building and left a crater 30 feet in diameter. Capt. Milton Gray Whitford, the pilot, ejected from his aircraft before the crash and landed in the garden of a house in Ripley with only cuts on his face. Recent controversies Bought in 1986 by the University of Surrey to become the residence of the Vice-Chancellor, the estate of Blackwell Farm is now a controversial topic since its owner has announced its plan to build approximately 2,000 new homes on the green belt land. As part of the Guildford Borough Council‚Äôs Local Plan, the University has submitted its idea for a ‚ÄúGarden Neighbourhood‚Äù in the west of Guildford. The proposal includes a railway station and a park-and-ride along with new houses. It has been criticized by local residents such as the Save Hogs Back campaigners who see the development plan like a threat for the Hog‚Äôs Back given the southern part of the site is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

It was released in November 2013 in South Korea, and on February 4, 2014 in the United States. The film stars AnnaLynne McCord, Billy Zane and Viva Bianca. The story is about a woman who discovers her boyfriend is having an affair with her best friend. She goes crazy and decides to take revenge on them. Plot Kevin (Billy Zane) and Sadie (AnnaLynne McCord) have been dating for six months, and Sadie tells her friend Jennifer (Viva Bianca) that she believes Kevin will propose to her on a weekend getaway, and invited her to be maid of honor. Jennifer cautions Sadie about marrying a man she has only known six months. At their weekend away, Sadie finds a sexual text from another woman on Kevin's phone An argument ensues, and Sadie pepper-sprays Kevin and knocks him out with a fireplace log. Kevin awakens tied to a chair. At first confused and seemingly believing it to be some sexual fantasy, he remains calm. However, Sadie tells him that she knows about his affair with Jennifer. Sadie, pretending to be Kevin, says Sadie and Kevin have broken up and invites Jennifer to join him. Sadie takes Kevin to their bedroom, ties him to the bed and gags him, then places candles and rose petals as well as some spiked champagne for Jennifer. Jennifer arrives, follows the petals, drinks the champagne and quickly undresses. As Jennifer reclines atop Kevin, believing his gag and other ties to be a sexual fantasy, Sadie knocks her out. Jennifer wakes up in a bathtub in which Sadie tells her that in olden days adulterers had their hair cut off, which Sadie proceeds to do to her. Jennifer and Kevin wake up with Jennifer now tied to the bed and Kevin tied to a chair. Bringing up both a microwave and Jennifer's dog, Bootsie, Sadie threatens to microwave the dog if Kevin doesn't perform oral sex on Jennifer. Sadie justifies this as being a cure for them and saying now they don't have to do it behind her back, Kevin eventually agrees. After feeding them and fending off a visiting neighbor, Sadie stops Kevin from getting his gun. In retaliation, Sadie electrocutes the pair and puts Jennifer's hand in a machine that breaks all her fingers. She also breaks Kevin's ankle with a sledge hammer. Sadie tells Jennifer the story of her childhood dog. She loved the dog but the dog fell in love with her sister, so Sadie drowned her sister. She adds that she never blamed the dog. Upstairs, she tells Kevin that they need to get rid of his wandering eye and partially blinds him. Sadie takes Jennifer to a boat, planning to drown her, but Jennifer escapes and intercepts a car, only to find Sadie driving. Once caught and driving with Sadie, Jennifer falsely professes her love for Sadie, saying that the affair was to end their relationship so she could be with Sadie. Jennifer kisses Sadie and then rolls out of the car in an attempt to get away but hurts herself. Sadie gets out of the car and chokes Jennifer, seemingly, to death. Driving away, Sadie is pulled over by the police who tell her that a criminal has broken out of jail and she should keep an eye out. Jennifer, however, is still alive and stumbles toward the police, only to be hit by an oncoming truck. Sadie drives away and, finding the criminal, lets him into the car. She proceeds to have sex with him and then kills him, thanking him for being her alibi. Driving back to the house, she finds Kevin has broken free and chases him. Kevin dodges the bullets she fires and manages to make it to the boat, but dies in the ensuing fight. Sadie sets up the scene as if the criminal raped her and killed her boyfriend and tells this to the police, using her mangled fingers, which she also put in the machine, as evidence. A few months later, Sadie has a new boyfriend, who is revealed to be cheating on her, too.

It covers the civil parishes of Ruan and Dysert, and includes the village of Ruan, which holds the parish office. The parish contains the ruins of the 12th century St. Tola's Church, part of Dysert O'Dea Monastery. Location The parish lies to the north of Ennis on the road to Corofin. The River Fergus runs through most of the parish, through Tedane and other lakes, to Clarecastle. In 1837 there were police stations in Dysert and Ruan, and chapels in each place. The chapel in Ruan had been rebuilt by public subscription in 1834. The parish includes the civil parishes of Ruan and Dysert. Dysert is sometimes called Dysert O'Dea, since it was part of the territory of the O'Dea sept. Ruan is near the Burren and between Corofin, Crusheen and Ennis. The name \\"Ruan\\" (An Ruadh√°n) is an old Irish term for the alder tree, at one time used to make red dye. Antiquities =Dysert O'Dea Church= The ruined Church of Disert consists of a nave and a choir . It was described by Eugene Curry in 1839. At that time the walls were in perfect condition, about high and thick. The west gable has a window, completely covered in ivy inside and out. In the south wall at a distance of from the west gable there is a beautifully sculpted door high and wide. The door has four circular arches, one over the other, resting on columns at the sides of the door. The columns are surmounted by human heads. The largest arch has nineteen stones that project a small way from the wall. They are carved with twelve human and seven animal heads. The choir in 1839 had a beautiful circular arch built with finely cut grit-stone, about wide and the same height. The gable had a double-headed curvilinear pointed belfry. There were pointed windows in the north wall of nave and in the south side of quire near the east gable. The window in the east gable was wide and about high, divided into three compartments by two triangular pillars of masonry and lined all round with the same sort of cut stones as those in the choir arch, but looking somewhat fresher. According to tradition the choir was added to the Church by O'Dea. =White Cross of Tola= White Cross of Tola About a mile east of the Church of Disert there is a deserted burying ground, near the old chapel, called Mainistir-na-Sratha-Duibhe (Monastery of the Black Sward). There is a Holy Well near it called Tobar Oireachta at which Stations were still performed in 1839. Nearby to the north is a small elevated spot called Cnocan-na-Croise (Height of the Cross), on which a Celtic cross was erected. Part of the shaft remained standing in 1839 about high. The ancient cross lay on the ground. The cross was re-erected in 1871 by Francis Hutcheson Synge of Dysert. The shaft of the cross is and the head is high. The north and south sides of the cross are cut into patterns. The north side includes a crude carving of two men swearing on a staff between another man and a bishop. The west side has two heads, but otherwise the carvings have been broken off. The east side has a figure of Christ, with outstretched arms. Below that is a large figure of Saint Tola of Clonard, the Bishop of Clonard and the founder and patron of the Dysert church. Tola died between 733 and 737. = Ruan Church = The ruined Church of Ruan stands in the Ruan townland of the Ruan civil parish. It is in area. As of 1839 the walls stood at their original height apart from the west gable, the top of which is broken off. There was a pointed doorway in the south side near the west gable, and a square one in the same side near the east gable. There is a double pointed window in the east gable, but its mullion is gone. There is a portion of the north wall elevated six feet above the rest, as if for the purpose of a ball-alley. There is a little Chapel projecting to the south from the south west angle, nineteen feet six inches long and sixteen feet three inches broad having a pointed door in its east side and elevated tomb in its north end, with a monumental stone over it in the Church wall, exhibiting the following inscription: \\"This Chapel and tomb were erected by Donogh O‚ÄôKerine, the son of Dermot O‚ÄôKerine of Owan, for him and his posterities‚Äô use in the year of our Lord God, 1688.\\" There is no patron saint associated with this church, and no holy well dedicated to any particular saint nearby. The only holy wells in the area were named after the townlands. Today Dysart and Ruan is a parish in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. The parish office is in the village of Ruan. The parish churches are St Mary's in Ruan and St Tola in Dysart. The parish runs two primary schools, Ruan National School and Toonagh National School.

She is most famously known for her 1929 film The Last Post. Additional credits to her name include Afraid of Love (1925), Second to None (1926), Every Mother's Son (1926), Carry On (1927). Shurey often calls upon themes surrounding the British war within her films, tending to take on a more melodramatic narrative style.  Early life  Born in 1888 into a comfortable middle-class family, Shurey's father Harry was a magazine and penny paper publisher. Some of Edgar Wallace's Sanders of the River stories first appeared in Harry Shurey's magazine The Weekly Tale Teller which was published from 8 May 1909 to 29 April 1916 (365 issues). During the First World War, Dinah Shurey worked for the French Red Cross as a canteen worker. Due to overexertion, Shurey was dismissed from duty and sent home.Berki, Bibi. ‚ÄúThe Film Society, 1930.‚Äù Film International 16, no. 3 (September 1, 2018): 12. https://doi.org/10.1386/fiin.16.3.6_1 She later worked with actor-manager Lena Ashwell to organise concerts for troops on the Western Front. After the war, Shurey managed the acting couple Eva Moore and Henry V. Esmond.  Film career  Shurey's film career began with Teddington Film Company, for which she worked in a number of roles, graduating to assistant film director. In May 1924, Shurey founded her own film production company, Britannia Films and in 1929 her own distribution company Showman Films. Shurey was the only female British film director of her day. Britannia made five films, two of which, Carry On and The Last Post Shurey directed herself. Her wartime experiences instilled in Shurey a fascination of melodramatic and militaristic British experiences,Berki, Bibi. ‚ÄúThe Film Society, 1930.‚Äù Film International 16, no. 3 (September 1, 2018): 12. https://doi.org/10.1386/fiin.16.3.6_1Gledhill, Christine. ‚ÄúReframing Women in 1920s British Cinema: the Case of Violet Hopson and Dinah Shurey.‚Äù Journal of British Cinema and Television 4, no. 1 (May 1, 2007): 1‚Äì17. https://doi.org/10.3366/jbctv.2007.4.1.1. which scholar Bibi Berki stated foreshadowed the majority of her filmography, including films such as Carry On! and The Last Post. Berki further suggests that it was for her films Second to None and Carry On!, which both deal with the military experience within the First World War, that Shurey borrowed warships from the British military. According to Berki, Shurey's dedication to her filming process was expressed in her interview with Banbury Advertiser in 1927, in which she described the making of Second to None. She was forced, as the producer, to not only lower herself down through a manhole but also her entire crew with their equipment : = The Last Post (1929) = For her second venture into directing Shurey co-wrote with Lydia Hayward, who was a consistent collaborator on Shurey's films.Gledhill, Christine. ‚ÄúReframing Women in 1920s British Cinema: the Case of Violet Hopson and Dinah Shurey.‚Äù Journal of British Cinema and Television 4, no. 1 (May 1, 2007): 1‚Äì17. https://doi.org/10.3366/jbctv.2007.4.1.1. The Last Postis often cited by critics as Shurey's most controversial film. According to Bibi Berki, the film describes the story of twin brothers during the First World War who get wrapped up with the Bolshevik General Strike while both pursuing the same woman.Berki, Bibi. ‚ÄúThe Film Society, 1930.‚Äù Film International 16, no. 3 (September 1, 2018): 13. https://doi.org/10.1386/fiin.16.3.6_1 Her intention was to produce a film that commented on the British war sentiment during the First World War.  Court Case  However, while Shurey's films were generally well-received by the public, critics disagreed, gaining the attention of Nerina Shute, a columnist for the Film Weekly.Berki, Bibi. ‚ÄúThe Film Society, 1930.‚Äù Film International 16, no. 3 (September 1, 2018): 13. https://doi.org/10.1386/fiin.16.3.6_1 On June 10, 1929 Film Weeklypublished an article titled ‚ÄúCan Women Direct Films? A Decided Negative From A Woman Who Knows.‚Äù The article stated:The article raised questions as to whether or not women could successfully create a film that held the same standard as men, arguing that, using Shurey's filmography, women could not. Angered by the publication, Shurey suggested she write a piece in the Film Weekly as a direct response to her critics titled, ‚ÄúWomen Can Direct Films - From a Woman Who Knows.‚Äù Publishers refused to allow her to name Nerina Shute directly, resulting in Shurey's decision to take legal action and take her case to the High Court. In February 1931, Shurey sued Film Weekly for libel, arguing that the article stated that her work was without value and proving that women could not produce a film. Film Weekly disagreed arguing they were entitled to their opinion, and that their conclusions were proved through the viewing of her films. The case was put to the jury, who awarded Shurey ¬£500 in damages. No prints of The Last Post are known to survive and the film is one of the top ten films on the British Film Institute's most wanted list of lost British films. Paul Rotha compared Shurey to Harry Bruce Woolfe, calling her \\"an upstanding Empire loyalist\\" who \\"had made some quite atrocious films\\".

To make matters worse, Waldo Kaye's father wants to buy the bakery and replace it with a shopping mall. Waldo wants the kids' tree house for himself and ends up setting off the burglar alarm. Spanky suggests the gang get jobs in order to help save Grandma's bakery. Porky, Buckwheat, Mary Ann and Stymie all offer their services in professional working environments but are turned away at each one. Spanky and Alfalfa get jobs as Mr. Kaye's caddies at the local country club, but the two are quickly kicked out of the club after Spanky interrupts Officer Kennedy's date with Miss Crabtree by accidentally hitting a golf ball at the policeman's forehead. This does not stop Spanky. He suggests a pet washing business, which quickly goes haywire after he mistakenly replaces a bottle of shampoo with one containing green dye. The fur of several pets turns green, including Darla's cat. Alfalfa tries to make up for it by offering Darla a ride to the library on his bicycle, but she instead decides to go with Waldo in his toy car. This gives Spanky the idea for the Rascals to build their own taxi cab. This business also ends poorly after Waldo cuts the car's brake wires, sending them down a steep hill and into a gazebo. Darla, who was riding in the taxi, once again leaves Alfalfa for Waldo. Officer Kennedy, who has constantly had his dates with Miss Crabtree interrupted by the Rascals, yells at the kids for ruining yet another attempt at proposing marriage to the schoolteacher. Angered that Kennedy does not like children, Miss Crabtree breaks up with him. Spanky next decides to have Alfalfa get into the wrestling ring against the mysterious Masked Marvel. Porky is to play Alfalfa's opponent, but he accidentally tells to Waldo. Waldo then hires Butch and The Woim to stop Alfalfa from winning the wrestling match. Butch takes Porky's place in the ring and easily beats Alfalfa. To make matters worse, Waldo convinces Spanky to bet the money he had made from the match to him in the event that Alfalfa loses. Angered at their leader's poor decision and his bossy attitude, the rest of the gang turn against Spanky, but after a talk with Grandma, Spanky is able to rekindle his friendship with the others. The kids now begin rehearsing for the talent show, their last chance at earning the $10,000 for Grandma. Meanwhile, Miss Crabtree agrees to continue dating Officer Kennedy on the condition that he attends the kids' talent show with her. Kennedy reluctantly agrees. At the talent show, the gang are up against several professional acts including a song-and-dance routine by Waldo and Darla, but Waldo continuously pushes Darla out of the spotlight and she eventually leaves him after he attempts to sabotage the International Silver String Submarine Band's performance. The band's rendition of \\"I Got You Babe\\" starts poorly and gradually gets fair, and gets even better when Darla arrives to sing with Alfalfa. The Rascals win the $10,000, Darla officially joins the gang's band (and becomes Alfalfa's girlfriend), Grandma's bakery is saved, and Miss Crabtree agrees to marry Officer Kennedy. In a mid-credit sequence, Waldo gets a \\"tree house\\" from his Dad as promised, in the form of a miniature of their own huge mansion. When his Dad offers Waldo to christen it himself, Waldo proudly announces it a members-only place and strikes the bottle to one of its pillars. However, instead of the bottle, the pillar develops a crack, which then spreads throughout the house and within a moment, it shatters to dust. Waldo's Dad comments to a shocked Waldo, that he might still have the receipt.

These include: * The \\"high-sign\\" originally appeared in the Little Rascals short Anniversary Trouble. * The kids getting themselves kicked out of school during a classroom party originally appeared in the Little Rascals short Teacher's Pet. * The main plot, involving saving Grandma's bakery, was borrowed from the Little Rascals film Helping Grandma. * The kids' band, The International Silver String Submarine Band, was original featured in the Little Rascals film Mike Fright. In a deleted scene, Spanky and Alfalfa interrupt Butch's trombone performance by eating lemons. This gag was also borrowed from Mike Fright. * The kids preparing a cake was borrowed from 1932's Birthday Blues. The sounds that the cake makes inside of the oven are also based on those made by the cake in Birthday Blues. * Spanky and Alfalfa getting jobs as caddies was the plot for the Little Rascals comedy Divot Diggers. * A parrot says, \\"Remarkable!\\", a nod to the Our Gang film Forgotten Babies. In a deleted scene, the parrot also says, \\"Yum, yum! Eat 'em up!\\", a nod to The Kid From Borneo. * The kids' handmade taxi, and the idea of it going down a steep hill were borrowed from Free Wheeling. * Alfalfa fighting the Masked Marvel, which turns out to be Butch, was originally featured in the Little Rascals comedy Came the Brawn. The film features a handful of inside jokes for fans of both the original Little Rascals and the 1994 film adaptation. These include: * The kids attend Robert McGowan Elementary School. Robert McGowan directed several of the original Little Rascals shorts between 1922 and 1933. * Miss Crabtree's first name is June, while Officer Kennedy's first name is Edgar. This is a nod to June Marlowe and Edgar Kennedy, the actors who portrayed Miss Crabtree and Officer Kennedy in the original Little Rascals shorts. * A marquee on a movie theater reads \\"Hal Roach Film Festival. Hal Roach was the producer creator of the Our Gang/Little Rascals series. * The talent show host is named Leo McCarey. McCarey worked on several of the original Little Rascals shorts. * Bug Hall, who portrayed Alfalfa in the 1994 film, cameos as an ice cream man. In a deleted scene, he suggests that Alfalfa reminds him of himself when he was younger. *The \\"figurine\\" on the cab is the same as the figurine on \\"Blur 2: The Sequel\\".

The grandson of the British diplomat, Irish landowner and Catholic re-convert Sir John Francis Charles, 7th Count de Salis-Soglio, his earliest years were spent at 10 Priory Walk, Kensington, and 26 Roedean Crescent, Roehampton Gate, SW15. His father died when he was under two and his mother when he was five, his step-father when he was 10 and one of his two paternal uncles when he was four. His paternal grandparents had also died, in 1902 and 1939, so he was subsequently brought-up, inter-alia, by Franco-Belgian cousins in France (the widow and family of the 3rd Duc de Magenta at Sully, in particular), his remaining paternal uncle in Wiltshire, and his Veronese maternal grandmother, Teresa Vignola Presti. He was educated at Downside, read law at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (LLB (1972) and LLM), and was called to the Bar, Gray's Inn (1970). Later he was a tenant and then door-tenant, at 1 Brick Court, Middle Temple, EC4, and from 1972 lived at 12 First Street, SW3 and then from 1975 in two houses knocked together at 28 Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea, SW3.

John's eighteenth century ancestors, 3rd Count Peter in particular, had also been growers of hemp and vines in eighteenth century Valtelline.Fane de Salis MSSBy 2014 his precarious and rather over ambitious operation comprised 8 acres of olives, 12 acres of vines for his own production of Amarone (Corvina, Corvinino, Rondinella and Molinara, Croatina, Oseleta, Raboso, Veronese and Dindarella grapes) and Pinot Nero for his neo-Burgundian Monte Rugoli, with 80 acres for a while with the local agence Tenuta S. Antonio. In addition to the above Count de Salis was a member of the British Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta; had the Gold Medal with Swords (Beirut) 1982; was a Knight of Justice of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George; a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the White Elephant (Thailand); and an hereditary Knight of the Golden Spur (Eques Auratus) (1571).For Grisons envoy Giovanni Battista de Salis, the elder (1521-1597), of the Casa Alta, Soglio, invested by Pope Pius V, 11 April 1571, perpetuating an earlier investiture of 1568.

A separate ocean conservation charity, TerraMar (UK), was incorporated in 2013 by Maxwell in Salisbury, United Kingdom. The TerraMar Project was incorporated in London and Delaware in 2012. TerraMar (US) announced its closure on 12 July 2019, shortly after New York federal prosecutors arrested Maxwell's close associate, the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, on new charges of sex trafficking. However, Maxwell's company TerraMar (UK) continued to exist with her listed as a director until it was officially dissolved on 3 December 2019.  History  The Board of Directors of the TerraMar Project included former Executive Director of the United Nations Office for Partnerships (UNOP) Amir Dossal ‚Äì who handles $1 billion in the form of a grant from Ted Turner for charities, media executive Steven Haft, and Ariadne Calvo-Platero, daughter of the peer Lord Beaumont of Whitley, Maxwell‚Äôs best friend from Oxford. = The TerraMar Project, United States = The TerraMar Project was founded on 26 September 2012 at the Blue Ocean Film Festival and Conservation Conference in Monterey, California, and focused on the 64% of the ocean that lies outside any single country's jurisdiction. Their mission was to create a \\"global ocean community\\" based around the idea of shared ownership of the global commons, also known as the high seas or international waters. In 2014, on behalf of the TerraMar Project, Maxwell gave a lecture at the University of Texas at Dallas and later that year, a TED talk, about the importance of ocean conservation. Maxwell also spoke at the United Nations as the founder of the TerraMar Project. She accompanied Stuart Beck, a 2013 TerraMar board member, to two United Nations meetings to discuss the project. Maxwell presented at the Arctic Circle Assembly in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland in 2013. Scott Borgerson, listed on TerraMar's board of directors for 2013, appeared with Maxwell at the Arctic Circle conference. In June 2014, Maxwell and Borgerson spoke at an event in Washington, DC sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, titled ‚ÄúGoverning the Ocean Commons: Growing Challenges, New Approaches‚Äù. Tax documents for US organization the TerraMar Project consistently list Ghislaine Maxwell as the organization's President. The TerraMar Project's address was in New York City for 990 tax filings from 2012 through 2015, with later filings showing a Woburn, Massachusetts address for 2016 and 2017. The New York Times reported that TerraMar gave out no money in grants between 2012 and 2017 and that it was described as having unusually high accounting and legal fees for an organization of its size. Questions were also raised about what TerraMar entailed beyond the high profile appearance by Maxwell at the United Nations and on the TED stage. In 2017, an executive at a maritime firm made multiple requests for project funding to Terramar's development director Brian Yuratsis that were ultimately denied despite Yuratsis professing interest in having TerraMar sponsor the project. The maritime executive who made the requests stated that ‚ÄúMy impression was that TerraMar as a whole was pretty hollow‚Äù, and that ‚ÄúIt seemed like Brian was the entire organization.‚Äù On the organization's IRS annual return, the organization reported that it owed $560,650 to Ghislane Maxwell, it owed $1,341 of credit card debt, and it had $10,252 of cash, as of 31 December 2018.\\"990-EZ: Short Form Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax\\".

History The company was started as M and M Sports in 1987 when Mark Ellis and Martin Churchward were introduced by their Nike representative Ken Mallender. The two founders started their careers with retail shops in Hereford and Stourbridge and joined forces to buy end-of-line clearance sports products. The success of this led the pair to venture off into off-page advertising, with the first advert appearing in Shoot magazine in 1987. National press adverts followed in 1990 specifically offering clothing and footwear. As both men lived in the area a site in Leominster was purchased and the company was born. In 1994 the business was transferred from Stourbridge to its current base in Leominster, Herefordshire.

From 1812 to 1814, he served as Judge-Advocate General of the British Army under Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. He wrote an account of this period which provides information about the theory and practice of military justice in the early 19th century. After the Napoleonic Wars, Larpent worked in Gibraltar and Vienna, before returning to the United Kingdom where he died in 1845. Life The eldest son of John Larpent, and half-brother of Sir George Gerard de Hochepied Larpent, he was educated at Cheam school. He entered St John's College, Cambridge in 1795, where he graduated B.A. as fifth wrangler in 1799, was elected fellow, and proceeded M.A. in 1802. Larpent studied for some time under John Bayley the special pleader, was called to the bar, and went the western circuit, but did little business, but made some useful friendships. Charles Manners-Sutton, the judge- advocate general, selected him in 1812 to go out to the Iberian Peninsula as deputy judge-advocate general to the forces there. He remained till 1814 at headquarters with the Duke of Wellington, who thought highly of him. In August 1813 he was taken prisoner, but was exchanged almost immediately. In 1814 Larpent was made a commissioner of customs. About the same time he was appointed civil and admiralty judge for Gibraltar. A new code was in course of formation, and Larpent was employed for a month or two in arranging the court- martial on General Sir John Murray. In the spring of 1815 Larpent was invited by the Prince Regent to inquire into the improprieties which Princess Caroline was alleged to have committed abroad, but he insisted that his appointment should proceed from the government directly, and that he should not be employed to gather partisan evidence. Although he nominally set out to take up his work at Gibraltar, he went to Vienna, where he was accredited to Count M√ºnster, and began his investigations into the princess's conduct, with the result that he dissuaded the prince's advisers from bringing her to public trial. He travelled on to Gibraltar, and remained there till 1820, when he was again employed in secret service with reference to Queen Caroline. In 1821 Lord Liverpool made Larpent one of the commissioners of the board of audit of the public accounts. In 1826 he became its chairman, and in 1843 he retired. He died at Holmwood, near Dorking, Surrey, on 21 May 1845. Works When in the Peninsula Larpent wrote descriptive letters to his step-mother; these were edited, with a preface by Sir George Larpent, under the title of Private Journals of Francis Seymour Larpent, London, 1853, 3 vols., and passed through three editions the same year. Family Larpent married, first, on 15 March 1815, Catherine Elizabeth, second daughter of Frederick Reeves of East Sheen, Surrey‚Äîshe died without issue on 17 Jan. 1822; secondly, on 10 Dec. 1829, Charlotte Rosamund, daughter of George Arnold Arnold of Halstead Place, Kent‚Äîshe died at Bath on 28 April 1879.

It was installed in 1971 and is located in the outdoor plaza of the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library in Columbus, Indiana. Xenia and J. Irwin Miller commissioned the sculpture and gave it to the library. The sculpture is nearly 20 feet tall and is made of sandcast bronze that has been patinated. Description Large Arch is an abstract bronze sculpture of an arch created by Henry Moore. The shape of the sculpture suggests human hip and leg bones, while the negative space on the interior of the arch suggests an abstracted human torso with head. It is 19 feet 6 inches tall. The width of the sculpture at its base is 12 feet 3 inches wide, but is 13 feet 9 inches at its widest at the top. While the sculpture is hollow, it weighs approximately . Despite the fact that it was sandcast in 50 sections and then assembled in Germany before being brought on site in 1971, the surface of the sculpture is smooth with little evidence of the joins. The surface of the sculpture was originally patinated green, and was expected to change very little with age. Moore described the original color as Paris green. As of 2014 the patina has progressed, with a light blue patina forming in areas that are most exposed to rain. The deep wrinkles and rough surface of the sculpture is part of the original design, which I.M. Pei has described as \\"elephant skin.\\" The sculpture is surrounded by a circular red-brick paved pedestrian plaza. Moore's signature at the base of Large Arch and the foundry mark \\"H. Noack\\" in Berlin Historical information The artist Henry Moore cites his inspiration was the monument of Stonehenge in England, as well as the shoulders of a man. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) owns a smaller version of the bronze arch by Moore titled Large Torso, which dates from 1962‚Äì63, before the creation of the Columbus Large Arch or the Cleo Rogers Memorial Library. I.M. Pei had the idea of a large work of art to sit in the Fifth Street public plaza that would pull together the space between his newly built Cleo Rogers Memorial Library, the Irwin Gardens by Henry A. Phillips (just east of the library) and the First Christian Church by Eliel Saarinen (across the street). Pei wanted a sculpture that could be touched and walked through. After seeing Henry Moore's Large Torso at the MoMA and watching his daughter run and play within the small arch, Pei asked Henry Moore to make an arch twice as big, with enough for two adults to walk through side-by-side comfortably. Moore agreed so long as it was not so large or positioned in such a way that an automobile could pass through it. Moore also gave over control of the positioning of the arch within the plaza, trusting Pei and J. Irwin Miller to consider how visitors may approach as well as the position of the sun. In September 1970, Xenia Irwin Miller, co-commissioner of Large Arch, presented a 24-minute color film on the work of Henry Moore which was produced by the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Education corporation. Miller also presented her visit with Moore at his studio in England in July 1970. Complex patina and surface texture of Large Arch Large Arch was sandcast in 40-50 segments in Berlin, West Germany by the Herman Noack Foundry. Each casting is about a quarter of an inch thick. It was shipped to New Orleans, barged up the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to New Albany, Indiana and was then driven north to Columbus, Indiana on a flat bed trailer on Interstate 65 to Columbus where it was delivered on a truck and assembled as a single piece. Before its installation, a temporary plywood sculpture was erected in late 1970 to give an idea of the size of the sculpture. The dedication ceremony of the library did not occur until the installation of Moore's sculpture on May 16, 1971, two years after the library building was complete. I.M. Pei was in attendance and gave a short speech emphasizing the use of the plaza where Large Arch is placed as a public space that emphasizes the importance of the nearby buildings. Also present at the dedication were Carl Weinhardt, director of the Indianapolis Museum of Art at the time, Kenneth D. B. Carruthers, who worked with I.M. Pei on the library's design, and Robert Indiana, artist. Henry Moore did not attend. Even before its placement, Large Arch was considered a controversial choice by the surrounding community. It has been given colloquial names like \\"Dentist's Dream,\\" \\"Large Hip Joint\\" and \\"The Big Bone.\\" The arch is now featured on tours provided by the Columbus Area Visitor's Center, and before he died, Moore considered it to be one of his most important works. It was also featured prominently in the book Henry Moore in America by Harry J. Seldis. =Location history= Large Arch in Columbus, Indiana, was commissioned especially for the public plaza outside I.M. Pei‚Äôs Cleo Rogers Memorial Library. With its anthropomorphic features, it is a soft organic contrast to the hard geometric shapes that dominate the Library and First Christian Church. The plaza is Roman style, brick-paved and circular, and the arch is placed in the center of a slightly raised roundabout. In the past, cars were allowed to drive around the arch and park temporarily for the library, but this road was closed off shortly after to create a pedestrian plaza. The plaza is designed for use by the public. In 2013-14, the plaza underwent repairs but Large Arch is still on view. Similar bronze arches by Henry Moore are on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Lynden Sculpture Garden in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri. A similar arch by Moore made from travertine is also on display in Kensington Gardens in London, England. =Acquisition= Large Arch was approved by the Bartholomew County Library board and paid for by Xenia and J. Irwin Miller at the suggestion of I.M. Pei. The Millers donated the work to the Bartholomew County Library. Artist Condition At some point between the sculpture‚Äôs installation in 1971 and 1985, a line of caulking was added around the base of Large Arch to prevent water pooling and freeze/thaw damage. In October 1984, Large Arch was vandalized. An encircled capital letter \\"A\\" was spray painted in white on the south-east outer face of the sculpture, which may have referred to the musical style of Anarcho-punk. While the Bartholomew County Library posted a reward for information about the crime, no one was ever charged. Two efforts were made to remove the paint, the first of which was in December 1984. Phoebe Weil, a well-known sculpture conservator from Saint Louis who pioneered the field in the 1970s, removed as much paint as possible from Large Arch. Weil also recommended coating the sculpture to ensure easier removal of future paint-based attacks. The second attempt to remove the spray-painted A was in spring of 1986. This time the library association contacted Henry Moore‚Äôs studio for recommendations, approval of future cleaning, and to create a plan of regular maintenance schedule for the future. Unnamed art conservators from Cincinnati and New York City gave their opinions for future care, and both agreed that coating the sculpture in a special wax mixture would protect it from future paint-based attack.

Born in Durham, at the age of 15 he was apprenticed to Lambton Collieries whilst attending classes at Durham College of Science. In 1890 he moved to South Wales as improver for the ironworks at Tondu. In 1891 he became assistant engineer and chief draughtsman at Cyfarthfa Ironworks, Merthyr Tydfil. He returned to North East England in 1896 as manager of D Selby Bigge and Company, an engineering company based in Newcastle. In 1902 he founded his own company, G Harland Bowden and Company, consulting engineers of Victoria Street, London. The firm specialised in the design and installation of colliery and factory plants. In 1908 he became a Member of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers. In 1907 Bowden was granted a Volunteer Force commission in the Royal Garrison Artillery. Bowden was active in Conservative Party politics, and in April 1912 was adopted as the party's prospective candidate for the parliamentary constituency of North East Derbyshire. In April 1914 the sitting Labour Party member of parliament for North East Derbyshire died, causing a by-election. The by-election was held on 20 May, and Bowden was elected to the Commons, gaining the seat for the Conservatives with a majority of 314 votes. During World War I Bowden became commanding officer of 17th (Empire) Battalion, the Royal Fusiliers, a war-formed unit. He continued to hold his parliamentary seat during the war, but found himself estranged from the Conservative Party, going so far as to issue libel proceedings against a party official. At the 1918 general election he defended his seat as an Independent Conservative, opposed by a Conservative candidate who had the support of the Coalition Government. He lost his seat to the Liberal candidate, finishing in third place. In October 1919 he was awarded 125 pounds in damages for libel against the vice-chairman of the North East Derbyshire Unionist Association. By the time of the 1924 general election Bowden had repaired his ties to the Conservatives, and stood as the party's candidate in North East Derbyshire once more. He was unsuccessful, with the Labour Party holding the seat. He died suddenly at his home, \\"Rodney\\", Belmont Hill, St Albans in October 1927, aged 64.

It was established in 1832. History In 1832, Pierre Genty De Bussy, the Civil Intendant, and General Antoine Avisard, interim governor, decided to drain the marshes at the foot of the Arcades hill. The Botanical Garden of Hamma was then created on a area, to make not only a model farm but also a test garden. In 1837, the organization bought a site under the Fountain of Plane Trees. The garden grew westwards and became the Central Nursery of the Government. The initial site was renamed Little Test Garden until its exchange in 1848 for another piece of land inside the Nursery. The garden's principal activity is to provide trees to public organisations and to European settlers. From 1833, production of carmine was added. Auguste Hardy was named director of the Botanical Garden in 1842. Many animal species were introduced to the garden at that time, and it expanded several times. As well as the animal and vegetable produce, industry relating to new technology occupied a lot of space, and employed a lot of people. Between 1848 and 1867 the garden expanded several times, until it arrived at its current configuration. In 1860, a lake was created and an exterior boulevard constructed. The garden was renamed the Acclimatization Garden () in 1861. In 1867, an estimated 8,214 species could be found in the garden. The Garden in the 21st century Between 2001 and 2009 the garden was closed for restoration work. Reopened in 2009, it is now home to the Algerian National Institute of Agronomical Research, and was opened to visitors. There are currently an estimated 1,200 different species of plant in the garden.

Early years Esther Delia Caukin was born on July 7, 1901, near Jackson, California, to parents born in California. Her father, an electrician, had left-wing political views. Her mother worked as a clerk, supported women's suffrage, and campaigned for Woodrow Wilson in 1914. The family moved frequently during Esther's childhood. She graduated from Girls' High School in San Francisco in 1920 and then attended Mills College, graduating with a B.A. in history in 1924. She earned a doctorate from Stanford University in 1927, financing her education in part with a fellowship from the American Association of University Women (AAUW). She moved to Washington, D.C., to work on the AAUW staff and headed its international affairs program until 1944. Marriage Esther Caukin married Stephen Brunauer (1903-1986) on July 8, 1931. He was an immigrant to the U.S. from Hungary, trained as a chemist, who had belonged to the Young Workers' League, a Communist front, until 1927. In the 1930s he worked as a research scientist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. During World War II he joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and led its high explosives research group. He gained the rank of commander before changing his status to that of a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy in 1944. The Atomic Energy Commission denied him a security clearance because of his earlier membership in the Young Workers' League, but he continued to work as a scientist for the U.S. Navy.Fried, Nightmare in Red, 23-5, 27 The Brunauers had a son who lived only a few months in 1934 and two daughters who were born in 1938 and 1942. American Association of University Women The Brunauers spent time in Germany on fellowships in 1933, during the Nazi seizure of power. Returning to the U.S., Esther Brunauer became an advocate for collective security in opposition to the pacifism of many women's rights advocates of the period. She headed a National Defense Study Commission that published a study of national defense in 1937 that the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations assessed in 1950 as \\"largely responsible for converting various pacifist organizations in this country and thus making possible an immediate program of rearmament\\". On behalf of the AAUW, she became a key figure in such organizational alliances as the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies and the Women's Action Committee for Victory and Lasting Peace. She campaigned on behalf of the AAUW for the relaxation of the U.S. Neutrality Acts. In 1941 she authored an attack on isolationism and appeasement, \\"Relationship of Foreign Policy to National Defense\\", that said: State Department Brunauer joined the U.S. State Department in March 1944 where she was responsible for international organizational affairs. She first worked on planning for post-war international cooperation, helping draft plans for the United Nations and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In 1945 she served as an adviser to the U.S. delegation at the conference that founded the United Nations. She was promoted to the rank of minister, the third U.S. woman to hold that State Department rank, and represented the U.S. at preparatory meetings of UNESCO and several of its overseas conferences.Fried, Nightmare in Red, 24 The isolationist Chicago Tribune criticized Esther Bruanuer for her internationalism as early as 1941. In 1947, Representative Fred Busbey attacked her by name when denouncing \\"pro- Communist fellow travelers and muddle heads\\" in the State Department. She passed a government security review in 1948. In 1950, when Senator Joseph McCarthy launched the anti-Communist crusade known by his name, he identified her as one of the State Department employees whose disloyalty he could prove. On March 13, 1950, when he narrowed his suspects from his early list of 81, he included her as one of nine he named to the Senate's Subcommittee on the Investigation of Loyalty of State Department Employees, commonly known as the Tydings Committee, which was investigating his charges.Fried, Nightmare in Red, 25 Among her defenders were Eleanor Lansing Dulles, a State Department official from a politically prominent family. and several AAUW officials. Milton Eisenhower wrote a letter in support of her, as did her neighbor former U.S. Senator Joe Ball, a Minnesota Republican, who wrote that Brunauer was \\"perhaps the most violently anti-Communist person I know\\". Brunauer herself had long supported the government's loyalty-security review program. In 1948 she had written: Testifying in front of the committee, she reported receiving anonymous telephone calls with \\"death threats and profanity\\". She said: \\"My husband is a loyal American ... an outspoken foe of Communism. I am a loyal American. I am not a Communist. I have never engaged in Communist activities. I never had any sympathy for a doctrine which conflicts with the basic principles of our American democracy.\\" The committee exonerated her in July, but she found some of her activities at the State Department curtailed.Fried, Nightmare in Red, 26 During her husband's years of federal government service, he had passed four security clearance investigations. In April 1951, while working as a high explosives expert, the U.S. Navy suspended his security clearance to conduct another review. As a consequence, the State Department suspended his wife and subjected her to another security review along with him. Stephen resigned from the Navy rather than allowed himself to be found disloyal or labelled a security risk. Esther persisted with the review and was forced from the State Department on June 16, 1952. News of her ouster only became public several months later. She showed the press the letter that said the action was based on the fact that she was a \\"security risk\\" but did not specify the grounds for that determination. She said she thought the \\"official reason\\" was her marriage but the real reason was \\"political expediency\\". She said she hoped the incoming Eisenhower administration would review the federal government's loyalty-security program \\"fearlessly and thoroughly\\". She once commented on the role of gender in her loyalty-security review after facing an all-male panel:Fried, Nightmare in Red, 28 Later years After leaving government service, she worked briefly for the Library of Congress and then relocated with her husband to Evanston, Illinois, in September 1952. She worked as associate director of the Film Council of America and then in publishing at Rand McNally and Follett Publishing. She died of a heart condition in Evanston on June 26, 1959.

He was raised at Dodon, the family plantation on the South River, near Annapolis, Maryland. Career As a young man Steuart served as clerk to the two Judges of the Land Office, his father George H.

After collecting fees that were larger than those designated by the lower house, Steuart was jailed.Brugger, Robert J., p.109, Maryland, A Middle Temperament: 1634-1980 Retrieved August 2010 In response to this Governor Robert Eden prorogued the assembly, freed Steuart, and removed him from the assembly's jurisdiction. The question of proprietarial fees was to cause considerable discontent among Marylanders during the years immediately preceding the American Revolution. =Revolutionary War= Steuart's family was divided by the Revolution. His father George H. Steuart was a Loyalist politician who, as an ally of the ruling Calvert family, had benefited from substantial political patronage. In addition Steuart held estates in both Maryland and Scotland and, at the outbreak of war, forced to make a choice between loyalty to the Crown and backing the Revolution, he sailed to Scotland, saying that he \\"could not turn rebel in his old age\\", and pragmatically dividing his property between his sons. William Steuart accompanied his father to Scotland in 1775 and returned to Maryland after the war was over. Despite this, according to the memoirs of his nephew Richard Sprigg Steuart, William Steuart was sympathetic to Revolutionary cause. \\"Uncle William was mild and conciliatory, rather Republican, but with too much respect for his father to say much\\".Nelker, 131, Memoirs of Richard Sprigg Steuart After the end of the war, Steuart inherited the family estate of Dodon, on the South River, near Annapolis, Maryland. He was a founder member of the Maryland Jockey Club, re-established after the war's end on Saturday, March 1, 1783, at Mr Mann's tavern in Annapolis. Club rules were set down including that the plate given by the club should be run on the first Tuesday of November, at Annapolis, that the prize money should be \\"sixty guineas\\", and that the annual subscription should be \\"three guineas\\".American Turf Register and Sporting Magazine, Volume 5, p.65 (1833).

It takes its name from Saint Munchin, the first Bishop of Limerick. According to tradition its church was the first cathedral of the diocese of Limerick, built in 561 AD. Location The parish lies partly in County Limerick and partly in County Clare. In County Limerick part of the parish is in the borough of Limerick and part in the barony of Pobblebrien. The part in County Clare is in the barony of Bunratty Lower. The parish is and covers in the borough of Limerick, in Pobblebrien and in Bunratty. The parish is divided into two parts by the intervening parishes of St. Nicholas and Killeely. The part of the city on King's Island is mostly in the parish. Antiquities The old church of St. Munchin's is said to have been built in 561, and to have once been the cathedral of the diocese of Limerick. Saint Munchin, the first Bishop of Limerick, is supposed to have been buried in the churchyard. According to tradition the church was burned by the Danes. There is an ancient stone near the north end of Thomond bridge called the treaty stone, since this is said to have been where the Treaty of Limerick was signed in 1691. King's island has the remains of an old Dominican friary. A nunnery was established nearby, and in 1837 the nuns taught girls at no charge in an attached school. The Church of Ireland built a church in 1827 near the site of the old church with a square tower surmounted by pinnacles. A layer of ashes was found under the foundation of the old church, which may confirm the story of the earlier burning. As of 1841 the total population was 4,593 in 537 houses. Townlands The Bunratty section includes the townlands of Ballycannan East, Ballycannon North, Ballycannan West, Cappateemore East, Cappateemore West, Glennagross, Gortgarraun, Knockalisheen and Mountgordon.

Aufr√®re was the eldest son of Anthony Aufr√®re (1730‚Äì1814), of Hoveton Hall, Norfolk, a landowner and magistrate,The miniature here is of his father. A portrait of the son (watercolours on ivory) by the Italian painter Gustavo Lazzarini, was acquired in 1972 by the Preservation Society of Newport County in the United States of America (Ref. RI010048) from a very large family of fifteen children- seven sons and eight daughters.Agnew‚Äôs Protestant Exiles from France, Chiefly in the Reign of Louis XIV: Or, The Huguenot Refugees and Their Descendants in Great Britain and Ireland(Turnbull & Spears, 1886), vol. 2, p.392. His mother was Anna Norris (1728‚Äì1816), only daughter of John Norris, of Witton, in the same county, and sister to John Norris, founder of the Norrisian professorship at Cambridge. The Aufr√®re family were of noble French lineage, and proud Protestant Huguenots who had left France on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. As the eldest child, his parents had in mind a legal career for their son, and he was admitted to Gray‚Äôs Inn in 1773 as a fifteen-year-old.\\"Jan 28.

Not much is known about his early life but he appears to have got into serious financial difficulties and his friend, the Reverend William Gunn (1750‚Äì1841), rector of Sloley, Norfolk, helped him out in 1781 with his debts. Aufr√®re was called to the Bar in February 1782.\\"Last week the Honourable Society of Gray‚Äôs Inn, called Jeremiah Church, John Matthews Grimwood, and Anthony Aufrere, Esquires, to the Degree of Barristers at Law.\\" St. James's Chronicle or the British Evening Post (London, England), 14 February 1782 ‚Äì 16 February 1782; Issue 3268.

He met up with his friend Gunn in Pisa, Italy, who was on a Grand Tour, and they both continued to Florence. According to Riviere, Gunn's biographer, Aufr√®re later settled in Florence in 1785. The American royalist Thomas Hall (1750‚Äì1824), chaplain to the British factory at Leghorn (Livorno), also an antiquary, wrote to Gunn in October 1785 about \\"news of Aufr√®re who lives at Pisa\\".NRO WGN 1/1/82 10 Oct 1785 T.

XXXIII, 1965, Part III, pp.351-378, & Part IV, pp.379-398; Riviere is extremely prejudiced towards Aufr√®re in his account here. In January 1786 Aufr√®re travelled to Naples, and he said himself that he visited Rome for the first time in the winter of 1786, as he recalled seeing Charlotte Stuart, Duchess of Albany there.Viator A to Mr. Urban, 23 Aug., Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine, Bd. 67, 1797, Pt. 2, p.1000 In 1787 it was reported that he was back in Florence, and in the same year he was also in Geneva, where he studied with the celebrated language teacher Monsieur de Rodon.We presume that he may have studied German in Geneva. Aufr√®re also speaks highly of his cousin, Philip DuVal Aufr√®re (died London 14 March 1808), who died at the age of 76, as \\"my kind friend and benefactor\\"(Genealogical Notes, op cit. p.,56); the son of his father‚Äôs sister Marieanne Aufr√®re. \\"He was educated at Westminster, Cambridge and G√∂ttingen, took orders, was Subpreceptor to some of the Royal family of England and at the time of his death was Dr of Divinity, Canon of Windsor, and Vicar of Twickenham.\\" His father was Dr Philip DuVal Aufr√®re, a French refugee physician, who had studied under Herman Boerhaave, and was first Physician to the Dowager Princess of Wales, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1719‚Äì1772) mother of King George the Third. Aufrere in Germany Soon after he visited Germany, he settled down in Stuttgart and befriended Karl Friedrich Emich Freiherr von Uxk√ºllUexk√ºll, is the old Livonian place-name √úxk√ºll on the Duina; according to the ADB he wrote his name Ixk√ºll; Aufr√®re writes Baron d'Uxk√ºll=Gyllenband (1755‚Äì1832), gentleman of the chamber to the Duke of Wirtemberg. He was a renowned art connoisseur and a generous patron. We know that it was the Baron who originally showed Aufr√®re, Herder‚Äôs essay on the great German humanist, knight, poet and pamphleteer, Ulrich von Hutten (1488‚Äì1523) that had been published in 1776 in Christoph Martin Wieland‚Äôs journal Der Teutsche Merkur and that he suggested to him to translate it, as this is all mentioned in the translator's preface dated (Stuttgardt 10 June 1788). title page of Aufrere's 1789 translation We presume that it was also the Baron that had assured him that this anonymously printed essay was from the pen of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, although this false attribution was widely shared in Germany, and the error was still being made by German professors of literature in the 1840s.See Wilhelm Kreutz, Die Deutschen und Ulrich von Hutten: Rezeption von Autor und Werk seit dem 16. Jahrhundert (1984), p.67. Aufr√®re is thus one of the earliest English translators of one of Herder's Sturm und Drang writings, albeit as a supposititious work.Wilhem Kreuz, \\"Ulrich von Hutten in der Franz√∂sischen und Angloamerikanischen Literatur. Ein Beitrag zur Rezeptionsgeschichte des deutschen Humanismus und der lutherischen Reformation\\", in: Francia. Forschungen zur westeurop√§ischen Geschichte, Bd. 11 1983‚Äì1984(Sigmaringen 1983.-1984) S.633. It is clear, however, from his preface, that he was proud to have translated this work: \\"I trust that I am not deceived in my hopes and wishes, that this publication may prove grateful to the public, and may induce some to make farther enquiries into the particulars of the life of Hutten, and of his contemporaries, with which is interwoven a very interesting event in the history of mankind; nor can I help thinking that I am doing a pleasure to such as take delight in elegant and classic literature. Should I fail in my wishes in these respects, I still hope that my endeavours to make known in England the merits of a great and a virtuous man, will shelter me from censure, and that the defects in the execution will be pardoned in favour of the intention.\\" [A Tribute to the Memory of Hutten (1789), Preface of the Translator, p.xi] Marriage in London, 1791 Aufr√®re returned to England early 1791 and set about preparations for his marriage. At St George's, Hanover Square, in the fashionable London district of Mayfair, on 19 February he married Countess of the Empire, Marianne Matilda Lockhart (10 October 1774 ‚Äì 14 September 1850), the only surviving daughter of General James Lockhart, of Lee and Carnwath in Lanarkshire, Scotland, who had been a general in the service of Empress Maria Theresa. The Empress had raised him to the dignity of a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire and had decorated him with military orders. In his later years he had been attached to the household of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Lockhart had died in Pisa on 6 February 1790.His actual tomb is at Dryden, Scotland, and has the following inscription: 'James Lockhart Wishart, of Lee and Carnwath, Lord of the Bedchamber to his Imperial Majesty Joseph the Second, Emperor of Germany, Knight of the Order of Maria Teresa, Count of the Holy Roman Empire, and General of the Imperial, Royal, and Apostolical Armies, died at Pisa, in Italy, VIth February, MDCCXC, in the LXIVth year of his age.' Marianne is also buried there. Aufr√®re and Marianne had almost certainly met in Pisa in 1785 as his friend William Gunn had already been introduced to father and daughter and, as he wrote somewhat begrudgingly, it was expected of him to spend the evenings at the houses of the three English families there.Riviere (1965), op.cit. After the marriage the Aufr√®re family chose to live abroad in Heidelberg, Germany, possibly for financial reasons, and in the following year their daughter Louisa Anna Matilda (17 November 1792 ‚Äì 1868) was also born there. There is a letter of Aufr√®re's to Gunn from Heidelberg dated 1 May 1793 but it is claimed that they had later moved to Mannheim, as his friend William Gunn and his family ‚Äì returning from his second Grand Tour ‚Äì met up with him there on 26 September, where they hired a barge and went sailing down the Rhine. In 1794 a son George Anthony (18 June 1794 ‚Äì 6 May 1881) was born.The daughter Louisa Anna Matilda later married in 1818 George Barclay (1790‚Äì1869), Esq., a merchant of New York, by whom she had a daughter Matilda Antonia Barclay (born in New York 7 December 1824 ‚Äì 1888) she married Francis Robert Rives (1822‚Äì1891) their son George Lockhart Rives later published the Genealogical Notes; and George Anthony married at Hamburg in 1828 Caroline Wehrtmann (died 1885), the second daughter of a Hamburg merchant, John Michael Wehrtmann, of Hamburg and of Osterrade in the Duchy of Holstein. There followed the publication of his Travels (1795) that has the translator‚Äôs preface signed \\"Newton, near Chester, February, 1795.\\" It was pitched in the newspaper classified ads as \\"a proper Supplement to Mr. Henry Swinburne's Travels in the Two Sicilies\\" so a work firmly belonging to that genre of the travel book influencing and encouraging the Grand Tour. In 1798 appeared his popular anti-revolutionary pamphlet A Warning to Briton's (1798)This work has recently been described as \\"One of the most widely circulated pieces of atrocity literature from this period\\" Catriona Kennedy, Narratives of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars: Military and Civilian Experience in Britain and Ireland (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), p.162. Aufr√®re also had in mind the translation of German work, and had written to his publishers Cadell & Davies in 1799: \\"As I hate to be idle I have some thoughts of employing my few leisure hours in a free translation & alteration of a German Novel, with additional portraits of some characters within the sphere of my own observations- & if I follow it up, as I now think I shall, I shall have it ready by next spring, & will send it you for perusal, & for publication if you think it will take.\\"Letter from Aufr√®re, Ipswich 5 August 1799, to Messrs. Cadell & Davies, Strand, London, [NRO: MC 486/1, 747X7 ] It appears that the novel was never published or finished. Imprisonment in France, 1802‚Äì1814 According to the Genealogical Notes, compiled by George Lockhart Rives (1849‚Äì1917), but based on Aufr√®re's own MS, it says \\"He and his family went to France in 1802 and were among the English prisoners seized by Napoleon at the rupture of the Treaty of Amiens in May, 1803. They were in consequence forced to spend eleven years in France chiefly at Verdun and Avignon.\\"\\"Of the Aufr√®re Family\\" in Genealogical Notes. Collected by George Lockhart Rives. (New York, 1914) pp.50-61. As GLR writes \\"This account of the Aufr√®re Family, and the account of the Lockhart Family below, were written by my great-grandfather, Anthony Aufr√®re, in 1830; and they are here reproduced from his MS, in my possession, without verification and without material alteration‚Ä¶.\\" It appears that the manuscript is based originally on a work by Anthony Norris, of Barton, Norfolk, his maternal uncle, that came into his possession after his death in 1785. Aufr√®re made some corrections and additions to it, adding the Aufr√®re and Lockhart families.(Ibid., preface, p.iii.) After the death of George Anthony Aufr√®re in 1881, they came into Rives' possession. This is now deposited in the Rives - Barclay Family Papers, 1698‚Äì1941 collection, held at The Library of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia. John Henry Lawrence (1773‚Äì1840), a fellow d√®tenu who knew them both at Verdun and also moved to Orleans in July 1808, reported \\"Mr. and Mrs. Aufr√®re left Verdun in September, 1805, for Orleans, but generally resided in the neighbourhood, at the little town of Beaugency till July, 1808, when they received permission to remove at their option to Moulins, Lions, or Avignon.\\"A picture of Verdun, or the English detained in France; their arrestation, detention at Fontainbleau and Valenciennes, confinement at Verdun, incarceration at Bitsche, amusements, sufferings, indulgences granted to some, acts of extortion and cruelty practised on others, characters of General and Madame Wirion, list of those who have been permitted to leave or who have escaped out of France, occasional poetry, and anecdotes of the principal detenus. From the Portfolio of a Detenu. In two volumes. (London) Vol. 2, 1810, p.125. Lawrence gave a charming description of Mrs Aufr√®re confronting the commandant's wife, Madame la Generale Wirion at Verdun.\\"Mrs. Aufrere (daughter to Count Lockhart, a general in Maria Theresa's service) appeared one evening at a party with a handkerchief twisted round her head like a turban. Madame Wirion invited her to come and take coffee with her the next morning. Mrs. Aufrere made some excuse.‚Äî\\" Well then, if you breakfast upon tea, I will give you tea.\\" Mrs. Aufrere made a second excuse. \\"Well then,\\" said Madame Wirion, losing all patience, \\" if you like neither coffee nor tea, I will tell you the plain truth. The manner in which your handkerchief is put on pleases me, and I am invited out to dinner to-morrow, 'so I wish you would come and put on my handkerchief in the same manner.\\" Most of our fair countrywomen were by this time so humbled, that they would have complied; but the Caledonian blood of the Countess of the holy Roman empire boiled at the idea of becoming the tire-woman to the Citoienne Generale. She knew what she owed to the dignity of a gentlewoman, and had the spirit to refuse.\\"vol. I, 1810, p.160-161. Lawrence later sent Goethe his MS. of the play The Englishman at Verdun; or the Prisoner of Peace. A drama in 5 acts (1813). He asked Goethe to consider it for a performance at the theatre in Weimar, and in a long letter from 13 April 1816 suggested to him numerous deletions and possible alterations to the adapted play.(See Letter from Lawrence to Goethe, 13 April 1816, in D.F.S. Scott, Some English correspondents of Goethe(London, 1949)pp.25-28.) Goethe wrote to Lawrence on the same day as he returned the MS., regretting that he did not feel able to produce the play in Weimar, because the happenings were still too fresh in the public mind.\\"(Scott, Ibid., p.30). While at Avignon Aufr√®re was involved with the distribution of 'charitable succours', as aid was then called, for two neighbouring depots of British prisoners of war. Return to Norwich, 1814 In the year of his release from imprisonment, his father died (11 September 1814) and, as eldest son, he inherited Hoveton Hall and the considerable estates. His mother died less than two years later (11 April 1816). According to Riviere it was Aufr√®re who got Humphry Repton (1752‚Äì1818), the architect and landscape gardener \\"to make some drawings for a new house there.\\"Riviere, op. cit. p.353. \\"new\\" Hoveton Hall was built between 1809 and 1812. In 1817 he mortgaged 241 acres in Hoveton, St. John to Robert Baker, in 1828 Aufr√®re sold the Hoveton estate to Christabell Burroughes as well as land allotted under the Hoveton Inclosure Bill after Aufr√®re's own petition to Parliament, where he is named: \\"Anthony Aufrere, Esquire, Lord of the Manor of Smallburgh\\",See the Journals of the House of Commons, vol. 70, 6 March 1815, p.140, When he was in England he resided at Old Foulsham Hall, Norfolk, which is now a grade II listed building,Old Hall Farm House, Foulsham, http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-227807-old-hall-farm-house- foulsham-norfolk that was previously the home of Major General Philip Skippon, Commander of Parliamentary Forces at the battle of Naseby.

In his last will & testament, in a last codicil written at Pisa 22 January 1833, Aufr√®re wrote \\"I desire to be interred in the English burial ground at Leghorn as near as possible to the Lockhart monuments...\\" He also stipulated his inscription on a plain monumental stone: \\"Anthony Aufr√®re Esquire of Foulsham Old Hall in the county of Norfolk upwards of 48 years in the Commission of the Peace for that county.\\"The National Archives, Kew, PROB 11/1850/139 (Will of Anthony Aufr√®re of Pisa, Italy) His wife survived him seventeen years and died at Edinburgh, on 14 September 1850.

Jones HCR 3\\". The Uncle Sam billboard is a billboard directly adjacent to the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 near Chehalis, Washington, in the United States. Description and history The two-sided billboard, which depicts Uncle Sam, is located beside the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 (I-5), near Exit 72 in Chehalis. Since the 1970s, Alfred Hamilton used the sign to promote his \\"archconservative views in big block letters\\". Since Hamilton's death in 2004, his grandson has continued the billboard's conservative messages and upkeep. I-5 motorists have been called a \\"captive audience\\", as congestion often causes traffic jams between Portland, Oregon and Seattle, both generally considered liberal. In 2003, an average of 50,000 motorists drove the stretch daily, including northbound and southbound. Hamilton began posting messages after I-5 was constructed across his turkey farm in the early 1960s. The first message he and his wife, Ruth, posted was based on their anger towards the government for funding welfare programs. Hamilton further resented the government for interfering with his ability to lease billboard space following Lady Bird Johnson's Highway Beautification Act. The New York Times described Hamilton as a \\"cranky crusader\\" who \\"loved a fight\\" and a \\"stubborn man, a turkey farmer with a big belly full of opinions\\". According to the paper, \\"Mr. Hamilton minced no words in attacking virtually everything and everyone that irritated him: gun control, the government and gays, Russians and radicals, Kissinger and Kerry.\\" One of his friends recalled Hamilton's belief that \\"all Democrats were 'damn fools'\\", saying: \\"In many instances ‚Äì and we were pretty close ‚Äì I warned people not to get into discussions of religion and politics with him. He was so set in his ways that it was unusual.\\" The billboard was moved and reconstructed occasionally due to conflicts with the state and federal government. In 1995, The Seattle Times reported that Hamilton had sold his of land between Centralia and Chehalis, and that the sign and other buildings on the land would be removed. The land had been in the Hamilton family since 1945. He and his wife moved to Alaska but continued to own nearby land. In the year leading up to the sale, billboard messages were changed once a month; before then, they were changed weekly. The billboard was moved to its current site just inside the Napavine, Washington city limits in 1996. Hamilton has said: \\"I'm not trying to convert anyone to my way of thinking. But I want to make people think.\\" He died in November 2004 at the age of 84. His survivors, who claimed that they did not necessarily share all of his opinions, were unsure if they would continue to use the billboard for political purposes. Hamilton's son said, \\"I know the billboard had a lot of repercussions politically, from the state and the feds on down, because he voiced his opinions and sometimes he stepped on toes.\\" Messages The billboard, which reads \\"In the race for president can I just vote no?\\" (pictured in October 2007) Billboard messages have targeted abortion, big government, and homosexuality. Some messages which have appeared on the sign include: * \\"Be thankful you live in America\\" (1974) * \\"Bill Caruth tells why you must stick to your guns\\" (1978), referring to opposition of gun control * \\"Hasn't Gregoire cost taxpayers plenty of $ $ in boo-boos?\\", referring to Democratic politician Christine Gregoire (2004) * \\"Let's keep the Canal and give them Kissinger\\" (1970s) The Henry Kissinger message was Hamilton's favorite. The Gregoire one marked his last before he died. Reception The billboard has received a mixed reaction. Hamilton once said that feedback to the sign had been \\"95 percent positive\\". However, in 1985, he told The Oregonian that he had received threats over the sign, and The Seattle Times reported that someone once attempted to burn it down. The New York Times called the billboard \\"a kind of grouchy chronicle of one man's one-sided take on things.\\" Following Hamilton's death, one editorial contributor for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote, \\"We thought the billboards cranky, but worth looking at. That billboard is what makes America better because it celebrates a founding principle of our nation, the First Amendment. We completely disagree with Hamilton's view of the world, but praise his discourse.\\" The editorial began with the phrase \\"Uncle Sam is no more\\", but ended with, \\"Forget what we said above.

In addition to improving subjective audio quality, echo suppression increases the capacity achieved through silence suppression by preventing echo from traveling across a telecommunications network. Echo suppressors were developed in the 1950s in response to the first use of satellites for telecommunications, but they have since been largely supplanted by better performing echo cancellers. Echo suppression and cancellation methods are commonly called acoustic echo suppression (AES) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), and more rarely line echo cancellation (LEC). In some cases, these terms are more precise, as there are various types and causes of echo with unique characteristics, including acoustic echo (sounds from a loudspeaker being reflected and recorded by a microphone, which can vary substantially over time) and line echo (electrical impulses caused by, e.g., coupling between the sending and receiving wires, impedance mismatches, electrical reflections, etc., which varies much less than acoustic echo). In practice, however, the same techniques are used to treat all types of echo, so an acoustic echo canceller can cancel line echo as well as acoustic echo. AEC in particular is commonly used to refer to echo cancelers in general, regardless of whether they were intended for acoustic echo, line echo, or both. Although echo suppressors and echo cancellers have similar goals--preventing a speaking individual from hearing an echo of their own voice--the methods they use are different: * Echo suppressors work by detecting a voice signal going in one direction on a circuit, and then muting or attenuating the signal in other direction. Usually, the echo suppressor at the far end of the circuit does this muting when it detects voice coming from the near-end of the circuit. This muting prevents the speaker from hearing their own voice returning from the far end. * Echo cancellation involves first recognizing the originally transmitted signal that re-appears, with some delay, in the transmitted or received signal. Once the echo is recognized, it can be removed by subtracting it from the transmitted or received signal. This technique is generally implemented digitally using a digital signal processor or software, although it can be implemented in analog circuits as well. ITU standards G.168 and P.340 describe requirements and tests for echo cancellers in digital and PSTN applications, respectively.  History  In telephony, echo is the reflected copy of one's voice heard some time later. If the delay is fairly significant (more than a few hundred milliseconds), it is considered annoying. If the delay is very small (10s of milliseconds or less), the phenomenon is called sidetone. If the delay is slightly longer, around 50 milliseconds, humans cannot hear the echo as a distinct sound, but instead hear a chorus effect. In the earlier days of telecommunications, echo suppression was used to reduce the objectionable nature of echos to human users. One person speaks while the other listens, and they speak back and forth. An echo suppressor attempts to determine which is the primary direction and allows that channel to go forward. In the reverse channel, it places attenuation to block or suppress any signal on the assumption that the signal is echo. Although the suppressor effectively deals with echo, this approach leads to several problems which may be frustrating for both parties to a call. * Double-talk: It is fairly normal in conversation for both parties to speak at the same time, at least briefly. Because each echo suppressor will then detect voice energy coming from the far-end of the circuit, the effect would ordinarily be for loss to be inserted in both directions at once, effectively blocking both parties. To prevent this, echo suppressors can be set to detect voice activity from the near-end speaker and to fail to insert loss (or insert a smaller loss) when both the near-end speaker and far-end speaker are talking. This, of course, temporarily defeats the primary effect of having an echo suppressor at all. * Clipping: Since the echo suppressor is alternately inserting and removing loss, there is frequently a small delay when a new speaker begins talking that results in clipping the first syllable from that speaker's speech. * Dead-set: If the far-end party on a call is in a noisy environment, the near-end speaker will hear that background noise while the far-end speaker is talking, but the echo suppressor will suppress this background noise when the near-end speaker starts talking. The sudden absence of the background noise gives the near-end user the impression that the line has gone dead. In response to this, Bell Labs developed echo canceler theory in the early 1960s, which then resulted in laboratory echo cancelers in the late 1960s and commercial echo cancelers in the 1980s. An echo canceller works by generating an estimate of the echo from the talker's signal, and subtracts that estimate from the return path. This technique requires an adaptive filter to generate a signal accurate enough to effectively cancel the echo, where the echo can differ from the original due to various kinds of degradation along the way. Since invention at AT&T; Bell Labs echo cancellation algorithms have been improved and honed. Like all echo cancelling processes, these first algorithms were designed to anticipate the signal which would inevitably re- enter the transmission path, and cancel it out. Rapid advances in digital signal processing allowed echo cancellers to be made smaller and more cost- effective. In the 1990s, echo cancellers were implemented within voice switches for the first time (in the Northern Telecom DMS-250) rather than as standalone devices. The integration of echo cancellation directly into the switch meant that echo cancellers could be reliably turned on or off on a call-by-call basis, removing the need for separate trunk groups for voice and data calls. Today's telephony technology often employs echo cancellers in small or handheld communications devices via a software voice engine, which provides cancellation of either acoustic echo or the residual echo introduced by a far-end PSTN gateway system; such systems typically cancel echo reflections with up to 64 milliseconds delay. Operation hybrid transformer, is to route incoming speech from the far end xk to the local telephone and route speech from the telephone to the far end. However, the hybrid is never perfect, so its output dk contains both the desired speech from the local telephone plus filtered speech from the far end. The echo canceller is the adaptive filter fk, which attempts to minimize the error signal Œµk by filtering the incoming far end speech into a replica yk of the far end speech that leaks through the hybrid. Once the adaption is complete, the error signal consists mostly of speech from the local telephone. The echo cancellation process works as follows: # A far-end signal is delivered to the system. # The far-end signal is reproduced. # The far-end signal is filtered and delayed to resemble the near-end signal. # The filtered far-end signal is subtracted from the near-end signal. # The resultant signal represents sounds present in the room excluding any direct or reverberated sound. The primary challenge for an echo canceller is determining the nature of the filtering to be applied to the far-end signal such that it resembles the resultant near-end signal. The filter is essentially a model of speaker, microphone and the room's acoustical attributes. Echo cancellers must be adaptive because the characteristics of the near-end's speaker and microphone are generally not known in advance. The acoustical attributes of the near- end's room are also not generally known in advance, and may change (e.g., if the microphone is moved relative to the speaker, or if individuals walk around the room causing changes in the acoustic reflections). By using the far-end signal as the stimulus, modern systems use an adaptive filter and can converge from providing no cancellation to 55 dB of cancellation in around 200 ms. Until recently echo cancellation only needed to apply to the voice bandwidth of telephone circuits. PSTN calls transmit frequencies between 300 Hz and 3 kHz, the range required for human speech intelligibility. Videoconferencing is one area where full bandwidth audio is used. In this case, specialized products are employed to perform echo cancellation. Because echo suppression has known limitations, in an ideal situation, echo cancellation alone will be used. However, this is insufficient in many applications, notably software phones on networks with long delay and meager throughput. Here, echo cancellation and suppression can work in conjunction to achieve acceptable performance. =Quantifying echo= Echo is measured as ' (ERL). This is the ratio, expressed in decibels, of original and it's echo. High values mean the echo is very weak, while low values mean the echo is very strong. Negative indicate the echo is stronger than the original signal, which if left unchecked would cause audio feedback. The performance of an echo canceller is measured in echo return loss enhancement (ERLE), which is the amount of additional signal loss applied by the echo canceller. Most echo cancellers are able to apply 18 to 35 dB ERLE. The total signal loss of the echo (ACOM) is the sum of the ERL and ERLE.  Current uses  Sources of echo are found in everyday surroundings such as: * Hands-free car phone systems * A standard telephone or cellphone in speakerphone mode * Dedicated standalone speakerphones * Installed conference room systems which use ceiling speakers and microphones on the table * Physical coupling where vibrations of the loudspeaker transfer to the microphone via the handset casing In some of these cases, sound from the loudspeaker enters the microphone almost unaltered. The difficulties in canceling echo stem from the alteration of the original sound by the ambient space. These changes can include certain frequencies being absorbed by soft furnishings and reflection of different frequencies at varying strength. Implementing AEC requires engineering expertise and a fast processor, usually in the form of a digital signal processor (DSP), this cost in processing capability may come at a premium, however, many embedded systems do have a fully functional AEC. Smart speakers and interactive voice response systems that accept speech for input use AEC while speech prompts are played to prevent the system's own speech recognition from falsely recognizing the echoed prompts and other output. =Modems= Standard telephone lines use the same pair of wires to both send and receive audio, which results in a small amount of the outgoing signal being reflected back. This is useful for people talking on the phone, as it provides a signal to the speaker that their voice is making it through the system. However, this reflected signal causes problems for a modem, which is unable to distinguish between a signal from the remote modem and the echo of its own signal. For this reason, earlier modems split the signal frequencies, so that the devices on either end used different tones, allowing each one to ignore any signals in the frequency range it was using for transmission. However, this diminished the amount of bandwidth available to both sides. Echo cancellation mitigated this problem. During the call setup and negotiation period, both modems send a series of unique tones and then listen for them to return through the phone system. They measure the total delay time, then configure a delay line for that same period. Once the connection is completed, they send their signals into the phone lines as normal, but also into the delay line. When their signal is reflected back, it is mixed with the inverted signal from the delay line, which cancels out the echo. This allowed both modems to use the full spectrum available, doubling the possible speed. Echo cancellation is also applied by many telcos to the line itself, and can cause data corruption rather than improving the signal. Some telephone switches or converters (such as analog terminal adapters) disable echo suppression or echo cancellation when they detect the 2100 or 2225 Hz answer tones associated with such calls, in accordance with ITU-T recommendation G.164 or G.165. After the turn of the century, DSL modems also made extensive use of automated echo cancellation. Though they used separate incoming and outgoing frequencies, these frequencies were beyond the voiceband for which the cables were designed, and often suffered attenuation distortion due to bridge taps and incomplete impedance matching. Deep, narrow frequency gaps often resulted, that could not be made usable by echo cancellation. These were detected and mapped out during connection negotiation.

History The Jobawa were reportedly the First Fula people to make contact with the central Sudan thus sparking the possibility of them being a Pre-Tengualla Fulani migration from the primordial Fula body. At some point during the 14th century the Jobawa emerged as a power in the East of the Sultanate of Kano and shortly afterward became the natural heirs to the Makama of Kano ( an office they still hold to this day). Jihad period During the Fulani jihads of the 19th century the jobawa were instrumental to the pacification of the Sultanate of Kano. A switching of allegiance by Muhammadu Bakatsine, the then Makama of Kano and Magajin Jobe at the epic battle of 'Daukar Girma' turned the tide of the Kano campaigns in favour of the Fulanis. Bakatsine was later to become one of the Seven Founding fathers of the Kano Emirate ensuring for the Jobe a place in the newly founded Sokoto Caliphate. However after the jihad, the leadership of the New Kano Emirate was given to the rival clan of Sullubawa under Suleman Abu Hama, but as recompense, Mandikko Ibn Bakatsine, the son of Muhammadu Bakatsine was made the first Madaki of the Kano Emirate. The Jobe also retained control of the office of Makama and much of Eastern Kano except for the Fortresses of Gaya and Birnin Kudu, making them custodians of more than two - thirds of the emirate.

The first couple, Wamaj and Raima to an upper- middle-class family and have been married for the past eight years despite their hatred for each other, and second couple Abrar(bunty) and Manahil(bubbly) who love each other. In the start it is shown that Bunty's family lives in the portion of Manahils house as their Renters. Manahil and Abrar want to marry each soon as possible but they can't due to Abrar's elder sister Seher who is not yet married because of her weird character and wants herself to be married as she is going beyond the marriage age, however a marriage proposal comes for her which as usual got denied. A marriage proposal comes for Seher but she is rejected. Manahil tries to make love relationship between Seher and an old shop keeper (Rasheed) but fails as bunty(abrar) sees the shopkeeper and Seher together. Manahil and Seher are now good friends, Manahil is advising tips for Seher so she can get married soon. Raima and Wajmaj are married from past eight years and hate each other they can not divorce each other because the one who attempts to divorce will not be the part of the will signed by their parents. Raima tries to put some black magic on Wajmaj so he can divorce her, and Wajmaj pretends that he is drunk in front of Raima and makes her made Zareena dance seeing this Raima thinks that Wajmaj has gone crazy and changes her plan for putting black magic. =Episodes 6-8= Finally a marriage proposal comes for Seher and she is accepted for the marriage seeing this bubbly and bunty and the whole family are very happy, Raima makes a plan to show Wajmaj that she is interested on another man by doing so she takes her friend Numra's husband on a lunch. Wajmaj is doing the same thing but while he is flirting with a girl it is shown that the girl is a thief who takes away Wajmaj's cell phone, car and wallet, Namra sees her husband and Raima together while they are having dinner. She gets very angry and sends her husband away, Raima handles the condition and tells her that she was treating his as a friend in reality but in front of Wajmaj she would have treated him as his date. Numra. Numra advises Raima to date another guy from his boutique, while Wajmaj's friend advises him to date someone from his office. Raima tries to date Bunty and tells him that she just wants herself to be divorced which he fully rejects, while Wajmaj on the other hand asks Manahil to be his date only in front of Raima because of which Manahil gets angry and rejects. Inlaws of Seher are asking for about 2 lack rupees which can not be afforded because of which Bunty, Seher and their Mom are really depressed seeing this Manahil's Mother is also feeling sorry for them. Manahil asks her mother for her marriage which her mom fully rejects, she tells her that she will only let her marry after four years when her sibling are mature enough to earn. Seeing all of the conditions Manahil and Abrar are very depressed and have no choice but to accept their bosses. Abrar tells Manahil that he will work for Raima in order to get more money and get Seher's Marriage done, Manahil tells him that if she works for Wajmaj She can get more Money So he tells her that she should Work for Wajmaj so she can get more money and save it and after some time she can she that money to her mom so she can't blame her for her job, and there would be enough money for their marriage. Abrar agrees to work for Raima and gets more pay he gives it to his Mother who then gives it to Seher's in-laws. Seher's marriage takes place and everyone is very happy it is also shown that Seher knows about Manahil and Abrar's relationship and instead of being angry she want them to marry soon. Seher gets married and every thing is settled. Manahil agrees to work with Wajmaj, and now Abrar is working for Raima while Manahil is working for Wajmaj. =Episode 9-12= Raima and Wajmaj are now planning to make each other feel jealous, by this Wajmaj invites Manahil to his house and Raima decides to spend her whole day with Abrar before this process Raima takes Abrar for shopping so he can look more decent and same happens with Manahi and Wajmaj. Abrar's Mother(Zainab) wants him to marry someone by this she invited people for bringing marriage proposal but later rejects as Abrar denies. Manahil comes to Wajmajs house and tries to make Raima jealous by showing her that she cares a lot for Wajmaj, but Raima is not jealous same happens with Wajmaj after Raima receives flowers and is going out with Abrar. Seher's husband sees Abrar with Raima and tells her about his affair, Seher asks Abrar about this and he handles the situation by saying that he treats Raima as his sister. Manahil's mother (Asiya) is suspicious about Manahil and spies on her she sees Manahil with Wajmaj and thinks that both are having a love affair. After that she takes her home and asks her that she should marry Wajmaj. When Wajmaj takes a fake marriage proposal to her house and lies to Asiya that he is around 80 years and is married to a women before, Asiya rejects this Proposal. After looking at Raima's Wealth Seher tells Zainab about her and tells her that through her they can be rich. Zainab then invites Raima to her house and now Seher and Zainab are treating Raima as their family members and this attitude of theirs is annoying Raima. Wajmaj and Raima Both comes to know their plan about their Affair. =Episode 13-17= After knowing about their love affairs Raima and Wahaj do not care about themselves. Seher wants Raima to marry her brother-in-law Khudbudeen whom Raima hates and after knowing this she can't do anything. Manahils Mom wants her to marry Wahaj and after she meet Raima Raima tells her that she is fully okay with the marriage, Abrar's mom thinks that Manahils Mom is interested in Wajmaj Raima thinks that Abrar is useless and making him work with her is a waste of time and she tells Abrar to quit, Same is happening with Wajmaj and Manahil every one thinks that Manahil has a bad character and Wajmaj is telling her to quit. Manahil's mom is not telling Manahil to marry Wamaj. Manahil and Abrar lose their jobs. Khudbudeen tells Seher and Abrar's mother that Abrar has married Raima and they both hit him a lot and order him to leave the house. But his mother soon takes him inside though Seher does not want Abrar. Soon Raima and Wamaj gets an invitation to their uncle's daughter's marriage, and when they are getting back Raima gets shot. Wamaj takes care of her in the hospital, and Raima falls in love with him. After Abrar is forgiven, Seher and his Mom believes him that he is true, Manahil finally tells her mom that she is not in love with Wajmaj and she was only working for him seeing this her mom gets emotional and hugs her. Seher's husband starts blaming her that her brother is a spoilt boy and is not talking to her seeing this Seher's mother gets emotional just then Manahil's enters and seeing her she also gets emotional in conclusion both mothers crying thinking that both of their daughters are unlucky that they have such mothers. Manahil and Abrar are not talking to each other while Raima and Wajmaj have fallen in deep love. Numra(Raima's friend) tells her that Wahaj is acting to be a good man but in reality he just wants her to take divorce same is happening with Wahaj that his friend is telling him the same thing, because of this big misunderstanding Raima now is telling Abrar to work for him by bringing her and Wahaj close and by telling him that Manahil is a fraud and only loves his money, Wahaj is telling Manahil the Same and exactly thing to do, but this time Manahil and Abrar are not working for them and their answer is NO! =Episode 18= Because of their jobs, Manahil and Abrar are not talking with each other. After asking Abrar for help Raima starts to cry because of which Abrar is ready to do her work that is ti tell Wahaj that a Manahil has a bad character same is Happening with Wahaj and Manahil and Manahil also agree. Wahaj and Manahil are waiting in the park Wahaj is telling her that Raima would be here no time so she would start doing her practice. Raima was actually following Wahaj when she reaches there with Abrar she asks him that he should be going and should start what he was told. Both Manahil and Abrar see each other (Abrar with Raima and Manahil with Wajmaj) because of that both are really depressed. There on the other hand Seher and Zainab(her and Abrar's mom) are in Manahil's house for the marriage proposal of Manahil and Abrar both families agree to this and are now very happy. Aasiya (Manahil's mom) tells her the news but instead of asking who she is to marry Manahil agrees. When she finds out that it was Abrar she fully Denies the proposal. Only because of their sake, Wahaj and Raima have destroyed Manahil and Abrar's relationship without knowing that they are in love or even without thinking that they know each other. When Manahil and Abrar come face to face they get into argument because of which Manhil holds her collar and hits him both are fighting so weirdly that their mothers came and are holding them to stay back. =Episode 19= The Episode starts with Wahaj, it shows that he is talking to his friend and he says that he can do anything to get Raima back and he can also kill Abrar his friend Calms im and tells him to be patient. The next morning Raima goes to Manahil's home and humiliates her badly while standing on the front gate, Manahil tries to tell her the truth which she fully denies to listen, she tells her that she has a very bad character and that she should back off from Wahaj, Manahil warns her and tells her that before telling her what to do she should look inside herself and asks her that what sort of a woman would want her husband back while dating another young man? Raima gets confuse tells her to shut up and leaves. The Next day it is shown that Wahaj pays a beating gang an amount of money to beat Abrar but not badly, so for this the beating gang beat Abrar while reaching home Abrar tells the whole story to his mother and to Seher and tells them that Manahil has done this seeing this there love burns while there hater grows for Manahil. On the other hand, it was shown that Manahil tells her mom about Abrar that he is in love with Raima her mom gets very angry and starts hating Abrar. The Next day Story focuses on a comedic fight it is shown that Manahil's family and Abrar's family are shouting at each other and are teamed up it shows that first they argue with each other and then they start fighting with ash other after that it is shown that both hate each other a lot. it is also shown that Wahaj is talking to his lawyer to arrange divorce papers for him. Here the Story takes 2 months leap and shows that Raima is Talking to Numra, she tells her that she madly love Wahaj butshe will only be happy when he will be happy which she thinks can be fulfilled by his marriage with Manahil same is happening with Wahaj. The leap also focuses on Manahil and Abrar's life that both have there families have gained anger against each other Next morning Wahaj tells Raima to sign Divorce papers she thinks he is doing this for Manahil while both have a talk about each other there Plan for making each other jealous is opened so all the miss-understanding is cleared and both laugh out there problems and are very happy while laughing loudly Zareena hears them laughing and tells Wahaj's servant Sharfu that both can never love each other and can never even sit with each other so there's only one thing left that they are mentally ill so both Sharfu and Zareena run away. Next morning Wahaj and Raima are enjoying there breakfast and talk about Abrar and Manahil that because of them there love storey is hurt. Wahaj tries to talk to Abrar whom he ignores same happens with Raima and Manahil. =Episode 20 (Last Episode)= This was the last episode of the show, the episode starts with Wahaj and Raima it shows that both are still worried for Manahil and Abrar.

The fossils are regarded as evidence of the earliest form of multicellular life. The fossils were discovered by an international team led by the Moroccan- French geologist Abderrazak El Albani, of the University of Poitiers, France. While the fossils have yet to be assigned to a formal taxonomic position, they have been informally and collectively referred to as the \\"Gabonionta\\" by the Natural History Museum Vienna in 2014.Experiment Life ‚Äì the Gabonionta. (Press Release). 4 March 2014. Naturhistorisches Museum Wien Morphology A member of the Francevillian biota. Maximum fossil diameter= 12 cm The fossil organisms are up to 17 cm in size. Their bodies were flattened disks with a characteristic morphology, including circular and elongated individuals. A spherical to ellipsoidal central body is bounded by radial structures. The fossils show three-dimensionality and coordinated growth. Cell-cell communication must be assumed as it existed before multi-cellularity arose. A newer 2014 study by El Albani et al. describes multiple types of fossils with different morphologies. There are convoluted tubes, and \\"string of pearls\\"-like structures that terminate in a \\"flower\\". This is similar to dictyostelid slime molds, amoebal organisms that form multicellular assemblies to migrate. However, dictyostelids are terrestrial, not marine organisms so the structures cannot simply be dictyostelids. Among known fossils, the Ediacaran Nemiana and Beltanelloides are most similar. Locality Geology of the Francevillian basin The findings come from shales of the Franceville basin with a high fossil density of up to 40 individuals per square meter. Presumably, the organisms survived at the bottom in shallow sea water in colonies. The geochemistry of the fossil site indicates that they lived on the sediment under an oxygenated water column of a prograding delta, and they might have engaged in aerobic respiration. Interpretations In describing the fossils, El Albani and colleagues described them as colonial organisms with possible affinities to eukaryotes, akin to microbial mats, albeit unlike any known structures in the fossil record, yet noting the complexity of the fossils and presence of sterane as suggestive of possible eukaryote identity. In a concurrent news report in Nature, paleontologist Philip Donoghue of Bristol University advocates a more conservative approach pending further evidence before calling them eukaryotes. Another view, held by Yale's Adolf Seilacher, interprets the fossils as not organisms at all, but rather pseudofossils of inorganic pyrites. El Albani et al. (2014) explicitly disputes Seilacher's interpretation. Both pyritized and unpyritized impressions of the structures remain, as well as lightly pyritized forms. The structures have formed in a single event, at the same time as the sediment. This is demonstrated by the uniform distribution of sulfur isotope ratios within the sample. In pyrite flowers, which crystallize slowly, the isotope ratio would vary within the structure. For structures that resemble pollen, chemical analysis also shows that the material in the walls of the \\"pollen\\" contains organic material.  Fate  The Francevillian biota disappears and is absent in the overlying black shale. El Albani attributes this to their extinction. The biota formed with the Lomagundi event, a temporary increase in atmospheric oxygen, and became extinct from marine anoxia when the event ended. The biota represents the first known experiment in multicellularity, with no extant multicellular descendants.

The district extends along Main Street (New Hampshire Route 101) from its junction with Lake Street in the west to the junction with Old County Road in the east, and includes sections of Old Common Road, Harrisville Road, and Church Street. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Settlement of Dublin began in the 1760s, and the town was incorporated in 1771. Its original town common, cemetery, and pound are located at the western end of the district, near the eastern end of Dublin Pond. This area was subjected to harsh winds blowing across the lake, and the current town center took shape in a more sheltered area further east. The central feature of the village is the intersection of the Main and Church Streets, where the 1852 Dublin Community Church and 1883 town hall are located. The most prominent commercial building to the west of this intersection are the wood frame publishing offices of Yankee magazine. A little further west is the 1901 Gothic Revival library. Just north of Main Street and along Harrisville Road lies the campus of the Dublin School, on which stand a number of 19th century homes. East of the central intersection on Main Street is the lower village, a stretch that is predominantly residential, with an array of houses that are predominantly Greek Revival in their styling.

Description and history Eveleth Farm is located at the end of Burpee Road, which extends westward from Upper Jaffrey Road up the eastern slopes of Mount Monadnock. The farmstead is a -story wood frame structure oriented facing south, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The original main block is five bays wide, with sash windows in the right four bays, and the main entrance in the leftmost bay, all simply trimmed. A modern addition of similar height extends to the west, culminating in a garage; the addition is fronted by an all-glass greenhouse. The house was built about 1823 by Joab Eveleth on land acquired from his brother-in-law, Samuel Gowing. Eveleth's son Joseph hosted Henry David Thoreau here on a walking trip through the region in 1852. The house was owned by members of the local Burpee and Harrington families until 1957.

The 90-minute film, directed by Julian Farino and written by Peter Bowker, is about the life of Neil Baldwin, from Westlands, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. In the 1990s Baldwin, now an honorary graduate of Keele University, was appointed as Stoke City Football Club's kit- man by its manager Lou Macari. Baldwin's autobiography, Marvellous: Neil Baldwin ‚Äì My Story, was published in hardback in 2015. Cast * Toby Jones as Neil Baldwin * Tony Curran as Lou Macari * Gemma Jones as Neil's mother, Mary Baldwin * Greg McHugh as Neil's friend, Malcolm * Nicholas Gleaves as Rev Mark Making cameo appearances as themselves: * Neil Baldwin * Norman Barrett * Gary Lineker * Lou Macari * Uriah Rennie Production The programme was commissioned by Janice Hadlow and Ben Stephenson. The executive producers were Patrick Spence and Peter Bowker for Fifty Fathoms and Tiger Aspect Productions, and Lucy Richer for the BBC. Filming locations Marvellous was filmed mostly in Staffordshire. Several of the scenes were set at and filmed at Keele University. Crewe Alexandra Football Club's Alexandra Stadium and the Glynd≈µr University Racecourse Stadium in Wrexham, North Wales were used for the scenes set at Stoke City's football ground. Reception Writing in The Guardian, Sam Wollaston praised Jones's \\"lovely, very human, performance\\". Andrew Anthony, for The Observer, said \\"Jones realised its potential with such poignant insight into character that it‚Äôs impossible to imagine anyone else playing the part. [Baldwin]'s life has been a triumph of unselfconsciousness, which is easier read about than captured. But in a story fraught with the danger of sentimentality, Bowker located a sort of comic truth about an innocent at home and Jones made that truth both funny and movingly real.\\" Ellen E Jones, reviewing the film in The Independent, said: \\"The triumph of Marvellous is that it‚Äôs a feel good film that feels good, not through any Hollywood schmaltz, but through the sheer force of Baldwin‚Äôs own optimistic personality\\". Sarah Crompton, for The Daily Telegraph, described Marvellous as \\"sweet and sharp... on the whole a great number of people emerge well from this film, including Stoke City‚Äôs former manager Lou Macari (played by Tony Curran but also popping in as himself) and many long suffering clergy. It might have been too cute in different hands, but both Toby and Gemma Jones gave performances that were almost as miraculous as the story itself.\\" Jim White, writing in The Sunday Telegraph, described it as \\"a wonderful, uplifting, life affirming 90 minutes of television. And the most compelling argument yet that ‚Äì despite all the evidence presented by previous filmic depictions of the beautiful game ‚Äì it is possible to extract telling fiction from football.\\" Julie McDowall for Scotland's The Herald, described it as 2014's best television programme. Rachel Cooke in the New Statesman said of Toby Jones' portrayal of Baldwin that he \\"played him brilliantly, turning in an understated performance that combined innocence and wryness to powerful effect\\". She praised Bowker‚Äôs \\"pitch perfect script, which was as natural sounding as a conversation overheard on the top deck of a bus\\", and Farino‚Äôs direction ‚Äì \\"so deft, quirky, witty and attentive to important details (buildings as well as moods; rooms as well as body language)\\". Reviewing the programme for the Stoke Sentinel, John Woodhouse said \\"It says everything for Neil that Marvellous was ever made. For in times when television is seduced by vacuity and celebrity, it doesn't sound that promising a pitch. A drama, set in Newcastle [under Lyme], about a man saddled with the tag of 'learning difficulties' who reveals himself to be so much more? Good luck with that one. And yet here it is ‚Äì primetime BBC2.\\" Stoke Sentinel columnist Simon Lowe described it as \\"the most human of stories: a truly stirring, laugh-out-loud tearjerker of a drama. Part biopic, part musical (has there ever been a better use of the ukulele in a piece of television ‚Äì and I‚Äôm including George Formby‚Äôs contribution to the instrument‚Äôs status in that?) and part incredible journey, Marvellous was life-affirming and inspirational.\\" Lou Macari was quoted in the Stoke Sentinel as saying: \\"The film really captures Nello [Neil Baldwin] as he was and for those who didn't know him I can assure them everything in the film is true. There are many moving moments, and it must be the best 90 minutes viewing Stoke-on-Trent has had for a long time.\\" Awards At the 2015 British Academy Television Awards, Marvellous won the Single Drama award and Gemma Jones received the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Baldwin's mother. Baldwin collected the former award and made an acceptance speech. DVD The DVD and a digital download of Marvellous were released on 1 December 2016.

Built in the 1790s, it is a good local example of 18th-century farm architecture, made further notable by its conversion to an art studio in 1929, during Dublin's heyday as an artists' colony. The barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Fisk Barn is located in eastern Dublin, in a small farm complex at the southern end of Gerry Road. It is a long rectangular two-story wooden structure, with a gabled roof and shingled exterior. A variety of window and door treatments appear on the sides, including a pair of full-height windowed doors on one side, and oculus windows on the second level. A Cape style farmhouse with large central chimney stands nearby, and the grounds are landscaped with walls resembling those of old foundations. The barn was probably built in the 1790s by Samuel Fisk, who lived nearby and farmed the land. The barn remained in his family's hands until the late 19th century.

Discovery of the body On February 19, 1971, two teenage hitchhikers discovered a partially submerged figure floating beneath a highway overpass in Lake Panasoffkee, Florida. Authorities retrieved the fully clothed, badly decomposed body of a young woman from the lake. The body had no identification papers. The body was dressed in a green shirt, green plaid pants, and a green floral poncho. Also found were a white gold watch and a gold necklace. On her ring finger there was a gold ring with a transparent stone, indicating that she may have been married. A forensic examination of the remains was conducted by Dr. William Schutze. Schutze concluded that the victim had been killed approximately 30 days before her body was discovered. A man's size-36 belt was fastened around her neck, strongly indicating strangulation as the cause of death. Forensic examination The body was exhumed in February 1986 for further forensic examination. The woman was determined to have been between 17 and 24 years old when she died, weighing about 115 pounds. She had brown hair and prominent cheekbones. She was between 5 feet, 2 inches and 5 feet, 5 inches in height. She had received extensive dental work, including numerous silver tooth fillings. She had a porcelain crown on one of her upper right teeth. It was determined that she had borne at least two children before her death. One of her ribs had been fractured at the time of death, leading investigators to theorize that the killer had possibly knelt on her while he strangled her with the belt. Additional facial reconstruction of the victim Investigators initially believed the woman to be either of European or Native American ancestry. A further exhumation and examination of the remains, conducted in 2012, established that she was of European descent. An examination of Harris lines in the victim's bones indicated that an illness or malnutrition had briefly arrested her growth in childhood. Examining the lead isotopes in the victim's teeth, a geological scientist deduced that the victim had undoubtedly spent her childhood and adolescence in southern Europe close to the sea‚Äîmost likely south of the Greek city of Athens‚Äîuntil within a year of her murder. The geological scientist George Kamenov pinpointed the most likely place as the fishing port of Laurium, Greece. Given that there is a large Greek-American population in Tarpon Springs (about from Lake Panasoffkee), and that the victim had been dead for about 30 days and had likely lived in Greece, it was possible to conclude that she had traveled to the United States to attend an Epiphany celebration. Forensic examination of her hair supported the theory that she had been visiting temporarily. This was indicated by the fact that she had been in Florida for less than two months before her death. An orthopedic surgery procedure, known as the \\"Watson-Jones\\" technique, had been performed on her right ankle when she was about 16 years old.Ocala Star-Banner May 14, 1989 This operation‚Äîwhich involved stretching the tendon by screws drilled into the bone‚Äîwould most likely have been performed to rectify a chronic instability which would likely have seen the victim sprain her ankle several times before the operation. Periostitis was found in her right leg, which may have been noticeably uncomfortable for the victim. A further development with the case occurred when it was featured on a Greek crime show. A woman came forward to say that she believed the facial reconstructions looked like a girl she knew, called Konstantina. She and Konstantina attended a prep school in Greece, where they were trained to be domestic help. After finishing the course, the school sent their students abroad to Australia or America as part of a two-year work contract. The school was funded by the International Organization for Migration. This woman had lost contact with Konstantina when they were separated, Konstantina was sent to America and the woman was sent to Australia. Konstantina had arrived in America at exactly the same time as the forensic testing indicated the victim had. =Facial reconstructions= A collection of forensic facial reconstructions were made in the 1980s to show what Little Miss Lake Panasoffkee may have looked like at stages of her life. In 2012, another composite was created, visually different from the first. The composite was combined with a scale model of the victim's clothing.

Racebending was coined as a term of protest in 2009 as a response to the casting decisions for the live-action film adaptation of the television series Avatar: The Last Airbender. The starring roles of the show (Aang, Katara, and Sokka) were intended to be of Asian and Inuit descent, but were cast as Caucasian actors in the film. The initial protests such as \\"Saving the World with Postage,\\" were created in a LiveJournal online forum that initially responded to the casting decisions by \\"inundating Paramount with protest mail.\\" However, the cast went unaltered and when production began, the leaders of this protest responded by founding the advocacy group and accompanying website Racebending by \\"playfully borrowing the concept of manipulating elements (bending) from the Avatar universe.\\" The Racebending.com website defines \\"racebending\\" as, \\"situations where a media content creator (movie studio, publisher, etc.) has changed the race or ethnicity of a character. This is a longstanding Hollywood practice that has been historically used to discriminate against people of color.\\" The website also states that the issue predates the coining of the term. Whitewashing, particularly common in film, \\"possesses a long tradition among the industry's most successful and venerated productions. Film history is replete with ignominious examples of white actors portraying characters of color.\\"  Reasons for racebending  According to Christina Shu Jien Chong, racebending, whitewashing and an overall lack of representation of Asians as well as other minorities in the film industry is not due to lack of minority applicants, but instead due to lack of opportunities for minorities due to a connection-based culture in the entertainment industry created through implicit bias, and breakdowns, casting descriptions that usually include characteristics including a characters name, gender, age, race, minor personality traits and a brief life background. Chong does not consider breakdowns problematic in themselves, but as stated by Russell Robinson in a research article published by the Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository, they tend to discriminate against minorities in the entertainment industry. Part of Robinson's argument against breakdowns is that they are usually created by studio directors and 87% of directors are white. Robinson claims that these directors as well as others within the film industry can easily decide to change the race of a breakdown or of a character being adapted from another form of media. Robinson stated, \\"Any person in this decision-making chain might exclude an actor or an entire category of actors based on race or sex-based considerations, yet this discrimination would normally remain concealed from the excluded applicants and the public.\\" According to Robinson, there are circles of \\"the wealthy elite in Hollywood\\" whose \\"implicit biases\\", covered up by breakdowns, lead to a significant amount of racebending and whitewashing within the film industry. Many producers and directors in the film industry believe that it is not racial discrimination that leads to racebending, whitewashing, and an overall lack of minority representation in the film industry. Instead, many accredit it to a low number of minority applicants and the lack of funding they would receive if they did cast minorities in lead roles. In response to critic backlash after the release of the film 21, which is based on the true story of a group of Asian American students who in the film are portrayed mostly by Caucasian actors, producer Dana Brunetti claimed, \\"We would have loved to cast Asians in the lead roles, but the truth is, we didn't have access to any bankable Asian- American actors that we wanted.\\" Furthermore, Ridley Scott claimed, after the release of his film Exodus: Gods and Kings, which faced a similar whitewashing controversy, \\"I can't mount a film of this budget, where I have to rely on tax rebates in Spain and say that my lead actor is Muhammad so-and-so from such- and-such. I'm just not going to get it financed. So the question doesn't even come up.\\"  Examples  After the producers of The Last Airbender announced their decision to cast white actors Noah Ringer, Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone as the lead roles, the artists who had worked on the animated show it was based on created an anonymous LiveJournal website and started a letter- writing campaign. On the other hand, the actors portraying the antagonist characters are mainly Middle Eastern and Indian. Two fans from the LiveJournal website, known as glockgal and jedifreac, realized there were more cases regarding racebending other than The Last Airbender movie, leading them to create their own forum against racebending as a whole, Racebending.com. In 2010, Racebending.com wrote a letter to Nickelodeon's CEO at the time, Jeff Dunn, regarding the audition restrictions for Power Rangers Samurai, the eighteenth season of the Power Rangers franchise. The producers of the show had restricted auditions for the Red Ranger to only white actors, but the casting was re-opened in June 2010 to actors of all ethnicities. The film Exodus: Gods and Kings received significant backlash on social media before its release, due to white actors Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton and others being cast to play the roles of Egyptians, while black actors were only given the roles of slaves and thieves. Director Ridley Scott argued that they cast actors of other ethnicities as well (Iranians, Spaniards, Arabs, etc.) because Egyptians have varied ethnicities, and that the audience shouldn't focus on only the white actors. In 2010, Racebending.com and the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, alongside urging boycotts of The Last Airbender, also urged boycotts of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time as well, due to practices of racebending. Prince of Persia was criticized for casting white actors for the leads instead of actors of Iranian or Middle Eastern descent. When Scarlett Johansson was cast in the lead role of Motoko Kusanagi in Ghost in the Shell, a live-action adaptation of the Japanese manga, there was fan backlash over the casting as, since the story is located within Japan, it was assumed that the actress to portray the character was meant to be of Japanese descent, and numerous fans signed petitions for a recast. Johansson addressed the issue in an interview for Marie Claire magazine, stating that she never would have accepted the role if it meant taking it from an Asian actor. Johansson explained how she accepted the part because the main protagonist was female and \\"having a franchise with a female protagonist driving it is such a rare opportunity.\\" Activists groups, such as the Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) accused Johansson of lying that she would never portray or attempt to play someone of a different race. Their complaints stemmed in the idea that they believed Hollywood was not allowing Asians to portray Asian characters, and instead, was hiring white actors to take roles that could easily have been portrayed by an Asian actor and actress. Asian actors such as Constance Wu and Ming-Na Wen called for a boycott of the movie because they thought that it was unfair that the role did not go to an Asian woman. The Founding President of MANAA, Guy Aoki, stated, \\"Hollywood continues to make the same excuses, that there aren't big enough Asian/Asian American names to open a blockbuster film. Yet it has not developed a farm system where such actors get even third billing in most pictures. Without a conscientious effort, how will anyone ever break through and become familiar enough with audiences so producers will confidently allow them to topline a film? When will we ever break that glass ceiling?\\" The film spawned many different conversations on how to allow actors and actresses of minority groups to have the spotlight, as well as created discussions on how to end these endemic problems throughout Hollywood. In contrast to the controversy, Mamoru Oshii, director of the 1995 anime film, defended Johansson's casting and has even cited the casting being in line with the themes, story, and source material of the book, specifically saying \\"The Major is a cyborg and her physical form is an entirely assumed one. The name 'Motoko Kusanagi' and her current body are not her original name and body, so there is no basis for saying that an Asian actress must portray her...I believe having Scarlett play Motoko was the best possible casting for this movie. I can only sense a political motive from the people opposing it, and I believe artistic expression must be free from politics.\\" https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/ghost- in-the-shell-original-director-mamoru-oshii-scarlett-johansson-casting- whitewashing-a7650461.html Conversely, when Harry Potter received an addition to its installment with the stage play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, it was announced that the character Hermione would be played by Noma Dumezweni, an African actress residing in England. Fans were displeased with this and called it \\"reverse whitewashing\\", but J. K. Rowling, the author of the original series, stated in a tweet that white skin was never specified in the making of the character Hermione, but rather being intelligent and smart.  Other uses  The Racebending website acknowledges that often the terms \\"whitewashing\\" and \\"racebending\\" are used interchangeably, but that occasionally, the effects of racebending can have a positive impact. Racebending can, at times, result in increased representation for minorities if a \\"white role\\" is altered to be played by a minority. The website gave as examples of positive racebending Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, Cinderella (Brandy Norwood) and Prince Christopher (Paolo Montalban) in The Wonderful World of Disney's retelling of Cinderella (1997), and Velma (Hayley Kiyoko) in Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins (2009), stating that, although minimal, \\"for communities of color, these casting decisions meant representation and meaningful inclusion in the American storytelling landscape.\\" Usage evolved, and by 2015, media studies academic Kristen J. Warner wrote that the term has \\"many definitions and contexts\\", from the film industry practice of color-blind casting to fan fiction. She describes how writers can \\"change the race and cultural specificity of central characters or pull a secondary character of color from the margins, transforming her into the central protagonist.\\" Pastes Abbey White said in 2016 that the term can apply to actors of color being cast in traditionally white roles. White said, \\"In the last several years, racebending has become a practice used more and more to help networks diversify their ensembles and capture a bigger audience. Not only has it resulted in more racial visibility on the small screen, but in a far more unexpected way, racebending can generate deeper and more significant depictions of characters.\\"  Statistics  According to a 2016 University of Southern California report on diversity in entertainment within which 414 stories were sampled, 109 motion pictures and 305 broadcast, cable and digital series, \\"71.7% were white, 12.2% Black, 5.8% Hispanic/Latino, 5.1% Asian, 2.3% Middle Eastern and 3.1% other\\", in contrast to the United States Census Bureau's population estimates for July 2016 being \\"63.3% White, 12.6% Black, 16.2% Hispanic/Latino, 4.9% Asian, 2.1% mixed, 1.0% other.\\" The University of Southern California report noted that it sampled all \\"independent speaking character utters one or more discernible and overt words (of any language) on screen. Nonverbal utterances are not considered words. Characters that are named are also considered speaking characters. Under rare circumstances, a group of nearly identical characters might speak at the exact same time or sequentially. Given their extreme homogeneous appearance, it is impossible to distinguish these characters from another. When this occurs, the coders are instructed to \\"group\\" the identical characters and code them as one unit.\\" According to Christina Shu Jien Chong's article in the Asian Pacific American Law Journal, \\"Whites occupied 83.5% of lead roles while minorities occupied 16.5%; 9.5% Black, 2% Latino, 2.5% Asian, 0.5% Native American, and 2% Mixed/Other.\\" According to Chong, when it comes to casting for major roles, racebending, whitewashing and implicit bias lead to an even more drastic underrepresentation of minorities in the entertainment industry.

He became the senior producer of NPR's On the Media in 2000, where his team tripled the audience, started one of NPR's first podcasts, and won a Peabody Award. In 2005, he became the senior editor of Public Radio International's Studio 360. Later that year, Rath jumped to television as a correspondent and producer for Frontline, where he focused on military justice and national security issues. Some of his major stories focused on WikiLeaks, the Guantanamo military commission, and the Haditha killings. He also became a regular correspondent for PBS's Sound Tracks: Music Without Borders. In September 2013, Rath was hired as the host of the weekend edition of All Things Considered, coinciding with its move to NPR's West Coast bureau in Culver City. Rath replaced Guy Raz, becoming the first Indian-American to host an NPR news-magazine. He has stated that he hopes to do more of his own reporting from the field, and to strengthen NPR's presence on the West Coast. In October 2015, Michel Martin replaced Rath as the host of the weekend edition of All Things Considered. NPR Media Relations Director Isabel Lara says Rath, \\"will be moving back to Boston\\" but did not elaborate. Rath Joined WGBH Boston, and continued to report for NPR. On February 21, 2017, the PBS network's documentary series Frontline broadcast an episode Rath produced, entitled \\"Out of Gitmo\\". The first 40 minutes of the episode were focussed around Mansur al-Dayfi, a former Guantanamo captive released to Serbia in July 2016. Rath traveled to Serbia for a stay to allow him to profile al-Dayfi, in depth. The attention he paid to al-Dayfi triggered increased scrutiny from Serbian security officials.
