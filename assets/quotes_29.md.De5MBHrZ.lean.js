Wynn and the Indians were leading 5‚Äì1 heading to the bottom of the fifth, but when Wynn let up three runs in the bottom of the inning, he was pinch-hit for in the top of the sixth.

Located adjacent to what is now Meriwether National Golf Club, at the time it was the second tallest steel tower in the world after France‚Äôs Eiffel Tower. The tower was constructed in 1921 and was torn down in 1952.Kimberli Fitzgerald, Deborah Raber, Hillsboro Historic Landmarks Advisory Committee, Hillsboro (Arcadia Publishing, 2009), , p. 110. Excerpts available at Google Books. History Federal Telegraph Company purchased property south of Hillsboro on September 20, 1920, from the Fred Rood estate, with completion of the project coming in 1921.Horner, John B. (1921). Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. Federal paid $41,500 for the site that was then three miles from Hillsboro. The tower was built to replace a tower the federal government owned in Lents that the government removed and sent to Siberia during World War I. The dedication of telegraph station KGH came on May 11, 1921, with a crowd of 500 and the Hillsboro mayor, A. C. Shute, in attendance.World‚Äôs second-largest tower relayed wireless messages. Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. Built on the station had one large tower at a height of surrounded by eight shorter towers arranged in a circle around the main tower in the center. Once complete, it was the tallest structure on the Pacific Coast, and the only taller structures in the world were the Eiffel Tower in France and the Woolworth Building in New York City. Workers dug out deep concrete bases to secure the towers under the guidance of the engineer J. L. Miller. Constructed of steel, the station cost $300,000 to build. KGH used synchronous rotary spark gap transmitters. A 3 kW set for close ships and a 5 kW transmitter for ships far out at sea. A receiving set was installed on top of \\"The Board of Trade\\" building in Portland, Oregon. Transmission lines were placed between the Hillsboro transmitter site and Federal's Portland offices. In September 1927, KGH was purchased by Mackay Radio & Telegraph Company, a subsidiary of International Telephone & Telegraph Corporation. Mackay Radio shortly thereafter installed a shortwave transmitter and replaced one of the spark gap transmitters with the new arc and tube type. On December 31, 1928, Mackay Radio announced a new more powerful transmitter would be installed by February 1929, making KGH the most powerful Marine Radio station in the Northwest. In April of that year the new transmitter was put into use by Mackay. In October 1935, a strike by employees of Mackay caused the transmitter to go dead. During World War II the United States government took over the operations of the station. It was then operated by the United States Coast Guard. In 1951, the station was abandoned and subsequently torn down in 1952. Details The tower was operated remotely from Portland, Oregon and was capable of sending telegraph message as far away as Asia and Europe. The eight smaller towers were from the central tower. Utilizing short-wave radio signals, the station would transmit point-to-point to regional transmitters such as in San Francisco, California or directly to ships at sea. On site was also a large concrete building by and tall. In addition to this, on July 9, 1923, KEK began operation. The Marine receiving station was licensed to Hillsboro but was located in a building on Council Crest in Portland and the main office was in the Postal Building in downtown Portland. This downtown building is where all messages were received and relayed. The cables supporting the towers were one and one-quarter inch in diameter. KEK had four long wave receivers. Two for ship work and two for shortwave reception. Three of four signals from Federal's San Francisco operating room (KFS transmitter in Palo Alto, California) were picked up simultaneously by KEK and passed down to the main office in Portland where the operating room was located. The signals came in on a long wavelength automatically and were received on a paper tape. Operators then transcribed the signals from the tape directly on telegraph blank cards, ready for delivery at a speed of 40 to 80 words per minute over KGH. As reported in The Oregon Journal newspaper in 1923: \\"Portland is one of the very few cities in the world that has a complete ship to ship and point to point radio service. KEK receives news day and night of ships carrying loved ones, news of ships in trouble. Vessels 1,000 miles at sea report their positions nightly or might request medical aid.\\" References External links *\\"New Stations of the Federal Tel.

Spurgin was transferred from the US Army to the US Navy and commissioned as ACM-13 on 25 January 1950. After decommissioning and sale to commercial interests 17 February 1961, the ship remained in the fishing fleet into the 1990s before becoming part of a breakwater in Tacoma, Washington. Army Service USAMP Col. Horace F. Spurgin MP-14 is known to have served in Sausalito, California at Fort Baker's Submarine Mine Depot supporting the San Francisco Bay Coast Artillery defenses with the USAMP Gen. Samuel M. Mills. The ship became the prototype for correction of a deficiency in engine order telegraphs to extend them to bridge wings. One commercial system was installed on USAMP Col. Alfred A. Maybach while a second, fabricated and installed by Chief Engineer CWO John B. May, aboard Col. Horace F. Spurgin became the recommended correction for all M1 type Mine Planters. Navy Service Commissioned as ACM-13 at Treasure Island on 25 January 1950 under the command of Lt. Harold G. Gibson. Assigned to the 12th Naval District, based at US Naval Station, Treasure Island, California, the unnamed auxiliary minelayer operated out of San Francisco Bay along the California coast training for harbor defense. In addition she towed sea targets and supported fleet gunnery exercises. The ship was involved with the transition of harbor defense responsibilities from Army to Navy as shown in photographs in the March 1950 issue of All Hands magazine. The Fort Baker Submarine Mine Depot was in close proximity to the Naval School, Harbor Defense, Fort Winfield Scott, San Francisco, California in which Naval Reserve personnel were trained for duties previously performed by Army Coast Artillery Corps personnel. Both services would man the Harbor Entrance Control Post (HECP). On 7 February 1955 she reclassified to MMA-13, and on 1 May she was named Miantonomah. The newly renamed ship reported to the Long Beach Group, Pacific Reserve Fleet, to begin inactivation on 14 May. Miantonomah decommissioned at Terminal Island, Long Beach, California, 19 July 1955. She entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Long Beach. Her name was struck from the Navy List 1 July 1960 and she was sold to Hubert P. Sturdivant and Edward Madruga of San Diego, 17 February 1961. She was delivered to her purchaser on 28 February. Commercial Service Became tuna fishing vessel Nautilus owned by Edward Madruga and Manuel Cintas.

This event was discontinued in 2002 and replaced with the Little Fifty, a relay-style footrace. Georgia Tech In the 1960s, freshman fraternity pledges were often forced to ride tricycles around campus. Georgia Tech's Mini 500 was derived from this practice and was first organized by the Ramblin' Reck Club in 1969 and has been orchestrated during the week leading up to the homecoming football game every year since. The race is divided into men's and women's divisions. Men must complete 15 laps around Peters Parking Deck while women must complete 10. In times of poor weather, the race can be shortened. The teams are made up of assorted fraternities, sororities, ROTC, sports clubs, and other student organizations. The teams can have up to seven members (4 drivers and 3 pit crew). As the tricyclers race, they must complete three pit stops in which the front tire is rotated. Each tire rotation and each lap is counted by a designated Ramblin' Reck Club member. The tricycles are provided by Ramblin' Reck Club but because they are made for children, an additional support bar can be welded to the frame.

Under article 9 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, and the Official Languages Ordinance, Both Chinese and English are equally official languages of the territory. However, no particular variety of \\"Chinese\\" referred to in laws is specified. While Mandarin written in simplified Chinese characters is used as the standard language in mainland China, Cantonese in traditional Chinese characters is the de facto standard in Hong Kong. Chinese as an official language In 1974 Chinese was declared as another official language of Hong Kong through the Official Languages Ordinance. The ordinance does not specify any particular variety of Chinese although majority of Hong Kong residents have Cantonese, the language of Canton (now called Guangzhou), as their mother tongue and this is considered the de facto official variety used by the government. Annex I of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration provided that in addition to Chinese, English may be used for official purposes in the future Hong Kong special administrative region; in March 1987, the Official Languages Ordinance was amended to require all new legislation to be enacted bilingually in both English and Chinese. Article 9 of the Hong Kong Basic Law affirms the official status of both Chinese and English in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's population reached 6.99 million in 2006, of which approximately 95% are of Chinese descent, the majority of which was Cantonese, Hakka, and Teochew. English as an official language Hong Kong became a crown colony of the United Kingdom in 1840, and was established as a free port to serve as an entrep√¥t of the British Empire. The government officials and businessmen from Britain spoke English. The British administration in Hong Kong continued to use English as an official language, but added Chinese as another official language in 1974 through the Official Languages Ordinance. Annex I of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration provided that English may be used in addition to Chinese for official purposes in the future Hong Kong special administrative region, and this is affirmed under article 9 of the 1990 Hong Kong Basic Law. Following the 1997 transfer, English is still widely used in law and business, and it is still taught in kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, and universities. The British have also left their language on place names within Hong Kong, particularly on Hong Kong Island, where British rule had the largest impact. Bilingual freeway signs in Chek Lap Kok Code-switching in Hong Kong Code-switching, or the practice of using more than one language in conversation, is very common in Hong Kong.

There is a significant number of South Asians in Hong Kong. Signboards written in Hindi or Urdu are common in areas with South Asians, and languages such as Nepali, Sindhi and Punjabi are often heard on the streets of Hong Kong as well. In addition, the large number of domestic helpers from Indonesia and the Philippines made Indonesian and Tagalog significant minority languages in Hong Kong.

Acanfora, who is openly gay, fought to become an earth science teacher in the public schools in Pennsylvania and Maryland in the early 1970s. His fight between 1971 and 1974 over a series of transfers and dismissals by authorities from his public school teaching assignments based upon his acknowledged homosexuality involved litigation through the federal court system; expert witness court testimony on the effect of an openly gay teacher on his students; extensive media coverage, including an \\"episode appearance\\" on CBS 60 Minutes; a \\"morality investigation\\" by the Penn State University Teacher Certification Council; and active participation of his parents in the public debate.Acanfora vs. Montgomery County Public Schools, Maryland  Childhood  Joseph Acanfora, III was born in 1950 to Leonore and Joseph Acanfora, II. At the age of five, Acanfora and his family moved from Jersey City to Brick Town, New Jersey.Bowman, Denise R. (June 15, 1972). \\"To Acanfora, it's the principle\\". The Pennsylvania Mirror. Box 4.

(August 9, 1972). \\"Letters to the editor: In defense of her son.\\" The Collegian. Box 4. Pennsylvania State University, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Coalition Records. Eberly Family Special Collections Library, Penn State University Library, University Park, Pennsylvania. October 8, 2019. As a young child, Acanfora was interested in the weather, and this interest turned into a passion for meteorology. His mother said that Acanfora \\"...once tried to eat chicken wings so he could fly up to the clouds and look at them close up.\\" This passion was also spurred by Acanfora's seventh grade science class teacher, who was a former Navy meteorologist. Acanfora graduated as valedictorian of his class from Brick Township High School, in Brick Township, New Jersey in 1968. Penn State college days Acanfora entered Pennsylvania State University in fall 1968, with the intent to major in meteorology and participate in the Navel Reserve Officers Training Corps. At the end of his sophomore year, Acanfora realized he wanted to teach and decided to major in secondary education. In his junior year, he joined, and soon thereafter became Treasurer of the Homophiles of Penn State (HOPS), a newly formed campus organization dedicated to protecting the civil and constitutional rights of homosexuals and increasing public understanding of homosexuality. When the University refused to grant official recognition to the organization, four of its members, including Acanfora, instituted legal action to compel such recognition. That action, which ultimately was successful, received considerable local publicity, in the course of which Acanfora acknowledged that he was a homosexual. At the time that his acknowledgment became public, Acanfora was fulfilling the student teaching assignment that was necessary to obtain his teaching degree from Penn State at Park Forest Junior High School located in State College, Pennsylvania. That school system and Penn State immediately suspended his student teaching status upon learning of his homosexuality and membership in HOPS. Acanfora thereupon instituted legal action seeking reinstatement as a student teacher, and obtained an immediate court injunction granting such reinstatement. He successfully completed the student teaching assignment with a grade of \\"B\\" and graduated from Penn State in June 1972. As his senior year was coming to a close Acanfora applied for certification to teach in Pennsylvania. The question was raised by the Penn State dean of the College of Education, Dean Abram VanderMeer, as to whether a homosexual could have the requisite \\"good moral character\\" necessary for certification. This issue became a subject of great campus, county, and statewide controversy, including an interrogation of Acanfora by six Penn State deans who made up the University Teacher Certification Council. When the Council deadlocked 3‚Äì3 on whether or not Acanfora possessed a \\"good moral character\\", the matter was referred to the then Pennsylvania Secretary of Education, John C. Pittenger, for decision. With his Pennsylvania status in this undecided posture, Acanfora sought and found employment as a teacher with the Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland. Employment in Montgomery County, Parkland Junior High School = Spring & summer 1972 = In April 1972, Acanfora applied for employment with the Board of Education of Montgomery County, Maryland. In the application process, he was asked to list his \\"professional, service and fraternal organizations\\", and for a list of \\"extracurricular activities\\" he had engaged in as a student.Acanfora v. Board of Education of Montgomery County, 491 F.2d 498 (4th Cir. 1974). He did not list his membership in the Homophiles of Penn State in response to either question. In later court trials, Acanfora would admit that \\"...he realized that this information would be significant, but he believed disclosure would foreclose his opportunity to be considered for employment on an equal basis with other applicants.\\" On May 19, 1972, Acanfora was interviewed by a personnel specialist in the Department of Personnel for Montgomery County Public Schools. Following the interview, the personnel specialist filled out an \\"interview and recruitment form\\" which is a standard part of each applicant's file. Acanfora was rated above average in each of the seven categories contained on the form (appearance, personality, verbal expression, knowledge of subject area, enthusiasm for teaching, references, and scholarship). In the \\"comments\\" section, the interviewer described Acanfora as \\"an above average earth science applicant.\\" However, the interviewer had acquired a subjective \\"gut feeling\\" during the interview that Acanfora might be a homosexual, and so he added the following comment on the form: \\"Principal must interview before contracting; reservations.\\" Despite this caution, Acanfora was hired without further interviewing by the Assistant Principal of Parkland Junior High School in Rockville, Maryland, and entered into a one- year teaching contract. He was one of 719 new teachers hired in Montgomery County in 1972, out of 10,000 applicants. Acanfora commenced his duties as an eighth grade earth science teacher on August 29, 1972. His teaching performance was judged entirely satisfactory by his supervisor.Acanfora v. Board of Education, 359 F. Supp. 843, 1973 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13416 (United States District Court for the District of Maryland May 31, 1973 ). Retrieved from https://advance-lexis- com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/api/document?collection=cases&id;=urn:contentItem:3S4V-JMM0-003B-33WW-00000-00&context;=1516831. = Suspended from teaching = On Friday, September 22, 1972, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Pittenger called a press conference to announce that he had decided to certify Acanfora. That weekend, a New York Times article from September 24 and a Washington Evening Star-News article from September 23 reported the decision of the Pennsylvania Secretary of Education, and noted that Acanfora was then currently teaching in Montgomery County, Maryland. On the following workday, Monday, September 25, the principal of Acanfora's school addressed a memo to the Deputy Superintendent of Schools, Donald Miedema, recommending that Acanfora \\"be considered for removal from his teaching position as soon as possible . . . in anticipation of the disruption which can materialize when this becomes known in the community.\\" Miedema, in turn, addressed a memo to the Board of Education advising that \\"one of the alternatives which we are exploring is the reassignment of Mr. Acanfora with full salary, to a position that does not require contact with youngsters.\\" On the following day, Miedema addressed a letter to Acanfora informing him that he had been transferred from his classroom teaching position to \\"a temporary alternate work assignment\\" in the headquarters building \\"while we gather information and assess the circumstances relating to this matter.\\" The letter stated that the transfer was \\"in no way to be construed as punitive action. You will receive full salary while you are in this temporary work assignment.\\" Acanfora's \\"temporary alternate work assignment\\" was an office job created for him in which his duties largely were \\"make-work.\\" It was revealed in court testimony that in that position, Acanfora was denied the opportunity to teach and deprived of the opportunity to gain experience and receive evaluations critical to a teacher's ability to secure renewal of teaching employment beyond the first year. Although Acanfora's salary was not reduced, the district court would find later that the transfer breached the \\"clearly implied promise of continued employment in a classroom teaching capacity for the duration of [his] contract.\\" At trial in Baltimore Federal District Court, Miedema explained the factors which prompted him to transfer Acanfora. The newspaper stories reporting Acanfora's certification had recounted his suspension from his student teaching position and the controversy which had attended his request for certification, and Miedema wished to investigate the facts underlying the suspension and delay in certification. Additionally, Miedema was \\"concerned\\" that Acanfora might be \\"an activist, advertised homosexual.\\" Finally, Miedema was worried about \\"community concern and reaction\\" to the newspaper disclosures that a homosexual was teaching in the school. Montgomery County School officials took steps to assure that Acanfora would have no contact whatsoever with students. The junior high school needed to have him return to the school to assist in preparing his former students' grades, but he was instructed not to arrive at the school until the students had left for the day. On another occasion, when he requested the opportunity to participate in a teacher workshop, he was told that he could not attend because students would be present. Although Acanfora performed the office work to which he was transferred, he repeatedly requested that he be reinstated to his classroom position. These requests were denied, Acanfora being advised that the transfer would remain in effect pending investigation, but that the transfer was \\"in no way to be construed as punitive action.\\" In fact, as the district court later found, the investigation conducted by respondents was \\"cursory.\\" Miedema wrote to Penn State University and to the Secretary of Education for the State of Pennsylvania requesting information about Acanfora's suspension from his student teaching position and the controversy concerning his certification. Penn State responded that Acanfora had \\"successfully completed the student teacher assignment\\", and that the brief suspension therefrom had been motivated by his joining the lawsuit to obtain accreditation of HOPS, a suspension which all concerned had recognized to be an invasion of Acanfora's constitutional rights and which had been quickly corrected. The Secretary of Education responded that Acanfora's performance as a student and as a student teacher had been satisfactory in all respects, and that he had deemed Acanfora to be of \\"good moral character\\" in deciding to certify him. Both responses were received by Miedema in late October. At no time throughout the \\"investigation\\" which was the ostensible reason for the \\"temporary\\" transfer, did school authorities make any inquiry concerning Acanfora's conduct as a classroom teacher at Parkland Junior High School, nor was he offered or provided a hearing of any kind. Although court testimony revealed the \\"investigation\\" was completed upon receipt of the letters from Pennsylvania, and although those letters contained nothing but praise for Acanfora, Montgomery County Schools did not reinstate him to the classroom. The transfer of Acanfora became a subject of great public interest, both locally and nationally. Acanfora accepted invitations to appear on several radio and television programs including CBS's 60 Minutes, which devoted a 20-minute segment to the case, entitled \\"The Case of Joe Acanfora\\".\\"60 Minutes video here\\" The substance of his remarks in all those appearances was threefold, that: * employment discrimination against homosexuals was unjust, * he would never discuss his sexual orientation with students in or out of school, and * he hoped that greater public understanding of homosexuals would develop.  Acanfora v. Board of Education: Proceedings in the U.S. District Court in Maryland  On November 7, 1972, Acanfora instituted a lawsuit against the Board of Education, the Superintendent (Dr. Elseroad), and the Deputy Superintendent (Dr. Miedema), under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The complaint alleged that: # Acanfora had been transferred for constitutionally impermissible reasons, and # he had been denied procedural due process. An extensive trial ensued in the federal District court in Baltimore, Maryland. Much of the trial was devoted to eliciting the facts outlined above. Acanfora testified regarding the philosophy that guided him in his professional role as a teacher. He explained in his testimony that in his view it would be wholly inappropriate for a teacher to discuss his sexual orientation with students. He would not, and had not, discussed any aspects of sexuality either with students or fellow faculty members. He would not advocate, and had not advocated, that any other person participate in homosexual activities. Asked how, if he were reinstated, he would respond to students who might inquire about his homosexuality. Acanfora testified that he would tell students that he did not inquire into their personal lives and that he wished them not to inquire into his. Acanfora's supervisor testified that his teaching performance had been wholly satisfactory. Students of Acanfora testified that he was a popular and effective teacher and that they hoped he would be reinstated. Students and faculty alike had sponsored petitions urging Montgomery county Schools to reinstate him. (Both the local Montgomery County Education Association and the National Education Association, the largest teachers' group in the U.S., lent their support.) The record contained no evidence that any students, parents, or faculty members objected to his reinstatement at the time. In addition to testimony concerning the facts, both sides introduced concerning the possible effects of Acanfora teaching in the classroom. The experts were unanimous that there is generally no danger in homosexuals teaching in the public schools. However, Montgomery County School Board's experts contended that the return of Acanfora to the classroom might conceivably be dangerous because of the conjunction of two additional facts: # as a result of the publicity, his students would be aware of his homosexuality, and # he taught at a grade level in which students were entering adolescence. In their view, if Acanfora was an effective and popular teacher he would constitute a \\"role model\\" for his students. The experts feared that a \\"relatively few\\" students who enter adolescence with \\"extreme emotional disturbances\\" might be so impressed with Acanfora as a teacher that they would seek to emulate him in all respects, and thus decide to become homosexuals. The experts likened their view that Acanfora be excluded from the classroom to an \\"inoculation program\\" even though only a \\"handful of individuals\\" might be affected, he should be excluded. They acknowledged that their concerns were wholly speculative, that there was no relevant data on the subject, and that there is no known instance of a homosexual teacher, simply because he was known to be a homosexual, having an adverse effect on even a single adolescent. Acanfora's experts disagreed with this speculation, advancing several reasons why Acanfora's impressiveness as a teacher would not result in students becoming homosexuals to emulate him. The Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Elseroad, testified that he opposed reinstatement of Acanfora, for three reasons: # Acanfora had \\"withheld information on his application\\" i.e. his membership in the Homophiles of Penn State, # employment of a known homosexual in the classroom \\"increases the risk of having a good model available for students in the public schools\\", and # because Acanfora's homosexuality \\"has become widely-known and highly publicized\\", returning him to the classroom \\"would involve that school in a swirl of controversy. . .\\" On May 1, 1973, after the trial but prior to the district court's decision, Montgomery County Schools notified Acanfora that his employment would not be renewed for the 1973‚Äì74 school year. The notification did not state the reasons for non-renewal, but its issuance came only two weeks after Dr. Elseroad's testimony as to the reasons why he did not believe Acanfora should be reinstated to the classroom. The district court reopened the record, at Acanfora's request, to admit the non-renewal notice into evidence. District Court's opinion The district court found that it was \\"quite clear from the evidence that the essential reason for the transfer was that Acanfora is an admitted homosexual\\", and that \\"the Board of Education would not knowingly hire a homosexual\\". \\"The Board has in no way attacked Acanfora's classroom performance, nor has it charged Acanfora with bringing up the subject of homosexuality in the school environment. The evidence is that he is competent and that he did not discuss his private life while at school\\". Declaring that \\"the time has come today for private, consenting, adult homosexuality to enter the sphere of constitutionally protectible interests\\", the court ruled that one's right to be a homosexual is protected by the First Amendment's freedom of association and by the right of privacy enunciated by this Court in, inter alia, Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). The court concluded, therefore, that Acanfora could be removed from the classroom, and his protected interests thus transgressed, only if there were an overriding state interest justifying that action. The only evidence which had been proffered by respondents going to that issue was the testimony of their experts, and accordingly the court recounted all of the expert testimony in great detail. The court concluded that respondents had not sustained their burden of proving an overriding state interest. While it would be \\"premature to state definitively that Acanfora's presence in the classroom would have no deleterious effect\\", the risk, albeit \\"not illusory\\", \\"does not seem as great or as likely as defendants have assumed\\". The court concluded that \\"the 'board of education's policy of not knowingly employing any homosexuals is objectionable\\"; that \\"mere knowledge that a teacher is homosexual is not sufficient to justify transfer or dismissal\\"; that a teacher need not hide his homosexuality in order to retain his teaching position; that the transfer was \\"arbitrary\\" and \\"without legal justification as matters then stood\\"; and that the transfer was a \\"transgression\\" by Montgomery County Public Schools. The district court also held that Acanfora had been denied procedural due process. Acanfora had a \\"clearly implied promise of continued employment in a classroom teaching capacity for the duration of [his] contract\\", and thus a property interest which could not be taken away without procedural due process. Additionally, the precipitous transfer was \\"an implicit allegation that his homosexuality determines unfitness to teach\\", and thus interfered with his liberty interests. Since defendants transferred him without any prior investigation or hearing, and thereafter conducted only a \\"cursory investigation\\" without even then providing him any hearing, he was denied procedural due process. Despite these rulings, the district court held that Acanfora was entitled to no relief for any of the constitutional violations committed against him. With respect to the substantive violations, the court held that Acanfora's post-transfer appearances on radio and television programs disqualified him from entitlement to relief. Those appearances \\"were not reasonably necessary\\" for \\"self-defense\\", and would likely spark unnecessary controversy regarding the subject of \\"homosexuality and the classroom\\". \\"Accordingly, despite the initial transgression of the defendants, the Court cannot grant plaintiff the relief for which he prays. Plaintiff's public activities as herein described are not 'protectable' and the Court cannot at this time characterize the refusal to reinstate plaintiff or renew his contract as arbitrary or capricious under either the First Amendment or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\" With respect to the procedural due process violations, the district court thought them cured by the de nova trial which Acanfora received in his lawsuit: \\"The parties have shifted their attention to the plenary hearing in this forum\\". 4th Circuit Court of Appeals' decision On appeal, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals issued its decision concluding that Acanfora's post-transfer public appearances were protected by the First Amendment, and that \\"they do not justify either the action taken by the school system or the dismissal of his suit [by the district court]\\". Nevertheless, \\"without reaching Acanfora's claim that his denial of a teaching position is unconstitutional, we affirm the district court, but on different grounds\\". In the view of the court below, Acanfora \\"is not entitled to relief because of material omissions in his application for a teaching position\\". The court found controlling a series of decisions in which this Court and other courts of appeals have held that one who is prosecuted or otherwise punished for lying to the Government may not defend by attacking the constitutionality of the question which elicited the lie. Acanfora had argued that these cases were inapposite \\"because the school officials transferred him on account of his homosexuality, not the omission from his application\\". The court acknowledged, as the district court had found, that the transfer was not motivated by the omission from the application. Nevertheless, it found the cases controlling for two reasons. First, to limit the cases to prosecution or punishment for lying would constitute \\"an unduly restrictive application of the principles expressed\\" in those cases. Second, respondents should not be \\"prejudiced\\" by their failure to rely upon the omission as a motivation for transferring Acanfora, for at that time they only suspected that the omission was deliberate and it was not until trial that the suspicion was confirmed. The court noted that at trial the Superintendent had testified that the omission was one of the reasons which made him unwilling to reinstate Acanfora, and concluded that this was sufficient to warrant application of the \\"lying to the Government\\" cases. With respect to the procedural due process issue, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals merely reiterated the district court's reasoning that, as there had been a full hearing in court, the failure to furnish an administrative hearing was cured. U. S Supreme Court denies certiorari Acanfora appealed the decision of the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to the United States Supreme Court at its October Term, 1973. The Court thereafter denied certiorari, effectively upholding the lower court decision and refusing to reinstate Acanfora to his teaching position with Montgomery County Public Schools.  Life after the court cases  Acanfora never taught after he was not reinstated at Montgomery County Public Schools. Instead, he found work in Washington, D.C. and later moved to California. Once in California, Acanfora stayed within higher education, working at the University of California, in contract and grant administration and in patents and intellectual property management. These days, Acanfora lives in Saigon with his husband, and they blog about their food experiences there.

He was wounded in the leg in the Battle of Belleau Wood after charging an enemy machine-gun nest on 25 June. After begging the doctors not to amputate, he went home to spend two painful years recuperating at the Brooklyn Naval Hospital. He later damaged it with a fall on the ice, and it was amputated in 1922. Many years later, he had to have his remaining leg amputated, as well. After finishing his convalescence, Stallings and Poteat married on March 8, 1919; they had two daughters, Sylvia (born 1926) and Diana (born 1931), before divorcing in 1936. In 1928‚Äì1929, they restored Poteat House near Yanceyville, North Carolina. Through Helen his aunt by marriage was the painter Ida Isabella Poteat. The year following his divorce, Stallings married Louise St. Leger Vance, his secretary at Fox Studios. They had two children, Laurence, Jr. (born 1939) and Sally (born 1941). Stallings died of a heart attack in Pacific Palisades, California. He was buried with full military honors at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in Point Loma near San Diego. Career Stallings and American film artist Raoul Walsh, who later directed the 1926 film version of What Price Glory, in 1918 Stallings received a Master of Science degree from Georgetown University, after which he worked as a reporter, critic, and entertainment editor at the New York World. He was impressed by Maxwell Anderson's first play, White Desert, and the two joined forces to collaborate on What Price Glory, which opened at the Plymouth Theatre in New York City in 1924. The critically acclaimed play ran for 435 performances and spawned two film adaptations. The two went on to co-write the plays The First Flight and The Buccaneer, both in 1925. Stallings continued his theatre career with the book and lyrics for the musical Deep River (1926), adapted Ernest Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms for the stage in 1930, co-wrote the book for the musicals Rainbow (1928) with Oscar Hammerstein, and Virginia (1937) with Owen Davis, and penned the play The Streets Are Guarded in 1944. He was a member of the Algonquin Round Table. Stallings' novel, the autobiographical Plumes, was published in 1924 and was a success, with nine printings by 1925. It depicts Richard Plume, a veteran with a missing leg, attempting to adapt to society after the war. It was adapted into King Vidor's The Big Parade, which was quite successful and remained MGM's largest-grossing film until Gone with the Wind in 1939. He was regarded as a key influence on three of John Ford's greatest films, serving as writer or co-writer for 3 Godfathers, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and The Sun Shines Bright. Additional screenwriting credits included Northwest Passage, The Man from Dakota, and On Our Merry Way. Stallings's last book, The Doughboys: The Story of the AEF, 1917-1918, was published in 1963. The nonfiction account of World War I partly explores the racism and discrimination faced by the black troops during the war. Stallings was recalled up to service with the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II as a lieutenant colonel, but did not serve overseas.

Whitney is one of two high schools in Rocklin Unified School District; its counterpart is Rocklin High School. The school is the district's newest educational facility, having opened in 2005 to freshmen and sophomores; Whitney's first freshmen graduated at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 school year. That same school year, Whitney was recognized as a California Distinguished School. The school educates its students using a modified block schedule program that alternates four periods every two days. Students are subject to eight different periods in total. Students at the school are also taught through a standard-based essential skills program, where students must demonstrate mastery of all skills deemed necessary in a class before credits can be earned; additionally, students must achieve a grade higher than C by the year's end, as scores lower than C equate to a \\"No mark\\", and the course must be retaken. As of the end of the 2009‚Äì10 school year, the high school fielded twenty-three clubs, including an award-winning school yearbook (known as Details), a school newspaper (known as the Roar), and an Emmy winning broadcast program (known as Unleashed). Whitney also ran twenty-three sports teams as of the 2008‚Äì09 school year; the football and girls' soccer teams were champions at the 2009 Sac-Joaquin Section Championships for the respective sports. History Whitney's name was a significant subject of debate, as the school's first two proposed names were associated too closely with other schools in the area. The school was initially designated Granite Ridge High School, which was deemed too similar to RUSD's Granite Oaks Middle School. It was then designated as Liberty High School, but the name was associated with the rival Lincoln High School. Rocklin Unified School District finally decided on \\"Whitney\\" in honor of Joel Parker Whitney, the man who suggested that his successful Boston businessman father, George Whitney, invest in the 1854 development of Placer County, which was then a major locale for gold-seeking Argonauts. George Whitney would later found and develop the city of Rocklin. Additional debate revolved around the school's mascot and colors; deliberation around data collected via survey from the city of Rocklin and other Rocklin Unified School District entities ultimately convinced the district administration to choose the wildcat and the colors of maroon and gold. Construction began in October 2003 with preliminary site work and underground utilities; construction of the buildings started on April 2004. The high school opened its doors to over 721 ninth and tenth grade students on August 22, 2005, while still partially under construction. Its opening relieved the strain of overcrowding that had previously affected Rocklin High School. Whitney was recognized as a California Distinguished institution on April 1, 2009, four years after its opening in 2005; the school was noted for this achievement, and is one of six in Placer County to merit the title. On May 19, 2009, Whitney and other recently designated California Distinguished Schools were congratulated in a ceremony in Anaheim. Three petitions were issued by local charter school Rocklin Academy to found a 7‚Äì12 grade charter school called Western Sierra Collegiate Academy in 2008 and base it on the grounds of either Whitney or Rocklin High School. Rocklin Unified School District denied the school its facilities in its first two attempts, although the academy secured a location where Rocklin's Sierra Christian Academy once operated by 2009. Whitney teacher Matthew Yamamoto was arrested in September 2012 on suspicion of molesting an underage student. The school district waited two days after the arrest before informing parents. In 2013, Yamamoto pleaded no contest to oral copulation with a minor, attempted sexual intercourse with a minor and sexual penetration with a foreign object on a minor, and pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. He received the maximum sentence of five years in prison, in light of his violation of a restraining order during the investigation. =Facility= The campus was designed to accommodate 1800 students and 175 employees. The area that Whitney's thirteen campus buildings occupy total approximately and includes a total of 65 classrooms, while Whitney's sports fields encompass of hard court and grass athletic areas. Of all structures on the campus, the theatre was amongst the last to be completed; construction was finished the following January. In all, the school's construction cost $82 million. Excluding Whitney's sports fields, the school's outdoor facilities are composed of a number of circular gathering areas (including an amphitheatre) that were designed for use during lunch hour and for outdoor class excursions. In addition, Whitney's class campus structures have private workspaces for the teaching faculty from which each of the structure's classrooms branch off. Academic curriculum In accordance with recommendations made by the California's Department of Education, Rocklin Unified School District students are taught using a standards-based curriculum; each student much fulfill a set of essential skills before they are allowed to pass the class. The program is initially implemented in district elementary schools. For some classes, like English, essential skills may be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade on assigned essays or tests. In classes like mathematics, Essential Skills must be demonstrated by receiving a passing grade in specific skills on cumulative tests. In addition, WHS policy does not allow F or D grades. Any grade below a grade of C is considered a No Mark (NM) or a No Credit (NC); the class must then be repeated to get a passing grade. This plan attempts to prepare students for the California High School Exit Exam, or CAHSEE test, which they are expected to pass prior to graduation; CAHSEE is provided to students during their second year. The test covers grade 6‚Äì10 language arts concepts, as well as pre-algebraic and Algebra I mathematics. Whitney High School in 2006, as seen from Wildcat Boulevard Whitney High School offers a college preparatory-based curriculum where students are required to take four years of language arts, three and a half years of social studies, three years of mathematics and science each, three years of physical education, and one year's worth of foreign languages, technology and applied sciences, and visual and performing arts (VAPA). One semester of health education and ten semesters' worth of electives are also mandatory for graduation, in addition to twenty-five hours of completed community service. Whitney sports fifteen advanced placement classes, ranging from subjects in foreign language and core classes to VAPA electives, such as art. Each class is managed by one of eleven academic departments. Nine departments will be experienced by students before the end of their senior year, as one or more of their classes are mandatory for graduation. The other two departments are specialized courses; one involves the Culinary Arts, while the other involves a precollegiate form of ROTC. This system of Professional Learning Communities was designed by Illinois's former Adlai E. Stevenson High School principal, Richard Du Four. Whitney High School runs along the Response to Intervention guideline; the RTI model implements a three-tiered research-based plan to catch students who are struggling in their schooling. The model implements a number of measures intended to assist students, including an intervention period, an AVID program, night and summer school programs, and Section 504 plans. Among the programs, the intervention periods are twenty minutes set before lunch that is intended for students who need to fulfill the academic requirements in which they are lacking. The AVID program pertains to students who are socially or economically disadvantaged. Whitney students undergo a full eight-class period school day extended over two individual days in a modified block schedule. Each year, as a result, students complete eight classes. Of the 320 possible credits, 250 credits are required for graduation. At the end of the 2007‚Äì2008 school year, 48.6% of Whitney's graduating seniors were qualified for entry into a University of California or California State University campus; 39.6% were accepted into four-year institutions. 12% of the graduating class motioned directly for employment or joined the US military. Demographics 1,438 students attended Whitney High School during the 2007‚Äì08 school year; of these students, there were 361 freshmen, 424 sophomores, 355 juniors, and 298 seniors. The student body is predominantly Caucasian (70.51%), where the largest minorities represented are Hispanics (9.18%) and Asians (5.35%). 9.6% of the school's students marked their race as either \\"mixed\\" or did not respond at all. 14% of the student body reported themselves socio-economically disadvantaged, 8% reported themselves as having a disability, and 3% of the school population reported themselves as ESL students. 96.1% of the Whitney student body graduated in its first school year; in the 2005‚Äì06 school year, every student passed the requirements for graduation. The school's first dropout students were in the 2006‚Äì07 school year; 1.5% of the school's students were part of that group. Class sizes had increased in all core classes between the school's founding in 2005 and the School Accountability Report Card for the 2007‚Äì08 school year, where an average 23.1 English class size and an average 21.9 mathematics class size had increased to, respectively, average class sizes of 25.4 and 25.0. Extracurricular activities =Clubs and publications= As of April of the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, Whitney High School runs forty-seven clubs.2010‚Äì2011 Whitney High School Club Roster. Retrieved April 12, 2011. Many of these clubs, including those pertaining to art, dance, music (the school's band and orchestra), foreign language, and the United States Air Force Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps, directly correspond to official classes that are run by the school itself. Others, including the California Scholarship Federation and National Honor Society, can be used as catalysts to fulfill the community service graduation requirement. The high school's yearbook, known as Details, was awarded a Silver Crown Award at the 2009 Scholastic Awards Convention at Columbia University alongside Rocklin High School's yearbook; in addition, Whitney's yearbook placed first in the 2006 National Student Press Association Best-of-Show's Yearbook length 1‚Äì224 pages category. The school's newspaper, known as The Roar, was founded in the spring of 2005 by the school's Journalism I course; the first issue was released in March of the following year. Whitney High School's student government is known as the Associated Student Body, or ASB. The association is responsible for organizing rallies, dances, and other schoolwide activities. =Sports= Whitney High School fields eleven boys' sports teams and twelve girls' sports teams. Nearly all sports have teams of both genders, although exceptions do exist: baseball and football are specific to males, while cheerleading, drill team, softball, and team tennis are specific to females. Whitney's sports teams participate in the Pioneer Valley League, which includes six other high schools in El Dorado County, Placer County, Nevada County, and Sacramento County. Whitney's football team won the Sac-Joaquin Section championships in 2008; they were runners-up to Oakdale High School the previous year and reached the championships again in 2009. Likewise, the girls' soccer team won the Sac- Joaquin Section championships in 2009. Nazir Rasooli was the champion of the 2009 Sac-Joaquin Section Wrestling Championship, and was the first Whitney wrestler to qualify for the State championship.

Flores-Montano, 541 U.S. 149 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that customs agents may remove the gas tank from a vehicle crossing the international border in an effort to look for contraband.  Background  Flores-Montano (\\"Flores\\") was driving a 1987 Ford Taurus station wagon as he attempted to enter the United States through the port of entry at Otay Mesa, California. A customs inspector referred the vehicle to secondary inspection, where a second inspector tapped the gas tank and noticed it sounded solid. The second inspector summoned a mechanic who, less than half an hour later, arrived and removed the gas tank from the car. The mechanic then removed an access plate from the tank and found 37 kilograms of marijuana. The process of removing the gas tank took between 15 and 25 minutes. Flores was indicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California for importing marijuana into the United States and for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute it. Relying on Ninth Circuit precedent in effect at the time requiring reasonable suspicion for removal of a gas tank, Flores filed a motion to suppress the marijuana found in his car. Although the Government urged the district court to ignore that precedent, the district court declined to do so and granted Flores's suppression motion. The Ninth Circuit summarily affirmed the granting of the suppression motion, and the Government asked the Supreme Court to review the case. Opinion of the Court In United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, , the Court had said, \\"Routine searches of the persons and effects of entrants are not subject to any requirement of reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or warrant.\\" The Ninth Circuit interpreted this language to mean that reasonable suspicion was required when government agents sought to conduct an \\"intrusive\\" search at the border, including searches involving the removal and dismantling of gas tanks. The Supreme Court rejected this reasoning because \\"the reasons that might support a requirement of some level of suspicion in the case of highly intrusive searches of the person ‚Äî dignity and privacy interests of the person being searched ‚Äî simply do not carry over to vehicles.\\" Accordingly, the Supreme Court found the Ninth Circuit's rule to be inconsistent with the meaning of \\"reasonableness\\" under the Fourth Amendment. The Court's ruling in this case rests on the fact that the search at issue in this case took place at the international border. \\"The Government's interest in preventing the entry of unwanted persons and effects is at its zenith at the international border.\\" In light of the Government's interest in protecting its sovereignty and territorial integrity, \\"searches made at the border... are reasonable simply by virtue of the fact that they occur at the border.\\" Indeed, the statute authorizing the search in this case derived ultimately from a statute first passed in 1789. Smugglers frequently attempt to penetrate the border, and using vehicle gas tanks is a common tactic. In the five and a half years preceding the decision in this case, 18,788 drug seizures had occurred at the ports of entry in southern California, and of those involving vehicles, 4,619, or 25%, were from gas tanks. In addition, instances of persons smuggled in and around gas tank compartments are discovered at the ports of entry of San Ysidro and Otay Mesa about once ever 10 days. Flores argued he had an expectation of privacy in his gas tank. But the Court pointed out that a reasonable expectation of privacy is diminished at the international border. \\"It is difficult to imagine how the search of a gas tank, which should be solely a repository for fuel, could be more of an invasion of privacy than the search of the automobile's passenger compartment.\\" Flores also pointed to the potential of a search like the one at issue in this case to cause damage to the vehicle. But the Court replied that the searches are not truly destructive, and that there was not a single accident among the \\"many thousands of gas tank disassemblies that have occurred at the border.\\" A gas tank search is a brief procedure that can easily be reversed without damaging the vehicle, and if by chance the vehicle were damaged in the process, the owner could sue for damages.

His life Sava Babiƒá's parents arrived to Vojvodina from Hercegovina. From the autumn of 1941 he studied at a Hungarian school. He finished the high school in Subotica. In 1953 he passed the school-leaving exam, then studied Yugoslav literature at the University of Belgrade. He worked for several publishing houses and cultural institutions. Since 1974 he taught at the universities of Novi Sad, then Belgrade, where in 1993 he founded the Department of Hungarian Language and Literature, and worked as its head till 1999, when he retired. In 2007 he received the Golden Cross of Merit of Hungary. Babiƒá is also an honorary citizen of Balatonf√ºred. His first translation was a novel of Tibor Cseres: Hideg napok. It was an important gesture of reconciliation between Serbs and Hungarians, because Cseres's book describes Hungarian war criminals reminiscencing in judicial custody about their crimes and killings of non-Hungarian population in 1942 raids in southern Baƒçka. Babiƒá translated also the works of S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi, Istv√°n √ñrk√©ny, Mikl√≥s Hubay, Gyula Illy√©s, Tibor D√©ry, Gyula Kr√∫dy, Istv√°n E√∂rsi, S√°ndor We√∂res, √Åd√°m Bodor, Lajos Szab√≥, Ott√≥ Tolnai and P√©ter Esterh√°zy.

Area C covers portions of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Area C also covers about of over-ocean airspace south of Long Island. Area C is responsible for descending Boston Logan arrivals, climbing Boston Logan departures, and working arrival and departure traffic to and from John F. Kennedy International Airport. Area C also climbs all northeast-bound and oceanic departures from the New York metropolitan area. Additionally, Area C descends and climbs traffic to and from airports such as T. F. Green, Long Island MacArthur, and Bradley International. Area D is the largest area in ZBW, covering almost half of the total airspace. Area D overlies the eastern portions of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and most of Maine, as well as owning airspace extending around east of the coast. Area D is responsible for descending and climbing traffic to and from Boston Logan, Bangor International Airport, Portland International Jetport, and all Cape Cod area airports. Area D also includes some Canadian airspace, mostly over New Brunswick, but also a small area of Quebec. The bulk of this is an artifact dating back to the Cold War when Loring Air Force Base, a SAC bomber base lying very close to the international border, was active. Loring's circular terminal control area, that no longer exists, extended into New Brunswick. This area was included with the rest of the TCA in Boston's area of responsibility. The base closed in 1994, but the Canadian airspace has not been transferred back to Canadian control. Area E covers portions of New York state and western Massachusetts. Area E is primarily responsible for working traffic landing and departing New York metropolitan airports such as John F. Kennedy, Newark Liberty, and LaGuardia. The New York TRACON underlies most of Area E. ZBW is bordered by the following ARTCCs/ACCs/FIRs: * New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZNY) * Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZOB) * Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZDC) * Montreal ACC (ZUL) * Moncton ACC (ZQM) * Toronto ACC (ZYZ)  Sectors and frequencies  Boston Center Sector Maps = Area A =  Low Altitude Sectors  * ALB 22 (Albany 22) - 121.350/257.850 Departure traffic flows consist of all jets off Albany requesting flight levels and prop departures going north, east or west. Bradley jet departures routed over CTR also traverse this sector. En route traffic flows include eastbound traffic on V2, westbound traffic on V490, northbound on V487, and southbound over ALB. Arrivals to EWR, PVD, ISP, HPN, BDL, LGA, MHT, SYR and ALB are descended through the Albany Sector. The Albany Sector controls from 110 up to FL230. It overlies about half of Albany ATCT and shares a common boundary with fourteen ZBW sectors. This sector is a departure, en route and arrival sector. * HNK 23 (Hancock 23) - 133.250/279.500 This sector controls both arrivals and departures from SYR, UCA and BGM. It is also responsible for IFR approaches and departures to and from OIC, N66 and N23. The major traffic flows include arrivals to ALB, V167 traffic to EWR, V433 traffic to New York area airports, V14 traffic eastbound and V2 traffic westbound. The Hancock Sector controls from the ground up to 17,000 feet MSL. It shares a common boundary with Syracuse ATCT, Binghamton ATCT, Albany ATCT, Wilkes-Barre ATCT, New York TRACON (LIB Sector), two ZNY sectors, one ZOB sector and five ZBW sectors.  High Altitude Sectors  * UCA 09 (Utica 09) - 123.8750/323.00 The Utica Sector controls FL 280 to FL 600. It shares a common boundary with three ZOB sectors and 9 ZBW sectors. The sector's primary traffic flow is westbound on J547. This traffic includes aircraft landing at ORD, DTW, CLE and MSP. Another traffic flow comes through the sector from the Canadian facilities. This includes traffic to and from YUL, YOW, YMX and JFK. Most traffic crosses at SYR. Two ARs and 5 ATCAAs are also found in this sector. * DNY 24 (Delancey 24) - 127.375/388.8 The Delancey Sector is responsible for sequencing and descending aircraft destined to ALB, PHL, EWR, HPN, LGA and BDL. Most conflicts occur in the area from HNK to DNY to RKA and back to HNK. This is where most of the aircraft in this sector will be crossing and descending. The Delancey Sector controls from FL180 up to FL270. It shares a common boundary with two ZOB sectors, three ZNY sectors, and seven ZBW sectors.  Low-High Altitude Sectors  * ART 08 (Watertown 08) - 135.250/377.1000 This sector shares a common boundary with five different Canadian facilities. The Watertown Sector contains IRs, VRs, ARs, MOAs, ATCAAs and a Restricted Area. The Watertown Sector controls from the ground up except for the airspace that underlies the Utica Sector, which owns FL 280 and above, and the airspace delegated to Syracuse ATCT, Utica ATCT, Wheeler Sack ATCT, and Montreal Centre. The sector is responsible for IFR approaches and departures at MAL, MSS, YCC, OGS, and PTD. The sector also contains a number of small airports without SIAPs.  Super High Altitude Sectors  * RKA 10 (Rockdale 10) - 124.120/273.550 The primary traffic flow through the sector is eastbound. The sector's primary purpose is to sequence traffic to BOS, BDL, PVD and PIT. At HNK, PIT and PVD arrivals cross with JFK departures that are still climbing to altitude. Just east of RKA, PIT arrivals cross with BDL arrivals. South of SYR, aircraft flightplanned toward JHW conflict with IAD and YUL arrivals, and all of these traffic flows conflict with eastbound traffic from ZOB. The Rockdale Sector controls FL280 and above. It shares a common boundary with two ZOB sectors, one ZNY sector and four ZBW sectors. = Area B =  Low Altitude Sectors  * GDM 36 (Gardner 36) - 123.75/338.2 GDM Sector controls aircraft in an area encompassing Gardner, MA; Keene, NH; Mount Monadnock, NH; Turners Falls Airport (Montague, MA); Deerfield Valley Regional Airport (West Dover, VT) flight level 230 and below. En route NAVAIDs EEN VORTAC, GDM VORTAC.BOS, BOS satellite airport and MHT arrivals make up most of the turbojet traffic transitioning through the sector. GDM Sector also provides service to tower en route traffic entering and departing the New York metropolitan area at and below 10,000 feet. Radar coverage in the GDM Sector is very good due to its close proximity to ARSR and ASR-9 radars. Traffic advisories are also provided to VFR aircraft as workload permits. When traffic permits Sector 37 (Concord) is combined at Sector 36 (Gardner). * CON 37 (Concord 37) - 134.7/269.475 CON sector controls aircraft in an area covering the southern portion of New Hampshire, flight level 230 and below except for areas controlled by Boston Consolidated TRACON. En route NAVAIDs LEB, MHT VORDMEs and CON VORTAC. BOS, BOS satellite departures to the north and west fly through the CON sector. CON also provides approach control services to LEB airport. This sector is responsible for controlling LASER S and AR631. When traffic permits this sector is combined with Sector 36 (Gardner). * MPV 52 (Montpelier 52) - 135.700/282.200 (or 120.35 at or below 10,000 in the SLK area) This sector is stratified from the surface to FL230. Traffic at FL180 and above is primarily en route via J595 or ALB-YSC, creating a crossing point 50 miles east of PLB. Low altitude traffic is not generally on any preferential route; there is no well-defined crossing point in the low structure. There is a high volume of traffic on V141 between BTV and LEB. Sector 52 is the controlling sector for YANKEE 1 and YANKEE 2 MOAs. Sector 52 controls all airspace within its lateral boundaries at all altitudes except for 5,000 feet and below delegated to CON-37 for the ILS-18 to LEB; 10,000 and below delegated to Burlington; and 5,000 feet and below delegated to Portland ATCT. When traffic permits Sector 53 is combined with Sector 52.  High Altitude Sectors  * ATHENS 38 (Athens 38) - 135.320/360.600 There are two eastbound flows of traffic in Sector 38. One is along J16, consisting of high altitude Boston terminal arrival traffic. The other is along J68 for PVD and Long Island metro arrivals. Crossing with these flows is north/south traffic to/from NY metro, destined for Canada and overseas. Sector 38 owns all airspace within its lateral boundaries at and above FL240. When traffic permits Sector 39 is combined with Sector 38. * CAM 39 (Cambridge 39) - 128.320/348.700 Sector 39 is the high altitude, west departure sector for Boston metro. Traffic is primarily westbound, handed off from Sector 37, and climbing to en route flight levels. New York departure traffic crosses the Boston departure track about 30 NM west of MHT. Sector 39 is also responsible for sequencing high altitude NY arrival traffic flight planned over ALB. Sector 39 owns all airspace within its lateral boundaries at and above FL240. When traffic permits sector 39 is combined with sector 38. * PLB 53 (Plattsburgh 53) - 118.82/251.075 This sector is stratified at FL240 and above. High altitude traffic is primarily north/south traffic going in or out of BTV, YUL, and YOW. Any crossing traffic is likely to occur at PLB. Low altitude traffic is also north/south into the same terminals. Sector 53 owns all airspace within its lateral boundaries. When traffic permits Sector 53 is combined with Sector 52. The sector contains a portion of the LASER ATCAAs and abuts the AKS and SCOTTY ATCAAs. = Area C =  Low Altitude Sectors  * CLIPPER 32 (CLIPPER 32) - 135.800/132.300//292.150 This is the new sector created with the combination of the SARDI and ERICK sectors. This sector serves as a departure and arrival sector for North Atlantic JFK departures, departure and arrival sector for Long Island and southern Connecticut airports, arrival sector for White Plains Airport, and an en route sector for north/south low altitude overflights. The departures are handed off by N90 (JFK and ISP areas), and the arrivals are handed off to New York TRACON (ISP area) or New York TRACON Rober arrivals. JFK arrivals overhead CCC are potentially in conflict with VFR parachute operations at Skydive Long Island which operate over the CCC VOR. The SARDI sector, which became CLIPPER, was working TWA800 when it exploded. * PVD 34 (Providence 34) - 124.850/269.200 (Handles BOS arrivals from the southwest) The sector serves as a primary arrival sector for jets landing at Logan Airport that are handed off to Boston ATCT. Additional traffic flows include Bradley departures traveling southeast and non-jet arrivals landing at Boston south satellite airports. The sector serves as a meter sector for Logan Airport. * BOSOX 47 (BOSOX 47) - 133.425/307.900 (Handles BOS departures to the west-southwest & BED/PVD arrivals/depts to/from west) The sector serves as a primary departure sector for departures handed off by Boston ATCT and by Providence ATCT traveling west/southwest. Additional traffic includes Bradley departures via HFD VOR handed off by Bradley TRACON and Boston north satellite arrivals handed off to Bradley TRACON.  High Altitude Sectors  * HTO 31 (Hampton 31) - 124.52/299.7 The primary traffic flow in the sector is north/south overflights. Additional flows are North Atlantic JFK departures and Providence arrivals from the southwest. The primary area for traffic conflicts is southwest of HTO between the JFK departures, PHL arrivals, and other overflight traffic. * BOS 46 (Boston HI 46) - Currently 126.225, past freqs were 118.425 & 127.825/370.900 The primary traffic flows in the sector are Logan and Providence departures to the west/southwest, JFK arrivals via TRAIT Intersection, New York metro departures bound for Europe, and overflights. BOSTON is the busiest, most complex sector in Area C. The hijack of American Airlines Flight 11 occurred in the western portion of BOSTON HI. The western boundary of the sector approximately traverses the Naugatuck Valley of Connecticut, with IGN 20 high altitude sector being to the west.  Super High Altitude Sector  * SOUTHIE 49 (Southie 49) - 132.3 This sector overlies the HTO sector and is split from it during busy traffic periods. At those times the HTO sector will only work aircraft up to 31,000 feet (FL310) and Southie will work aircraft FL320 and above and FL280 and above over the New York Metro Area. When New York Center shuts off traffic from Boston and or Washington Center, aircraft are routed through HTO and SOUTHIE to keep things moving. This is an example of the flexibility of Boston and Washington, without which delays would climb significantly. = Area D =  Low Altitude Sectors  * SURRY 15 (SURRY 15) - 120.25/124.250/124.750/121.6(Clearance Delivery Frequency/290.500/346.400/239.05/290.500/321.300 Sector 15 is a low altitude sector that serves a number of Maine airports: BGR, BXM, AUG, HUL, PQI and PNN.

Traffic Management Unit (TMU)  It is the job of the TMU to balance air traffic demand with system capacity to ensure maximum efficiency and utilization of the airspace. As a result, this creates a safe and orderly flow of traffic while minimizing delays. The TMU reports to the ATCSCC (Air Traffic Control System command center). Some of the methods that can be used to help minimize delays are the following: * Altitude * Minutes-in-trail/Miles-in-trail * Fix balancing * Airborne Holding * Sequencing programs which include Departure sequencing program (DSP), Arrival Sequencing Program (ASP)or En-route sequencing program (ESP). * Ground Delay Programs * Ground Stops  Center Weather Service Unit  The CWSU (Center Weather Service Unit) is a Joint Aviation Weather Support Team composed of on- site NWS (National Weather Service) meteorologists and an STMC (Supervisory Traffic Management Coordinator)/TMC (Traffic Management Coordinator) assigned to the WC (Weather Coordinator) Position. The purpose of the CWSU is to provide weather consultation and advice to managers and staff within ZBW and to other FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) facilities.  Flight Data Communications Unit  The purpose of this unit is to provide data processing and monitor all flight plan related entries into the En Route Automatiom Moderization (ERAM) computer system. These flight data messages are exchanged with other air traffic facilities and occasionally require format and content corrections.

Taking place from 1043 to 1045 and so called for falling in the 1041-1048 era of the same name, it was a short-lived attempt to introduce reforms into the traditional way of conducting governmental affairs in China. It was a precursor to a grander effort three decades later led by Wang Anshi. Fan Zhongyan Fan Zhongyan was prefect of Kaifeng, the imperial capital during the Northern Song era, in the 1030s. However, he was demoted to regional posts for criticizing the Chief Councillor. In 1040, the Liao and Western Xia to the north threatened Song security. Fan was brought back to organize a strong defense. Ouyang Xiu Ouyang Xiu was posted to Kaifeng four years after passing his jinshi examination in 1030. He began his association with Fan from this time in Kaifeng. Like Fan, he also was demoted. After Fan‚Äôs demotion, Ouyang criticized Fan‚Äôs principle critic, resulting in being sent to a minor post in Hubei. Like Fan, he was brought back to the capital in the 1040s where he was assigned to work on cataloguing the entire imperial library. Ten-Point Memorial Fan Zhongyan submitted a ten-point memorial in which he outlined his reform objectives. They can be divided into three categories: # Administrative efficiency # Strengthen local governments # Strengthen defense The first set of proposals met opposition from groups of bureaucrats, who deeply resisted. The second set, while farsighted, seemed remote to the court. The third sought to correct Song over corrections for the Tang dynasty‚Äôs mistakes of giving local military commanders too much independent authority. Implementation Many of these reforms were put into effect in the two-year period from 1043 to 1045. However, without the full support of the emperor, there never was complete implementation of the reforms, and not long after they began, backlash from conservative elements at the court resulted in the reformers being brought down and sent out to remote postings in the provinces. Legacy Wang Anshi would take up the banner of reform in the 1070s, not only pushing for many of the Qingli Reforms, but going even further. However, while they remained in place longer than the Qingli Reforms, with the exception of some reforms to the examination system, this reform effort similarly met a dead end.

He was a professor at the University of Belgrade. Early life and education Ostrogorsky was born at Saint Petersburg, Imperial Russia, the son of a secondary school principal and a writer on pedagogical subjects. He completed his secondary education in a St. Petersburg classical gymnasium and thus acquired knowledge of Greek early in life. He began his university studies in Heidelberg, Germany (1921), where he devoted himself initially to philosophy, economics, and sociology, though he also took classes in classical archeology. His teachers included Karl Jaspers, Heinrich Rickert, Alfred Weber and Ludwig Curtius. His interest in history, especially Byzantine history, was awakened by a young Dozent by the name of Percy Ernst Schramm. After studying various aspects of Byzantinology in Paris (1924‚Äì25), Ostrogorsky received his doctorate from the University of Heidelberg (1927) with a dissertation in which he combined his interests in economics and Byzantine history. He then taught as Privatdozent in Breslau from 1928 and moved to Belgrade in 1933. Career Ostrogorsky taught at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy, where he was the Chair for Byzantinology. Ostrogorsky made the Kingdom of Yugoslavia his permanent home and taught at Belgrade for 40 years until his retirement in 1973, leaving the Chair for Byzantinology to Bo≈æidar Ferjanƒçiƒá. He was made a corresponding Member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1946 and a Regular Member two years later. An Institute of Byzantinology was created within the Academy in 1948 with himself as director, a post he held until his death. He was chief editor of the Institute's house organ, the Zbornik radova Vizantolo≈°kog instituta, through its 16th volume which appeared in 1975. He also supervised the monograph series of the Institute of which the choice items were his own study Pronija (1951) and the multivolume collection of Byzantine Sources for the History of the Nations of Yugoslavia. Ostrogorsky repaid in more than one way the hospitality he met with in his new country; he created a new generation of Yugoslav Byzantinists, broadened the horizons of Yugoslav historians by the example of his personal research, and provided for them closer contacts with the world scholarly community.

Plot summary In only their second outing, the Three Investigators are hired by a friend of their patron, Alfred Hitchcock, to find his missing parrot. The boys soon discover that his parrot was one of a group of seven, trained by their former owner to each repeat a specific message. The focus of the investigation shifts from finding the single lost parrot to discovering the secret behind these cryptic messages. The boys aren't the only ones who want to hear the dead man's secret. Others, including an infamous French art thief, Huganay, have also concluded that the messages are the key to locating a particularly valuable hidden item. The coded message is as follows, by parrots, in order: :Little Bo Peep: Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep and doesn't know where to find it. Call on Sherlock Holmes. :Shakespeare (Billy): To-to-to-be or not to-to-to-be. That is the question. :Blackbeard: I'm Blackbeard the pirate and I've buried my treasure where dead men guard it ever. Yo-ho-ho and a bottle o' rum! :Robin Hood: I shot an arrow as a test, a hundred paces shot it west. :Sherlock Holmes: You know my methods, Watson. Three Severns (sic) lead to thirteen. :Captain Kidd: Look under the stones beyond the bones for the box that has no locks. :Scarface: I never give a sucker an even break, and that's a lead pipe cinch. Ha-ha-ha! The messages each stand for something. Little Bo Peep's message talks about calling on Sherlock Holmes, and where would you call on him except for Baker Street? So the parrots give an address on Baker Street. Next is Billy, whose stutter actually is the number of the address, to-to-to-be, or rather, 222-B. So the address is a 222-B Baker Street in California. Next is Blackbeard, who states that dead men guard the treasure. Where else but a graveyard could dead men be? So the final address is a graveyard in California at 222-B Baker Street. Once you get to the entrance, follow Robin Hood's instructions for his arrow and go exactly 100 paces west. After this, see if you are at the Severn family's grave, and if it leads to the graves of thirteen unknown men. Past the graves, follow Captain Kidd's instructions to the letter and search under the huge stones for a box with no locks. Pete picks up a piece of pipe with the edges sealed as a weapon from the pile of stones. Later, he thinks of Scarface's message and how they never solved it or used it, and believes that the lead pipe he picked up at the graveyard is the pipe talked about in the \\"lead pipe cinch\\" joke. His hunch is correct, and the picture is inside the pipe. Adaptations In 1984, an audio adaptation based on the book was released on cassette (BOW-099) by Rainbow Communications Limited of England.

Software metrics Software size, functional measurement The primary measurement of software is size, specifically functional size. The generic principles of functional size are described in the ISO/IEC 14143. Software size is principally measured in function points. It can also be measured in lines of code, or specifically, source lines of code (SLOC) which is functional code excluding comments. Whilst measuring SLOC is interesting, it is more an indication of effort than functionality. Two developers could approach a functional challenge using different techniques, and one might need only write a few lines of code, and the other might need to write many times more lines to achieve the same functionality. The most reliable method for measuring software size is code agnostic, from the user's point of view - in function points. Measuring code One method of software measurement is metrics that are analyzed against the code itself. These are called software metrics and including simple metrics, such as counting the number of lines in a single file, the number of files in an application, the number of functions in a file, etc. Such measurements have become a common software development practice. Measuring software complexity, cohesion and coupling There are also more detailed metrics that help measure things like software complexity, Halstead, cohesion, and coupling.

It is the country's oldest operational rail tunnel, and is on the Lyttelton Line, one of the first in the province. On completion in 1867 it became the first tunnel in the world to be taken through the side of an extinct volcano, and at 2.7 km, the longest in the country. Its opening made the Ferrymead Railway, New Zealand's first public railway line, obsolete.  History  = Background = Canterbury's first settlers had two options for transporting themselves and their goods between the harbour at Lyttelton and the Canterbury plains: the Bridle Path over the Port Hills, or by ship over the Sumner Bar then up either the Heathcote or Avon Rivers. It was therefore with concern over access to the plains that the Canterbury Provincial Council, formed in November 1853, established four months later a Commission to examine the options for improvement. Only one road route was considered feasible, the Sumner Road passing under the summit of Evans Pass via a 350-yard tunnel. There were two contenders for the rail line: a direct route down the Heathcote Valley and through a 2.5 km tunnel to the Lyttelton foreshore, or a more circuitous route via the Avon Heathcote Estuary and around the shore to Sumner, where a shorter tunnel would take the line to Gollans Bay and Lyttelton. The tunnel allowed passage between Lyttelton Harbour and the Canterbury Plains (top) The inability of the commission in its final report to make an unequivocal recommendation as to the best option for connecting the port to the plains resulted in plans for the railway to be temporarily suspended. This only exacerbated the problem to the point where, in 1858, Superintendent William Sefton Moorhouse prevailed upon the Provincial Council to consider the matter again. In response, the council set aside ¬£4,000 to engage the services of an engineer and to seek tenders from reputable engineering firms that may be interested in the project. The provincial Commission that had been established to implement the recommendations of the council, chaired by W. B. Bray, set about investigating the two railway proposals that had earlier been considered, west and east of Mount Pleasant. Provincial Engineer Edward Dobson favoured the latter route as it meant that Gollans Bay could be used to berth ships at a deepwater jetty without having to dredge the area. However, there were several factors against the Gollans Bay route that had to be considered, not least that it bypassed Lyttelton, a growing commercial centre of some importance; its exposure to the wind; and the lack of suitable land at the bay for port facilities. Though the commission considered it to be the best route to the harbour, they discounted the route and decided against a detailed survey of it, as their terms of reference had tasked them with finding a route to Lyttelton. The report from George Robert Stephenson, a consulting engineer to the Provincial Commission, was largely in favour of the \\"Bray\\" route, and made the following points: it was the shortest route providing access to all necessary points; construction costs would be 32% less than the alternative; it would be cheaper to work; and less expensive to maintain. The only point he noted in favour of the route via Gollans Bay was that it would take three years to construct as opposed to five years for the direct route. Having considered the available data, the commission adopted the report from Stephenson and requested that he obtain a tender from a suitable English contractor. = Popular support = Superintendent Moorhouse became a strong proponent of the tunnel project. During the campaign for election of the provincial superintendent in 1857, the tunnel became the central issue, with Moorhouse's opponent, Joseph Brittan, being opposed to the idea. Moorhouse received much support for his position from the residents of Lyttelton, as evidenced by the results of the election: of the 12,000 residents of Canterbury, including 3,205 in Christchurch and 1,944 in Lyttelton, both candidates received 206 votes from the residents of Christchurch. However, overall results were a victory for Moorhouse by 727 votes to 352. Moorhouse later began the project by turning the first sod on 17 July 1861. = Construction = Lyttelton portal of the rail tunnel with construction workers in 1867. Stephenson retained the services of English contractors John Smith and George Knight, who had agreed to complete the project within five years. They dispatched an agent, chief miner and a party of 12 miners to New Zealand near the end of 1859. On arrival in Canterbury, Smith & Knight's miners drove trial shafts at each end of the tunnel. Nine chains from the Lyttelton end they encountered rock much more difficult to bore through than what they had been led to believe they would encounter from samples that had been sent back to England. Given this new information, they concluded that it would not be possible to complete the contract for the original amount, and they sought an additional ¬£30,000 to complete the work. After consulting with the provincial engineers, the Canterbury Government decided not to proceed with the services of Smith & Knight. It was later discovered that Smith & Knight were in severe financial difficulty at the time, a fact which may possibly explain their request for the ¬£30,000 extension on the contract. In light of the failure of Smith & Knight to honour their contract, Moorhouse sought the assent of the council to two measures: to complete tunnel works as far as the test shafts left behind by Smith & Knight, and to seek the services of another contractor by tender to complete the tunnel between the two headings. The council concurred with the first request, honouring its commitment under the terms of the contract with Smith & Knight to assume responsibility for the immigrant workers should the tunnel be abandoned. A decision on the second request was deferred while the council made financial arrangements. Meanwhile, Provincial Engineer Edward Dobson submitted his own plan for the completion of the tunnel from the workings left behind by Smith & Knight. The biggest problem faced by the previous contractors had been encountering water which leaked into the working faces. This made drilling difficult, slowing progress. Dobson proposed the boring of additional shafts from both ends which would eventually drain the excess water. The work commenced with 340 men at an estimated cost of ¬£42,800. Only 96 yards had been driven in the shafts before the next contractors took over the work six months later. Moorhouse continued to advocate for the railway, suggesting that the government seek to raise a loan for the project, and to engage the services of a \\"competent and responsible contracting firm\\" to undertake the works. At the behest of the council, Moorhouse travelled to Melbourne, Australia in January 1861. On his return in May, he brought with him news of success on both counts. Of the three contractors approached by Moorhouse to tender for the work, the two lowest priced were discounted, leaving the highest tender, that of Holmes & Richardson. George Holmes undertook by written agreement on 16 April 1861 to carry out the contract on offer on the proviso that \\"the description corresponded with the fact\\". He travelled to Canterbury with Moorhouse where he signed the contract. The cost of the tunnel works agreed to was ¬£188,727, or complete with portals, ¬£195,000. This compared with Smith & Knight's figures for the same work of ¬£183,051 and ¬£190,551 respectively. During the course of the contract, improvements to the Lyttelton portal were agreed at an additional cost of ¬£5,000. Work proceeded at both ends of the tunnel, with the rate of progress determined by the difficulty encountered in drilling through the rock. By the time work started on the Canterbury Southern Railway, 91.66 chains of the 130.66 chain total length had been bored. Hole-through was achieved on the morning of 28 May 1867 from the Lyttelton heading to the Heathcote side. Temporary rails had been laid through the tunnel by mid-November, enabling the passage of the first locomotive, No. 3, on the night of 18 November. The first goods train through the tunnel was headed by No. 3 and driven by Abraham Beverley a week later, to be followed by passenger services on 9 December. The tunnel was not considered complete until June 1874, by which time the government had outlaid a further ¬£20,710 on \\"maintenance\\". = Proposal = The Railways Department gave consideration to the idea of duplicating the tunnel in 1914, but the proposal did not proceed. = Operations = At the time the colonial government decided to implement a national railway gauge, they made exceptions for some existing railway systems that had already been laid using different gauges, generally on the proviso that any new track was to the national gauge. One such system was the railways of the Canterbury Province, which were brought under the jurisdiction of a special act of parliament, the Canterbury Gauge Act. This act made provision for the regauging of existing lines by laying a third rail between the two existing rails to allow for the use of narrow gauge rolling stock on the same track. Rather than incur the inconvenience of this approach, the provincial government decided to lay a new narrow gauge line beside the existing broad gauge line from Addington to Lyttelton. The narrow gauge line reached Christchurch on 7 March 1876 and Lyttelton 34 days later. The nuisance of smoke in the tunnel created by steam locomotives prompted attempts by the Railways Department to alleviate the problem. In August 1909, they had locomotive WF 433 converted to oil burning to reduce the amount of smoke produced. The locomotive was used for a trial period to haul 450 ton goods trains through the tunnel. Though the modification proved to be efficacious, the benefit did not outweigh the cost involved and the idea was abandoned. The second attempt was to electrify the line from Christchurch to Lyttelton. Following the successful electrification of the Otira Tunnel in 1923, and a report recommending electrification of the suburban networks of New Zealand's four main cities, it was decided to electrify the Christchurch ‚Äì Lyttelton route using the same system as had been used at Otira. Fortunately, because the tunnel had originally been built to accommodate the provincial railways' larger broad gauge rolling stock, the tunnel was already sufficiently large enough to accommodate the overhead catenary without modification. The first electric train ran from Christchurch to Lyttelton on 14 February 1929. Electrification lasted until 1970, by which time the EC class electric locomotives had reached the end of their working lives. With the decline in rail services after the opening of the Lyttelton road tunnel in 1964, and with dieselisation almost complete and only a few steam locomotives left in revenue service, the electrification system was scrapped in favour of diesel haulage.  Today  The tunnel is the exclusive domain of freight trains, with six scheduled daily return services from the port of Lyttelton through the tunnel, including coal trains from Hector and Ngakawau via the Seddonville Branch on the West Coast. The Heathcote end can be accessed by foot from Station Road, and a strong smell of smoke can be smelt which would make breathing difficult in the tunnel. Schedule times of trains going through the tunnel can be observed from the KiwiRail website. Additional shunts convey other traffic between the city and the port.

Initially a Saxon count, he became the ruler over large Imperial estates in the Eastern March and progenitor of the Saxon electors and kings. Life Conrad was the son of the Saxon count Thimo of Wettin and his wife Ida, a daughter of Count Otto of Nordheim. Both his father and maternal grandfather had been involved in the Saxon Rebellion against the Salian king Henry IV in 1073‚Äì75. Thimo was the first to call himself a Count of Wettin after the ancestral seat on the Saale river, while his elder brother Dedi ruled in the Saxon March of Lusatia (Eastern March). His son Henry the Elder also became the first Wettin margrave in Meissen in 1089. Upon the early death of his father, Conrad succeeded him as Count of Wettin and Brehna. When his cousin Henry the Elder died in 1103, he hoped to be enfeoffed with the Lusatian and Meissen marches by Emperor Henry IV. However, his expectations proved to be false, when Henry's widow Gertrude of Brunswick gave birth to a posthumous son, Henry II. Conrad, with bitterness, spread rumours that Gertrude in fact had given birth to a girl and had replaced her by a peasant's son. When Henry II attained his majority in 1121, he campaigned against his uncle and had him arrested. Conrad faced an end in prison, but avoided this fate when Henry II died in 1123 at the age of twenty, presumably poisoned. Now head of the Wettin dynasty, Conrad saw his aspirations fulfilled. He succeeded Henry II as Count of Eilenburg and also claimed Lusatia and Meissen. However, that same year, Emperor Henry V enfeoffed Count Wiprecht of Groitzsch with both marches. Furious Conrad forged an alliance with the Saxon duke Lothair of Supplinburg and with the support of several local nobles expelled Wiprecht. Duke Lothair ignored the Imperial bestowal and appointed Conrad Margrave of Meissen; he also named the Ascanian count Albert the Bear Margrave of Lusatia. As Wiprecht was unable to hold his own against his two opponents, Conrad was securely in power in Meissen by Wiprecht's death in May 1124. In 1136, upon the death Wiprecht's son Henry of Groitzsch, Lothair, then emperor (as Lothair II), appointed Conrad to Lusatia as well. He also ruled the Milceni lands around Bautzen (later known as Upper Lusatia), which had been re-acquired from Poland and remained a part of Meissen, while the March of Lusatia was reduced to Lower Lusatia alone. Obtaining the status of an Imperial Prince, Margrave Conrad had the Polabian territories colonised by Flemish settlers in the course of the Ostsiedlung migration and laid the foundations for the development of the Wettin dominions in Upper Saxony. In 1143, Conrad also became Count of Groitzsch and Rochlitz and Vogt (bailiff) in Chemnitz and Naumburg. He eased the tensions with the neighbouring Kingdom of Poland by marrying his son Theodoric to Dobroniega Ludgarda, a daughter of the Polish duke Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth. He also married his eldest son Otto II to Hedwig of Brandenburg, a daughter of Margrave Albert the Bear. In 1147, while the Hohenstaufen king Conrad III of Germany was on the Second Crusade, Conrad joined the Welf duke Henry the Lion, Albert the Bear, the Archbishops of Magdeburg and Bremen on the Wendish Crusade against the Slavic Obodrites and Wagri tribes. In August, Conrad, Albert, the bishops of Magdeburg, Havelburg, and Brandenburg deployed their forces at Magdeburg. The Dubin and Dimin fortresses of Obodrite prince Niklot were besieged. Both he and Pribislav, another Obodrite prince, were forced to adopt Christianity. In his later years, Conrad founded the Lauterberg monastery (later Petersberg Abbey) north of Halle, to which he retired after he had officially renounced all secular rights in favour of his son Otto II on 30 November 1156. There he died the following year and was buried next to his wife, Luitgard (Lucarda; d. 1146), daughter of the Swabian count Adalbert of Elchingen-Ravenstein and his wife Bertha of Boll, possibly a daughter of Duke Frederick of Swabia and the Salian princess Agnes of Waiblingen. Marriage and issue His wife Luitgard of Elchingen-Ravenstein (‚Äì1146), whom he had married before 1119, had blessed him with many children. His eldest surviving son, Otto II, succeeded him in Meissen in 1156, while his second surviving son, Theodoric, succeeded in Lusatia. His son Count Henry of Wettin married Sophia of Sommerschenburg, Countess Palatine of Saxony, daughter of Count Frederick VI, Count Palatine of Saxony of Sommerschenburg and Countess Liutgard of Stade, queen dowager of Denmark. His issue were: * Henry, died young * Otto II, Margrave of Meissen (‚Äì1190) * Theodoric I, Margrave of Lusatia (Dietrich; ‚Äì1185) * Dedi III, Margrave of Lusatia (Dedo V of Wettin; ‚Äì1190) * Henry I, Count of Wettin (d. 1181), married (1) Sophia of Sommerschenburg (d. 1189 or 1190), daughter of Count Frederick VI, Count Palatine of Saxony of Sommerschenburg, Count Palatine of Saxony and his wife Countess Liutgard of Stade (later queen of Denmark). * Frederick I of Brehna (‚Äì1182) * Gertrud (d. ), married Count Gunther II of Schwarzburg * Oda (d. ), Abbess of Gerbstedt * Adela of Meissen (d. 1181), married King Sweyn III of Denmark (d. 1157), secondly married to Count Adalbert of Ballenstedt (d. 1171) * Bertha, Abbess of Gerbstedt * Sophia (d. 1190), married Count Gebhard I of Burghausen * Agnes II, Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg (d. 1203) Ancestry References Bibliography *Thompson, James Westfall: Feudal Germany, Volume II.

Wollstonecraft wrote about her frequently in her later works. Fanny grew up in the household of anarchist political philosopher William Godwin, the widower of her mother, with his second wife and their combined family of five children. Fanny's half-sister Mary grew up to write Frankenstein and married Percy Bysshe Shelley, a leading Romantic poet, who composed a poem on Fanny's death. Although Gilbert Imlay and Mary Wollstonecraft lived together happily for brief periods before and after the birth of Fanny, he left Wollstonecraft in France in the midst of the Revolution. In an attempt to revive their relationship, Wollstonecraft travelled to Scandinavia on business for him, taking the one-year-old Fanny with her, but the affair never rekindled. After falling in love with and marrying Godwin, Wollstonecraft died soon after giving birth in 1797, leaving the three-year-old Fanny in the hands of Godwin, along with their newborn daughter Mary. Four years later, Godwin remarried and his new wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, brought two children of her own into the marriage, most significantly‚Äîfrom Fanny Imlay and Mary Godwin's perspective‚ÄîClaire Clairmont. Wollstonecraft's daughters resented the new Mrs Godwin and the attention she paid to her own daughter. The Godwin household became an increasingly uncomfortable place to live as tensions rose and debts mounted. The teenage Mary and Claire escaped by running off to the Continent with Shelley in 1814. Fanny, left behind, bore the brunt of her stepfather's anger. She became increasingly isolated from her family and committed suicide in 1816. Life =Birth= Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797)Todd, Death and the Maidens, 39. Fanny Imlay was the daughter of the British feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft and the American entrepreneur Gilbert Imlay. Both had moved to France during the French Revolution, Wollstonecraft to practise the principles laid out in her seminal work A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) and Imlay to engage in speculative business ventures. The two met and fell in love. At one point during Wollstonecraft and Imlay's relationship, the couple could meet only at a tollbooth between Paris and Neuilly, and it was there that their daughter was conceived; Fanny was therefore, in Godwin's words, a \\"barrier child\\".St Clair, 182; Todd, Death and the Maidens, 54. Todd identifies the place as a \\"tollbooth\\" and St Clair, paraphrasing Godwin's 1798 edition of Wollstonecraft's and Imlay's letters, identifies it as a \\"toll gate barrier\\". In modern French, at least, poste de p√©age can mean both \\"tollbooth\\" and \\"tollhouse\\". According to St Clair, \\"the lovers had arranged uncomfortable assignations there during the time when Imlay was forbidden to leave the city limits\\" (182). Which of the many places named Neuilly is unclear. Neuilly-sur- Seine was known as \\"Neuilly\\" until 1897, when the name was changed, and is the most likely candidate. Frances \\"Fanny\\" Imlay, Wollstonecraft's first child, was born in Le Havre on 14 May 1794, or, as the birth certificate stated, on the 25th day of Floreal in the Second Year of the Republic,Tomalin, 218‚Äì19; Holmes, Footsteps, 118. and named after Fanny Blood, her mother's closest friend.Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 258. Although Imlay never married Wollstonecraft, he registered her as his wife at the American consulate to protect her once Britain and France went to war in February 1793. Most people, including Wollstonecraft's sisters, assumed they were married‚Äîand thus, by extension, that Fanny was legitimate‚Äîand she was registered as such in France.Tomalin, 218‚Äì19; Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 267. =Infancy and early childhood= Initially, the couple's life together was idyllic. Wollstonecraft playfully wrote to one friend: \\"My little Girl begins to suck so manfully that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the R[igh]ts of Woman\\" [emphasis in original].Qtd. in Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 258; see also, Tomalin, 219; Todd, Death and the Maidens, 22. Imlay soon tired of Wollstonecraft and domestic life and left her for long periods of time. Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations, explained by most critics as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman but by some as a result of her circumstances‚Äîalone with an infant in the middle of the French Revolution.Tomalin, 220‚Äì21; Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 258; Todd, Death and the Maidens, 22. Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795, seeking Imlay, but he rejected her; the next month she attempted to commit suicide, but he saved her life (it is unclear how).Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 286‚Äì87. In a last attempt to win him back, she embarked upon a hazardous trip to Scandinavia from June to September 1795, with only her one-year-old daughter and a maid, in order to conduct some business for him. Wollstonecraft's journey was daunting not only because she was travelling to what some considered a nearly uncivilized region during a time of war, but also because she was travelling without a male escort. When she returned to England and realized that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide a second time. She went out on a rainy night, walked around to soak her clothes, and then jumped into the River Thames, where a stranger rescued her.Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 355‚Äì56; Tomalin, 232‚Äì36; Todd, Death and the Maidens, 22‚Äì24; Seymour, 15‚Äì16. Before one of her suicide attempts, Wollstonecraft wrote at the top of the first page of Lessons: \\"The first book of a series which I intended to have written for my unfortunate girl.\\"William Godwin, the editor, speculates that Wollstonecraft wrote this note in October 1795. Using her diaries and letters from her journey to Scandinavia, Wollstonecraft wrote a rumination on her travels and her relationship‚ÄîLetters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796)‚Äîin which, among other things, she celebrated motherhood.Tomalin, 225‚Äì31; Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 311ff; Todd, Death and the Maidens, 22‚Äì23. Her maternal connection to her daughter prompted her to reflect on a woman's place in the world: > You know that as a female I am particularly attached to her‚ÄîI feel more than > a mother's fondness and anxiety, when I reflect on the dependent and > oppressed state of her sex. I dread lest she should be forced to sacrifice > her heart to her principles, or principles to her heart. With trembling hand > I shall cultivate sensibility, and cherish delicacy of sentiment, lest, > whilst I lend fresh blushes to the rose, I sharpen the thorns that will > wound the breast I would fain guard‚ÄîI dread to unfold her mind, lest it > should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit‚ÄîHapless woman! what > a fate is thine!Qtd. in Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 326‚Äì27. Wollstonecraft lavished love and attention on her daughter. She began two books, drawn from her own experience, related to Fanny's care: a parenting manual entitled Letters on the Management of Infants and a reading primer entitled Lessons.Tomalin, 249; Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 259‚Äì60; Seymour, 26. In one section of Lessons, she describes weaning: > When you were hungry, you began to cry, because you could not speak. You > were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you > began to gnaw a crust of bread. It was not long before another came pop. At > ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor > mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very > much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not > naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must > look for some other milk.Qtd. in Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 260. In 1797, Wollstonecraft fell in love with and married the philosopher William Godwin (she had become pregnant with his child). Godwin grew to love Fanny during his affair with Wollstonecraft; he brought her back a mug from Josiah Wedgwood's pottery factory with an \\"F\\" on it that delighted both mother and daughter.Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 439‚Äì42; Todd, Death and the Maidens, 30; Locke, 130; Seymour, 18. Wollstonecraft died in September of the same year, from complications giving birth to Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, who survived.Tomalin, 271ff; Todd, Mary Wollstonecraft, 448ff; Todd, Death and the Maidens, 30. Three-year-old Fanny, who had been scarred from smallpox,Todd, Death and the Maidens, 22, 47. was unofficially adopted by her stepfather and given the name of Godwin. Her copy of Wollstonecraft's only completed children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), has the initials \\"F. G.\\" written in large print in it.Tomalin, 286. According to the dominant interpretation of Godwin's diary, it was not until Fanny turned twelve that she was informed in an important conversation with Godwin that he was not her natural father.St Clair, 180; Tomalin, 286‚Äì87; Seymour, 82‚Äì83. In the only biography of Fanny, Janet Todd disputes this reading, arguing instead that the conversation was about Fanny's future. She finds it unlikely that Fanny would have been unaware of her origins in the open and liberal Godwin household.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 54‚Äì55. After Wollstonecraft's death, Godwin and Joseph Johnson, Wollstonecraft's publisher and close friend, contacted Fanny's father, but he was uninterested in raising his child. (Neither Wollstonecraft nor her daughter ever saw Gilbert Imlay after 1796.)St Clair, 296; Tomalin, 287; Todd, Death and the Maidens, 31‚Äì32. Wollstonecraft's two sisters, Eliza Bishop and Everina Wollstonecraft, Fanny's only two living female relatives, were anxious to care for her; Godwin, disliking them, turned down their offer.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 35‚Äì36; Seymour, 38, 40‚Äì41; see also Locke, 218. Several times throughout Fanny's childhood Wollstonecraft's sisters asked Godwin to allow them to raise their niece and each time he refused.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 52ff. Godwin himself did not seem particularly ready for parenthood and he now had two small children to raise and no steady source of income. However, he was determined to care for them.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 36. During these early years of Fanny's life, Joseph Johnson served as an \\"unofficial trustee\\" for her as he had occasionally for her mother. He even willed her ¬£200, but Godwin owed Johnson so much money upon his death in 1809 that Johnson's heirs demanded Godwin pay the money back as part of his arrears.St Clair, 305; Todd, Death and the Maidens, 67. =Childhood= Although Godwin was fond of his children, he was, in many ways, ill-equipped to care for them. As Todd explains, he was constantly annoyed by their noise, demanding silence while he worked.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 46‚Äì47. However, when he took a trip to Dublin to visit Wollstonecraft's sisters, he missed the girls immensely and wrote to them frequently.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 48‚Äì49; Seymour, 41‚Äì42. William Godwin, Fanny Imlay's stepfather (James Northcote, oil on canvas, 1802, the National Portrait Gallery) On 21 December 1801, when Fanny was seven, Godwin married Mary Jane Clairmont, a neighbour with two children of her own: three-year-old Claire and six-year-old Charles. She had never been married and was looking, like Godwin, for financial stability.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 56‚Äì58; Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit, 170; St Clair, 241. Although Clairmont was well- educated and well-travelled, most of Godwin's friends despised her, finding her vulgar and dishonest. They were astonished that Godwin could replace Mary Wollstonecraft with her.St. Clair, 242; St Clair notes that \\"it is easy to forget in reading of these crises [in the lives of the Godwins and the Shelleys] how unrepresentative the references in surviving documents may be. It is easy for the biographer to give undue weight to the opinions of the people who happen to have written things down.\\" (246) Fanny and her half- sister Mary disliked their stepmother and complained that she preferred her own children to them.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 56‚Äì57. On 28 March 1803, baby William was born to the couple.St Clair, 242. Although Godwin admired Wollstonecraft's writings, he did not agree with her that women should receive the same education as men. Therefore, he occasionally read to Fanny and Mary from Sarah Trimmer's Fabulous Histories (1786) and Anna Laetitia Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778‚Äì79), but, according to Todd, he did not take great pains with their educations and disregarded the books Wollstonecraft had written for Fanny.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 45‚Äì46, 63. William St Clair, in his biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys, argues that Godwin and Wollstonecraft spoke extensively about the education they wanted for their children and that Godwin's writings in The Enquirer reflect these discussions. He contends that after Wollstonecraft's death Godwin wrote to a former pupil to whom she had been close, now Lady Mountcashell, asking her advice on how to raise and educate his daughters.St Clair, 280‚Äì81. In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour agrees with St Clair, arguing that \\"everything we know about his daughter's [Mary's and presumably Fanny's] early years suggests that she was being taught in a way of which her mother would have approved\\", pointing out that she had a governess, a tutor, a French-speaking stepmother, and a father who wrote children's books whose drafts he read to his own first.Seymour, 53. It was the new Mrs Godwin who was primarily responsible for the education given to the girls, but she taught her own daughter more, including French.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 63. Fanny received no formal education after her stepfather's marriage. Yet, the adult Imlay is described by C. Kegan Paul, one of Godwin's earliest biographers, as \\"well educated, sprightly, clever, a good letter-writer, and an excellent domestic manager\\".Paul, C. Kegan. William Godwin. Retrieved 1 June 2007; see also St Clair, 399. Fanny excelled in drawing and was taught music.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 63‚Äì64. Despite Godwin's atheism, all of the children were taken to an Anglican church.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 64. The Polygon (at left) in Somers Town, London, between Camden Town and St Pancras, where Fanny spent her childhood years The Godwins were constantly in debt, so Godwin returned to writing to support the family. He and his wife started a Juvenile Library for which he wrote children's books. In 1807, when Fanny was 13, they moved from the Polygon, where Godwin had lived with Wollstonecraft, to 41 Skinner Street, near Clerkenwell, in the city's bookselling district. This took the family away from the fresh country air and into the dirty, smelly, inner streets of London.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 61; St Clair, 284‚Äì86, 290‚Äì96. Although initially successful, the business gradually failed. The Godwins also continued to borrow more money than they could afford from generous friends such as publisher Joseph Johnson and Godwin devotee Francis Place.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 61‚Äì62, 66‚Äì68. As Fanny Imlay grew up, her father increasingly relied on her to placate tradespeople who demanded bills be paid and to solicit money from men such as Place. According to Todd and Seymour, Imlay believed in Godwin's theory that great thinkers and artists should be supported by patrons and she believed Godwin to be both a great novelist and a great philosopher. Throughout her life, she wrote letters asking Place and others for money to support Godwin's \\"genius\\" and she helped run the household so that he could work.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 76‚Äì79; Seymour, 168‚Äì69. =Teenage years= Godwin, never one to mince words, wrote about the differences he perceived between his two daughters: > My own daughter [Mary] is considerably superior in capacity to the one her > mother had before. Fanny, the eldest, is of a quiet, modest, unshowy > disposition, somewhat given to indolence, which is her greatest fault, but > sober, observing, peculiarly clear and distinct in the faculty of memory, > and disposed to exercise her own thoughts and follow her own judgment. Mary, > my daughter, is the reverse of her in many particulars. She is singularly > bold, somewhat imperious, and active of mind. Her desire for knowledge is > great, and her perseverance in everything she undertakes is almost > invincible. My own daughter is, I believe, very pretty; Fanny is by no means > handsome, but in general prepossessing.Qtd. in Locke, 219. The intellectual world of the girls was widened by their exposure to the literary and political circles in which Godwin moved. For example, during former American vice-president Aaron Burr's self-imposed exile from the United States after his acquittal on treason charges, he often spent time with the Godwins. He greatly admired the works of Wollstonecraft and had educated his daughter according to the precepts of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. He was anxious to meet the daughters of the woman he revered and referred to Fanny, Mary, and Claire as \\"goddesses\\". He spent most of his time talking with Imlay about political and educational topics.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 77ff. Burr was impressed by the Lancastrian teaching method and took Fanny to see a model school in 1811.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 74‚Äì75. Percy, Mary, and Claire Radical Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was probably loved by all three Godwin sisters (Amelia Curran, 1819).Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit, 312. It was not Burr, but the Romantic poet and writer Percy Bysshe Shelley who had the greatest impact on Imlay and her sisters' lives. Impressed by Godwin's Political Justice, Shelley wrote to him and the two started corresponding. In 1812, Shelley asked if Imlay, then 18 and the daughter of one of his heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, could come live with him, his new wife, and her sister. Having never actually met Shelley and being sceptical of his motivations (Shelley had eloped to marry his wife, Harriet), Godwin refused.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 91‚Äì92; Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit, 147; Locke, 248; Seymour, 67ff; St Clair, 330. When Shelley finally came to visit the Godwins, all three girls were enamoured of him, particularly Imlay.Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit, 169‚Äì70; Locke, 248‚Äì49. Both Shelley and Imlay were interested in discussing radical politics; for example, Shelley liked to act as if class were irrelevant, but she argued that it was significant in daily affairs.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 97‚Äì99; see also Seymour, 68‚Äì69. In 1814, Shelley spent a considerable amount of time at the Godwins' and he and Imlay may have fallen in love. Later, Claire Clairmont claimed that they had been.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 111‚Äì12, 118‚Äì19. Imlay was sent to Wales in May of that year; Todd speculates that Godwin was trying to separate her from Shelley while Seymour hints that Mrs Godwin was trying to improve her despondent mood.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 125‚Äì28; Seymour, 89. Meanwhile, the Godwin household became even more uncomfortable as Godwin sank further into debt and as relations between Mary and her stepmother became increasingly hostile.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 120‚Äì21. Mary Godwin consoled herself with Shelley and the two started a passionate love affair. When Shelley declared to Godwin that the two were in love, Godwin exploded in anger. However, he needed the money that Shelley, as an aristocrat, could and was willing to provide. Frustrated with the entire situation, Mary Godwin, Shelley, and Claire Clairmont ran off to Europe together on 28 June 1814.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 129‚Äì36; Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit, 231‚Äì34; Locke, 251‚Äì54; Seymour, 99. Godwin hurriedly summoned Imlay home from Wales to help him handle the situation. Her stepmother wrote that Imlay's \\"emotion was deep when she heard of the sad fate of the two girls; she cannot get over it\\".Qtd. in Todd, Death and the Maidens, 138; see also Seymour, 99. In the middle of this disaster, one of Godwin's prot√©g√©s killed himself, and young William Godwin ran away from home and was missing for two days. When news of the girls' escapade became public, Godwin was pilloried in the press. Life in the Godwin household became increasingly strained.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 139; Seymour, 99‚Äì100; St Clair, 362‚Äì63. Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Fanny's half-sister and the (eventual) wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley (Reginald Easton, c. 1857) When Mary Godwin, Claire Clairmont, and Shelley returned from the Continent in September 1814, they took a house together in London, enraging Godwin still further. Imlay felt pulled between the two households: she felt loyal both to her sisters and to her father. Both despised her decision not to choose a side in the family drama. As Seymour explains, Imlay was in a difficult position: the Godwin household felt Shelley was a dangerous influence and the Shelley household ridiculed her fear of violating social conventions. Also, her aunts were considering her for a teaching position at this time, but were reluctant because of Godwin's shocking Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798). Seymour writes, the \\"few timid visits Fanny made to see Mary and [Claire] in London were acts of great courage; she got little thanks for them\\".Seymour, 115; see also Todd, Death and the Maidens, 146; Seymour, 121; Locke, 270‚Äì71. Although instructed by Godwin not to speak to Shelley and her sisters, Imlay warned them of creditors who knew of Shelley's return (he also was in debt).Todd, Death and the Maidens, 147‚Äì50; Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit, 265. Her attempts to persuade Clairmont to return to the Godwins' convinced Shelley that she was of Godwin's party and he began to distrust her.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 151‚Äì53; see also Gittings and Manton, 18‚Äì25; Locke, 256‚Äì68; St Clair, 372‚Äì73. Imlay was also still responsible for soliciting money from Shelley in order to repay her father's debts; despite Shelley's essential elopement with two of his daughters, Godwin agreed to accept ¬£1,200 from Shelley.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 152‚Äì53; see also Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit, 311-13. Shelley's financial situation was complex. As an aristocrat, he could borrow money against his inheritance through what were referred to as \\"post-obits\\"; they came at a costly interest rate. Shelley borrowed much money this way for himself and Godwin after his father refused to grant him any more funds. Thus, he was consistently in debt, though his creditors assumed that he would one day be able to pay or that he could somehow raise the money to pay off his debts. When Mary Godwin gave birth to a daughter in February 1815, she immediately sent for Imlay, particularly as both she and the infant were ill. Godwin chastised Imlay for disobeying his orders not to see her half-sister and her misery increased. After the death of the child, Imlay paid more frequent visits to the couple.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 160‚Äì62; see also Seymour, 121, 128‚Äì29. Soon after, Clairmont became a lover of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, and Mary Godwin and Shelley had a second child on 24 January 1816, who was named William after Godwin.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 176; Seymour, 143. In February, Imlay went to visit the Shelleys, who had settled in Bishopsgate.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 181. Godwin's debts continued to mount, and while he demanded money from Shelley, Godwin still refused to see either him or his daughter.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 182. At this time, Charles Clairmont (Imlay's step-brother), frustrated with the tension in the Godwin household, left for France and refused to help the family any further. At around the same time, Claire Clairmont, Mary Godwin, and Shelley left for the Continent, seeking Byron. Godwin was aghast. He relied on Shelley's money, and the stain on his family's reputation only increased when the public learned that the group had left to join the rakish Byron.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 185‚Äì86. Amidst all of this family turmoil, Imlay still found time to ponder larger social issues. The utopian socialist Robert Owen came to visit Godwin in the summer of 1816 and he and Imlay discussed the plight of the working poor in Britain. She agreed with many of Owen's proposals, but not all of them. She decided, in the end, that his utopian scheme was too \\"romantic\\", because it depended heavily on the goodwill of the rich to sacrifice their wealth.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 190; Locke, 271. That same summer, George Blood‚Äîthe brother of Fanny Imlay's namesake‚Äîcame to meet her for the first time and told her stories of her mother. After this meeting she wrote to Mary Godwin and Shelley: \\"I have determined never to live to be a disgrace to such a mother... I have found that if I will endeavour to overcome my faults I shall find being's to love and esteem me\\" [emphasis in original].Qtd. in Todd, Death and the Maidens, 203; see also Locke, 271. Claire Clairmont, Imlay's sister by adoption and a mistress of Lord Byron (Amelia Curran, 1819) Before Mary Godwin, Clairmont, and Shelley had left for the Continent, Imlay and Mary had had a major argument and no chance to come to a reconciliation. Imlay attempted in her letters to Mary to smooth over the relationship, but her sense of loneliness and isolation in London was palpable. She wrote to Mary of \\"the dreadful state of mind I generally labour under & which I in vain endeavour to get rid of\\".Qtd. in Todd, Death and the Maidens, 206; see also 208‚Äì09; Seymour, 152. Many scholars attribute Imlay's increasing unhappiness to Mrs Godwin's hostility towards her. Kegan, and others, contend that Imlay was subject to the same \\"extreme depression to which her mother had been subject, and which marked other members of the Wollstonecraft family\\". Wandering amongst the mountains of Switzerland, frustrated with her relationship with Shelley, and engrossed by the writing of Frankenstein, her sister was unsympathetic.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 206‚Äì07. The group returned from the Continent, with a pregnant Clairmont, and settled in Bath (to protect her reputation, they attempted to hide the pregnancy). Imlay saw Shelley twice in September 1816; according to Todd's interpretation of Fanny's letters, Fanny had earlier tried to solicit an invitation to join the group in Europe and she repeated these appeals when she saw Shelley in London.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 207‚Äì08, 213‚Äì14. Todd believes that Imlay begged to be allowed to stay with them because life in Godwin's house was unbearable, with the constant financial worries and Mrs Godwin's insistent haranguing, and that Shelley refused, concerned with anyone learning about Clairmont's condition, most of all someone he believed might inform Godwin (Shelley was being sued by his wife and was worried about his own reputation). After Shelley left, Todd explains that Imlay wrote to Mary \\"to make clear again her longing to be rescued\\".Todd, Death and the Maidens, 215; see also Todd, Death and the Maidens, 215‚Äì24; Locke, 271‚Äì72. Death =Theories= In early October 1816, Imlay left Godwin's house in London and committed suicide on 9 October by taking an overdose of laudanum at an inn in Swansea, Wales; she was 22. The details surrounding her death and her motivations are disputed. Most of the letters regarding the incident were destroyed or are missing.Pollin, 265‚Äì66; Seymour, 169‚Äì70. In his 1965 article \\"Fanny Godwin's Suicide Re-examined\\", B. R. Pollin lays out the major theories that had been put forward regarding her suicide and which continue to be used today: * Imlay had just learned of her illegitimate birth. * Mrs Godwin became more cruel to Imlay after Mary Godwin and Claire Clairmont ran off with Percy Shelley. * Imlay had been refused a position at her aunts' school in Ireland. * Imlay was depressive, and her condition was aggravated by the state of the Godwin household. * Imlay was in love with Percy Shelley and distraught that Mary and he had fallen in love.Pollin, 258. Pollin dismisses the first of these, as have most later biographers, arguing that Imlay had access to her mother's writings and Godwin's Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman which openly discuss the circumstances of her birth. Imlay herself even makes this distinction in letters to her half-sister Mary Godwin.Pollin, 259‚Äì61. Pollin is also sceptical of the second explanation, pointing to Imlay's letter to Mary of 3 October 1816 in which she defended her step-mother: \\"Mrs. Godwin would never do either of you a deliberate injury. Mamma and I are not great friends, but always alive to her virtues, I am anxious to defend her from a charge so foreign to her character.\\"Qtd. in Pollin, 261. Pollin finds no evidence that Imlay had been refused a position at her aunts' school, only that such a scheme may have been \\"in contemplation\\", as Godwin later wrote, although Seymour grants this explanation some plausibility.Pollin, 262; Seymour, 168. St Clair claims that Imlay was on her way to join her maternal aunts in Ireland when she decided to commit suicide. He believes that it was to be a probationary visit, to see if she could be a teacher in their school.St Clair, 398‚Äì408. Godwin's modern biographer, Richard Holmes, dismisses this story.Locke, 274. In his survey of the letters of the Godwins and the Shelleys, Pollin comes to the conclusion that Imlay was not depressive. She is frequently described as happy and looking toward the future and describes herself this way. The mentions of melancholia and sadness are specific and related to particular events and illness.Pollin, 263‚Äì64. Richard Holmes, in his biography of Percy Shelley, argues that \\"her agonizing and loveless suspension between the Godwin and Shelley households was clearly the root circumstance\\" of her suicide.Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit, 347. Godwin biographer and philosopher Don Locke argues that \\"most probably because she could absorb no more of the miseries of Skinner Street, her father's inability to pay his debts or write his books, her mother's unending irritability and spitefulness\\", all of which she blamed on herself, she committed suicide. Pollin largely agrees with Todd, speculating that Imlay saw Percy Shelley in Bath and he \\"somehow failed her\\", causing her to commit suicide.Pollin, 268. Seymour and others speculate that Shelley's only failure was to live up to his financial promises to Godwin and it was this that helped push Imlay over the edge; she was convinced, like her father, \\"that the worthy have an absolute right to be supported by those who have the worth to give\\".Seymour, 169. Todd, on the other hand, agrees with Pollin and speculates that Imlay went to see Mary Godwin and Shelley. Todd argues that Imlay had affection for Shelley and felt that his home was her only haven.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 223‚Äì25; see also Locke, 272 where he writes that she might have seen Percy Shelley at this time. Relying on scraps of poetry that Shelley may have written after Imlay's death, Todd concludes that Shelley saw her in Bath and rejected her pleas because he needed to protect Claire's reputation as well as his own at this time.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 225‚Äì26. Todd also notes that Imlay had worn her mother's stays, which were embroidered with the initials \\"M.W.\\", and the nicest clothes she owned. She had adorned herself with a Swiss gold watch sent to her from Geneva by the Shelleys and a necklace, in order to make a good impression.Todd, 224‚Äì25; see also Seymour, 160. After Shelley rejected her, Todd concludes, Imlay decided to commit suicide. =Suicide and aftermath= On the night of 9 October, Imlay checked into the Mackworth Arms Inn in Swansea and instructed the chambermaid not to disturb her. The same night Mary Godwin, staying in Bath with Shelley, received a letter Imlay had mailed earlier from Bristol. Her father in London also received a letter. The alarming nature of the letters prompted both Godwin and Shelley to set out for Bristol at once (although they travelled separately). By the time they tracked her to Swansea on 11 October, they were too late. Imlay was found dead in her room on 10 October, having taken a fatal dose of laudanum, and it was only Shelley who stayed to deal with the situation. Imlay left behind an unaddressed note, describing herself as \\"unfortunate\\", perhaps referring to Mary Wollstonecraft's description of her as \\"my unfortunate girl\\" in the note she wrote on \\"Lessons\\" before she herself attempted suicide:Pollin, 260. > I have long determined that the best thing I could do was to put an end to > the existence of a being whose birth was unfortunate, and whose life has > only been a series of pain to those persons who have hurt their health in > endeavouring to promote her welfare. Perhaps to hear of my death will give > you pain, but you will soon have the blessing of forgetting that such a > creature ever existed asQtd. in St Clair, 411. The note appears to have originally been signed, but the name was torn off or burned off so that her body could not be identified.St Clair, 411‚Äì12; Todd, Death and the Maidens, 3‚Äì4; Seymour, 169‚Äì71; Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit, 347‚Äì48; Locke, 272‚Äì74. When the announcement was printed in the local newspaper, The Cambrian, therefore, it did not refer to Imlay specifically.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 233; Gittings and Manton, 36. At the inquest, Imlay was declared \\"dead\\", rather than a suicide or an insanity victim, which saved her body from various indignities.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 236‚Äì37. Todd speculates that Shelley arranged for Imlay to be declared \\"dead\\" (an appellation more common for the well-to-do) and removed any identifying items, such as her name on the note. She also concludes that to protect the rest of the family, he refused to claim her body. No one else claimed Imlay's body and it was probably buried in a pauper's grave.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 3; Seymour, 171. In fact, Godwin wrote to Percy Shelley: > Do nothing to destroy the obscurity she so much desired, that now rests upon > the event. It was, as I said, her last wish ... Think what is the situation > of my wife & myself, now deprived of all our children but the youngest > [William]; & do not expose us to those idle questions, which to a mind in > anguish is one of the severest trials. We are at this moment in doubt > whether during the first shock we shall not say she is gone to Ireland to > her aunts, a thing that had been in contemplation ... What I have most of > all in horror is the public papers; & I thank you for your caution as it > might act on this.Qtd. in Todd, Death and the Maidens, 239; according to > Seymour this letter was written to Mary Shelley, not Percy Shelley, 171. Because suicide was considered scandalous, disreputable, and sinful at the time, which might have damaged Godwin's business, the family told various stories regarding Imlay's death in order to cover up the truth, including that she had gone on vacation, that she had died of a cold in Wales, that she had died of an \\"inflammatory fever\\", that she was living with her mother's sisters, or, if forced to admit suicide, that Imlay killed herself because Shelley loved Mary Godwin and not her.Todd, Death and the Maidens, 242‚Äì43; Gittings and Manton, 36; Seymour, 171. Neither Percy nor Mary mention Imlay's death in their surviving letters from this time. Claire Clairmont claimed in a letter to Byron that Percy became ill because of her death, but as Holmes notes, there is no other evidence for this assertion.Holmes, Shelley: The Pursuit, 347‚Äì48. Yet Locke writes that Shelley told Byron he felt \\"a far severer anguish\\" over Imlay's suicide than over Harriet's (his wife's) suicide just two months later.Locke, 274‚Äì75; see also Pollin, 267. While there is no known image of Imlay, a few months after her death, Shelley penned the poem quoted at the beginning of this article. As Seymour writes, \\"[p]ublished by Mary without comment, it has always been supposed to allude to his last meeting with her half-sister.\\"Seymour, 170.

His exile from power was a fallout of a regional crisis between two Action Group leaders: Awolowo and Samuel Ladoke Akintola. The Action Group which was launched in his palace a decade earlier, was led by Awolowo in the 1950s. A battle of wills between the two gladiators in the early 1960s saw Oba Olateru pitching his tent with Akintola. However, his choice only fomented tension in his community. A military coup in 1966 created an avenue for some citizens of Owo to unleash violence and revolt against Olagbegi. He was banished from power in 1966 by the military administrator of the Western Region and re-instated 25 years later. In 1993, he was re- appointed to his former title of Olowo after the death of the reigning monarch.Bamidele Johnson, \\"Exit Of A Two-Time Monarch,\\" Tempo.

Politicization of traditional authority  When elective politics began in the Western region in 1951, Olagbegi was one of the prominent traditional rulers who supported the Action Group and who was involved in the politics of that era. The Action Group's public launch was at his palace in 1951. In 1962, two factions emerged within the party, the Akintola Group led by the regional premier, Ladoke Akintola and the Awolowo group led by the previous premier, Obafemi Awolowo. Olagbegi sided with the Akintola group pitching him against his friend Michael Ajasin, a member of the House of Representatives and majority of the community members who were still behind AG. In his push to solidify support for Akintola in Owo, he was met with opposition from Awolowo supporters and from the majority of Owo residents. Many Owo residents did not support his opposition and displacement of the co- regent at Ijebu-Owo and the use of police force at the nearby village of Isho. When a military coup cut short the First Republic, public revolt by Awolowo supporters and Owo community led to open display of violence within Owo forcing the Military Governor, Adekunle Fajuyi to suspend the Olowo. Olowo thenwent to exile in Ibadan. In 1968, he returned to Owo but strong opposition to his rule forced him back into exile. He was finally removed from office by governor, Adeyinka Adebayo in 1969.

Early life Taylor was born on 11 January 1853 at Richmond barracks, Melbourne, the eldest child of Robert Crofton Taylor, a policeman, and his wife Mary Jane, n√©e D'Esterre. In 1870 he commenced work with the Melbourne Savings Bank (later the State Savings Bank of Victoria and now part of the Commonwealth Bank). Politics A free trader, Taylor became a member of the Victorian branch of the Imperial Federation League in 1885. He was instrumental in ensuring the Victorian Branch survived the collapse of the parent group in London in 1893. The league promoted closer union within the British Empire and advocated the establishment of an Imperial parliament to be composed of representatives of Britain and the self-governing members of the Empire. Taylor was honorary secretary of the Victorian branch from 1895 to 1907. Taylor was a supporter of the federation of the Australian colonies as a first step in the greater federation. He joined the Melbourne branch of the Australian Natives' Association, hoping to gain members. He clashed with republicans over his I.F.L. prize-winning essay, The Advantages of Imperial Federation (Melbourne, 1888). His address, \\"Three Great Federations: Australasian, National and Racial\\" (London, 1890), delivered to the A.N.A. at Ballarat, met with approval insofar as he urged Australian Federation; but his advocacy of Imperial Federation and, ultimately, a federation of the British races aroused heated opposition. Although Taylor held that trade, defence and financial advantage would flow from Imperial Federation, others feared that in such an organization Australia's voice would be submerged. The conservative Melbourne Argus supported Taylor; the radical Age opposed him. Taylor was an I.F.L. delegate to the 1893 Corowa conference of the A.N.A. He was once described as an \\"Australian imbecile\\" but was a gifted debater and art critic. A pamphleteer for the I.F.L., he also wrote for other periodicals. Banking A mathematician, Taylor had been inspector of branches, accountant, assistant auditor and manager of city branches of the Melbourne Savings Bank until ill- health forced him to retire in March 1908. He was a foundation member (1886‚Äì1906) of the Bankers' Institute of Australasia and contributed articles to its journal. Taylor never married. He died of cerebral sclerosis on 28 April 1909 at East Melbourne and is buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery.

The vehicle was designed to take part in the US Military's Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle program, led by the US Marine Corps, as well as a similar US Army-led Medium Mine Protected Vehicle program. MRAPs are categorized as category 1 or category 2, depending on usage and passenger compartment space, and Navistar produces the MaxxPro in both sizes, although the vast majority of those sold have been category 1 MRAPs. The MaxxPro Plus model comes with dual rear wheels for increased load carrying capacity, such as an ambulance or EFP protected variant. The latest model produced is the MaxxPro Dash, which is a smaller and lighter category 1 model. Both the Plus and Dash models use the MaxxForce 10 engine with 375 hp, in place of the DT 530 with 330 hp, used in the original base model produced. Design The M1224 MaxxPro base model utilizes a crew capsule with a V-shaped hull, mounted on an International 7000 chassis. The V-hull deflects the blast of a land mine or improvised explosive device (IED) away from the vehicle to protect its occupants. Because the chassis is mounted outside the armored crew capsule, there are concerns that it will likely be destroyed in the event of an ambush, leaving the soldiers inside stranded. However, according to Navistar Defense spokesperson Roy Wiley, the MaxxPro \\"did extremely well during the tests, and we are extremely pleased.\\" This design may prove as effective as the Krauss-Maffei Wegmann ATF Dingo that uses a similar design, one which mounts an armored capsule to a Unimog chassis. This design has survived a 7 kg (15 lb) land mine blast with no injuries.Krauss-Maffei Wegmann ‚Äì Ihr Partner rund um Wehrtechnik According to Navistar Defense, the vehicle is designed with operational readiness in mind and utilizes standardized, easily available parts, to ensure rapid repair and maintenance.International : News Detail The armored body is bolted together instead of welded, as in other MRAPs. This facilitates repair in the field and is a contributing factor to Navistar's greater production capacity for the MaxxPro. In 2010, the Army initiated a development effort to add electronic stability control (ESC), a computerized technology designed to improve vehicle stability, to the MaxxPro. The MaxxPro's high ground clearance provides greater protection from underbody blasts, but also raises its center of gravity, causing rollovers in certain situations. The ESC combines road factors, vehicle data, and driver intent to automatically correct driving to ensure stability during maneuvers. Installation on MaxxPros began in late 2014 and is to be completed by late 2017, with other MRAPs planned to have ESC integrated onto them.U.S. Army Outfits First Vehicles with Electronic Stability Control ESC ‚Äì Armyrecognition.com, 26 May 2015 Production Initially just two vehicles were delivered for testing at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in March 2007.

A further order for 16 Category 2 versions (dubbed MaxxPro XL) was placed on June 19, 2007 for delivery by September 2007. An additional 755 Category 1 MaxxPros were ordered on July 20, 2007, also for delivery by February 2008, and a third order for a further 1,000 vehicles was announced on October 18, 2007. In the final order of 2007 a further 1,500 Category 1 MaxxPros were ordered bringing the total to 4,471. Of total MRAP orders to the end of 2007, 45% are MaxxPros (66% of Category 1 MRAPs). In the first order of 2008, 743 Category I MaxxPros were ordered. The MaxxPro was by now the only Category I MRAP still receiving fresh orders.

However such Macedonian activists,Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900-1996; Peter Lang, 2010; , p. 88. who came from the IMAROThe first name of the IMARO was \\"Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees\\", which was later changed several times. Initially its membership was restricted only for Bulgarians. It was active not only in Macedonia but also in Thrace (the Vilayet of Adrianople). Since its early name emphasized the Bulgarian nature of the organization by linking the inhabitants of Thrace and Macedonia to Bulgaria, these facts are still difficult to be explained from the Macedonian historiography. They suggest that IMRO revolutionaries in the Ottoman period did not differentiate between 'Macedonians' and 'Bulgarians'. Moreover, as their own writings attest, they often saw themselves and their compatriots as 'Bulgarians' and wrote in Bulgarian standard language.

The Yugoslav Communist Party (YCP) is accused of interfering in Macedonia's domestic policy and ASNOM's activities, and of displaying extreme Serbian nationalism. They wrote that the goal pursued with the creation of the Macedonian alphabet is to Serbianize the Bulgarians in Macedonia. According to them, the Macedonian Communist Party acts entirely in the interest of the YCP and bans all Bulgarian books and newspapers, but makes an exception for Serbian ones. Bulgarian songs are also banned. The authors also wrote that the new Macedonian authorities curse everything Bulgarian, although it is a historical fact that the Ilinden insurgents were people with a Bulgarian national consciousness. The statement also reads: \\"The Macedonian leaders imposed by Belgrade are trying to crush everything Bulgarian without raising funds for it. Those who disagree with the YCP's policy are considered \\"unconscious Bulgarophiles.\\" and continued to see themselves as Bulgarians, even in Communist Yugoslavia.According to the Macedonian historian Academician Ivan Katardzhiev all left-wing Macedonian revolutionaries from the period until the early 1930s declared themselves as \\"Bulgarians\\" and he asserts that the political separatism of some Macedonian revolutionaties toward official Bulgarian policy was yet only political phenomenon without ethnic character. Katardzhiev claims all those veterans from IMRO (United) and Bulgarian communist party remained only at the level of political, not of national separatism. Thus, they practically continued to feel themselves as Bulgarians, i.e. they didn't developed clear national separatist position even in Communist Yugoslavia. This will bring even one of them - Dimitar Vlahov on the session of the Politburo of the Macedonian communist party in 1948, to say that in 1932 (when left wing of IMRO issued for the first time the idea of separate Macedonian nation) a mistake was made. –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏–∫ –ö–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—ü–∏–µ–≤, –ò–≤–∞–Ω. –í–µ—Ä—É–≤–∞–º –≤–æ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∏–æ—Ç –∏–º—É–Ω–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–æ—Ç, –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—ò—É –∑–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ \\"–§–æ—Ä—É–º\\", 22 j—É–ª–∏ 2000, –±—Ä–æj 329.

He was born in Veles (then known by the name K√∂pr√ºl√º) in the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day North Macedonia) where he graduated from Bulgarian Exarchate's school.

In 1903 he took part in the Ilinden Uprising. In 1908 he joined the People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section). In 1903-1913 Brashnarov worked as Bulgarian teacher. In 1914-1915 he completed a two-year higher educational course in Plovdiv. He was mobilized in the Bulgarian army during the First World War and participated in the battles of Doiran. After Bulgaria lost the war, the Bulgarian occupation of Vardar Macedonia ended and Brashnarov remained in the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1919, he joined the Yugoslav Communist Party. In 1925 in Vienna, Brashnarov was elected as one of the leaders of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United).–†–∞–∑–º–∏—Å–ª–∏ –≤—ä—Ä—Ö—É —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü–∏—è—Ç–∞ –≤ –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–∞, –ö—Ä–∞—Å–∏–º–∏—Ä –£–∑—É–Ω–æ–≤, –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—ä—Ä –∑–∞ –∏–∑—Å–ª–µ–¥–≤–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞ –¥–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è—Ç–∞, 1992, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, —Å—Ç—Ä. 74.

After his release in 1936 he remained politically passive. When Bulgaria annexed Vardar Banovina in 1941, he was one of the founders of the Bulgarian Action CommitteesMinchev, Dimitre.

Till then there was no real communist resistance in Vardar Macedonia, but in the middle of 1943 it became obvious that Germany and Bulgaria would be defeated.Viktor Meier, Yugoslavia: A History of Its Demise, Routledge, 2005, , p. 181. In the same year Brashnarov became politically active again and joined the Yugoslav Communist partizan's movement there fighting against the Axis Powers. At that time the Yugoslav communists recognized a separate Macedonian nationality to stop the fears of the local population that they would continue the former Yugoslav policy of forced serbianization, but they didn't support the view that the Macedonian Slavs are Bulgarians, because that meant in practice, the area should remain part of the Bulgaria after the war.Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R. King, Yugoslav communism and the Macedonian question, Archon Books, 1971, , Chapter 9: The encouragement of Macedonian culture. On 2 August 1944, the Antifascist assembly of the national liberation of Macedonia took place at the St. Prohor Pƒçinjski monastery. Brashnarov served as the first speaker.Entangled Histories of the Balkans: Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies, Roumen Dontchev Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov, BRILL, 2013, p. 328., The modern Macedonian state was officially proclaimed as a federal state within Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia, receiving recognition from the Allies in 1945. The new Macedonian authorities had a primary goal to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate Macedonian consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia. From the start of the new Yugoslavia, these authorities organised frequent purges and trials of Macedonian communists and non-party people were charged with autonomist deviation. Many of the former left-wing IMRO government officials were purged from their positions, then isolated, arrested, imprisoned or executed on various (in many cases fabricated) charges including pro-Bulgarian leanings, demands for greater or complete independence of Yugoslav Macedonia, collaboration with the Cominform after the Tito-Stalin split in 1948, forming of conspirative political groups or organisations, demands for greater democracy and the like. Initially, he cooperated with the new regime, but soon after had realized the defeats brought about by the Yugoslav Macedonism,Because th–µ Communists as well as the whole left wing of the Macedonian national-revolutionary movement treated the Macedonian Slavs as a regional section of the Bulgarian nation up to the middle of the 1930s, the main reason for Cominformism in Macedonia was opposition to the new national policy in Yugoslav Macedonia and support for the old pro-Bulgarian option. For more see: Ivo Banac: With Stalin Against Tito. Cominformist Splits in Yugoslav Communism, Ithaca/London, 1988, p. 192.

In 1948, being fully disappointed by the policy of the authorities, Brashnarov complained of it in letters to Joseph Stalin and to Georgi Dimitrov and asked for help, maintaining better relations with Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, and opposing the serbianization and de-Bulgarization of the Macedonian people. He did so together with Pavel Shatev. As a result, he was arrested in 1950 as a cominform agent under the accusation of \\"organizing an illegal group to support the Soviet Union in its the conflict with Yugoslavia\\".Heinz Willemsen, The Labour Movement and the National Question: The Communist Party of Yugoslavia in Macedonia in the Inter-War Period, Vol. 33 (2005): Social Movements in Southeast Europe, p. 102. Afterwards he was imprisoned in Goli Otok labor camp where he died the following year.Goli Otok: The Island of Death: a Diary in Letters, Venko Markovski, Social Science Monographs, Boulder, 1984, , —Ä. 42. Initially, Brashnarov was buried in the labor camp, but two years later his remains were transferred somewhere. His grave was found in 2011 in Zagreb, where he was reburied in a mass grave of prisoners from Goli Otok. The name of Brashnarov was taboo in the SR Macedonia during the period 1950‚Äì1990, because of the obligatory pro-Serbian and anti- Bulgarian tendency among the \\"socialist\\" Yugoslav Macedonian historians, but he was rehabilitated during the 1990s, after then Republic of Macedonia gained its independence.Stefan Troebst, Historical Politics and Historical 'Masterpieces' in Macedonia before and after 1991, New Balkan Politics, issue 6, 2003. Although he was liked by the historiography in Communist Bulgaria as a left-wing pro-Bulgarian politician, after the fall of communism he has been criticized by some right-wing nationalist historians there as a late repented Macedonian Communist apostate.–¶–æ—á–æ –í. –ë–∏–ª—è—Ä—Å–∫–∏, –ó–∞–∫—ä—Å–Ω—è–ª–æ—Ç–æ –æ—Å—ä–∑–Ω–∞–≤–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–∫–∞—è–ª–∏—Ç–µ —Å–µ —Ä–æ–¥–æ–æ—Ç—Å—Ç—ä–ø–Ω–∏—Ü–∏ –ü–∞–≤–µ–ª –®–∞—Ç–µ–≤ –∏ –ü–∞–Ω–∫–æ –ë—Ä–∞—à–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–≤, 24.04.2010, –°–∏—Ç–µ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏ –∑–∞–µ–¥–Ω–æ.

Over the course of a half a century, the institute has established an international reputation for excellence. The institute is located on a 700-acre campus on Skidaway Island in suburban Savannah, Ga. Founded in 1968, Skidaway Institute was merged into the University of Georgia in 2013. Institute faculty are members of the Department of Marine Sciences at UGA and serve as mentors and advisors for undergraduate and graduate students from UGA and all over the world. Institute resources include state-of-the-art research laboratories and instrumentation, and the 92-foot Research Vessel Savannah. History =pre- SkIO= Skidaway Island was originally a hunting and ceremonial ground of the Timucua Indians. European settlement of the island was successful between 1754 and 1771, and included John Milledge (the father of John Milledge), who established a plantation on the northern end. He named it \\"Modena,\\" presumably after the Italian city for its famed production of silk. Silk was an early industry of the European settlers of coastal Georgia. The Modena Plantation grew corn, cotton, oranges and mulberry trees, and kept sheep, cattle, hogs and horses. It survived as a plantation into the 1840s, until John Milledge III sold it in 1843. The name \\"Modena\\" is still used to refer to the northern part of the island. After the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), many of the plantations on the island were unable to continue without slave labor, and their owners gradually sold them to wealthy northerners, who mostly held them on speculation. Much of the island reverted to wilderness and was used mainly for hunting, trapping, fishing and lumber for several decades. The Modena Plantation changed hands sixteen more times after the war. In 1927 the property became a private hunting preserve for Ralph H. Isham, best known for purchasing a collection of James Boswell's private papers from Baron Talbot of Malahide and passing them to Yale University. Mr. Isham sold the property in 1934 to Robert C. Roebling (great-grandson of John Augustus Roebling). The Roebling family (Robert, Dorothy, and five children) established a farm for Black Angus cattle while living on their schooner, the Black Douglas, which provided all of the power needed by the farm until it was sold in 1941 to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The cattle farm was very successful for the next twenty years, until it came to an end in 1954 due to post-WWII economic pressures. Many of the buildings from the farm are still standing and in use by SkIO, most notably the seven-sided barn with its compass rose mosaic at the center. Another successful European settler of the mid-18th century was Henry Yonge, who had a plantation located just southeast of Modena, called Orangedale. In 1877 it came into the ownership of the Benedictine Order. The Benedictines tried to establish a monastery and Catholic school for the newly freed former slaves on the island, but were unsuccessful. They abandoned their efforts in 1889. The \\"Priest tract,\\" as the property had come to be called, became one of many acquired by a partnership of Thomas Bourke Floyd, James Boog Floyd, and A. Goden Guerard Jr. Thomas Floyd eventually assumed ownership of the entire middle portion of the island, until economic hardship forced a transfer to C&S; Bank in 1924. The Union Camp Corporation purchased it from the bank in 1941. =The Founding of SkIO= Main entrance to SkIO In 1966, the Georgia Science and Technology Commission of the Georgia General Assembly proposed the establishment of an oceanographic research center on Skidaway Island. The thought at the time was to foster economic growth in coastal Georgia by attracting secondary industries of oceanography, in much the same way that secondary industries of space exploration had arisen around NASA. Dorothy Roebling donated approximately of the Modena property to the State of Georgia for this purpose in 1967, including of high land, all of the buildings and farm workers, and both of their docks on the Skidaway River at the western side of the island. In addition, Union Camp donated of the Orangedale property, including of high land with access to the Wilmington River at the eastern side of the island; this portion of the campus is now called Priest Landing. With the land donations, the Georgia General Assembly created the \\"Ocean Science Center of the Atlantic (OSCA)\\" in 1967. The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography was officially created in January 1968 with Thomas Jackson (formerly of Georgia Tech) as director, two co-directors, a secretary, and several former workers inherited from the Roebling farm. Its first faculty member, Herbert L. Windom, began work in July 1968. President Richard Nixon and Governor Lester Maddox dedicated the first building of the program in 1970. Governor Jimmy Carter dissolved OSCA in 1972, at which point SkIO became an independent research unit in the University System of Georgia. In 2013, Skidaway Institute was merged with the University of Georgia. SkIO has had five directors during its existence: Thomas Jackson (1967‚Äì1970), David Menzel (1970‚Äì1993), Herbert L. Windom (1994‚Äì2001), James G. Sanders (2002‚Äì2016), and Clark R. Alexander (2016‚Äìpresent). The UGA Skidaway Marine Science Campus Location of Skidaway Island in Georgia, USASkIO main building and water towerThe institute operates on a campus at (31.9885476, -81.0212228) surrounded by another of salt marsh. It has ten faculty with research interests ranging from nutrients and pollutants of the salt marshes and estuaries, to the movements of water masses between the coast and Gulf Stream, to the ecology of plankton and microbes of the open ocean. Much of the institute's research since its inception has focused on the southeastern U.S. continental shelf, the influences of land, open ocean, and atmosphere on the continental shelf, and other continental shelf environments worldwide.  Research  UGA Skidaway Institute scientists conduct oceanographic research across all the major disciplines (chemistry, biology, physics and geology) and on a geographic scale ranging from the waterways adjoining the campus to sites around the world. A sample of ongoing research projects at Skidaway Institute includes: * Coastal and estuarine physics which investigates the processes that affect circulation on continental shelves and in estuaries * Studying the way carbon cycles through the ocean and its implications on global climate change. * The chemical, physical and biological processes that regulate the biological productivity of the Georgia coastal ocean. * The role plankton play in the cycling of energy and materials in the oceans * Helping Georgia coastal communities build their resilience to storms by locating sand resources for post-storm beach renourishment. * Investigating the way microscopic parasites affect the Georgia shrimping industry  Education  Skidaway Institute has always had a role in training future scientists, especially at the graduate level. Since being merged into UGA in 2013, that mission has grown. Skidaway Institute's education mission is primarily focused on research. Graduate students at both the masters and doctoral level come to Skidaway to conduct research with institute faculty. Some are enrolled at UGA, but others come from other institutions around the country and internationally. Advanced undergraduate students in marine sciences receive hands-on research experience in Skidaway‚Äôs active internship program. UGA Skidaway Institute scientists also teach on-line and field courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level.  Facilities  Skidaway Institute includes state-of-the-art biological, chemical, geological and physical oceanographic research laboratories as well as a number of specialized facilities: * The 92-foot Research Vessel Savannah. A part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System fleet, the R/V Savannah is a modern, state-of-the-art vessel ideal for marine research in estuarine and continental shelf waters throughout the southeastern U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. In addition to a crew of seven, the R/V Savannah can accommodate up to 16 research personnel for 24-hour ‚Äúround the clock‚Äù research cruises, or larger groups for shorter day- trips. *A fleet of smaller boats for inshore field work * Advanced instrumentation for trace analysis of inorganic and organic constituents, and a variety of instruments for molecular and cellular investigations and sophisticated image analysis systems. * State-of-the-art facilities and instrumentation to analyze the genetic identity, diversity and functionality of marine organisms and microbial communities.  Funding  UGA Skidaway Institute scientists‚Äô research efforts are funded by both public and private agencies. The State of Georgia provides a portion of Skidaway's funding, but most of the research at Skidaway is underwritten by grants from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation. State agencies such as the Department of Natural Resources, the Georgia State Coastal Zone Management Program and the Georgia Department of Transportation also provide support for important studies of Georgia's coastal region.  Campus Partners  =UGA Marine Extension = The University of Georgia Marine Extension Service consists of several educational outreach facilities in the state of Georgia, including one on the Skidaway Marine Science Campus. The Marine Education Center and Aquarium (MECA) operates a small public saltwater aquarium of local marine fish and invertebrates, which is visited by 18,000 schoolchildren per year. There is also a small research facility for shellfish aquaculture. =Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary= The campus hosts the administrative offices for NOAA's Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary, which is one of thirteen marine sanctuaries in the United States. It consists of of a nearshore live-bottom rock reef, off the coast of Sapelo Island, Georgia. =GSU Applied Coastal Research Lab= Georgia Southern University's Applied Coastal Research Laboratory (ACRL), studies sedimentary processes of the coastal zone of Georgia, such as groundwater hydrology and shoreline erosion. * New Georgia Encyclopedia * Skidaway Island history * Skidaway Island Comprehensive History * Roebling family history * Untitled.

The story follows William, a young boy who wishes for a doll to care for. William's father is unhappy with his request, instead giving William toys that he considers to be more gender appropriate. Finally, William's grandmother fulfills William's request, explaining to William's father that the doll will allow for William to practice good parenting. Zolotow cites personal observations about the relationship between her husband and son as inspiration for the book. She believes that denying young boys access to certain toys and absences of early interaction between father and child are destructive to expression and relationship formation. The book often is used in the classroom for lessons on gender roles, intolerance, or general anti-bias education. To counterbalance inherent micro-inequalities in the classroom, William's Doll is employed as a method through which educators expose students to the concept of sex-stereotyping. While exposure through children's literature has been employed by many marginalized populations, representations of males such as William with traditionally female characteristics have not been as easily welcomed. Many educators, for example, object to using texts representing gender-role reversal in the classroom, whereas others promote it, recognizing the critical role schools play in childhood identity and sexuality development. A song based on the story was included in the 1972 best-selling Free to Be... You and Me children's album and songbook. In 1981, William's Doll also became a 14-minute film starring Craig Salles.  Background  Published in 1972, William's Doll extends Zolotow's legacy of recognizing and legitimatizing the emotional capacity of small children. Rejecting condescension based on age, Zolotow appeals to genuineness by introducing themes such as death and anger, and in William's Doll, non-traditional gender stereotypes, to young audiences. Zolotow explained that although she is a feminist and appreciates feminist support of the book's message, her inspiration derives from personal observations about her husband's early attempts to bond with the couple's son, Stephen. She cites a specific experience that later became the basis of the book. As a result of her husband's refusal to fulfil their son's request for a stuffed animal lion due to his association between stuffed animals and femininity, Zolotow later purchased the item for Stephen behind her husband's back. Zolotow argues that denying young boys access to certain toys rejects fulfilment of genuine human instinct. Observing similar interactions between fathers and sons at local parks, Zolotow found inspiration in how men of the time period missed out on some of the pleasures of being closely involved with their children's early development. She observed, for example, that by always exiting the room during diaper changes, her husband missed their son's first smile. Such absences of early interaction between father and child, Zolotow believes, result in a breach in the foundation of the relationship.  Summary  William's Doll follows the story of William, a young boy who wishes for a doll to care for. His father, uncomfortable with William's request, tries giving William toys that he considers to be more gender-appropriate, such as a basketball and a train set. William still enjoys these toys, practicing his basketball skills and playing with his train set for hours. However, he persists with his request for a doll, enduring taunting by his brother and other boys in the neighborhood. When William's grandmother comes to visit, William shows her the toys his father bought him, but mentions his continuing desire for a doll to care for. Finally, William's grandmother fulfills William's request, upsetting William's father. William's grandmother explains to William's father that the doll will allow for William to practice good parenting and grow into a great father just like him.  Analysis  Numerous scholars analyze the use of William's Doll in the classroom. The impact of the book, a representation of non-traditional gender stereotypes in children, is significant in the classroom as a tool to address gender micro-inequalities, intolerance, and learning challenges faced by non-English speaking students. The effects of sexism are residual, especially in the classroom, the center of childhood socialization. Sex stereotyping by educators is reinforced by inequity of time, encouragement, difficulty of assignments, and expectation of success offered between male and female students, labeled \\"hidden curriculum.\\" To counterbalance inherent inequity in the classroom, William's Doll is employed as a method through which educators may expose students to the concept of sex- stereotyping. Introducing relatable characters who are not stereotypically gender-conforming such as William allows for a source of new role models. This method of exposure through children's literature has been employed by many marginalized populations; however, representations of males such as William who are portrayed as having traditionally female characteristics have not been as easily welcomed. For example, to promote women's involvement in traditionally male-dominated careers, sports, and other interests, the Women's Movement witnessed a surge of empowering female characters in children's literature. However, a persisting lack of non-traditional male characters such as William is proposed to be a reflection of unchanging male stereotypes despite evolving popular opinion regarding gender roles. Dr. Cecilia Silva, a professor at Texas Christian University, claims society is oblivious to this \\"boy code,\\" only prominent when characters such as William contravene. For many male nonconforming individuals, however, the result of conforming with the \\"code\\" is self-esteem and emotional growth obstacles. Implementing William's Doll in the classroom is frequently proposed as a tool to assist children in identifying sex stereotyping, so it has become the focus of many classroom studies. Martha Goldstein-Schultz, a professor at the University of Connecticut, suggests family and consumer science classrooms as environments to promote discussions concerning sex stereotypes. She emphasizes the critical role schools play in childhood identity and sexuality development as platforms to encourage questions and acceptance through exposure to literature such as William's Doll. A study investigating student responses to a classroom read- aloud of William's Doll to a sample of young boys found that including literature with non-gender-conforming males elicits increased identification of textual interrelation.  Reception  Considering the role of William's Doll in the classroom, scholars focus on teachers' reception of the book as they choose class readings. Julie Wollman-Bonilla, a graduate of Harvard University's Institute for Educational Management, identifies elementary teachers' lack of selection of nonmainstream titles such as William's Doll. She argues that every children's text presents a set of morals and endorses a specific code of conduct. Texts displaying white, middle-class American values are the prevailing choice among elementary school educators, neglecting books representing the perspective of marginalized populations on the basis of sex, race, or socioeconomic factors. In Wollman-Bonilla's sample of teachers' reception, she found that most educators objected to texts representing gender-role reversal. In response to William's Doll, many teachers referenced their own parenting techniques as reasons to reject its use in the classroom. For example, many educators' responses aligned with this male teacher's assertion about the text: \\"I would never let my son play with a doll!\\" In general, male educators were more adverse to the use of William's Doll in their classrooms than female educators, although the dominant opinion across both genders was negative. Wollman-Bonilla identifies that opposition to William's Doll was mostly by gender-conforming individuals who endorse gender roles as a natural order. Books such as William's Doll, however, suggest that sex stereotyping is an intrinsic societal issue that needs to be addressed. Adaptations A song based on the story, with music by Mary Rodgers and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, was included in the best-selling Free to Be... You and Me children's album and songbook in 1972, where it was sung by Alan Alda and Marlo Thomas. The song was later sung by B. D.

The soil series was established in 1955 in Spink County, South Dakota. It is unique to the United States, but in particular to South Dakota where it is the state soil. :;Surface layer: Dark grayish brown loam :;Subsoil - upper: Dark grayish brown clay loam :;Subsoil - middle: Grayish brown clay loam :;Subsoil - lower: Light olive brown clay loam :;Substratum: Light yellowish brown clay loam  South Dakota State Soil  The soil forming factors provide a unique landscape in South Dakota which gives rise to more than 550 different soils. The Houdek soil was designated as the South Dakota State Soil in 1990, by Governor George Mickelson of the State Legislature. The House Bill was signed into law, making the Houdek loam South Dakota‚Äôs Official State Soil. This soil and others in the same location have been mapped on about 600,000 acres. The Professional Soil Scientists Association of SD and the SD Chapter of the Soil and Water Conservation Society worked together to commemorate the importance of soil to South Dakota. It is appropriate that Houdek loam was adopted as the state soil to bring acknowledgement to the important role it has played in South Dakota‚Äôs most important industry, agriculture.  Classification and Genesis  Houdek topsoil is composed of weathered glacial till and 2% to 4% organic matter which gives it a deep, dark color. The slopes ranges from 0 to 25 percent depending on location. The subsoil consists of layers of clay and lime accumulations that were carried downward from the surface by water. Below these layers is the parent material called glacial till. The family name is fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiustoll. The Houdek soil series is deep, well drained, loamy soil that represents many soils formed in South Dakota under grass vegetation. The dark color of the surface layer is a result of decomposition of biomass from vegetation and other materials that have been deposited over thousands of years. Prairie conditions form a thick, dark colored, humified surface horizon or layer that is humus rich (1 to 4% organic C). This is a key characteristic that makes these soils fertile. Characteristics: The depth to carbonates ranges from 14 to 24 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches and includes all or part of the Bt horizon. The soil contains 0 to 10 percent by volume of coarse fragments as pebbles. Some pedons contain up to 20 percent by volume of stones throughout. The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is loam or silt loam but is clay loam in some pedons. It is slightly acid or neutral. 1) Clay accumulation layer The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is clay loam averaging between 27 and 35 percent clay. Some pedons have thin horizons that exceed 35 percent clay. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. 2) Lime accumulation layer. As the Houdek soils weathered and formed, water from the soil surface carried lime and clay downward. These materials were deposited deeper, forming the two subsoil layers. The Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay loam or loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline. It contains few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate. The last layer in the Houdek soil is the parent material. This layer represents the materials from which the Houdek soil has developed with time. It represents what the glacier originally left at the soil surface. Climate factors and vegetation/soil organisms have weathered the glacial parent materials to form the present day Houdek soil. The C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline. It has few to many mottles inherent to the parent till. It has few or common accumulations of gypsum between depths of 40 and 60 inches in most pedons. The classic Houdek soil profile includes: a 6-8 inch friable, neutral, black loam topsoil; a 10 to 15 inch friable, neutral, dark brown clay loam subsoil; a 15 to 30 inch friable, calcareous, moderately alkaline, olive brown clay loam subsoil; and 20+ inches of friable, light olive brown, calcareous, moderately alkaline clay loam parent material.  Geomorphology  The Pleistocene (1.5 - 10,000 B.C) in Northern America was tilled by a succession of great ice sheets. The area covered by glaciers in North America is estimated at 10.4 million km2 and about 20% of the U.S. is influenced by the deposits. The retreating glaciers created the unconsolidated rock surface east of the Missouri River. It took the sediment numerous glacial advances and retreats beginning some 1.5 million years ago, and ending 10 thousand years ago to create glacial tilled soils. Eastern South Dakota has a thick layer of glacial sediment that is about 100 feet (30.5 meters). The glacial till is a result of the material deposited directly by the ice. The mixture of rock has a diverse range of particle size.  Climate and Vegetation  The average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is 22 inches. Due to its high storage of water that is plant available no irrigation is needed during the growing season to sustain at least three months of perennial grasses ranging from tall, mid, or short species. The amount of precipitation is sufficient to provide good production of organic residues but not enough to cause severe weathering and leaching. The climate and vegetation have interacted in South Dakota to produce seven major soil regions. These regions are named: Cool Moist Forest; Cool, Very Dry Plain; Warm, Very Dry Plain; Cool Dry Plain; Warm Dry Plain; Cool Moist Prairie; and Warm Moist Prairie. Houdek soils are recognized for their uses for cropland and rangeland. Common crops grown are small grains, sunflowers, corn and soybeans are commonly grown crops. Livestock graze pastures of Alfalfa and other native grasses. Large areas of Houdek soils are also composed of native range. Crops and grasses grown on the Houdek soil also provide habitat for wildlife. Some native vegetation consist of big bluestem, little bluestem, western wheatgrass, green needlegrass, needle and thread, sideoats grama, blue grama, sedges, and forbs.  Economic Importance  The Houdek soil is of major economic importance to South Dakota because it is often used as to grow small grain, corn, sunflowers, and soybeans. South Dakota is well known as an agricultural state with an area of 77, 047 square miles and it has a population density of nine persons per square mile. Cash receipts from farming and ranching normally exceeds $3 billion each year. On the average, South Dakota is recognized nationally in the top ten for corn, soybeans, spring wheat, oat, alfalfa hay, all hay, grain sorghum, sunflower seed, barley, rye, and flaxseed production. With such soil fertile soil comes premium forage for livestock which is why South Dakota also comes in top ten for beef, sheep, hog, and honey production. Houdek loam soil is the foundation of life and the economic base for South Dakota. Houdek loam is a symbol that can help increase public awareness and importance of South Dakota‚Äôs soil resources.

Between November 1944 and the end of the war in August 1945, the Australian 6th Division, with air and naval support, fought the Imperial Japanese 18th Army in northern New Guinea. Considered a \\"mopping up\\" operation by the Australians, and although ultimately successful for them with the Japanese forces cleared from the coastal areas and driven inland, amidst difficult jungle conditions, casualties from combat and disease were high. With Japan on the verge of defeat, such casualties later led to the strategic necessity of the campaign being called into question.  Background  In 1942, the Japanese occupied the Aitape region in northern New Guinea as part of their general advance south. Throughout 1943 and into 1944, the Allies began a series of offensives in New Guinea and the surrounding area as they sought to reduce the main Japanese base around Rabaul on New Britain, as part of a general advance towards the Philippines that was planned for 1944 and 1945. On 22 April 1944, United States Army forces‚Äîprimarily the 163rd Regimental Combat Team from the 41st Infantry Division‚Äîlanded at Aitape and recaptured the area to help secure the flank of US forces fighting around Hollandia.Grant 2016, pp. 213-214. Following this, Aitape was developed as base from which to support the continuing Allied drive towards the Philippines and the US forces in the area increased to include elements of the 31st and 32nd Infantry Divisions. Largely these forces stayed inside a small defensive area around the airfield, and apart from the Battle of Driniumor River in July, the fighting was limited.Grant 2016, p. 214. As preparations began for this drive, it was decided that defence of the area would be passed to Australian forces to release the American troops for service elsewhere. Consequently, in early October 1944, troops from the Australian 6th Division along with some support personnel from the 3rd Base Sub Area began to arrive at Aitape to relieve the American garrison. The first unit to arrive was the 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment and they began patrolling operations almost immediately.Long 1963, pp. 275‚Äì276. Location of New Guinea, including Aitape and Wewak The Japanese troops in Aitape consisted of approximately 30,000 to 35,000 men from the Japanese 18th Army.Grant 2016, p. 215. This force had suffered heavily during the Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign in 1943‚Äì1944, as well as its failed attack on the American garrison at Aitape in July 1944. As a result, the Australian planning staff believed they faced three Japanese divisions‚Äîthe 20th, 41st and 51st Divisions‚Äîall of which had been reduced to brigade- strength.Allied intelligence estimated Japanese forces in the region to be between 24,000 to 30,000 men. Keogh 1965, p. 401. The Japanese lacked air and naval support, and many troops were sick and short of food, with resupply efforts being limited to occasional deliveries by aircraft or submarines.Odgers 1988, p. 179. In contrast, the Australians were better equipped and better fed, and their medical and other support services were superior. They also had a moderate amount of air support, which was provided by No. 71 Wing RAAF, which included Nos. 7, 8 and 100 Squadrons, equipped with Beaufort light bombers, while aerial reconnaissance was provided by Boomerang and Wirraway aircraft of No. 4 Squadron.Long 1963, p. 275.

Flotilla,Gill 1968, p. 628. under the command of Bill Dovers, captain of Swan.  Battle  An Australian light machine gun team in action near Wewak in June 1945 Following their defeat on the Driniumor River in July, the Japanese commander, General Hatazo Adachi, withdrew his forces from their forward positions and in the lull that followed, Adachi's forces focused upon foraging operations into the Torricelli Mountains and Wewak as hunger and disease began to take its toll on the Japanese force. During this period there had been very little contact between the Japanese and US forces in the area, and US forces had remained on a primarily defensive footing, restricting their operations to limited patrols around their position on the Driniumor.Keogh 1965, p. 401. The Japanese for their part, lacking significant air and naval assets, and low on ammunition and other supplies, had also sought to avoid engagement. Upon the arrival of the Australians, however, the 6th Division's commander, Major General Jack Stevens, decided to begin offensive operations, albeit on a limited scale, to clear the Japanese forces from the coastal area. Initially tasked with the defence of the port, airfield and base facilities at Aitape, the 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment was ordered to advance towards Wewak to destroy the remnants of the Japanese 18th Army. Patrols by the 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment preceded the main Australian advance of the 6th Division. The attack, which began in November 1944, proceeded along two axes‚Äîthe 19th Brigade moved along the coast towards the Japanese base at Wewak, while the 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment, working with ANGAU detachments, advanced into the Torricelli Mountains, driving towards Maprik, which provided the Japanese with most of their supplies. While the advance was under way, the 17th Brigade was assigned the task of building a defensive position around the airfield and base facilities at Aitape, while the 16th Brigade was held back in reserve.Keogh 1965, p. 404. On 19 December, the 19th Brigade crossed the Danmap River and began moving towards the east to cut the main Japanese line of communication. A series of minor actions followed, but no significant engagements took place, and at the end of four weeks the Australians had reached Wallum, about east of Aitape. A week later, on 24 January 1945, the 16th Brigade relieved the 19th, while the 17th Brigade continued the advance towards the west through the Torricellis. The operations were characterised by prolonged small-scale patrolling with small-scale company attacks. Progress was slowed by the difficulties of transporting supplies overland or by barge and the flash flooding of a number of the rivers the Australians had to cross. In one incident, seven men from the 2/3rd Battalion drowned in the swollen waters of the Danmap River which had risen suddenly after a torrential downpour. After Dogreto Bay was occupied, the supply problems eased somewhat for the Australians. On 16 March 1945, the airfields at But and Dagua on the coast were occupied, although fighting continued further inland from there over the course of the following fortnight as the Australians fought to gain control of the Tokuku Pass. On 25 March, Lieutenant Albert Chowne, a platoon commander from the Australian 2/2nd Battalion led an attack on a Japanese position that was holding up the advance on Wewak. For his actions he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Heavy fighting continued for four days after this, and the Australians resorted to the use of flame throwers for the first time in the war, using them effectively against heavily entrenched Japanese positions; the weapon had a profound psychological effect, boosting the morale of the Australians and sapping that of the Japanese defenders, many of whom simply fled in the face of flame thrower teams.Grant 2016, pp. 219-220. Farida Force landing at Dove Bay, May 1945 In the Torricelli Mountains, the 17th Brigade continued its advance against stubborn Japanese defence. Nevertheless, by 23 April 1945, they had secured Maprik. The fall of Maprik allowed the Australians to begin constructing an airfield away at Hayfield, and this was completed on 14 May allowing reinforcements and supplies to be flown in. Elsewhere, the 19th Brigade had begun its assault on Wewak in early May. HMAS Hobart, Arunta, Warramunga, Swan and HMS Newfoundland (of the British Pacific Fleet) as well as the RAAF bombarded the Wewak defences. On 11 May, a landing at Dove Bay by Farida Force was undertaken to encircle Wewak and prevent the escape of its garrison. Wewak fell on the same day, as the 19th Brigade occupied its airfield. The fighting around Wewak Airfield continued until 15 May, however, when men from the 2/4th Battalion, with armoured support, attacked Japanese positions overlooking the airstrip. It was during this attack that Private Edward Kenna carried out the deeds that led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross, attacking several Japanese bunkers.Grant 2016, p. 223. Following this, the remaining Japanese in the area withdrew into the Prince Alexander Mountains to the south of Wewak. To counter this, the 16th Brigade was dispatched to follow them up, and push them towards the 17th Brigade which advanced towards the east towards Maprik. Meanwhile, the 19th Brigade came up against strongly defended positions around several high features known as Mount Kawakubo, Mount Tazaki and Mount Shiburangu. This fighting took place throughout June and July. These operations continued until 11 August, by which time the 16th Brigade had reached Numoikum, about from Wewak, while the 17th Brigade had captured Kairivu, from Wewak.Odgers 1988, p. 180.Keogh 1965, p. 407. At this stage, word was received that the Japanese government had begun discussing terms for a possible surrender and so offensive operations were brought to a halt.  Aftermath  By the end of the campaign, the Australians had lost 442 men killed and 1,141 wounded in battle.Keogh 1965, p. 408. On top of this, a further 145 died from other causes, and 16,203 men were listed as \\"sickness casualties\\". Many of these casualties were the result of an atebrin- resistant strain of malaria that infested the area.Grant 2016, p. 222. Japanese casualties are estimated at between 7,000 and 9,000 killed while 269 were captured during the fighting. Following the end of hostilities in New Guinea, approximately 13,000 Japanese surrendered, with about 14,000 having died of starvation and illness during the entire campaign.Grant 2016, p. 225.Grey 2008, p. 191. During the course of the campaign, the strategic necessity of the operation was called into question as it became clear that the fighting would have little impact upon the outcome of the war. In that regard, it was argued that the Japanese forces in Aitape‚ÄìWewak posed no strategic threat to the Allies as they advanced towards mainland Japan and that if they could be isolated and contained they could be left to \\"wither on the vine\\" as their supplies ran out. As such, the campaign has sometimes been referred to as an \\"unnecessary campaign\\", and General (later Field Marshal) Thomas Blamey, commander-in-chief of the Australian Military Forces, was accused of undertaking it for \\"his own glorification\\".Grey 2008, p. 190. Army officer and military historian Eustace Keogh concludes that \\"politically or strategically, the offensives on Bougainville and at Aitape‚ÄìWewak served no useful purpose\\".Keogh 1965, p. 428. Nevertheless, at the time that the operation was planned there was no way for the Australian commanders to know when the war would come to an end and there were political and operational reasons to carry out the campaign. By late 1944, the Australian Army had taken a secondary role in the fighting and there was a political need for Australia to demonstrate that it was sharing the burden in the Pacific. As New Guinea was an Australian territory at the time, it was argued that there was a responsibility to clear the Japanese from that area. Regardless, due to manpower shortages in the Australian economy, the government had requested that the Army find a way to reduce its size, while at the same time requiring it to maintain forces to undertake further operations against the Japanese into 1946. To do that, it was argued that there was a requirement to clear the Japanese that had been bypassed to allow the garrisons of these areas to be reduced.

It was directed by Jacques Tourneur and produced by George Jessel. The film stars Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan, with Debra Paget, Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice. Plot Jean Peters in Anne of the Indies After seizing a British ship, female pirate captain Anne Providence (Jean Peters) spares Pierre LaRochelle (Louis Jourdan), a Frenchman captured by the British, from walking the plank. He agrees to join Providence's crew and soon she begins to fall for the handsome officer. They travel to an island where they meet with her pirate mentor Captain Blackbeard (played by Thomas Gomez), who takes an instant dislike to LaRochelle although he, at first, holds back as he can see Anne has affection for him. Blackbeard eventually realises he has seen LaRochelle before in the French navy when a pirate was hanged. When he reveals this, LaRochelle claims he has left the French navy. Anne believes him, but when Blackbeard attacks him, she defends him and sends Blackbeard and his men away, making an enemy of Blackbeard. It eventually transpires that LaRochelle is working for the British as they have captured his ship, and he has a wife. He betrays Anne to the British who attack her ship. Anne escapes and takes his wife hostage. The British do not return LaRochelle's ship to him, as they did not capture Anne, so LaRochelle gets a ship of his own to go after Anne. In the confrontation that follows, LaRochelle's ship is destroyed and he is captured. Anne maroons LaRochelle and his wife on a remote island to die. She sails away, but a few days later her conscience compels her to return with provisions and a small boat. As she does so, she is attacked by Blackbeard; instead of fleeing, she stays and fights to stop Blackbeard from finding LaRochelle, even though her ship is no match. As Anne, the last survivor of her crew, challenges Blackbeard to a final personal duel, she is blown away by a salvo from the enemy ship before Blackbeard can stop his cannoneers. Watching on, LaRochelle and his wife pay tribute to Anne's sacrifice. Cast * Jean Peters as Anne, also known as Capt. Providence * Louis Jourdan as Capt.

Sass was asked by New York publishers and Los Angeles studios to write a movie treatment of the story. In 1948 he offered up a fictionalized version of the true story of Anne Bonny, including a 10-page \\"factual basis\\" for the story. Studios seemed responsive, but in the end Sass was left out of the loop until the movie came out in 1951. What ended up on the screen was very different from the original story. Without writer credit to Sass, it would be difficult to convince anyone it was the same story.Sass files: South Carolina Historical Society In February 1948 Walter Wanger bought the screen rights to the story as a vehicle for Susan Hayward who Wanger had under contract. Hayward reportedly is the one who prompted Wagner to make the purchase.

The current appellation was given in 1625 when it was named after the Palazzo Barberini, the substantial Baroque palace built in an elevated position on the south side of the piazza for the Barberini. Originally, there was a large entrance gateway to the palace designed by the Baroque painter and architect Pietro da Cortona on the south east corner of the piazza but this was demolished to make way for the construction of a new road in the 19th century.

Boschert concludes that \\"it's possible that Cobasys (Chevron) is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline.

A 2006 study by Kyung Hee University estimated their total population at roughly 10,000. Aside from North Korean citizens living in Russia, there has also historically been significant migration from the northern provinces of Korea, especially Hamgyong, to the Russian Far East; this population of migrants became known as the Koryo-saram. 65% of the Sakhalin Koreans also took up North Korean citizenship in the 1950s and 1960s in order to avoid statelessness; roughly one thousand even repatriated to North Korea, though their ancestral homes were in the southern half of the Korean peninsula. In addition, various senior members of the Workers' Party of Korea, including Kim Il-sung himself, lived in Russia prior to Korean independence and the establishment of North Korea. Migration history =Students= During the post-Korean War reconstruction period of North Korea from 1953 to 1962, many North Korean students enrolled in universities and colleges in countries of the Soviet bloc, including Russia, and others came as industrial trainees. =Workers= Number of North Korean migrant workers in Asia In the late 1940s, roughly 9,000 North Korean migrant workers were recruited by the Soviet government to work in state-owned fisheries on Sakhalin. Another 25,000 workers also came to work in fisheries during the 1950s. The second wave began in 1966 or 1967 under a secret agreement between Leonid Brezhnev and Kim Il-sung in Vladivostok, which involved North Koreans working as lumberjacks. Roughly 15,000 to 20,000 were present in any given year. The first two waves consisted mostly of criminals or political prisoners. However, the most recent influx of North Korean workers, which began under the government of Vladimir Putin, is composed of volunteers seeking to escape unemployment and poverty at home. Most are from Pyongyang; recruitment companies prefer workers from urban areas, as they are believed to adapt better to life in other countries. By 2006, more than 10,000 North Koreans entered Russia on work visas annually, largely headed for the Russian Far East. They are closely monitored by North Korean security forces to prevent defections; many report being paid in scrip rather than legal currency. In 2009, the North Korean government was estimated to earn roughly US$7 million each year in foreign exchange through their workers in Russia. In 2010, reports came out from Nakhodka indicating that North Korean workers and traders there had been evacuated back to their home country due to rising military tensions with South Korea. In 2011, Kim Jong-il made a visit to Russia in which he reportedly negotiated for even more North Korean workers to be sent to Russia. Up to 70% of the $40 to $100 per month wages earned by the workers are reported to be taken away as \\"loyalty payments\\". Refugees The decline of the economy of North Korea has also resulted in an increasing number of North Korean refugees in Russia, also in the eastern regions. Many of these refugees are runaways from the North Korean logging camps. Both South Korean diplomatic missions and local ethnic Koreans are reluctant to provide them with any assistance. As early as 1994, the South Korean prime minister was quoted as stating \\"It is legally not tidy for us to grant North Koreans asylum\\". It is believed that North Korea ordered the assassination of South Korean consul Choi Duk-gun in 1996 as well as two private citizens in 1995, in response to their contact with the refugees. In 1999, there were estimated to be only between 100 and 500 North Korean refugees in the area. However, their numbers grew rapidly. In 2003, Sergey Darkin, the Governor of Primorsky Krai, suggested allowing up to 150,000 North Korean refugees in China to settle in Russia, but his plan never came to fruition. In November 2007, Russian law enforcement abducted a North Korean asylum seeker in front of a Federal Migration Service office in Moscow which turned him over to agents of the North Korean special services. The refugee later escaped from a facility in Vladivostok, and intervention by the NGO Civic Assistance and UNHCR prevented his deportation.  References  Further reading *.

It is a shrub or small tree with many tangled branches and flowers in a number of colour forms. It seems to be mostly restricted to the upper reaches of the beds and nearby flats of two rivers. Description Eremophila laanii is a shrub or small tree usually growing to a height of , sometimes twice as high which sometimes produces suckers. Its branches are spreading or drooping and are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. The leaves are linear to elliptic in shape, mostly long, wide, sometimes glabrous, sometimes covered with fine hairs. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk long and are usually clustered near the ends of the branches. There are 5 green, egg-shaped, tapering sepals which are mostly long, glabrous on the outer surface but hairy on the inside. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is sometimes pink to red with pink spots on a light colour inside the tube, or cream and without spots. The petal tube is mostly glabrous except that the inside of the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs from June to December and is followed by woody, oval-shaped to top-shaped fruits with a pointed end and which are long and have a thin, papery covering. Taxonomy The species was first formally described in 1884 by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller and the description was published in Australasian Chemist and Druggist.The type specimen was collected on the Upper Murchison River, near Mount Hale, by Charles Crossland. The specific epithet (laanii) honours Dr van der Laan, a 19th-century Dutch promoter of scientific research. Distribution and habitat Eremophila laanii occurs on clay or sandy clay soils on floodplains and riverbanks along the upper reaches of the Murchison and Gascoyne Rivers in the Carnarvon, Gascoyne, Geraldton Sandplains, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. It can reproduce by root suckering and often forms dense thickets. Conservation This species is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila is well known in cultivation. It is a large, tough shrub and is suitable for large gardens where there is little competition and it can be used as a screening plant. It is most easily grown from cuttings or from its root suckers and grows in most soils, especially heavy clay. It grows naturally near rivers and although drought resistant, flowers profusely after a deep watering. It is also frost tolerant but needs to occasionally be heavily pruned in order to maintain its shape and to remove dead wood.

There are reserved constituencies in both Parliamentary and State Assembly elections. Candidates of General category are not eligible to contest from these constituencies. All voters are to vote for one of the candidates (from Scheduled Castes or Schedule Tribes). In case of Municipal elections and other Local Bodies elections, the constituencies are known as Wards. Thus, there may be as many Wards or Constituencies as the number of elected seats in the elected body. Reserved constituencies are those constituencies in which seats are reserved for SCs and STs on the basis of their population. In earlier History of India under British rule, separate electorate meant not only were the seats reserved for a specific community, but voting for the reserved constituency was allowed for only members of that specific community. For example, only Muslims could vote for Muslim candidates in the reserved constituencies for Muslims.  Definition  An electorate is a group of voters, namely, all the officially qualified voters within a particular country or area or for a particular election. A joint electorate is one where the entire voting population of a country or region is part of a single electorate, and the entire electorate votes for the candidates who contest in the elections. In the case of separate electorates, the voting population of a country or region is divided into different electorates, based on certain factors such as religion, caste, gender, and occupation. Here, members of each electorate votes only to elected representatives for their electorate. Separate electorates are usually demanded by minorities who feel it would otherwise be difficult for them to get fair representation in government. For example, separate electorate for Muslims means that Muslims will choose their separate leader by separate elections for Muslims.pakistan studies by dr. M. Azam Chaudhary  Under the British Rule  In India's pre-independence era, when the Muslims in India demanded fair representation in power-sharing with the British government along with the Hindus in 1906, the British government provided for a separate electorate system for the Muslims in Indian Council Act, 1909. As a result, of the total 250 seats of the Bengal Legislative Assembly, 117 seats were kept reserved for the Muslims. Accordingly, the general elections of 1937 were held on the basis of the extended separate electorates, where only the Muslims voted for the 117 seats, in Bengal. Again, in the Round Table Conferences in 1930‚Äì32, the concept of separate electorates for the Untouchables (SC/ST) was raised by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, as a way to ensure sufficient representation for the minority SC/ST communities, in government. This provision was strongly opposed by Gandhi on the grounds that the move would disintegrate Hindu society. If the SC/ST communities were given a separate electorate, then certain constituencies would have been reserved for them, and only the people belonging to SC/ST communities would have been able to vote for the candidates contesting those seats, thus alienating the rest of the Hindus. Finally, a compromise was reached with Ambedkar and Gandhi with the Poona Pact in which the parties agreed that certain constituencies would be reserved for the SC/ST communities, where the people belonging to SC/ST communities could elect 4 candidates per constituency who would then be candidates for election by the joint electorate. Anglo-Indians The Anglo-Indian community were the only community in India that had its own representatives nominated to the Lok Sabha (lower house) in Parliament of India. This right was secured from Jawaharlal Nehru by Frank Anthony, the first and longtime president of the All India Anglo-Indian Association. The President can nominate two Anglo-Indian member to the Lok Sabha. Fourteen states of India (Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal) also had a nominated member each in their respective State Legislative Assemblies. The Article 334 of the Indian Constitution gave reservation to the Anglo-Indian community during the creation of the Constitution, the article 334 also says that this reservation would cease to exist 20 years after the commencement of the Constitution. But this reservation was extended to 1970 through the 5th Amendment. The period of reservation was extended to 1980 through 23rd amendment and then to 1990 through 45th amendments, to 2006 through 62nd amendment, to 2010 through 79th amendments and to 2020 through the 95th Amendment. In January 2020, the Anglo-Indian reserved seats in the Parliament and State Legislatures of India were abolished by the 104th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2019. The reason cited by the Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who introducing the Bill in the Lok Sabha is that the Anglo-Indians population in India was just 296 in the 2011 Census of India, though the number is disputed. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes A number of seats in the Parliament of India, State Assemblies, urban and rural- level institutions are reserved for the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). Though seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, they are elected by all the voters in a constituency, without any separate electorate. Also a member of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is not debarred from contesting a general i.e. non-reserved seat. This system was introduced by the Constitution of India in 1950 and was supposed to be in place for the first 10 years, to ensure participation in politics by these groups which were deemed weak, marginalised, under-represented and needing special protection. Under 104th amendment to the Constitution of India, this reservation is to last until 2030 and subject to extension with further constitutional amendment. The population figure of Scheduled Castes in percentage terms with reference to the total population figure had increased from 14.6% in 1971 census to 16.2% in 2001 census. Similarly, the population figure of Scheduled Tribes had increased from 6.9% in 1971 census to 8.2% in 2001 census. The overall increase of population figure of SC and ST in 2001 census has led the Delimitation Commission to increase the seats for Scheduled Castes in Lok Sabha from 79 to 84 and for Scheduled Tribes from 41 to 47 out of 543 constituencies, as per Delimitation of Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies Order, 2008. Allocation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha are made on the basis of proportion of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the State concerned to that of the total population, provide provision contained in Article 330 of the Constitution of India read with Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 . Other Backward Classes As per the enforcement of recommendations of the Mandal Commission, the Other Backward Classes (OBC) also get reserved seats in the Rural and Urban bodies election. Allocation of seats for Other Backward Classes are made on the basis of proportion of Other Backward Classes in the State concerned to that of the total population. Women Women get one-third reservation in Gram Panchayats (meaning 'Village Council', which is a form of local rural government), Block Panchayats, District Councils and Municipal bodies. There is a long-term plan to extend this reservation to the Parliament and State Legislature. The Women's Reservation Bill proposed in 2008, reserves 33% of all seats in Lok Sabha and all State Legislative assemblies for women. The Rajya Sabha passed the bill on 9 March 2010. The bill was never voted on Lok Sabha. Between 1957 and 2019, before the abrogation of Article 370 and 35A of the Constitution of India, erstwhile 89-member Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly had 2 seats reserved for the nominated women members. Reserved seats in the Sikkim Legislative Assembly Sikkim was merged with the Union of India in 1975. The 32-member Sikkim Legislative Assembly has one seat reserved for Buddhist Sangha member. Only Buddhist monks and nuns belonging to the Six registered Buddhist monasteries are eligible to vote for this seat. Additionally 12 seats of the Sikkim legislative Assembly are reserved for the Bhutia and Lepcha ethnic people and 2 seats for Scheduled Castes. Union government's nominees to the Puducherry Legislative Assembly In the 33-member Puducherry Legislative Assembly, 3 members are nominated by the Union government of India. Governor's nominees to the State Legislative Councils A Governor can nominate up to the 1/12 members of the total number of members in a State Legislative councils, the upper house of the state lagislature in 6 states, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. These members are experts in the field of art, science, literature and social service. President's nominees to the Rajya Sabha The President of India can nominate 12 members to the Rajya Sabha. These 12 members are personalities who have expertise in art, science, literature and social service.

He achieved success from 1891, performing cockney songs including \\"Arf a Pint of Ale\\", \\"It's a Great Big Shame\\", \\"Down the Road\\" and \\"If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses in Between\\" in a career lasting over thirty years. Born in Pimlico, London, Elen had worked as a barman and a draper's assistant and had packed eggs for the Co-op before becoming a singer. He began busking at an early age and found a position singing in a minstrel troupe. His solo success began in 1891 when he started performing in public houses, singing songs in a manner similar to many cockney fruit sellers of the time, known as costermongers - from the old word 'costard' , meaning apple. Because of this, he became known as a \\"coster comedian\\". For the stage persona he had created, Elen dressed in a coster uniform of striped jersey, peaked cap turned towards one ear and a short clay pipe in the side of his mouth. His characters adopted a persona of being constantly bad tempered and pugnacious. In 1907 he starred in a short film called Wait Till the Work Comes Round. In his later years, Elen went to America during the English music hall strike. He performed the same act as he did in the UK, but box-office sales show that he was less successful than his friend, the singer Albert Chevalier, and so he returned to the UK. He then made several appearances as a top attraction in music halls across London. He appeared on stage occasionally in the 1930s, albeit briefly, and he appeared in the 1935 Royal Command Performance. He retired in 1914, shortly after returning from America. He made occasional appearances on stage and film before his death in 1940 aged 77. Biography =Early career= Elen was born at 103 Pulford Street, Pimlico, London. His father was Edwin Elen, a viewer of cloth in a military store, and Mercy Elen, n√©e Letherbarrow.Russell, Dave. Elen, Gus Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, accessed 16 November 2011 Elen started his career as a solo performer and briefly worked at the Old Marylebone Theatre in a 'blackface' comedy double act with a man named Daniels, who died in a boating accident a few years after the partnership was formed.Cullen, Frank. Vaudeville old & new: an encyclopedia of variety performances, Elen Gus, Volume 1, pg 351 ‚Äì 354 After the death of Daniels, he returned to being a solo performer and bought the rights to \\"Never introduce your donah to a pal\\" from the song's writer A.E Durandeau, (donah was cockney slang meaning girlfriend). The song was performed on stage on 4 June 1891, at Harewood's varieties in Hoxton. Elen performed songs and sketches as the character of an old east end costermonger and became known as a 'coster' comedian. Elen drew inspiration from his experiences of growing up around people, similar to that of his persona on stage. Elen's performances were often misinterpreted as being a self caricature, but were performed in a realistic and simplistic manner, one that made him popular with his audiences. The sheet music of If it wasn't for the 'ouses in between In an interview, given after he had become a star, he said: Elen's songs were often compared to those of Albert Chevalier, a contemporary to Elen and a major performer on the halls. There were many other coster performers on the Victorian music hall circuit, but throughout his career Elen maintained a particularly friendly rivalry with Chevalier. =Musical performances= The Coster's Mansion, 1899 sheet music The movements for each of Elen's songs were carefully rehearsed so that the performances themselves were clean and precise. Each gesture was powerfully distinct and could be seen from the back of the largest theatre. Many of Elen's songs spoke of the living conditions of ordinary workers and about the cramped housing conditions of the East End. Commenting on the overcrowded poor parts of London, in one of his songs, he takes on the persona of a proud tenant boasting about the dismal place he lives in, and in particular the view from his 'garden': The lyrics to \\"If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between\\" were written by Edgar Bateman, who later wrote two more of Elen's songs: \\"She's Too Good to Live Is Mrs. Carter\\" and \\"The Postman's 'Oliday.\\" The music to the songs was written by George Le Brunn, who wrote a vast number of music-hall songs and accompaniments for Marie Lloyd and Dan Leno, and also for Gus Elen's \\"It's a Great Big Shame\\". Chance Newton, a friend of Elen, spoke of his habit of leaving scores he was working on at the various pubs he visited en route to the particular hall he was travelling to. \\"If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between\\" is perhaps Elen's most recognisable song and is about the little backyards of London houses which are hemmed in by row upon row of other houses in all of the other streets in the neighbourhood. It is set in a typical working day of an east end costermonger.Dictionary on line, accessed October 2011 =Audience representation= His songs were bitter and realistic and rooted in the poverty and life of the East Enders who were his audience. The appeal to his audience, many of whom were poor, proved to be a relief to the working classes of society within London. His act would encourage his audience to laugh at the difficulties of working class life, and to celebrate one's capacity for survival. Some songs would go further and openly reject establishment values of hard work and moral rectitude. His song \\"Wait until the work comes round\\" was specifically written for the unemployed people of Victorian London. =Later career= In 1907, William Morris, a respected vaudeville performer in America, was sent to London by the czar of the American legitimate theatre, Abe Erlanger, who had formed \\"The Advanced Vaudeville\\". It was created to act as direct competition for the newly established Vaudeville Hegemony, which was operating in the eastern half of the USA. Whilst in London, Morris saw a performance of Elen's at the Hackney Empire and signed him to take part in the new company. Elen was offered $1,500 to work in the US.\\"Profit By Music Hall War\\", The New York Times, 5 April 1907 He accepted the offer and appeared on the same bill as Harry Lauder and Will Evans at The New York Theatre where he performed his repertoire of cockney songs to the delight of American audiences.\\"London Types in New York\\", The New York Times, 10 September 1907 The New York Times described his act as being \\"...strange, raucous, quavering voice with its queer breaks into the treble, the shambling gait and the sudden jerky gestures of a coster, with all the little mannerisms that serve to make him what he is\\". The New York Dramatic News cited; \\"While his act is, in a sense, similar to that of Albert Chevalier, it is also radically different. Mr. Elen portrays the coster as if he actually exists in his native element\\". The box-office sales indicated that Chevalier, who was also appearing in America, was more popular with American audiences than Elen and so he returned to the UK and performed for a further seven years as a top attraction in music halls across London, before his retirement. Elen took early retirement in 1914 after 33 years of performing. He returned in the 1930s, albeit briefly, where he appeared in a film and in the 1935 Royal Command Performance. Personal life Unlike most performers, Elen kept a meticulous record of his songs with notes about the gestures and emotions, props required and stage settings. He also wrote comments about how his performance was received. Elen was praised as an \\"authentic cockney from the poor streets of London\\" and was well known for his involvement in personally organised charity events. For many years he and his wife distributed free Christmas gifts to the poor in public. Elen was a fiercely private person and although he was married with children, he would never refer to his family by their names when interviewed by the press. From 1898 Elen lived largely in Balham, where he bred poultry and took up photography. He also became a keen fisherman, particularly during a spell in residence on the south coast, and enjoyed shooting. Elen would not socialise with fellow artists, opting instead to go fishing, shooting or driving around the English countryside. Elen died of liver cancer at his home in Balham, South London, on 17 February 1940, aged 77 and is buried in Streatham Park Cemetery. There is a blue plaque at his former home, 3 Thurleigh Avenue, Balham, which was erected by Greater London Council in 1984.

We learn that the woman ended their earlier relationship in a letter she wrote to him, but we come to doubt that she expected the letter to do so. They sit together and reminisce about past events - for example, the day they spent at Kew Gardens together. Both initially seem to regret not being friends any longer. The man tells her about his many journeys abroad, insisting that he has accomplished alone the things they had said they would do together. He tells her about Russia and how different the society is there. Despite his originally being perhaps poorer and her being better-off (there is a reference to her in the past eating expensive caviar), now the man seems to be prosperous, while the woman has perhaps fared less well, having had, for example, to give up her piano. The man's manners, however, still partly reflect his poorer origins. For example, the man unwittingly risks offending the woman by recalling that she had few friends. He also talks repeatedly about money and what things cost. He claims that when they were together he loved her more than she him. The reader, however, can see that the woman remains attracted to him, and the man appears uncommitted; finally, the man dismisses their earlier selves as immature, mentioning how he had studied the mind while he was in Russia. Here he is unable to complete his sentence because his companion suddenly leaves. He recovers quickly from this surprise, though, asking the waitress not to charge him for the cream which had not been used.

History =Philological School= Founded as the Philological Society by Thomas Collingwood, under the patronage of the Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, its object was to help \\"the heads of families, who by unexpected misfortune, have been reduced from a station of comfort and respectability.\\" Founded in Mary Street (later renamed Stanhope Street, N.W. 1), it moved to Marylebone Road in 1827. Its fortunes improved largely due to Edwin Abbott, headmaster from 1827 to 1872. After Abbott, the school's financial position deteriorated. =Grammar school= In 1908 it was accepted in trust by the London County Council and renamed St Marylebone Grammar School. After World War II it recovered. Under headmaster Philip Wayne it developed artistic activities, acquired shared use of playing fields in Sudbury Hill, and established a country base in the village of Forest Green, near Leith Hill.. Retrieved 1 June 2007. In 1957 the motto \\"ex animo tamquam Deo\\" (\\"from the heart, as from God\\") was added to the school's crest at the suggestion of the deputy headmaster Kenneth Crook. After Philip Wayne, SMGS was led by Harry Llewellyn-Smith as headmaster until 1970. During his period a new and separate science block was built a short walk away from the school's main site. Roy Mansell led the science team and was for a short period the last headmaster after Patrick Hutton. =Closure= Soon after headmaster Patrick Hutton (formerly head of English at St Paul's School) arrived in 1970, the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) proposed to merge SMGS with the local secondary modern school, Rutherford School, later part of North Westminster School. ILEA itself came into conflict with the new Conservative government, whose secretary of state for education Margaret Thatcher took an interest in SMGS. By 1981, however, SMGS had closed. Current use of buildings The former science block continues in educational use as the Cosway Street Centre, part of City of Westminster College. The main school building consisted of the original school building on Marylebone Road and two later wings in Lisson Grove; the Lisson Grove buildings were demolished and replaced with an office block. The original building is Grade II listed and remains intact; it is now part of Abercorn School.

The 33-minute planetarium program utilizes a Zeiss Universarium star projector and an innovative laser video projection system developed by Evans & Sutherland to create an immersive environment. A live presenter narrates the script.  Synopsis  As the audience is seated, the planetarium dome is suffused with a cool blue light, with a suggestion of clouds. The presenter walks to the center of the theater and flourishes a glowing ball, representing a star, about the size of a grapefruit, which he/she alternately lights and dims to accent a description of how various cultures interpreted celestial phenomena such as the cycle of day and night. At the conclusion of the introduction, the orb fades, the theater darkens, and the audience experiences a simulated sunset projected by the laser video system. As the sunset proceeds, the star projector rises to simulate the night sky. The lecturer asks the audience to imagine how mysterious the stars must have seemed to ancient people, and then demonstrates, using the star projector, how people invented constellations in an effort to make sense of the randomly scattered stars. In accelerated time, we see the complex motions of the sun, moon, and planets. The scene dissolves to ancient Alexandria, Egypt. We see the Great Library and the Pharos Lighthouse. In a courtyard, next to a pool surrounded by torches, we see the 2nd Century astronomer Claudius Ptolemy adjusting an armillary sphere to chart star positions. Behind Ptolemy is a small table on which rests a scroll. We approach the scroll and see that it depicts a geocentric model of the universe. Paintings on the scroll morph into 3D representations of the sun, earth, and planets, which hover above the scroll and rotate within a complex system of crystalline spheres, illustrating the earth-centered model of the universe that persisted until the Renaissance. The flame from a lamp pans across the field of view and dissolves to a candle flame burning above the workshop table of Galileo Galilei in Italy around the year 1610. We move into a courtyard where Galileo is observing with his telescope. On an easel lit by a lantern we see his sketches of the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus. These drawings also morph into 3D objects to demonstrate how Galileo's observations transformed our perception of the planets and helped establish the Copernican model of the solar system. The film transports the audience through a series of environments, such as Mount Wilson Observatory in the early 1920s, when Edwin Hubble discovered the true nature of the Andromeda Galaxy and the expansion of the universe. Over the desk of an anonymous modern researcher we see a representation of the Big Bang. The device of transforming raw data, such as sketches and photographs, into 3D objects is used to suggest how scientists must apply imagination to interpret their observations. Towards the end of the show, the audience experiences a simulated flight through clusters of galaxies, into the Milky Way Galaxy, our solar system, skimming the surface of Mars, where the probable and tragic loss of oceans beckon the audience to wonder about the future of our planet, and then finally returns to Earth, landing on the front lawn of Griffith Observatory. The presenter once again appears with the glowing \\"star\\" and delivers an epilogue, summarizing that of all the things we have learned about the Universe, one of the most amazing discoveries is that Earth and everything on it, including its inhabitants, are made from the clouds of dust and gas that lace the Milky Way Galaxy; that we are, in fact, made of stardust, which would possibly explain humanity's fascination with the night sky. Technical challenges According to Andrew Hofman, Visual Effects Supervisor, \\"Centered in the Universe\\" presented unique challenges. \\"Some long-established practices in conventional film making are simply not available in the dome venue.\\"Devor, Melissa (editor), \\"Centered in the Universe\\", FOTO Update, pp 4-9, Summer 2007 For instance, changing lenses is not an option in a dome show; there is only one lens: the 180-degree fisheye, which makes near objects appear distorted while objects only a few feet from the virtual camera appear very tiny. Developing a visual style to work within this limitation was integral to the success of the show. The sheer size of the image files was also daunting. Each frame was composed of 17 million pixels, as opposed to the mere 3 million required for conventional cinema. \\"Software behaved erratically, machines ran out of RAM; hard drives filled up and networks, even air conditioning, were overtaxed.\\" The Visual Effects Producer, Bill Murphy, had to create a schedule and budget for a production \\"that was not fully scripted requiring images never before created for a physical space that was not yet built.\\" Delays in the delivery of the laser video projectors required animators to continue making color adjustments until a few days before the premiere, as the projectors themselves kept changing. Artistic challenges Although every frame of the film was created using computer graphics, conventional artwork played an important role in developing the look and feel of the show. Art Director Chris Butler did extensive research to design props and sets that would allow the 3D animators to create historically authentic environments. The animators visited the dome of the telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory to photograph the building before constructing it in Maya (software) as it might have appeared in 1925, when Edwin Hubble worked there. \\"Dixon insisted on authenticity; from the location of planets in the sky to the kind of feather in Galileo's quill pen, everything was meticulously researched\\", according to Executive Producer Ann Hassett.Riggott, Julie, \\"Infinitely Entertaining\\", Arroyo Monthly February 22, 2007 Animators studied photographs provided by Galileo expert Dava Sobel to ensure that architectural details of the astronomer's house were modeled correctly. Musical score Centered in the Universe features an original orchestral score blending avant-garde and classical motifs composed by Alan Ett, Scott Liggett, and William Ashford from Alan Ett Music Group.

(States that Choi was 44 at the time of his death) Assassination Though the official cause of Choe's death was listed as bludgeoning, he had two pencil-sized holes on his torso which suggested injection of a foreign substance into his body. When his corpse was discovered, he still had $1,200 cash in his pocket. It emerged soon after that he had poison in his bloodstream of the same type as that carried by a North Korean submarine which had infiltrated South Korean waters and landed near Gangneung, Gangwon the previous month; North Korea had threatened to retaliate for the killings of their special forces agents by the South Korean Army. North Korea denied all involvement and accused the South of fabricating evidence in order to frame the North. Some news reports at the time suggested that the North Koreans had hired a Russian Mafia hitman to actually carry out the murder. Aftermath As a result of his death, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade allegedly instructed their personnel to refrain from contacting with or providing assistance to North Koreans in Russia, even refugees, for fear that they too could be murdered. Some analysts believe that the North Korean government chose to delay announcing their 24 August arrest and detention of American citizen Evan Hunziker until around the time of Choe's murder in an attempt to divert attention.

The school is well known for its symbolic clock tower, gigantic stone steps, Chinese pavilions and non-functional water fountain . The clock tower, \\"Xi Yin Lou ÊÉúÈò¥Ê•º\\", was a gift from the school 11th alumni. It was built in 1962 with an engraving of a famous Chinese poem by Tao Qian (Èô∂Ê∏äÊòé) from the Jin Dynasty: \\"ÁõõÂπ¥‰∏çÈáçÊù•Ôºå‰∏ÄÊó•ÈöæÂÜçÊô®; ÂèäÊó∂ÂΩìÂãâÂä±ÔºåÂ≤ÅÊúà‰∏çÂæÖ‰∫∫„ÄÇ\\" School compound The Principal of the school is Mr Tai Chen Kiun. History In 1918,some local merchants with the co-operation of the local Chinese set up a primary school named Chong Cheng Primary School (now known as Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (Cina) Seg Hwa, Chinese:ÊòîÂçéÂõΩÊ∞ëÂûãÂçéÊñáÂ∞èÂ≠¶) along Jalan Mentol, Segamat. With financial contributions from the local Chinese merchants, a new building with eight classrooms was constructed in 1936. After the Second World War, the school was renamed \\"Hwa Chiao Primary and Secondary School\\" (Sekolah Menengah Rendah Hwa Chiao) with the establishment of a secondary school section. Due to the increasing student population, a new block of 10 classrooms was put up in 1950. However, it did not solve the shortage of classrooms. The Board of Governors of the school set up a building committee in 1954 with the assistance of the Association of Rubber Merchants. The Building Committee proposed an alternative site for construction of the secondary school building. With the assistance of the then local assemblyman, YB Tuan Haji Noor, the school successfully applied for a piece of land approximately near Bukit Hampar (where the school is now situated) from the Government of Johor. A new block of 16 classrooms was constructed at the new site. The secondary school was officially separated from Hwa Chiao Primary and Secondary School and named as Sekolah Menengah Hwa Chiao, Bukit Hampar (Tahang Rimau). The primary school remains at Jalan Mentol. The first school session at the new site started in 1957. SMJK Seg Hwa Change of Name From the establishment until 1957, the school was running with private funding and donations from the locals. With the independence of the Federation of Malaya and in line with national policy, the Board of Governors agreed to accept the government funding and assistant for the administration of the school. It was renamed Hwa Chiao National Type Secondary School (Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan Hwa Chiao) with the appointment of Mr Tseng Hsi Kuei as Principal. Due to the shortage of classrooms, the school operated in two sessions per day i.e. morning for upper secondary and afternoon for lower secondary from 1959. In 1963 the Board of Governors of the school felt that the name \\"Hwa Chiao\\" was no longer appropriate as it carries the meaning of \\"Chinese abroad\\" while most of the Chinese in Malaya has been granted citizenship. The school was renamed \\"Seg Hwa National Type Secondary School\\" (Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan Seg Hwa). \\"Seg Hwa\\" means \\"the Chinese of Segamat\\".

The Fifth form students take Malaysian Certificate of Education examinations at the end of the year. =Sixth Form (Pre-University)= Sekolah Menengah Seg Hwa started its pre-university class (Science stream) in 2006. However, only two class was allocated; one upper six and the other lower six by the Education Department. The Sixth Formers (Pre-University) will have to study one and a half years before taking Malaysian Higher School Certificate examinations. All sixth formers are members of the Pre-University Student Representatives Council (Malay: Majlis Perwakilan Pelajar-Pelajar Pra- Universiti). Its main annual activities include orientation week for new Lower Sixth formers, field trip, graduation night and other co-curricular activities. Co-curricular activities All the students are required to join a Uniform Unit, Clubs and Societies as well as Sports and Games. The co- curricular marks will be given to all students in the end of year. The co- curricular marks is important for Fifth Form and Upper Sixth Form students as required for the consideration by the Ministry of Education, Higher Ministry of Education and Public Service Department for applying government scholarships or public universities. School facilities =Sports stadia= Festing stadium In 1959, the then principal Mr Tseng Hsi Kuei with the assistance of his former colleague General Festing, cleared of unused land of the school and converted the same into a sport stadium. The stadium was named after the General as \\"Festing Stadium\\". The stadium is now being used as football field. Woo Seng Hwa Sports Stadium In 2006, with the assistance of the Chinese community in the district of Segamat, a sports stadium is being constructed. This stadium is used as badminton courts, exhibition halls and other purposes. This stadium is named after the former Principal of the school Mr Woo Seng Hwa. =Libraries= The old library, named \\"Woo Seng Hwa Library\\", is now for lower form secondary students usage.

Its format is primarily Dance music, with occasional Spanish language and Christian music programming. The station is a one-man operation, as its Program Director and DJ, James Dispoto, aka \\"DJ New York\\", runs the station from his parents' home in Ocala. FCC regulations limit non-commercial radio certificates to educational or non-profit entities; the operating certificate is actually held by Primeria Inglesia Bautista Hispanic Association, a group in the Ocala area. The station's location and broadcasting tower were a source of conflict between Marion County officials and Dispoto's family. The county shut down the station in the fall of 2003, citing zoning laws that prohibited the operation of a radio station in a residential neighborhood and restricted the height of any towers to 50 feet; the tower was approximately 100 feet tall. An engineer working with the Dispotos noted that James Dispoto's mother, Elaine, possesses an amateur radio operator license, and that the Federal Communications Commission requires communities to reasonably accommodate amateur radio operators. The county's response was that the station failed to secure a permit to construct the tower, and in any case, the tower was higher than required for amateur use. In November 2004, the Marion County Commission agreed to let the station continue operating from the Dispoto home as long as the transmitter was moved out of the neighborhood. A compromise was reached in which the transmitter would be moved a short distance away, to an existing tower at a landfill owned by the county.

Looming occurs when an object begins moving closer to the eye, this gives the illusion that the object is expanding in size. As the image becomes increasingly larger on the perceiver's retina, i.e., when an object looms, there is an automatic physiological response to perceive the object as an approaching object or surface, instead of one that is stationary or receding.Gibson, J. J. (2014). The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception: Classic Edition. Psychology Press. Evidence indicates that looming perception is not limited to the visual modality, but can occur due to auditory or even tactile stimuli.Gray, R. (2011).

This design has been widely used in Japan for a long time. The design of the Rising Sun Flag is seen in numerous scenes in daily life of Japan, such as in fishermen's banners hoisted to signify large catch of fish, flags to celebrate childbirth, and in flags for seasonal festivities. It was originally used by feudal warlords in Japan during the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868 CE). On May 15, 1870, as a policy of the Meiji government, it was adopted as the war flag of the Imperial Japanese Army, and on October 7, 1889, it was adopted as the naval ensign of the Imperial Japanese Navy. A modified flag is flown by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and a different version is flown by the Japan Self-Defense Forces and the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force.  History and design  25px War flag of the Imperial Japanese Army (1870‚Äì1945) 25px Naval ensign, flown by ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy (1889‚Äì1945). Flag ratio: 2:3. The flag of Japan and the rising Sun had symbolic meaning since the early 7th century in the Asuka period (538‚Äì710 CE). The Japanese archipelago is east of the Asian mainland, and is thus where the Sun \\"rises\\". In 607 CE, an official correspondence that began with \\"from the Emperor of the rising sun\\" was sent to Chinese Emperor Yang of Sui. Japan is often referred to as \\"the land of the rising sun\\". In the 12th-century work, The Tale of the Heike, it was written that different samurai carried drawings of the Sun on their fans. The Japanese word for Japan is , which is pronounced Nihon or Nippon and literally means \\"the origin of the sun\\". The character means \\"sun\\" or \\"day\\"; means \\"base\\" or \\"origin\\". The compound therefore means \\"origin of the sun\\" and is the source of the popular Western epithet \\"Land of the Rising Sun\\". The red disc symbolizes the Sun and the red lines are light rays shining from the rising sun. The design of the Rising Sun Flag (Asahi) has been widely used since ancient times, and a part of it was called \\"Hiashi\\" (Êó•Ë∂≥, „Å≤„ÅÇ„Åó) and used as the samurai's crest (\\"Hiashimon\\", Êó•Ë∂≥Á¥ã).Êí≠Á£®Â±ã.com Êó•Ë∂≥Á¥ãÁ´†ÂÆ∂Á¥ã„ÅÆÁî±Êù• The flag was especially used by samurai in the Kyushu region. Examples include the \\"Twelve-day legs\\" (Â§â„Çè„ÇäÂçÅ‰∫åÊó•Ë∂≥) of the Ry≈´z≈çji clan (1186‚Äì1607 CE) in Hizen Province and the Kusano clan (ËçâÈáéÊ∞è) in Chikugo Province and the \\"eight-day legs\\" (ÂÖ´„Å§Êó•Ë∂≥Á¥ã) of the Kikuchi clan (1070‚Äì1554 CE) in Higo Province. There is a theory that in many parts of the Kyushu region, Hizen and Higo are related to what was called \\"the country of Japan (Hi)\\".Ë¶ãËÅûË´∏ÂÆ∂Á¥ãNote: in modern times, it is also used as a simple pattern, for example, Yurikamome Inc. (company), Hinode Station pattern. There have been many types of Asahi flags since ancient times, and the design in which light rays spread in all directions without clouds expresses Halle, and was a design that was used for emphasizing the goodness of the economy, festiveness, and the good economy at the time of Keiji etc.ÈüìÂõΩ‰∏ñË´ñ„ÄåÊó≠Êó•Êóó„Å®„Éä„ÉÅ„ÇπÂÖöÊóó„ÇíÂêå‰∏ÄË¶ñ„Äç„ÅÆÂ§ß„ÅÑ„Å™„ÇãË™§Ëß£ „Çµ„Éº„ÉÅ„Éä 2013Âπ¥4Êúà16Êó•‰∏≠ÂõΩ„Å´„Åä„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÇÇ„ÄÅÂ∫ÉÊù±Ë™û„ÅßÈÄöÂãù„Å®Áß∞„Åï„Çå„Çã‰∏≠ÂõΩÂè§Êù•„ÅÆÈªÑÊö¶„Å´„ÅØ„ÄÅÂè§„Åè„Åã„ÇâÊò•ÁâõÂõ≥„ÅåÊèè„Åã„Çå„Å¶„Åä„Çä„ÄÅ„Åù„ÅÆÂõ≥‰∏≠„ÅÆÊó•„ÅÆÊÑèÂå†„ÅØÊó•Êú¨„ÅÆÊó≠Êó•„Å´È°û‰ºº„Åó„Å¶„ÅÑ„ÅüÔºàË±ä‰ΩúÁ•àÈ°òÔºâËäíÁ•ûÊò•ÁâõÂúñ A well-known variant of the flag of the sun disc design is the sun disc with 16 red rays in a Siemens star formation. The has been used as a traditional national symbol of Japan since at least the Edo period (1603 CE). It is featured in antique artwork such as ukiyo-e prints through history, such as the Lucky Gods' visit to Enoshima, ukiyo-e print by Utagawa Yoshiiku in 1869 and One Hundred Views of Osaka, Three Great Bridges, ukiyo-e print by Utagawa Kunikazu in 1854. The Fujiyama Tea Co. used it as a wooden box label of Japanese tea (green tea) for export in the Meiji period / Taisho period (1880s). It was historically used by the daimy≈ç (Â§ßÂêç) and Japan's military, particularly the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ensign, known in Japanese as the , was first adopted as the war flag on May 15, 1870, and was used until the end of World War II in 1945. It was re- adopted on June 30, 1954, and is now used by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and Japan Ground Self- Defense Force (JGSDF) use a variation of the Rising Sun Flag with red, white and gold colors. The design is similar to the flag of Japan, which has a red circle in the center signifying the Sun. The difference compared to the flag of Japan is that the Rising Sun Flag has extra sun rays (16 for the ensign) exemplifying the name of Japan as \\"The Land of the Rising Sun\\". The Imperial Japanese Army first adopted the Rising Sun Flag in 1870. The Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy both had a version of the flag; the naval ensign was off-set, with the red sun closer to the lanyard side, while the army's version (which was part of the regimental colors) was centered. The flags were used until Japan's surrender in World War II during August 1945. After the establishment of the Japan Self-Defense Forces in 1954, the off-set Rising Sun Flag was re-adopted for the JMSDF and a new 8-rays Rising Sun Flag with a yellow border for the JGSDF and JSDF was approved by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP/GHQ). The flag with the off-set sun and 16 rays is the ensign of the Maritime Self-Defense Force, but it was modified with a different color red. The old flag is darker red (RGB #b12d3d) and the post-WW2 modified version is brighter red (RGB #bd0029). The Imperial Japanese Army flag with symmetrical 16 rays and a 2:3 ratio was abolished. The Japan Self-Defense Forces and the Ground Self-Defense Force use a significantly different Rising Sun Flag with 8-rays and an 8:9 ratio. The edges of the rays are asymmetrical since they form angles 19, 21, 26 and 24 degrees. It also has indentations for the yellow (golden) irregular triangles along borders. The JSDF Rising Sun Flag was adopted by a law/order/decree published in the Official Gazette of June 30, 1954. Regardless of the military flag, before the Meiji period, the design of Asahi was used for prayers, festivals, celebration events, reconstruction, logos of companies and products, big catch flags (Tairy≈ç-bata), corporate and product logos and sports.  Present-day use  25px The Japanese naval ensign, which is flown by ships of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (established in 1954). It uses a 2:3 ratio. 25px The flag of the Japan Self-Defense Forces and the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (established in 1954) Commercially the Rising Sun Flag is used on many products, designs, clothing, posters, beer cans (Asahi Breweries), newspapers (Asahi Shimbun), bands, manga, comics (e.g., Fantastic Four/Iron Man: Big in Japan, June 2006), anime, movies, video games (e.g., E. Honda's stage of Street Fighter II), etc. The Rising Sun Flag appears on commercial product labels, such as on the cans of one variety of Asahi Breweries lager beer. The design is also incorporated into the logo of the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun. Among fishermen, the represents their hope for a good catch of fish. Today it is used as a decorative flag on vessels as well as for festivals and events. The Rising Sun Flag is used at sporting events by the supporters of Japanese teams and individual athletes as well as by non-Japanese. Since June 30, 1954, the Rising Sun Flag has been the war flag and naval ensign of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). JSDF Chief of Staff Katsutoshi Kawano said the Rising Sun Flag is the Maritime Self-Defense Force sailors' \\"pride\\". The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) and the Japan Ground Self- Defense Force (JGSDF) use the Rising Sun Flag with eight red rays extending outward, called . A gold border lies partially around the edge. The flag is also used by non-Japanese, for example, in the emblems of some U.S. military units based in Japan, and by the American blues rock band Hot Tuna, on the cover of its album Live in Japan. It is used as an emblem of the United States Fleet Activities Sasebo, as a patch of the Strike Fighter Squadron 94, a mural at Misawa Air Base, the former insignia of Strike Fighter Squadron 192 and Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System with patches of the 14th Fighter Squadron. Some extreme right-wing groups display it at political protests. = Controversy = As the flag was used by the Imperial Japanese military during Japan's actions during World War II, it is regarded as offensive by some in East Asia, particularly in South Koreahttp://www.manilastandard.net/news/national/333757/-rising-sun-art-sets- off-bashing.htmlhttp://www.gmanetwork.com/news/hashtag/content/754837/here-s- why-cancelkorea-is-trending-on-twitter/story/ (which was ruled by Japan) and China. This symbol is often associated with Japanese imperialism in the early 20th century in these two countries. South Korea hosted an international fleet review at Jeju Island from October 10 to 14, 2018. South Korea requested all participating countries to display only their national flags and the South Korean flag on their vessels. Japan balked at the demand, with the then- Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera, since replaced, claiming the display of the Rising Sun Flag should be mandatory under Japanese law. South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha urged Japan to be more considerate about Japan's former rule of the Korean Peninsula and stated that her ministry will review \\"possible and appropriate options\\" before deciding to take stronger international actions when asked whether South Korea could raise the issue with the United Nations. Japan announced on October 5, 2018, that it will be withdrawing from the fleet review because it could not accept Seoul's request to remove the Rising Sun Flag. The Defense Minister notified the South Korean government of its decision. Both nations reiterated the need for continued defense cooperation. When the JMSDF was established in 1954, it adopted the Rising Sun Flag (Kyokujitsu-ki) as its ensign to show the nationality of its ships. It was approved by GHQ/SCAP. On September 28, 2018, an official of Japan's Ministry of Defense said that the South Korean navy's request lacks common sense and that they would not partake in a fleet review, since no country would follow such a request. On October 6, 2018, JSDF Chief of Staff Katsutoshi Kawano said the Rising Sun Flag is the Maritime Self-Defense Force sailors' \\"pride\\" and that the JMSDF would absolutely not go if they had to remove the flag.https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east- asia/article/2167441/japan-pulls-out-south-korea-naval-drills-over-demands-it- remove Critic Katsumi Murotani, a correspondent of the Jiji Newsletter Seoul in the 1980s, stated that the Rising Sun Flag was not criticized until recently in South Korea.‚ÄòÏòÅÍµ≠ÏóêÏÑúÎèÑ Ïö±ÏùºÍ∏∞Í∞Ä?‚Äô Êó•, Ïö±ÏùºÍ∏∞ ÌùîÎì† ÏÇ¨Î°ÄÎ≥¥Îãà‚Ä¶ÏùºÍ∞ÑÏä§Ìè¨Ï∏† ‰∏≠Â§ÆÊó•Â†± 2013Âπ¥7Êúà31Êó•„ÄåÊó•Êú¨„ÅØÊÑèÂë≥ÂàÜ„Åã„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Äç Êó≠Êó•Êóó‰ΩøÁî®„ÅßÈüìÂõΩÂ§ñÂãôÁúÅ ÂÖ±ÂêåÈÄö‰ø° 2013Âπ¥8Êúà2Êó• South Korea did not object to Japan's adoption of the Rising Sun Flag for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force in 1952, nor to the entry into South Korean ports Japanese warships flying the flag on a warship at the 1998 and 2008 navy fleet review held in South Korea. South Korean campaigns against the Rising Sun Flag began in 2011 when a South Korean footballer Ki Sung-yueng was accused of making a racist gesture, which he defended claiming he was annoyed at having seen a Rising Sun Flag in the stadium. In 2012, South Koreans who disapproved of the flag began to refer to it as a \\"war crime flag\\". The Sankei Shimbun criticized South Korea's attitude toward the Rising Sun Flag, stating that even the United States, who was Japan's opponent during World War II, has not protested formally against the Rising Sun Flag.ÈüìÂõΩ„ÅÆÂèçÊó•„Åã„ÇâÊó≠Êó•Êóó„ÅÆÂêçË™â„ÇíÂÆà„Çå ÔºàÁ¨¨‰∏âÊÆµ ÂõΩÈöõÁ§æ‰ºö„ÅØÂèó„ÅëÂÖ•„ÇåÔºâ Áî£ÁµåÊñ∞ËÅû 2013Âπ¥8Êúà3Êó• The president of the Sankei Shimbun Minagawa Hoshi said the corporate logo flag of the Rising Sun Flag design of the Asahi Shimbun, which is praised for being conscientious in South Korea, never had any such issues. On August 19, 2019, the American model and singer Charlotte Kemp Muhl uploaded a photo wearing a T-shirt design with the Rising Sun Flag on Instagram. She was criticized for this by Korean Internet commenters, who compared the flag's symbolic significance to that of the German Nazi flag. Muhl responded that the flag \\"was first used by the Japanese during the Meiji era...before the Korean colonial rule,\\" and therefore its usage should not necessarily be interpreted as indicating support of Imperial Japan or its rule over Korea. Sean Lennon, Muhl's romantic partner (and son of John Lennon), defended her use of the symbol, stating: ‚ÄúYou have to be free to use symbolic things.\\"2019Âπ¥8Êúà23Êó• „É¨„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„ÉÅ„É£„Ç§„Éä Êó≠Êó•ÊóóT„Ç∑„É£„ÉÑ„ÇíÁùÄ„ÅüÁ±≥„É¢„Éá„É´„ÄÅÈüìÂõΩ‰∫∫„Åã„Çâ„ÅÆÊåáÊëò„Çí‰∏ÄËπ¥„ÄåÈÄÄÂ±à„ÅßËôö„Åó„ÅÑË´ñ‰∫â„Äç2019Âπ¥8Êúà22Êó• SBS„Éã„É•„Éº„Çπ Á±≥ÂõΩ„ÅÆ„É¢„Éá„É´„ÄÅÊà¶ÁäØÊóó„ÅÆT„Ç∑„É£„ÉÑ„ÇíÁùÄ„Å¶„Éç„ÉÅ„Ç∫„É≥„Å®„ÄåËàåÊà¶„Äç(ÈüìÂõΩË™û) The South Korean parliamentary committee for sports asked the organizers of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo to ban the Rising Sun Flag.

In September 2019, the Chinese Civil Association for Claiming Compensation from Japan sent a letter to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban the flag. According to the Associated Press, the IOC confirmed the receipt of the letter and said in a statement \\"sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case by case basis.\\" The Japanese government's basic position on the Rising Sun Flag is that \\"Claims that the flag is an expression of political assertions or a symbol of militarism are absolutely false.\\"  Examples of the Rising Sun design in use  = Art = File:Jiraiya,-Sunrise-and-Boat-by-Utagawa-Kunisada-1852.pngJiraiya, Sunrise and Boat, Ukiyo-e by Utagawa Kunisada (1852).

The palace was constructed between 1899 and 1901 by Maharaja Radha Kishore Manikya Debbarma and stands on the banks of two lakes surrounded by gardens inspired by the Mughal style . It was the home of the ruling Manikya dynasty until Tripura's merger into India in October 1949. The palace was purchased from the royal family by the Government of Tripura in 1972‚Äì73 for Rs. 2.5 million, and used to house the State Legislative Assembly until July 2011. Ujjayanta Palace is now a State Museum and it primarily showcases the lifestyle, arts, culture, tradition and utility crafts of communities residing in northeast India, along with a lot of stone sculptures, coinage of the Manikya dynasty and some other artefacts.  History  Tripura claims to be one of the oldest princely states of ancient India. The royal line of Tripura began during the reign of Maharaja Maha Manikya, who was crowned in 1400 AD, and was the first ruler under the royal title of Manikya. Ujjayanta Palace was built in 1862, away from Agartala, by King Ishan Chandra Manikya (1849‚Äì1862). It was devastated by the Assam earthquake of 12 June 1897. The palace was rebuilt in the heart of Agartala city by Maharaja Radha Kishore Manikya in 1899‚Äì1901, at a cost of 10 lakh (1 million) rupees. It was built by Martin and Burn Co., and served as the model of the Maharajah's palace in Tintin and the Cigars of the Pharaoh. Main promenade leading to the palace =As state assembly building= Upon the merger of the Kingdom of Tripura with India in 1949, royal properties were nationalised. The main building along with the area around the palace was purchased from the royal family by the Tripura government in 1972‚Äì73. It housed the Tripura Legislative Assembly until July 2011 when the assembly moved to a new location north of Agartala. =As state museum= The museum was given seismic retrofitting to prevent possible earthquake damage, and the museum was inaugurated by the Vice-President of India Mohammad Hamid Ansari on 25 September 2013. Early in the museum's history, controversy erupted over the state government's proposed move to change the name of Ujjayanta Palace to Tripura State Museum. The Indigenous Nationalist Party of Twipra (INPT) has written to Vice-President, Hamid Ansari, protesting that the name of the museum should reflect the history and heritage of the region. Pradyut Bikram Kishore Debbarma, the titular king of Tripura said, \\"The palace is a historical spot. It doesn‚Äôt belong to the members of the erstwhile royal family alone, neither does it solely belongs to the government. It belongs to Tripura and somebody in the government can‚Äôt suddenly impose a decision to change its name\\". The government decided to keep the original name of Ujjayanta Palace and to build a statue of Maharaj Radha Kishore Manikya on the museum premises. A panoramic view of the palace.  Design  The Ujjayanta Palace compound covers an area of approximately and includes public rooms such as the throne room, durbar hall, library and reception hall. The buildings and grounds cover in the heart of Agartala. The neoclassical palace was designed by Sir Alexander Martin of the Martin and Burn Company. The two-storied palace has three large domes, the largest of which is high, and which rests atop a four-storied central tower. The architecture shows a mix of influences: Mughal, Roman and British There are two large artificial ponds on either side of the garden which is decorated with pools and fountains. Several Hindu temples occupy plots adjacent to Ujjayanta Palace, dedicated to Lakshmi Narayan, Uma-Maheshwari, Durga and Jagannath.

Digital X-ray radiogrammetry is based on the old technique of radiogrammetry. In DXR, the cortical thickness of the three middle metacarpal bones of the hand is measured in a digital X-ray image. Through a geometrical operation the thickness is converted to bone mineral density. The BMD is corrected for porosity of the bone, estimated by a texture analysis performed on the cortical part of the bone. Like other technologies for estimating the bone mineral density, the outputs are an areal BMD value, a T-score and a Z-score for assessing osteoporosis and the risk of bone fracture. Digital X-ray radiogrammetry is primarily used in combination with digital mammography for osteoporosis screening, where same mammography machine that is used to acquire breast X-ray images is also used to acquire a hand image for BMD measurement.

He was the 23rd of the dynasty, the son and successor of Kurigalzu II, and reigned for twenty six years.According to the Kinglist A tablet, BM 33332, column 2, line 2, in the British Museum. His reign can be seen as the peak of the Kassite Dynasty's prominence and subsequently Kassite culture declined, exemplified by his successful military campaigns against Assyria and Elam, the glyptic style of cylinder seals, the literature inspired by him (Hemerology for Nazi-Marutta≈°) and his appearance in the period piece Ludlul bƒìl nƒìmeqi, which was set during his reign. Conflict with Assyria Nazi-Marutta≈° faced a growing threat from the ascendancy of Assyria under Arik-den-ili and his successor Adad-Nƒ´rƒÅri I. The containment of Assyria was conducted through a strategy of flank attacks supported by his agents, eastern hillmen such as the Gutians, in a protracted war, avoiding a full frontal assault. Under Arik-den- ili, he seems to have had the upper hand, because Adad-Nƒ´rƒÅri, who styles himself \\"King of the Universe\\", later recountsIn the Epic of Adad-NƒÅrƒÅri, tablet VAT 9820 line 12: hi-ib-lat um-ma-ni MAN KUR ka.-.i-i a-bi ul ul- te-.√®r. that \\"my father could not rectify the calamities inflicted by the army of the king of the Kassite land\\" in a contemporary Assyrian epic.

However, the Assyrians won a complete victory over the Babylonians in this battle, plundering their camp and seizing the royal standards, thereby acquiring territory from them and causing the Assyro-Babylonian boundary to be adjusted southward. The conflict is fondly remembered in the Tukulti-Ninurta Epic,Tukulti-Ninurta Epic, extant in fragments BM 98496, BM 98730, BM 98731, BM 121033. in its recounting of past Assyro-Babylonian conflicts, where he says, \\"And like Adad - I will send a devastating flood upon your camp!\\" column 4, line 34.

A standard real estate transaction usually begins when a prospective purchaser submits an offer to purchase to the vendor of a property. As in a standard offer, a conditional offer sets out the terms of the sale such as the purchase price, the date of closing, the names of the parties, and the amount of any required deposit, but it also stipulates various conditions which must be met in order for the contract to be binding on the parties. These conditions may include approval by a co-purchaser, financing acceptable to the purchaser, the receipt and review of a survey showing that the buildings on the property comply with local zoning regulations, a title search showing no unacceptable liens or encumbrances, confirmation from the current mortgagee that the property is not in foreclosure, and the like. If the offer is accepted by the vendor, the offer to purchase will become a contract binding on the parties when all conditions are satisfied. An alternative to a conditional sale is an invitation to treat. Unlike a conditional sale, an invitation to treat does not become binding upon satisfaction of any conditions.

It is the 54th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are Click, Clack and Cluck, paparazzi-like photographers working for Whack Magazine (\\"If it's a good picture, it's out of Whack!\\"). After failing in their attempts to get a photo of movie star Percival De Puyster and his new bride, their boss Mr. Wilson (Vernon Dent) fires them. But Wilson changes his mind and instead sends the Stooges to Vulgaria (an obvious parody of Bulgaria) for their next job, knowing full well that taking pictures in Vulgaria is against the law and punishable by death. The inept trio arrive and inadvertently let another photographer who was to be shot escape. The Stooges themselves try to escape but end up running into a Vulgarian prison. As the firing squad is setting up for the Stooges' execution, Curly requests one last smoke, leading to him pulling out a cigar the length of a hero sandwich. After he finishes it, the firing squad open fire, but the trio run off with their heads inside their shirts. Three Vulgarian officers watch a demonstration of their country's new ray gun which can fire other guns remotely. When they hear of the Stooges' escape, they leave the officer's office. The Stooges soon arrive in the office and discover the ray gun, which they think is a new camera. But when Moe and Larry pose in front of the gun, Curly manages to shoot their belts and hats off. The Stooges hide as they hear the officers returning, with Curly taking refuge inside the radio, destroying the wiring in the process. When the officers try to turn on the radio, Curly pulls out a large harmonica and begins playing, while strumming the remaining wires like a harp and banging inside the radio with xylophone mallets. The officers discover Curly, who jumps out of a window to escape. Moe and Larry trap the officers' heads in the window while Curly hits the officers in the head with his mallets. The Stooges are now dressed in the Vulgarian officers' uniforms and end up in a local cafe, in which Curly pits his wits against a strong drink, and then a defiant oyster in his stew. When the oyster works Curly's last nerve, he pulls out his gun and fires at it repeatedly. This gets the attention of the guards, who promptly capture the Stooges and literally carry them off, upside down, on the bayonets of their guns. Production notes Filmed on August 1-5, 1940, the film title is a play on \\"beautiful but dumb.\\" This episode also marks the final appearance of long time regular, the late James Morton, who passed away one year later, in 1942. An adaptation of the oyster soup battle is featured in The Three Stooges video game, where players control Curly who attempts to pick up and eat as many crackers from the oyster soup as possible before the oysters do. Oysters occasionally fire soup at Curly. The gag was later performed by Moe in 1948's Shivering Sherlocks and Larry who fights the Lobster Gumbo in 1954's Income Tax Sappy. The gag also appears in the 1945 Abbott and Costello film, Here Come the Co-Eds.

Algeria had long been a colony of the French and saw other colonized nations gaining their independence, mainly from Great Britain. This among other factors led to a war that included acts of brutality, torture and guerrilla warfare. The end result was an independent Algeria but a tremendous amount of hostility remaining between the two nations. What added insult to injury for French citizens was at the end of the decade when migrants from Algeria began to migrate north and settle in the French countryside. Choosing Martel as the namesake of the radical group stems from his successful defense of the then Frankish Kingdom over a thousand years prior. There have been other groups with similar interests to that of the Charles Martel Group in and outside France. A terrorist organization targeting the French government for supporting the Algerian independence movement popped up using a similar name in the 1960s before the radical group came together. This original group never got around to acts of violence. A Charles Martel Society has formed in America with some radical overtones, but it too seems to be a non-violent group. Attacks * 14 December 1973 - Bomb attack on the Algerian consulate offices in Marseilles. Four Algerians were killed and 20 injured. Historians differ on when the group actually formed. Some do not credit the first attack to this group as they have the group coming together in 1975. However, since this attack targeted Algerian offices and killed Algerian migrants it is associated with the group. * 2 March 1975 - Bomb attacks on the Air Alg√©rie offices in Toulouse and Lyon. No one was hurt. These were two separate attacks on the same day, yet it appears they were done more as a scare tactic as nobody was injured in either attack. This gives merit to the argument that the first attack years earlier was an independent group. Bombing the offices of the major airline of Algeria would seem to infer that the next step would be a hijacking or bombing of an actual airline. * 10 April 1975 - Car bomb explodes outside the Algerian consulate in Paris. No one was hurt. Claimed by the Charles Martel group as a protest against the French President's visit to Algeria. An openly admitted attack by the group. For the first time since granting Algeria their independence, the French head of state, at this time Valery Giscard-d'Estaing, was making a visit to the former colony. Relations had not been going well and the Algerians were upset at many things, including prior terror attacks, The French president made a bold move by going. This outraged the radicals and led to a minor incident. * 1 November 1977 - Two Algerians kidnapped in Paris. Claimed as a reprisal for the kidnapping of two French nationals in Mauritania the previous month by the Algerian-backed Polisario Front. Mauritania was another former French colony who was now involved in a war of their own with other African factions including the radical group known as the Polisario Front. The French were giving aid to their former colony in the form of weapons and other resources. Then two French men working in the mining industry in Mauritania were killed and another six were kidnapped. The Charles Martel Group acted quickly after this but showed some restraint by sparing the lives of the two men they kidnapped. * 7 May 1980 - Bombing of the North African Moslem Students Association. No one was hurt. Little is known about this act. Primarily because nobody was injured once again. It had also been well over two years since the previous attack, it was possible that some of the resentment was starting to fade. * 11 May 1980 - Algerian consulate in Aubervilliers bombed. No one was hurt. A handwritten leaflet was left claiming responsibility, and stating that the Charles Martel Group was \\"against the church, the Jews, the starving of the Third World, and for the white race\\". This attack came less than a week after the previous bombing but once again failed to injure anyone. It is difficult to know the exact times of the attacks, but it is likely that there was intent to not harm anyone during most of these attacks. The intent was to leave a message and in this case that was done literally. * 9 August 1983 - Bomb attack on the Air Alg√©rie office in Marseilles. No one was hurt. This was seemingly the final act by the Charles Martel Group. If the first bombing is discounted, and to some it was not the work of the group, then this group's actions have a symmetrical irony. It started and ended with a bombing of an Air Algerie office in different parts of France. Several more bombings occurred in between, but with no casualties. * January 1987 - Attack on the offices of the magazine Jeune Afrique in Paris.

He became a leading man in the King's Men, the company of William Shakespeare and Richard Burbage, in the final phase of its existence. Career Swanston started his acting career with Prince Charles's Men around 1620. In 1622 he moved to the Lady Elizabeth's Men, and two years later transferred to the King's Men. He may have been brought into that company to replace the veteran John Underwood, who died in 1624. By 1631 he had acquired a role in the management of the company, along with Joseph Taylor and John Lowin; the three men received the company's payments for their performances at Court. In some cases, Swanston was the sole payee for the King's Men's Court performances; he received sums of ¬£120 (February 1632), ¬£270 (March 1633), and ¬£220 (April 1634), and other amounts, in trust for the company.Gurr, Shakespeare Company, pp. 242-3. Being a leader was not wholly positive: on 24 October 1633, Swanston and Lowin had to apologize to Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, for performing a play without Herbert's approval. Swanston gradually came to play some of the leading Shakespearean roles in revivals, including the title parts in Othello and Richard III. In the late 1630s he played the title character in George Chapman's Bussy D'Ambois, after the previous actor in the role, Taylor, had grown too \\"grey\\" for the role of a young firebrand. Swanston also originated some of the leading roles in the company's productions of Philip Massinger's plays. He played the role of Lugier, \\"the rough and confident tutor to the ladies,\\" in a 1632 revival of Fletcher's The Wild Goose Chase. He was Melantius in revivals of The Maid's Tragedy, and may have played the lead in Philaster. He played Aretine the spy in The Roman Actor, and had roles in other Massinger plays, The Picture and Believe as You List; he played the young lover Alcidonus in Arthur Wilson's The Swisser (1631).Gurr, Shakespeare Company, p. 242. (The scholar T. W. Baldwin developed a theory that the King's Men had specific actors for specific stock roles: Burbage and his successor Taylor specialized in \\"hero\\" parts, John Lowin in \\"tyrant\\" parts, Robert Benfield in \\"dignitary\\" parts, and the like. In Baldwin's scheme  which has left many other scholars unconvinced  Swanston specialized in \\"smooth villain\\" roles.)Baldwin, Organisation and Personnel of the Shakespeare Company. Controversy In the mid-1630s Swanston became involved in a major controversy within the King's Men. In the 1633-35 period, comedian John Shank purchased three shares in the Globe Theatre and two in the Blackfriars Theatre from William Heminges, the son and heir of John Heminges. Swanston at the time was a sharer in the acting company, but not in either of the company's theatres, which were separately organized. Swanston and two other men in the same situation, Robert Benfield and Thomas Pollard, petitioned the Lord Chamberlain, Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, for the right to purchase lucrative theatre shares from Shanks and the Burbage family (Cuthbert Burbage and Winifred Robinson, Richard Burbage's widow). Pembroke ruled in their favor, and Shank and the Burbages protested. The affair generated a supply of documents, sometimes called the \\"sharers' papers,\\" that throw light on the theatre conditions of the era.Halliday, p. 449. Shanks, for example, asserted that each of the three petitioners, as a sharer in the company, had an annual income of ¬£180, a very comfortable living for that era. The Burbages and Shank also complained that Swanston owned a third of one of the eight shares in the Blackfriars, and so wasn't entirely excluded from the householders' profits. The disagreement was not fatal for Swanston's credit in the troupe, by any means: on 5 June 1638, Swanston alone signed for a payment of ¬£240 for the company's Court performancesGurr, Shakespeare Company, p. 243. (though by then both Shanks and Cuthbert Burbage were dead). Aftermath After the theatres closed in 1642 at the start of the English Civil War, Swanston became a jeweller and also a Presbyterian. Unusually for a professional actor, he was a supporter of the Parliamentary cause. (Since the Puritans were hostile to the theatre, most men of the theatre tended to be hostile to them in return.) Swanston did not sever all his connections with his former occupation, however: he was one of the ten King's Men who signed the dedication of the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio in 1647 (he was the third to sign, after Taylor and Lowin). Swanston lived in the parish of St. Mary's Aldermanbury; he married in 1619, and fathered ten children. Notes References * Aaron, Melissa D.

It is a concrete gravity dam, 45 meters high and 393 meters long, generating 60 MW of power with an installed capacity of 3 units of 33 MW. Its construction was completed in 1972. The total catchment area of the dam is 27,195 km2, of which only 1,496 km2 are in Rajasthan. The free catchment area below Rana Pratap Sagar dam is 2,331 km2.Chambal River The dam is located after the Gandhi Sagar Dam and Rana Pratap Sagar Dam, but before the Kota Barrage. Geography The Chambal River (known in ancient times as the Chamranyavati River) raises in the Vindhya Range at an elevation of , west-southwest of the town of Mhow, near Indore. It flows north-northeast through Madhya Pradesh, runs for a time through Rajasthan, then forms the boundary between Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh before turning southeast to join the Yamuna River in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Its total length from its source to its confluence with the Yamuna River is . The Chambal and its tributaries drain the Malwa region of northwestern Madhya Pradesh, while its tributary, the Banas, which rises in the Aravalli Range, drains southeastern Rajasthan. At its confluence with the Yamuna, the Chambal joins four other rivers ‚Äì the Yamuna, Kwari, Sind, and Pahuj ‚Äì at Pachnada near Bhareh in Uttar Pradesh, at the border of the Bhind and Etawah districts. The river is drained by a rain-fed catchment area with an average annual rainfall of , a temperature range of between and , and a relative humidity ranging from 30% to 90%. Between and from the Chambal's source is an area of deep gorges; the Gandhi Sagar Dam is located in the middle reach of this gorge section. The dam is situated at a distance of from the district administrative headquarters of Mandsaur. Construction History The power station on the right bank of the Gandhi Sagar dam and the downstream bridge across the Chambal River. The Chambal River Valley Development marked one of the landmark actions of the First Five-Year Plan launched by the Government of India in 1951, after India attained independence in August 1947. The Chambal River had not until then been used for any major developmental works, and was proposed to be developed under a joint initiative of the state governments of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The three-stage proposal, drawn up in 1953, called for three dams to provide hydroelectric power generation, and a downstream barrage to use stored waters released from the upstream dams for irrigation. The river's drop of between its source in Mhow and the city of Kota, which marks the exit of the river from its gorge section into the plains of Rajasthan, was seen as having great hydroelectric potential. =Stage I= The first stage of the development involved construction of the Gandhi Sagar Dam to a height of a as a storage dam to store 7,322,000,000 cubic metres in Madhya Pradesh and use the stored water for hydroelectric power generation, followed by irrigation from the Kota Barrage in Rajasthan, downstream of the dam. Power generation at Gandhi Sagar Dam was through a powerhouse at the toe of the dam, with a total installed capacity of 115 MW (divided into five units of 23 MW). The Kota Barrage, an earth and masonry structure in height, was built to provide irrigation through a canal system, with two main canals on the right and left banks. Construction of both projects began in 1953‚Äì54; both began functioning in 1960. The water received at the Kota Barrage is shared equally between Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan for irrigation. =Stage II= The second stage of development involved the use of the water released from the Gandhi Sagar Dam through another dam structure, the Rana Pratap Sagar Dam, located downstream of the Gandhi Sagar at Rawatbhata in the Chittorgarh District of Rajasthan. Additional storage at this dam provides an increase in irrigation benefits from the Kota Barrage, increasing its area of irrigation from to . In addition, a powerhouse at the toe of the dam provides an additional hydroelectric power generation capacity of 172 MW from four turbo generators, of 43 MW capacity each. The second stage was completed in 1970. The power generated at the Rana Pratap Sagar Dam is shared equally with Madhya Pradesh, as the Gandhi Sagar Dam provides the stored waters for use at this dam. =Stage III= The third and final stage of development envisaged an intermediate dam between the Rana Pratap Sagar Dam and the Kota Barrage, called the Jawahar Sagar Dam. This dam is a concrete gravity dam, high, located approximately upstream of Kota Barrage to its southwest, and provides a hydroelectric power generation capacity of 99 MW, with three generator units of 33 MW capacity each. This project was commissioned in 1972.

It is included as part of the Kumano Sanzan in the World Heritage site \\"Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range\\". The main deity enshrined is Kumano Gongen (ÁÜäÈáéÊ®©Áèæ). All of the ancient Kumano Kod≈ç routes lead to the Grand Shrine. It was originally located at present , on a sandbank at the confluence of the Kumano River and Otonashi River. In 1889, it was partially destroyed in a flood and the remaining shrine buildings were relocated at its present site in 1891. Of the original five main pavilions only three were rebuilt. Four deities were moved there and the other eight are still enshrined there in two stone monuments. Otorii In 2000, the largest torii shrine gate in the world (33.9 meters tall and 42 meters wide) was erected at the entrance to the Oyunohara sandbank. It‚Äôs an official gateway that designates the entrance to a sacred area. It signifies the division of the secular and the spiritual worlds. This torii is called Otorii (o means \\"great\\") and is made of steel weighing 172 tons, which took about six months to make and another six months to assemble.  History  Hongu Taisha main temple Over 900 years ago a pilgrim wrote of a massive shrine grounds including five main pavilions enshrining 12 deities. Numerous other small temples and shrines could be found surrounding the main buildings. Over the centuries the pavilions were partially destroyed by periodic fires and flooding, but always faithfully rebuilt to their original state. The last fire was in 1776 and the buildings rebuilt again in 1803. The first drawing of the shrine grounds from over 800 years ago and the reconstruction that took place in 1803 are almost exactly identical. After the flood of 1889, the shrine pavilions were moved and rebuilt at their present location.  Architecture  The Kumano Hongu Taisha's pavilions are an outstanding example of Japanese Shrine architecture. The use of natural unfinished materials allows it to blend effortlessly into the natural environment. Intricate joint works were used in the construction instead of nails. The thick roof gracefully sweeps forward extending over the stairs and the area in front of the shrine. It is made entirely of Hinoki, or Japanese cypress bark. Hongu Taisha rooftop The bronze ornaments on the roof top are characteristic features of shrine architecture. The X-shaped crosspieces that pierce the sky are called Chigi and the log like beams that are laid horizontally along and perpendicular to the ridge line are called Katsuogi. They add a dramatic highlight to the roof line. Unique to the Kumano Hongu Taisha is the space or corridor under the verandas of the pavilions. In the past, the pilgrims and ascetics would use this tiny refuge for meditation, prayer, Sutra copying, austere rites and even sleeping quarters. In fact, this is where Saint Ippen Shonin was enlightened. The Kumano Hongu Taisha is a mixture between Kasuga and Taisha styles but because of this sacred corridor it has also been referred to as the Kumano style.  Festivals  Kumano Hongu Taisha Spring Festival, the annual spring festival held 13‚Äì15 April every year is not only a quintessential festival of Kumano but also intimately associated with the pilgrimage to Kumano and the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage route. On April 13 fathers and their young sons purify themselves in the sacred waters of Yunomine Onsen before walking over the Dainichi-goe section of the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage route to Oyunohara wearing traditional costumes. The young boys have the character for big on their forehead and are forbidden to touch the ground. On April 15 the Kumano Deities are invoked to temporarily take up residence in a portable mikoshi shrine and returned to their original site of descend, Oyunohara. The atmosphere is serene, traditional, authentic and inspiring. Yata-no-Hi Matsuri Fire Festival, taking place on the last Saturday of August, in Oyunohara (Hongu- cho), in honour of the Yatagarasu crow (three-legged crow). This fire festival includes the parading of a fire mikoshi, a Taiko drum show, dancing, and fireworks.

This place is also revered as the mystical land of Shambhala by Tibetans. According to another tradition, the Siddhashrama is located in the Tibetan region, nearby Kailash parvat. Though any Sadhu, Sanyasi, Yeti, Monk and Yogi might have known 'Siddhashram' by any name or various cults might have used different worship or Sadhana methods according to their beliefs. The context of this supernatural land has been mentioned in many ancient scriptures along with four Vedas. The Siddhashram is described as a divine place in spiritual journey. Thus it is also believed that while discharging their divine works in this universe the spiritually empowered Yogis remain in constant touch with Siddhashram and they visit it regularly. Siddhashram is considered as the base of spiritual consciousness, heart of divinity and the mortification land of great Rishies. Siddhashram is equally scarce to human beings and all the visible and invisible creatures. Thus, the Siddhashram is assumed as a very scarce divine place. But it will be possible to get the divine power to enter this scarce and sacred place by doing hard works through Sadhana procedure and following Sadhana path. Siddhashram is a secret and mystical land deep in the Himalayas, where great siddha yogis, sadhus, and sages live. Siddhashram is the ashram by our ancestors, saints, sages & Yogis of high order. It is referred to in many Indian epics, the Veda, Upanishads and Puranas including the Rigveda, the oldest scripture of human civilization. Siddhashram is the society for the enlightened people or siddhas. The person, who reaches high level in sadhana can reach the mystical siddhashram with the blessings of the guru, who is the regular of this place. This aashram lies near the Mansarovar lake and the Kailash. Siddha yogis and sanyasis are meditating in this place for thousands of years. Like many mystical places mentioned in different religions this place can't be seen with naked eyes, it's an experience and only through the path of meditation and spiritual awareness we can experience this place. Swami Vishuddhananda Paramahansa first talked of this place in public. He was taken there in His childhood by some adept and He did his sadhana in Gyanganj Ashram for long long years. Many in Hinduism believe that Maharsih Vashishtha, Vishwamitra, Kanad, Pulastya, Atri, Mahayogi Gorakhnath, Srimad Shankaracharya, Bheesma, Kripacharya can be seen wandering there in physical form and also one can have the privilege of listening to their sermons. Many Siddha yogi, yoginis, Apsara (Angel), saints are found to be meditating in this place. The beautiful flowers in the garden, trees, birds, siddha-yoga lake, meditating saints and many other things of the place cannot be described in words. In ancient Indian literature Siddhashrama (literally, the hermitage of the siddhas) is referred to in the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Puranas. In Valmiki's Ramayana it is said that Viswamitra has his hermitage in Siddhashrama and it was the erstwhile hermitage of Vishnu, when he appeared as the Vamana Avatar. He takes Rama and Lakshmana to Siddhashrama to exterminate the demons who are disturbing his religious sacrifices.Valmiki Ramayana - Bala Kanda Chapter 29 In the Narada Purana (Purva,1.25), Siddhashrama is mentioned as the hermitage of sage Suta. In recent writings In the modern era, the knowledge of Siddhashram is first referred by the Pandit Gopinath Kaviraj and later extensively by Dr.Narayan Dutt Shrimali. It is also mentioned in the book Autobiography of an Avadhoota by Swami Nadananda.

He was born in Trieste, then Zone A of the Free Territory of Trieste, now part of Region Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy. His last name is of Slovenian origin.‚Ä¢ ^ https://www.dnevnik.si/1042455921 During his youth, he was a leader of the nationalist right wing Youth Front (Fronte della giovent√π) and then of the Italian Social Movement ‚Äì National Right of Trieste. He was also a member of the City Council of Trieste. In 1977, Almerigo Grilz was the leader of Trieste section of the Youth Front, becoming the Deputy National Secretary by a direct appointment of then secretary Gianfranco Fini. During this time he was also a member of the Journalist order of Trieste and cooperated with the Dissenso, the official journal of the Youth Front. Politician and war journalist As a teenager, he showed a considerable ability as photographer, and sketcher. He was also an avid reader particularly enjoying war stories, and comics in general. During this time he likes to walk in the city taking picture and short films over city‚Äôs everyday life. It is been reported that, his political passion started one day during one of his early reportages, when he was around with his camera taking pictures of a demonstration. At the Police charge of the demonstrators he was forced to run, seeking refuge inside the MSI seat of Trieste, in Via Paduina. More work was to come for him in the late sixties. Following the reorganization of the Italian dockyard system, the C.I.P.E, or (Commissione Interministeriale per la Programmazione Economica) (Economical Planning Interdepartmental Committee) decided the grouping of the Cantieri Riuniti Adriatico of Trieste and Monfalcone (\\"United Shipbuilders of the Adriatic\\") into one company, and set its new headquarters in Genoa. On 8 October 1966 the grouping plan was implemented and as expected the local population reacted. The ship building was one of the city‚Äôs excellence, since the Austrian days. Many Triestini had made up their living working at the dockyards. This ignite a demonstration against the dockyard grouping and the consequent loss of jobs. During those days Grilz was again on the streets taking pictures of the demonstration. The protests of 1968 comprised a worldwide escalation of social conflicts, and Italy was not immune and he documented the social disorder and the demonstrations. In 1970 he founded the ‚ÄúCentro Nazionale Audiovisivo‚Äù, an amateur documentary center. After a degree in Law, he started travelling. He was attracted by northern countries, where he profusely travelled by every means. He loved the order, the Northern countries vision of life and society. In those years he visited Denmark and Scandinavia; however he was particularly attracted by London and Britain. He learnt English very quickly becoming soon very fluent, and deeply loved British people. His passion for Britain can be also seen, in many of his early sketches, where he depicted war scenes of Tommies defeating Nazis. On 29 April 1981 he documented Charles and Diana wedding. [1] In the mid-1980s he became a full-time freelance war journalist, resigning his seat in the Trieste City Council. His job kept him away from home for 10 months a year. He witnessed all the conflicts from mid 70‚Äôs, from the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan to the Israeli‚Äôs operation in Lebanon; the conflicts between Druses and Christian Maronites; and the Myanmar-Thailand border war between Keren minority and Myanmar regulars. His reportages were sold all over the world and bought by CBS, France 3 and NBC. These important networks would subsequently hire Grilz as correspondent in other parts of the world. On a direct NBC request Grilz followed the Communist Philippine Guerrilla and the elections that led to the fall of the late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos and the subsequent election of Corazon Aquino. The Albatros press agency In 1983 together with Gian Micalessin and Fausto Biloslavo, he founded the ‚ÄúAlbatros Press Agency‚Äù. This agency would produce reportages, documentaries and articles, from every part of the world, where revolutions and war were fought. The agency sold a lot of its productions to foreign television networks, in particular in US and UK; also in Italy Albatros managed to sell its products to important networks, such as the Panorama weekly magazine and the Italian 1st TV channel news or TG Uno, this despite the high prejudice of the major Italian network for those who were considered culturally close to the MSI-DN right-wing party. Death On 19 May 1987 in Mozambique, while witnessing a battle between ‚ÄúRenamo‚Äôs‚Äù militiamen and the regular Army, Grilz was struck by a stray bullet in the head. His body was never recovered and buried close to where he was killed by, an English free-lance reporter. The news of Almerigo Griltz‚Äôs death, due to the prejudice, did not echo loudly in the Italian press world. Only in the late 1990s he would be listed as an Italian press agent, fallen in war zone.Italian Television reportage ‚Äú Terra‚Äù by Tony Capuozzo dedicated a story on Grilz on May 20, 2007. The ‚Äú Unit√†‚Äù the communist official newspaper wrote of the death of a ‚Äúmercenary‚Äù when reported to Grilz's death. An exception was Tg Uno which, thanks to Paolo Frajese, remembered Grilz even against the opinion of directors; Renato Farina, a writer for the weekly magazine ‚ÄúIl Sabato‚Äù, and Ettore Mo, also a special correspondent in the hot spots for the major Italian newspaper ‚ÄúCorriere della Sera‚Äù and a fellow journalist who went to various world hot spots, remembered the death and life of Almerigo Grilz.

Project Hermes was to determine the missile needs of army field forces. \\"Accordingly the Ordnance Department entered into a research and development contract with the General Electric Company on 20 November 1944. \\"This contract authorized the General Electric Company to seek the development of long-range missiles that could be used against both ground targets and high-altitude aircraft. The contractor agreed to perform investigations, research, experiments, design, development, and engineering work in connection with the development of long-range missiles for use against ground targets and high-altitude aircraft.\\" General Electric was also to investigate ramjets, solid rocket motors, liquid propellant rocket engines, and hybrid propellants. \\"The contract also required the General Electric Company to develop remote control equipment, ground equipment, fire control devices, and homing devices.\\"  History  Hermes was the Army's second missile program. In May 1944 the Army contracted with the California Institute of Technology's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratories to start the ORDCIT Project to research, test and develop guided missiles. The Hermes program originally was to have three phases; first would be a literature search, second a research group would be dispatched to Europe to investigate the German Missiles, third \\"it would design and develop its own experimental systems. Basically, this project covered every phase of missile technology with the exception of large-scale development and production of warheads and fuzes. However, ... these many areas may be grouped within three general categories, namely, the A1 and A2 missiles, the A3 missiles, and all other Hermes missiles and supporting research.\\" In December 1944, Project Hermes was tasked with studying the V-2. Subjects which were to be addressed were \\"... transporting, handling,unpacking, classifying (identifying), reconditioning and testing components of German rockets as well as assembling and testing subassemblies and complete rockets, manufacturing new parts, modification of existing parts, conducting special tests, constructing temporary test equipment not available at the Proving Ground, procuring and handling of propellants and supervision of launching rockets.\\" Project Hermes's mandate created a need for an extensive area where missiles could be safely tested. The Army moved to create the White Sands Proving Grounds in south central New Mexico as a place to test the new missiles. When the U.S. Army captured the Peenem√ºnde engineers, including Werner Von Braun, Dr. Richard W. Porter of Project Hermes was close behind. Following the capture by American forces of the Mittelwerk V-2 factory, Special Mission V-2 swept in and scooped up enough components to assemble 100 V-2s. The components were quickly removed to New Mexico. Three hundred rail cars of V-2 parts and documentation arrived at the White Sands Proving Grounds and General Electric personnel started the task of inventorying the components. For the next five years overhauling and manufacture of parts, assembly, modification and launching V-2 rockets would be the major part of Project Hermes. Many of the V-2 components were in poor condition or unusable. After the German V-2 parts and technology were imported into the United States, the U. S. Army formed the Upper Atmosphere Research Panel in early 1946 to oversee experiments both about their technology and their use for upper atmosphere research. One-third of the panel members were General Electric scientists. The Hermes project was expanded to include testing of the V-2 sounding rockets. General Electric employees, with the help of German specialists, assembled V-2s at White Sands Proving Grounds in New Mexico where the Army constructed a blockhouse and Launch Complex 33, now a National Historical Landmark. The first V-2 launch there was on April 16, 1946 but reached only 3.4 miles' altitude. The maximum altitude reached by a Project Hermes V-2 was 114 miles achieved by V-2 #17 on 17 December 1946. There were 58 standard V-2s, 6 Bumper\\" V-2s with a WAC Corporal second stage, and 4 drastically modified V-2s launched as Hermes IIs (Hermes B) by Project Hermes. The last Hermes flight was by V-2 #60 on 29 October 1951, carrying a Signal Corps Electronic Laboratory payload. Most photos of American V-2s show the common white and black markings. The first two flown were painted in yellow and black. Others had combinations of white, black, silver and red. The last two fired by Project Hermes were black, white, and red with a big \\"Buy Bonds\\" logo (V-2 #52) and white, black, and silver with a small \\"Buy Bonds\\" logo. The Project Hermes V-2 program had achieved its objectives. First, it had gained experience in handling and firing large missiles and trained Army personnel to launch them (the last 4 American V-2 flights were not part of Project Hermes, they were Army launched \\"Training Flights\\"). Second, Hermes had provided vehicles for experiments which aided the design of future missiles. Third, Hermes had tested components for future missiles. Fourth, Hermes had obtained ballistic data on high-altitude trajectories as well as developing various means of tracking such trajectories. Fifth, the V-2 program had provided vehicles for upper atmosphere and biological research. Additionally many components had to be manufactured due to shortages and deteriorated condition. Most notable was the inertial guidance system and mix computer. After the termination of V-2 flights by Hermes there were 5 final flights by V-2s from White Sands. They were training flights launched by Detachment 2 of the 1st Guided Missile Support Battalion.Cornett et al 1993, p. 363. Between 22 August 1951 and 19 September 1952 the 74th and final flight of a V-2 from White Sands was launched.Cornett et al 1993, p. 365. Hermes II The initial goals of Project Hermes included Hermes B, a ramjet-powered cruise missile. Hermes B was soon split into a Hermes B-1 test vehicle and a Hermes B-2 operational missile. Hermes B-1 soon evolved into Hermes II. In June 1946 General Electric's contract was amended to include a two-stage missile which used a V-2 as its first stage, with a ramjet-powered supersonic cruise missile as the second stage. The ramjet was assigned to the Von Braun team of which less than 40 were employed in the V-2 launching program. Design on the ramjet began on 10 December 1945. The Von Braun team dubbed the ramjet the \\"Comet.\\" Though the Peenemunde engineers had no experience with ramjets, and some members were scattered across the country, work progressed. On 11 January 1946 Von Braun presented his cruise missile design to Major General Barnes and the program was underway. Hermes II (aka RTV-G-3 & RV-A-3) was an attempt to produce a high-velocity ramjet-powered cruise missile. A V-2 would boost the cruise missile called the \\"Comet,\\" or \\"Ram.\\" to mach 3.3 at 66,000 feet where the ramjets would start. The Hermes II was an unusual design. It had two rectangular \\"wings\\" which doubled as the ramjets. It was described as a \\"two-dimensional, split-wing ramjet. The Hermes II, with its large rectangular wings, required enlarged tail fins. Still aerodynamic data was scant, and indicated that the Hermes II was unstable at most velocities which required more development of the guidance system. Another concern was the fuel intended, carbon disulfide, which was easy to ignite, but had a low specific impulse. At peak employment the Hermes II program employed 125 Germans, 30 Army officers, 400 enlisted personnel, 75‚Äì100 civil service personnel and 175 G.E. employees. A V-2 was modified to carry a test device called the \\"Organ,\\" a series of test diffusers (ramjet air intakes) which was to make measurements of pressures. That first Hermes II test missile (missile 0) was launched on 29 May 1947 and landed in Mexico causing an international incident. WSPG V-2 #44 carried a test ramjet diffuser. The successful flight returned data from Mach 3.6 and made GE confident it could proceed with a two-stage test. Progress was slow which frustrated Von Braun. The next Hermes II, (missile 1), the first to have the wings containing the ramjets, was launched by GE on 13 January 1949 and broke up shortly after liftoff due to unanticipated vibrations. There were two further Hermes flights missile #2 on 6 October 1949, which suffered the fate of missile 1. Missile 2-A on 9 November 1950. Missile 2-A did not break up, but the ramjet never started. When the Von Braun team transferred to Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, their primary mission was still a Mach 3.3 ramjet cruise missile. In May 1950 Hermes II was reduced to research only status. At that time Ordnance transferred the Mach 4 Hermes B from GE to Huntsville. September 1950 saw GE's Hermes C-1 study transferred to Huntsville where it evolved into the very successful PGM-11 Redstone short-range ballistic missile. The Hermes ramjet cruise missile faded into obscure history as it was terminated in 1953. Hermes B Hermes B was a Mach 4 ramjet- powered cruise missile design study undertaken by General Electric. It was later transferred to the Von Braun team at the Redstone Arsenal. Hermes B was also designated SSM-G-9 and SSM-A-9. The Surface to Air and Surface to Surface Missiles The development of the 25 ft tall Hermes A-1 (CTV-G-5/RV-A-5) rocket was begun by General Electric in 1946. Constructed mostly of steel, it was an American version of the German Wasserfall anti- aircraft missile; the Wasserfall was about 1/2 the size of the German V-2 (A-4).The aerodynamic shape of the Wasserfall was also adopted for the North American NATIV Hermes A-1 had one major difference from the Wasserfall. The Peenem√ºnde nitric acid/visol (vinyl isobutyl ether)-fueled P IX engine was replaced by a General Electric pressure fed 13,500 lb. thrust liquid oxygen/alcohol-fueled engine. Beginning in 1947, the engine of the A-1 was tested at GE's Malta Test Station in New York. The G.E. engine had a novel fuel injector which had great influence on future engine development in the USA. Combustion instability problems delayed engine development. Hermes A-1 components such as guidance and telemetry were tested on several V-2 flights at White Sands Proving Grounds in 1947 and 1948. Plans to develop Hermes A-1 as an operational surface to air missile were dropped in favor of the more suitable Nike. On 18 May 1950 the Army switched emphasis for Project Hermes to the surface to surface mission. The next day the Hermes A-1 first flew. The launch failed when thrust was lost shortly after lift-off. The second flight failed after 41 seconds when the hydraulic servo covers were burned through by engine exhaust. None of the three subsequent Hermes A-1 flights were totally successful, though \\"they demonstrated the functional capability of the missile system.\\" Those last three launches achieved apogees of 14 miles. The demise of the Hermes A-1 did not end two other design studies. Work on the Hermes A-1E-1 and Hermes A-1E-2 continued. They were tactical missile designs 25 feet and 29 feet long, respectively. Both were to have 1,450-pound warheads. The competing Corporal (XSSM‚ÄîG-7/XSSN-A-7) showed better development and Hermes A-1E-2 was cancelled in April 1952 and was followed by the A-1E-1 in October of that year. The original Hermes A-2 was projected to be a wingless A-1, but that missile was abandoned to be followed by another rocket called A-2 (RV-A-10). The RV-A10 was a short range solid fuel test vehicle, with plans to develop a tactical missile (SSM-A-13,) which were soon abandoned. The slightly larger Hermes A-3A (SSM-G-8, RV-A-8) followed. Progress on the Hermes A-3 until it was divided into an A-3A (RV-A-8) test vehicle and the A-3B (SSM-A-16) which was intended to be an operational missile with a W-5 nuclear warhead. A total of seven RV-A-8 were launches and five of them were either partial or total failures. The A-3B (SS-A-16) was slightly larger than the RV-A-8 and the last produced and tested vehicle of the Hermes missile program. It was designed as a tactical surface-to-surface missile carrying a 1,000 lb warhead with a 150-mile range but never achieved that range in practice. It had a thrust of 22,600 lb-force. By 1953‚Äì1954 six A-3Bs were test launched at White Sands, five successfully. One of the most important developments of the Hermes A-3 program was the first inertial guidance system tested on a ballistic missile. None of the Hermes missiles became operational, but did provide experience in the design, construction, and handling of large-scale missiles and rocket engines. The Hermes program was canceled in 1954. There were Hermes missiles which never flew. Work on a ramjet cruise missile continued after the end of the RTV-3 program. It was an ambitious program intended to produce a cruise missile, the Hermes II the RV-A-6 (Hermes B-1?), cable of flying at Mach 4.5 at . There was a SS-G-9, Hermes B-2 which was never built. The Hermes C program was composed of a series of studies, one of which was the Hermes C-1, which led directly to the SM-A-14 (GM-11) Redstone.

Pedersen was born on 7 November 1883 in Illeb√∏lle, Langeland Kommune, Denmark. For his higher education, Pedersen entered Sor√∏ Academy, a school with a history going back to 1140. His study of theology under F. C. Krarups, a priest/professor at Sor√∏, led to Pedersen‚Äôs study of the Old Testament. After he graduated from Sor√∏ Academy in 1902, Pedersen began study of Semitic languages under Professor Frants Buhl at the University of Copenhagen. In 1906 he obtained the university's gold medal, and in 1908 he took a divinity degree. Pedersen continued his Semitic studies abroad under Heinrich Zimmern, August Fischer, Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, and Ignaz Goldziher from 1909-12. During this period, he began publishing his many works by co-authoring Bibelbog for Skole og Hjem (Biblebook for School and Home) in 1909.

Support for it grew again in the West during the Renaissance. Ancient An astrological wheel located in the main stained glass window of a Presbyterian church found in Canada. The church was finished in 1889. The wheel is not complete, it only contains eight of the twelve signs. St. Augustine (354-430) believed that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil,http://astrologyclub.org/why-christianity-opposed-astrology/ July 20116 but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived at the same moment and born at approximately the same time. Medieval Dante Alighieri meets the Emperor Justinian in the Sphere of Mercury, in Canto 5 of the Paradiso. The first astrological book published in Europe was the Liber Planetis et Mundi Climatibus (\\"Book of the Planets and Regions of the World\\"), which appeared between 1010 and 1027 AD, and may have been authored by Gerbert of Aurillac.Campion, 1982. p. 44. Ptolemy's second century AD Tetrabiblos was translated into Latin by Plato of Tivoli in 1138. The Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas followed Aristotle in proposing that the stars ruled the imperfect 'sublunary' body, while attempting to reconcile astrology with Christianity by stating that God ruled the soul.Campion, 1982. p. 45. The thirteenth century mathematician Campanus of Novara is said to have devised a system of astrological houses that divides the prime vertical into 'houses' of equal 30¬∞ arcs,Campion, 1982. p. 46. though the system was used earlier in the East. The thirteenth century astronomer Guido Bonatti wrote a textbook, the Liber Astronomicus, a copy of which King Henry VII of England owned at the end of the fifteenth century. In Paradiso, the final part of the Divine Comedy, the Italian poet Dante Alighieri referred \\"in countless details\\" to the astrological planets, though he adapted traditional astrology to suit his Christian viewpoint, for example using astrological thinking in his prophecies of the reform of Christendom. =Objections = The medieval theologian Isidore of Seville criticized the predictive part of astrology. In the seventh century, Isidore of Seville argued in his Etymologiae that astronomy described the movements of the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing the movements of the sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous.Wood, 1970. p. 5 In contrast, John Gower in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions. The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people.Wood, 1970. p. 6 The fourteenth century skeptic Nicole Oresme however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his Livre de divinacions.Wood, 1970. pp. 8‚Äì11 Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry. However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of human action by the stars on grounds of free will. The friar Laurens Pignon (c. 1368‚Äì1449) similarly rejected all forms of divination and determinism, including by the stars, in his 1411 Contre les Devineurs.Veenstra, 1997. pp. 5, 32, passim This was in opposition to the tradition carried by the Arab astronomer Albumasar (787-886) whose Introductorium in Astronomiam and De Magnis Coniunctionibus argued the view that both individual actions and larger scale history are determined by the stars.Veenstra, 1997. p. 184 =Renaissance= 'An Astrologer Casting a Horoscope' from Robert Fludd's Utriusque Cosmi Historia, 1617 Renaissance scholars often practised astrology to pay for their research into other subjects.Campion, 1982. p. 47. Gerolamo Cardano cast the horoscope of king Edward VI of England, while John Dee was the personal astrologer to queen Elizabeth I of England. Catherine de Medici paid Michael Nostradamus in 1566 to verify the prediction of the death of her husband, king Henry II of France made by her astrologer Lucus Gauricus. Major astronomers who practised as court astrologers included Tycho Brahe in the royal court of Denmark, Johannes Kepler to the Habsburgs and Galileo Galilei to the Medici. The astronomer and spiritual astrologer Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake for heresy in Rome in 1600. Ephemerides with complex astrological calculations, and almanacs interpreting celestial events for use in medicine and for choosing times to plant crops, were popular in Elizabethan England. In 1597, the English mathematician and physician Thomas Hood made a set of paper instruments that used revolving overlays to help students work out relationships between fixed stars or constellations, the midheaven, and the twelve astrological houses. Hood's instruments also illustrated, for pedagogical purposes, the supposed relationships between the signs of the zodiac, the planets, and the parts of the human body adherents believed were governed by the planets and signs. While Hood's presentation was innovative, his astrological information was largely standard and was taken from Gerard Mercator's astrological disc made in 1551, or a source used by Mercator. English astrology had reached its zenith by the 17th century.Cummins A (2012) The Starry Rubric: Seventeenth-Century English Astrology and Magic, p. 3. France:Hadean Press Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, as well as providing individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything‚Äîpeople, the world, the universe‚Äîwas understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.Cummins A (2012) The Starry Rubric: Seventeenth-Century English Astrology and Magic, p. 43‚Äì45. France:Hadean Press =Enlightenment period= During the Enlightenment, belief in astrology amongst intellectuals fell away, though it had a popular following supported by almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed the spirit of the age by printing a derisive Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo- Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge. =Modern= Astrology saw a popular revival starting in the 19th century, as part of a general revival of spiritualism and, later, New Age philosophy, and through the influence of mass media such as newspaper horoscopes. Early in the 20th century the psychiatrist Carl Jung developed some concepts concerning astrology, which led to the development of psychological astrology.Gieser, Suzanne.

He started at the University of Chicago, going to Columbia University in 1922. He was originally from Forest, Indiana, the grandson of William Oliphant, an early pioneer of that area. Herman grew up on the family farm. In 1903, he graduated from Forest High School and attended Marion College. He returned home in 1905 to marry his childhood sweetheart, Julia Sims. In 1907, he graduated from Marion College and then went on to obtain degrees from Indiana University (1909) and his J.D. degree from the University of Chicago in 1914. Shortly after his arrival at Columbia University, he wrote to the university's president, Nicholas Murray Butler, outlining some plans he had for reorganizing the curriculum of the law school. Essentially, his goal was to transform the school into a research center, placing particular emphasis on the interaction of the law and other social sciences. Under the administration of Huger Jervey, who became dean of the law school in 1924, Oliphant's plans were used as the basis for a reorganization of the law school. In his 1928 inaugural address as President of the American Association of Law School, Herman Oliphant said: \\"Our case material is a gold mine for scientific work. It has not been scientifically exploited... We should critically examine all the methods now used in any of the social sciences and having any useful degree of objectivity.\\"Herman Oliphant, A Return to Stare Decisis, 14 A.B.A. J. 71, 161 (1928). In 1932 he was co-author with Theodore S. Hope Jr. of \\"Study of Day Calendars\\" 1932, an in-depth look into how time effects trial cases. Oliphant later went on to teach at Johns Hopkins University, and later became the chief counsel of the United States Treasury Department, serving in that capacity from 1934 to 1939. While serving in that position, he was regarded as an economic experimenter, and was the prime advocate of the Undistributed profits tax. While at the Treasury Department, he was lobbied by William Randolph Hearst to make cannabis illegal. Hearst had recently become heavily involved in synthetics based on petroleum hydrocarbons, and wanted to quash efforts from competing companies to make similar products from hemp seed oil. Although that theory has been promoted for Oliphant's push for the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, his nephew Dr. Cleon O. Swayzee of Columbia University, in a 1984 interview stated two other reasons that took precedence for Oliphant's efforts. First was the influence of Oliphant's brother, Dr. Homer Oliphant, a physician who practiced in Forest and Frankfort, Indiana and who was promoting the theory as early as 1919 that smoking was dangerous for the health of mothers and unborn babies. Granted Oliphant didn't do anything about smoking cigarettes. The second reason was that in the midst of the Great Depression with limited employment opportunities this endeavor was a vehicle to discourage immigration particularly from Mexico. He is generally regarded as a representative of American legal realism and is famous for his statement that the principle of stare decisis is no longer applicable. Although the approach could be implemented in a time when society was relatively simply structured, in the present age it should be abandoned. To this effect, Oliphant pleaded a scientific approach. In his opinion, the way a judge deals with a case can be qualified as a stimulus-response situation, in the sense that the judge reacts to the stimulus of the case brought to his attention. He died on January 11, 1939, of heart disease at the age of 54. He is buried in Frankfort, Indiana.

Pelletier was born on an island off the coast of France where her parents had been exiled by the French Revolutionaries. She was christened Rose Virginie Pelletier and at the age of eighteen joined the Order of Our Lady of Charity who cared for girls and women in difficulty. Some of the girls were abandoned by their families or orphaned, some had turned to prostitution in order to survive. The Sisters of Our Lady of Charity provided shelter, food, vocational training and an opportunity for these girls and women to turn their lives around. Mother Mary Euphrasia formed the Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd to expand this apostolate to wherever needed. Pelletier died in Angers, France, in 1868 and was canonized by Pope Pius XII in 1940. Her feast day is 24 April.  Biography  Mary Euphrasia Pelletier in her youth.

Her mother died in 1813.Clarke, A.M., Life of Reverend Mother Mary of St. Euphrasia Pelletier, London, Burns and Oates Limited, 1895 Near the boarding school was the convent of the Order of Our Lady of Charity of the Refuge, a religious Congregation founded by John Eudes to provide care and protection for women and girls who were homeless and at risk of exploitation. Despite her guardian's reservations Pelletier was allowed to join the sisters provided that she not make her vows before she turned 21. She made her profession in 1816, taking the name of Mary of Saint Euphrasia. The sisters of the community had been dispersed at one point during the revolution; the majority had been imprisoned. Pelletier joined what was a community of elderly weary sisters.O'Shea, Sr. Norma, A Brief Sketch of the Life of Mary Euphrasia, Good Shepherd Sisters, Waterford, Ireland A short time after her profession, she became first mistress of the penitents, and about eight years later was made superioress of the house of Tours.Butler's lives of the saints, Volume 4 by Alban Butler, Paul Burns 1999 page 175 She founded a community, the \\"Sisters Magdalen\\" for women who wanted to lead a contemplative and enclosed life and would support, by their ministry of prayer, the different works of the Congregation. It is now known as the Contemplatives of the Good Shepherd.  Sisters of the Good Shepherd  Mary Euphrasia Pelletier as Mother Superior of the Good Shepherd Sisters. The city of Angers asked that Pelletier establish a Convent of Refuge there. She established a house in an old factory and called it \\"Bon Pasteur\\" (Good Shepherd). In 1831 she was appointed as Mother Superior of the house in Angers. The congregation in Tours did not wish to expand to Angers, nor did the house in Nantes. Eudes had established his houses as separate and autonomous. Pelletier came to believe that if the work was to grow, that each house should be under the direction of a generalate. She founded additional convents in Le Mans, Poitiers, Grenoble and Metz.\\"Saint Mary Euphrasia Pelletier\\", Catholic Pamphlets, 1958 In April 1835, Pope Gregory XVI granted approval of the Mother-House at Angers for the institute known as Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd of Angers. Convents that developed for Angers would be part of the institute while those houses that did not attach themselves to the General Administration would remain Refuges. The development of the Generalate made possible the sending of the sisters to wherever they were needed. Convents were also established in Italy, Belgium, Germany, and England. The institute is directly subject to the Holy See; Cardinal Odescalchi was its first cardinal-protector. For some time, Pelletier had to deal with the opposition of the Bishop Angebault of Angers, who wished to exercise the authority of Superior General, although the constitutions of the Order did not provide for this. She was accused of ambition, of innovation, and of disobedience. Sometimes she was put in the position of addressing conflicting instructions from Rome and the bishop. Although she had the support of Rome, the local clergy tended to keep their distance from someone who had incurred the bishop's displeasure. According to Sister Norma O'Shea, the bishop's opposition, coupled with the deaths of a number of sisters and longtime supporters, made Pelletier's last years very lonely. Pelletier devoted herself to the work entrusted to her. By 1868, she was Superior General of 3,000 religious, in 110 convents, in thirty-five countries.Good Shepherd of North America She died of cancer on April 24, 1868.

Written by Costello and produced by Geoff Emerick, the track shares the name of the group's previous 1981 studio album. It was released on 2 July 1982 along with the rest of Imperial Bedroom, and would later be included on side two of The Best of Elvis Costello and the Attractions (1985). A traditional pop song, \\"Almost Blue\\" contains lyrics that compare a former relationship to a present one. Unanimously approved by music critics, \\"Almost Blue\\" was noted for being a highlight on Imperial Bedroom; Emerick's production on the track was also singled out by reviewers, who acclaimed his \\"aftermath\\" approach towards its composition. The song was covered by several performers, notably Chet Baker in 1987, Gwen Stefani in 1998, and by Costello's wife Diana Krall for her seventh studio album, The Girl in the Other Room (2004).  Background and composition  Chet Baker's cover of \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" served as the inspiration and basis for Costello's \\"Almost Blue\\". After listening to Chet Baker's version of the 1931 Ray Henderson/Lew Brown song \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" from the 1954 Pacific Jazz record Chet Baker Sings, Costello became inspired to create similar-sounding music. He noted that the recording's \\"eeriness\\" and \\"haunted\\" qualities persuaded him to create his own take on it. In a 2015 memoir Costello wrote that Baker's version of the Richie Beirach song Leaving \\"had provoked my song 'Almost Blue' as much as Chet's recording of the Brown and Henderson song 'The Thrill is Gone.' \\" Costello wrote the ballad that shared the same name as his previous 1981 studio album, and wrote and recorded it with a \\"British pop\\" perspective. Produced by Geoff Emerick, \\"Almost Blue\\" is a traditional pop song, that is written in A minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tender beat consisting of 60 beats per minute. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, Costello's vocals range from A3 to C5, leading an instrumentation of a piano and guitar. Stylus Magazines Colin Beckett described its sound as reminiscent to the works of Johnny Hartman and Baker. Lyrically, Costello expresses a \\"dead past\\" or \\"dead relationship\\" by comparing it to its present state.  Critical reception  \\"Almost Blue\\" was well received by music critics. Beckett, writing for Stylus Magazine, called it the \\"biggest step\\" that the singer took on Imperial Bedroom. He continued: \\"It's one of the strongest songs on the album. It has a haunting quality that had never been present in Costello's work.\\" Imperial Bedroom was deemed one of the 100 best albums of the 1980s and one of the top 500 albums of all time by Rolling Stone. Douglas Wolk of Blender described it as one of the songs that every listener should \\"download\\". Timothy and Elizabeth Bracy from Stereogum highlighted Emerick's contributions to the track in their article ranking Costello's albums \\"from worst to best\\". James E. Perone, in his book \\"The Words and Music of Elvis Costello\\", cited \\"Almost Blue\\" along with two other songs from Imperial Bedroom as a \\"demonstrat[ion of] Costello's increasingly successful integration of balladry into his palette of vocal techniques\\".  Live performances and covers  \\"Almost Blue\\" has been performed and sung live on several occasions. In July 2004, Costello sang it at the North Sea Jazz Festival alongside thirteen of his other solo works. The live edition would later be added to the accompanying live album, titled My Flame Burns Blue (2006). On side two of The Best of Elvis Costello and the Attractions (1985), \\"Almost Blue\\" appears in its original format, as displayed on Imperial Bedroom. The recording has also been a number of films since its initial release. Jennifer Jason Leigh performed the song in the 1995 independent film Georgia at a fictitious nightclub. Her take on the track included drums and bass performed by John C. Reilly and Tony Marsico, respectively, and featured a saxophone and harmonica interlude as performed by Jimmy Z. Director Alex Infascelli's 2000 film of the same name, based upon Carlo Lucarelli's 1997 novel, were both inspired by the lyrics of \\"Almost Blue\\". American trumpeter Chet Baker recorded the tune in 1987 for the documentary Let's Get Lost (1989) and it was released on the soundtrack album. He also covered it in concert on June 14, 1987, in Tokyo, creating an extended version totaling seven minutes and fifty-three seconds. After his death in 1988, it was released on his posthumous album Chet Baker in Tokyo (1988). At a 1998 benefit concert for the Walden Woods Project in Concord, Massachusetts, ska musician Gwen Stefani sang it alongside a jazz orchestra. It was later included on the accompanying promotional CD for AT&T; customers, titled Stormy Weather (1998). Other renditions were made by Kate Dimbleby and Jimmy Scott for their 1998 albums, Good Vibrations and Holding Back the Years, respectively. The Reputation featured it on their eponymous debut album in 2002, followed with covers performed by Everything but the Girl and Alison Moyet in 2003 and 2004, respectively.  Diana Krall version  Costello's wife, Canadian singer Diana Krall, recorded a cover of \\"Almost Blue\\" for her seventh studio album, The Girl in the Other Room (2004). Both Krall and Tommy LiPuma produced the track, which is over a minute longer than Costello's original rendition. An accompanying music video to Krall's version was created and released in 2004, and eventually uploaded onto her official Vevo account on October 6, 2009. The visual was selected by the singer to appear on her greatest hits album, The Very Best of Diana Krall, in 2007. In her review of the video's inclusion on the aforementioned album, Shackleton mentioned the \\"wintry outdoor scenes from Diana's native Vancouver Island\\" as a highlight. = Background and composition = Much of the song's production is similar to its original counterpart; it was written by Costello, while Krall and Tommy LiPuma handled the track's production. However, this version is in F major at a tempo of 56 beats per minute. According to the recording's official sheet music, her vocals range from E3 to F4, with a \\"very slow and gentle\\" expression. = Critical reception = Krall's version of \\"Almost Blue\\" divided critics. On a positive note, Thom Jurek of AllMusic enjoyed its blues roots and called the cover \\"striking\\". Agreeing, BBC Musics Kathryn Shackleton appreciated Krall's \\"sultry and raw\\" vocals, which Creative Loafings Hal Horowitz called \\"beautifully muted\\". However, Noel Murray of The A.V. Club questioned its overall composure for not \\"do[ing] much\\". Despite appreciating Costello's version in a previous review, Wolk from Slate disapproved of her edition and evident genre change, preferring her \\"pre-rock ballad standards\\" to her current material.

Based in Irkutsk, Russia, GBT is working to build hiking trails around Lake Baikal. Over the last 10 years, from 2003 to the end of 2012, GBT has run over 180 international projects, building or improving trails at various points throughout the Siberian regions of Irkutsk and Buryatia with the help of more than 4,500 volunteers from around Russia and the world. Mission The mission of the Great Baikal Trail is to promote the sustainable development of ecotourism in the Lake Baikal region as an alternative to industrialism. Their mission is for an overall goal of the preservation and protection of the environment, through an increased awareness of environmental issues. They also work towards creating more socially responsible community spirit, as well as a healthier lifestyle in the region. They hope to increase international cooperation and create more collaborative programs with local and international organizations. More specifically, they hope to achieve this through the creation of a single system of environmental trails around Lake Baikal, developing of a special kind of Russian tourism called \\"volunteer vacationing.\\" They organize a number of Russian and international cooperative programs, attracting young people to various environmental, educational, and other community programs. They aim to create a means for guaranteeing good communication and mutual support amongst community groups, government agencies, local businesses, and Baikal residents. GBT conducts educational programs, along with organizing various public conferences, discussions, seminars, and workshops. They form environmental teams to tackle various issues, with numerous field expeditions. History Irkutsk traveler and writer Valentin Bryanskii promoted the idea of a circular trail around Baikal beginning in the 1970s. However, the modern idea of the Great Baikal Trail was brought up in 1997 by Oleg K. Gusev, a Russian writer, photographer and scientist, who worked at the Barguzin Nature Reserve for over thirty years and was instrumental in forming the Baikal-Lensky Reserve. After visiting the Appalachian Trail in the United States, Gusev realized that creating a similar system of trails at Lake Baikal might also help its preservation. At this time the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was working on the project \\"Bed and Breakfast and Baikal.\\" The idea was to create a network of private homestays and \\"micro-hostels\\" to receive the tourists hiking the path around the lake. In 1999, the Great Baikal Trail project was presented at international exhibitions in Scotland and the Netherlands. The idea was also discussed at a seminar for the representatives of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Ulan-Ude. In April 2000, it was presented at the International Conference on Ecotourism in Brazil. In June 2000, Andrei Suknev made a presentation about the Great Baikal Trail project to representatives of the World Bank, the United States Forest Service, Greenpeace, and the leaders of environmental agencies in the Irkutsk Oblast and the Republic of Buryatia. This presentation met with a lively response from the Deputy Chief Forester of the Lake Tahoe watershed, Ed Guy, who was familiar with the Tahoe Rim Trail, a similar system of trails at Lake Tahoe. In 2001, Guy organized a trip of senior officials from the U.S. Forest Service to Lake Baikal. The goal of this trip was to create a project of mutual exchanges to begin the practical implementation of the Great Baikal Trail. Between 2002-2003, the U.S. Forest Service funded a series of exchanges between professionals, trail builders, and representatives from the protected regions around Lake Baikal. At the same time, two organizations ‚Äì the Federation of Sports Tourism and Mountaineering of the Republic of Buryatia and Earth Island Institute's Baikal Watch in San Francisco, United States ‚Äì were awarded a joint grant from the Foundation for Russian American Economic Cooperation for an exchange program to share experience in trail construction. In the fall of 2002, specialists from the Tahoe Rim Trail Association, the U.S. Forest Service, and EarthCorps came to Lake Baikal. They met representatives of the protected areas, and discussed trail building and planning techniques used in the United States. Gary Cook, the director of Baikal Watch, made great personal contributions to the Great Baikal Trail project. In January 2003, a group of interested people from all around Baikal traveled to the West Coast of United States to learn about trail building. In February it was decided to start building the Great Baikal Trail. In the summer of 2003, the first six teams of volunteers began work on trail construction with the support of the Baikal Nature Reserve, Zabaikalsky National Park, the community organization Ust'e from the village Bolshoe Goloustnoe, the club LAT from the city of Ulan-Ude, and the NGO GRIN School of Tourist-Environmental Education of Severobaikalsk. In its first season, GBT had 136 volunteers. In autumn, after numerous requests by these students, GBT founded the GBT Youth Club. Foreign volunteers also came to the club and they, along with Russian volunteers, assisted in the preparation of next season's projects. In February 2004, three young people were sent to train at the organization EarthCorps, in Seattle, United States, to gain skills on trail construction and volunteer management. They returned just in time for the 2004 season with GBT. With them came two qualified experts from EarthCorp], who spent three months helping with work on 15 projects. 2004 was a significant year, as Rotary International \\"adopted\\" 100 km of trail, and Baikal Plan in Germany joined up with GBT, sending 100 volunteers to help with trail construction. Also in 2004, GBT was incorporated as a non-profit organization, allowing it to apply for grants. This is how it became the interregional public organization \\"The Great Baikal Trail.\\" In the winter of 2004-2005, the GBT Youth Club began to travel to local schools to give presentations on environmentalism to children, prepare exhibitions, and most importantly find young people who wanted to become team leaders and translators. In the spring, GBT organized courses to help young people develop the practical knowledge and skills necessary to become crew leaders, which they would have to demonstrate at the GBT seminar in Listvyanka that May. Meanwhile, the GBT Youth Club participated in various events, such as Baikaltour, Winteriada, and Baikal Day. The Ulan-Ude club organized social projects, such as providing Christmas gifts to children in orphanages. As a result, hundreds of children have received gifts at the Children's Home and Rehabilitation Center. In the spring of 2005, in Ulan-Ude and Irkutsk, volunteers helped construct paths in city parks. In Ulan-Ude, volunteers built more than 300 meters of high quality wheelchair accessible trails. In 2005, GBT conducted more than 30 local trail building projects. GBT began sharing its experience with others, including an organization in Kamchatka. Its main international partners included the Earth Island Institute (San Francisco), EarthCorps (Seattle), and Baikal Plan (Dresden). In 2005, the Center of Expertise (ECOM) published a popularity rating of environmental NGOs in 2005. ECOM assessed public interest in the activities of 40 national and regional organizations by counting the number of searches in Internet search engines. The leading positions were held by Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Ringing Cedars of Russia movement. The Great Baikal Trail was at 6th place, sharing a place ranking with such organizations as the Baikal Environmental Wave, Center for Russian Environmental Policy, the Moscow Society of Nature, the Environmental Education Center \\"Reserves\\", and Sakhalin Environment Watch. In 2006 they were able to raise the quality of work by attracting Russian and foreign experts to the projects, and widened the geographic area of their work. GBT began conducting more projects for and with children. They won a National Award in the field of Social Volunteering for the 2005 Volunteer Project in Nature Trails. Since then GBT has expanded its work from trail building to hosting environmental education workshops, seminars, working on nature interpretation, visiting classrooms, giving lectures, and community service. Projects =Summer projects= The summer is the most active season for GBT. They run several two-week trail-building projects around Lake Baikal. These projects attract both Russian and international volunteers seeking to spend time in the wilderness of Lake Baikal, where they can work, relax and get to know people from other countries and cultures. These projects often take place in protected areas of the lake, such as Pribaikalsky National Park, Zabaikalsky National Park, Baikal Nature Reserve, and Barguzin Nature Reserve. Each trail- building project host between 10 and 18 volunteers along with a crew leader, assistant, and interpreter. Living out of tents, they work six hours a day, five days a week. At each of these project sites, volunteers are asked to clear areas for trails, then build and mark these new trails with special signs. They construct all the necessary trail features, such as switchbacks along steeper terrains, bridges over river crossings, and natural staircases made of stone and wood. They build campsites, create interpretive signs and displays, and create many trail markers made of stone. Most volunteers are individuals, but sometimes these projects involve entire families or groups of friends. =Winter projects= In winter there is no trail-building, but other projects take place. Participants create signs, trail descriptions, booklets and other promotion materials for the trails and protected areas around Lake Baikal. Often GBT conducts environmental programs for local children. =Language projects= Eco-English is typically a ten-day full English language immersion program aimed towards Russian participants with at least an intermediate English level, to learn and practice English. During the program, there are English classes with environmental focus, interactive activities, and trail building. =Educational projects= Besides the standard trail building projects, GBT also conducts educational projects, often in partnership with other groups. These projects vary depending on the focus and desire of each individual organizational partner. GBT also conducts ten-day children's projects. The children do a variety of activities with ecological themes, including arts and crafts, hikes, environmental classes, and trail- building. During the school year, Great Baikal Trail volunteers often visit classes in local schools in villages in the Republic of Buryatia and Irkutsk Oblast. Volunteers prepare interact lessons to teach about the protection of nature, ecology, and the importance of environmental protection. Leadership courses The Great Baikal Trail organizes annual leadership courses for young, energetic, and inquisitive individuals who love travelling, intercultural communication, and Lake Baikal. It enables every volunteer to work as a crew leader or interpreter, leading an international team, during summer trail building projects around the lake. =Courses for crew leaders= A crew leader is a GBT specialist who has been trained in trail construction and maintenance, and who has shown an ability to manage international teams in an outdoor setting. The crew leader is responsible for setting up the camp and directing the daily work that the volunteer crew performs during each two-week project. An interpreter is entirely responsible for fostering active communication between all crew members. The working languages on the trail are both Russian and English, so interpreters must be proficient in speaking both. Interpreters also plan a full agenda of recreational activities over a two- week period. They must understand communication basics and use of different languages, as well as psychological and cultural differences between Russian and international volunteers. They also must handle conflict resolution. GBT Youth Club In 2003, the GBT Youth Club was formed for the coordination of activities within the organization. In the winter, the club organizes hikes on the ice of Lake Baikal, and hosts ecological exhibitions, conferences and international workshops in partnership with foreign environmental organizations. They often work with children, holding interactive classes on environmental protection. Club members often complete GBT courses on crew leadership and interpreting, and become leaders of trail-building summer projects. The club does not meet in the summer, as most members are involved in summer projects. Members often have the opportunity to participate in the international programs of organizations such as EarthCorps, based in Seattle. Trails =Listvyanka to Bolshie Koty= The Listvyanka ‚Äî Bolshie Koty section of the Great Baikal Trail is located within Pribaikalsky National Park. This trail offers a scenic hike through Siberian forests and along the shores of Lake Baikal in the Baikal Mountains. It is a moderate 22 km (14 mi) hike, climbing 404m above the lake. It is easily accessible from Irkutsk and gives tourists an opportunity to truly experience Lake Baikal without venturing far from the city. On average, it takes 5-8 hours to hike. A permit from the Park is required for hiking or camping along this trail. =In the jungles of Khamar-Daban= This section of trail is in the Khamar-Daban mountain range and is located within the Baikalsky Nature Reserve. One must have a permit and must be accompanied by a member of the reserve's staff to visit the reserve. The trail is 12 km and follows a river valley leading to the Osinovsky Waterfall, alpine meadows and lakes, and views of the peaks of the Khamar-Daban mountains.

They were typically large pterosaurs that lived from the Early to Late Cretaceous periods (Valanginian to Maastrichtian stages), with fossil remains found all over the world except Antarctica. Ornithocheiroids were the most advanced group of pterosaurs, as the group includes the clade Azhdarchoidea, of which its members lived until the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, around 66 million years ago. Notable pterosaurs from this group include the pteranodontians Pteranodon and Nyctosaurus, the ornithocheirids Ornithocheirus and Tropeognathus, as well as the azhdarchids Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus. Classification The name Ornithocheiroidea was originally defined as an apomorphy-based taxon by Christopher Bennett in 1994. It was given a relationship-based definition in 2003 by Alexander Kellner, who defined it as the least inclusive clade containing Anhanguera blittersdorffi, Pteranodon longiceps, Dsungaripterus weii, and Quetzalcoatlus northropi.Kellner, A.

Their remains are usually found in what were once coastal or lake environments. They generally had long wings, long necks, and highly specialized teeth. Evolutionary history The earliest known ctenochasmatoid remains date to the Late Jurassic Kimmeridgian age. Previously, a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom, was considered the oldest known. This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae,Buffetaut, E. and Jeffrey, P. (2012). \\"A ctenochasmatid pterosaur from the Stonesfield Slate (Bathonian, Middle Jurassic) of Oxfordshire, England.\\" Geological Magazine, (advance online publication) though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stem-crocodilian instead of a pterosaur. Ecology Most ctenochasmatoids were aquatic or semi-aquatic pterosaurs, possessing large webbed hindfeet and long torsos - both adaptations for swimming and floating -, as well as a predominant occurrence in aquatic environments, the exception being the more slender-limbed and short-torsoed gallodactylids. They occupied a wide variety of ecological niches, from generalistic carnivores like Pterodactylus to filter-feeders like Pterodaustro and possible molluscivores like Cycnorhamphus. Most common, however, were straight-jawed, needle-toothed forms, some of the most notable being Ctenochasma and Gnathosaurus; these possibly occupied an ecological niche akin to that of modern spoonbills, their teeth forming spatula-like jaw profile extensions, allowing them a larger surface area to catch individual small prey.Witton, Mark P. (2013). Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy. Princeton University Press. . Flight Most ctenochasmatoids have wing proportions akin to those of modern shorebirds and ducks, and probably possessed a similar frantic, powerful flight style. The exception is Ctenochasma, which appears to have had longer wings and was probably more comparable to modern skuas. Launching varied radically among ctenochasmatoids. In forms like Cycnorhamphus, long limbs and shorter torsos meant a level of relative ease. In forms like Pterodaustro, however, which possessed long torsos and short limbs, launching might have been a more taxing and prolonged affair, only possible in large open areas, just like modern heavy-bodied aquatic birds such as swans, even with the pterosaurian quadrupedal launching. Classification Ctenochasmatoidea was first defined by David Unwin in 2003 as the clade containing Cycnorhamphus suevicus, Pterodaustro guinazui, their most recent common ancestor, and all its descendants.Unwin, D. M., (2003). \\"On the phylogeny and evolutionary history of pterosaurs.\\" Pp. 139-190. in Buffetaut, E. & Mazin, J.-M., (eds.) (2003). Evolution and Palaeobiology of Pterosaurs.

However, more recent studies have shown Germanodactylus to be much more primitive, either an archaeopterodactyloid or a primitive member of the Eupterodactyloidea. This makes Dsungaripteroidea a much larger group. Alexander Kellner in 2003 defined Dsungaripteroidea very differently as the group containing the last common ancestor of Nyctosaurus and Quetzalcoatlus, and all its descendants. However, subsequent recent analysis use the name Ornithocheiroidea instead of Dsungaripteroidea for this definition.Nicholas R. Longrich; David M.

Geological Society of London, Special Publications 217, London, 1-347. There have been several competing views of azhdarchoid relationships. The first, presented by Felipe Pinheiro and colleagues in 2011, considered the tapejarids to be a monophyletic clade including the thalassodromids and chaoyangopterids.Pinheiro, F.L., Fortier, D.C., Schultz, C.L., De Andrade, J.A.F.G. and Bantim, R.A.M.

Only one series was made before the programme was axed by the BBC.https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jan/27/broadcasting.bbc2 Trust received mixed reviews in the British press, but received better critical acclaim when it was rebroadcast on BBC America in 2004.http://www.today.com/id/4363803/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/trust- latest-bbc-tv-import/ The series was produced by Box TV Productions. Plot Trust revolves around a corporate law team led by partner Stephen Bradley (Robson Green), a maverick lawyer who often finds sense in apparently senseless argument. In each episode, the team are presented with corporate clients who require the services of the law firm, often in the handling of critical deals including takeovers, mergers and acquisitions and dissolutions. The series also deals with issues relating to long city working hours, corporate competition, drug abuse in the work place and corporate social responsibility, or the lack of it. The series is set in the City of London and makes full use of the city's iconic buildings as visual references. Cooper Fozard's offices are actually portrayed using two separate buildings for exterior shots ‚Äî Thomas More Square in Wapping is portrayed as Cooper Fozard's office building, while roof shots, which often provide breaks within episode stories to focus on series spanning themes, are filmed at 1 Poultry. Other locations have included The Bank of England and St Paul's Cathedral. The series makes constant use of aerial photographs of the city, with Tower 42, The Gherkin (while still under construction), Shoreditch & Hoxton, Lloyd's of London and The Royal Exchange frequently being utilised to set the scene. The title sequence features shots of the City from Waterloo Bridge, and the title banner is displayed over an ultra-wide angle shot of the Aviva building and 122 Leadenhall Street in Undershaft.

Like Isaac Benveniste, who is supposed to have been his father, he was styled \\"Nasi\\" (prince). According to one source Al-Harizi called him the \\"pillar of the world and the foundation-stone of all pietists\\".Prophetic inspiration after the prophets, Abraham J. Heschel, 1996, p. 22  Biography  He received his education at Narbonne, his probable birthplace; afterward he lived at Barcelona, and later at Zaragoza, in which city he died about 1209. It is said that he owed his high position to his knowledge of Arabic. He practised medicine, and was the author of a medical work, manuscript copies of which are still extant at Oxford and Munich. Such was his reputation as a physician that patients came long distances to consult him, and some are said to have journeyed even from Mainz (e.g., Solomon ben Hananel). Benveniste, whose generosity is praised by Al-·∏§arizi, was poetically gifted and composed several liturgical songs. Even in his old age he remained a friend of free investigation, as the following epigram on Me√Ør Abulafia shows: :You ask why 'lustrous' he is named, :Though he the light so cheaply rated; :Because the dusk we 'twilight' name: :By language-contrasts thoughts are mated. Benveniste directed a letter to the congregation of Lunel, in answer to the epistle of Abulafia to that congregation, in which he freely expresses himself upon the value of Maimonides's \\"Yad ha-·∏§aza·∏≥ah,\\" because it enabled the laity to control the judgments rendered by the Rabbis. He carried on a lively correspondence with Nasi Kalonymus ben ·π¨odros and with Levi ben Moses of Narbonne, where his brother Joseph also resided. He lost his three sons in their prime. He was also known in his day as the \\"elder-prophet\\", a man \\"on whom the spirit of the Lord dwelt\\". In one of his poems he describes a vision that came to him in a dream: \\"I saw an angel standing before me; his spirit came to me and i began to prophesy: Oh, you who seek visions, listen to my wordsthe Lord, who has embittered my soul, is now good to me; He has said that He will answer me in my time of trouble.Prophetic inspiration after the prophets, Abraham J.

Kinds of judicial opinions A unanimous opinion is one in which all of the justices agree and offer one rationale for their decision. A majority opinion is a judicial opinion agreed to by more than half of the members of a court. A majority opinion sets forth the decision of the court and an explanation of the rationale behind the court's decision. Not all cases have a majority opinion. At times, the justices voting for a majority decision (e.g., to affirm or reverse the lower court's decision) may have drastically different reasons for their votes, and cannot agree on the same set of reasons. In that situation, several concurring opinions may be written, none of which is actually the view of a majority of the members of the court. Therefore, the concurring opinion joined by the greatest number of judges is referred to as the plurality opinion. A dissenting opinion (or dissent) is an opinion written by one or more judges expressing disagreement with the majority opinion. A dissenting opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law. However, they are cited from time to time as a persuasive authority when arguing that the court's holding should be limited or overturned. In some cases, a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law, and a later case will write a majority opinion for the same rule of law formerly cited by the dissent. The dissent may disagree with the majority for any number of reasons: a different interpretation of the case law, use of different principles, or a different interpretation of the facts. They are written at the same time as the majority opinion, and are often used to dispute the reasoning behind the majority opinion. Normally, appellate courts (or panels) are staffed with an odd number of judges to avoid a tie. Sometimes when judicial positions are vacant or a judge has recused himself or herself from the case, the court may be stuck with a tie, in which case the lower court's decision will be affirmed without comment by an equally divided court. A majority opinion in countries which use the common law system becomes part of the body of case law. Such decisions can usually be cited as precedent by later courts. In some courts, such as the Supreme Court of the United States, the majority opinion may be broken down into numbered or lettered sections. This allows judges who write an opinion \\"concurring in part\\" or \\"dissenting in part\\" to easily identify which parts they join with the majority, and which sections they do not. An opinion may be released in several stages of completeness. First, a bench opinion may be handed down, with the judge or panel of judges indicating their decision and a rough explanation of the reasoning underlying it. A slip opinion may also be issued the day the decision is handed down, and is usually not typeset or fully formatted. It is not the final or most authoritative version, being subject to further revision before being replaced with a final published edition. The Supreme Court of the United States issues slip opinions with the following disclaimer: Opinions may also be issued in ways that limit the amount of authority that they have as precedents for future cases. In United States legal practice, a memorandum opinion (or memorandum decision) is an opinion that does not create precedent of any kind in some jurisdictions. A memorandum is often brief and written only to announce judgment in a particular case. Depending upon local court rules, citation of the opinion as case law may not be accepted. A memorandum opinion may be issued where the law is so clearly defined that no purpose would be served by issuing an explanation as to why the law requires a certain disposition of the case before the court. In appellate courts, a memorandum opinion may indicate that the judges hearing the appeal find no error in the opinion being appealed to be worthy of comment. A per curiam decision is one rendered by the court (or at least, a majority of the court) acting collectively and anonymously. In contrast to regular opinions, a per curiam does not list the individual judge responsible for authoring the decision, but minority dissenting and concurring decisions are signed.For examples, see Bobby v. Van Hook and Michigan v. Fisher Non-adjudicative opinions An Advisory opinion or Certified question are those issued by a court or administrative body or panel that do not dispose of a particular case. They often address a general issue or matter, or are issued in a case that is being heard outside their jurisdiction. They are not issued for the purposes of deciding a particular case before the court in question. Some circumstances where they are issued include: *helping determine the constitutionality of a proposed act or policy (often in response to a request by one of the other branches government) *helping determine the law governing a case before a court in a different jurisdiction where the jurisprudence available is considered inadequate to dispose of the questions the case presents. *helping define how government rules and regulations are intended to be administered. Factors influencing judicial opinions A 2011 peer-reviewed research paper suggested that judicial rulings can be swayed by extraneous variables that should have no bearing on legal decisions, such as the timing of a parole hearing in relation to the judges' meal breaks. However, a re-examination of the data found that these conclusions had been based on erroneous assumptions.

During a brief and unhappy marriage, she came to England in 1929; her husband Norman Ramsay was under investigation in South Africa. After touring with an opera company, and a spell as an actress, she began reading scripts for a number of managements, including that of Peter Daubeny,John Lahr, Prick Up Your Ears: The Life of Joe Orton, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2002 [1978, 2000], p. 144. who was later known for organising annual 'World Theatre' Seasons.  Theatrical agent  As she was gaining no financial return from scripts she was finding, in 1953 her friends and acquaintances persuaded her to open her own agency, in which they invested. For her entire career her business was based in Goodwin's Court, an alley off St Martin's Lane, London. She was able to buy out her partners in 1963, after the success of her first \\"discovery'\\", Robert Bolt. Sometimes she could be wrong in her opinions. Of A Man for All Seasons (1966), Bolt's own screen adaptation of his play, she was dismissive: \\"We don‚Äôt expect it to succeed as it‚Äôs not very dramatic and has no sex at all\\". She represented many of the leading dramatists to emerge from the 1950s onwards, including Alan Ayckbourn, Eug√®ne Ionesco, J. B. Priestley, Stephen Poliakoff and David Hare. After discovering Joe Orton, then living on National Assistance,Chambers (1997), p. 157. she persuaded producer Michael Codron to stage Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane. Ramsay represented the dramatist, and then his estate, for the rest of her life. The 1978 biography of Orton by John Lahr, initiated by Ramsay in 1970, led to friction between the author and the playwright's former agent.Chambers (1997), pp. 179-86. For about ten years, she consulted her client, David Hare, about the quality of the work of other writers represented by her agency. Ramsay's last years were affected by the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Her long term companion, the actor William Roderick, died in April 1991. She died on 4September 1991 in London from the effects of a heart condition and circulation issues.

Apologizing for discussing the contents of a letter not addressed to him, Bonfed minutely examines the Christian dogmas, and proceeds to argue how irrational and untenable they are.

Russia and the KGB in the Age of President Putin, , Encounter Books ; February 25, 2009, pages 136-138. Forty four people, including at least 19 soldiers and 12 children, were killed and 133 wounded in the explosion. The explosive device represented MON-50 directional landmine enhanced for greater destructive capability. Related events On May 16 Kaspiysk police announced that another terrorist attack had been prevented. Three terrorists were caught while planting a MON-100 mine, similar to that detonated on May 9. During the arrest, the suspects presented papers from Dagestan's Ministry of Internal affairs and said that police had no right to arrest them. Further investigation was blocked by the Russian state security service FSB, and the director of the service, Patrushev announced that \\"the arrested parties had no connection with terrorists\\". Further fate of these suspects, one of whom was identified as Rashid Dzabrailov, remains unknown. Investigation According to the indictment brought after the investigation, the explosion was organized by the Dagestani militant Rappani Khalilov. Khalilov allegedly sent his envoy named Kazim Abdurakhmanov to Dagestan to organize the bombing. Abdurakhmanov offered Abdulkhalim Abdulkarimov to join the plot, and Abdulkarimov agreed. Another militant, Dzhamal Turulayev, ordered Murad Abdurazakov to build the remotely controlled land mine-based bomb. The bomb was delivered to the potential explosion spot by Khanali Umakhanov. Abdulkarimov was videotaping the bomb installation, while Turulayev triggered the explosion by remote control. However, on 1 July 2005, the jury found Abdulkhalim Abdulkarimov and Murad Abdurazakov not guilty of participating in the bombing. Defeat parade, Kommersant, 4 July 2005. They were found guilty on other charges, such as participating in illegal armed formations, possessing weapons and counterfeiting documents, and they were sentenced to 14 years (Abdurazakov) and 11 years (Abdulkarimov) of imprisonment. Militants did not come to be terrorists, Kommersant, 9 July 2005. Khanali Umakhanov was also found not guilty of most of the charges he was facing in court (including terrorism) on 20 October 2005. He was found guilty of transporting the remote control device that triggered the bomb and sentenced to four years in prison, but the jury decided he did not know how the device was going to get used. Remote control determined to be a terrorism weapon, Kommersant, 21 October 2005. The sentence was later reduced to two years on appeal and he was released. Supreme court forgave the accessory of Kaspiysk terrorists, Kommersant, 28 June 2006. After release, he sued the Russian government for being tortured when in custody and unlawful prosecution.

His five brothers all qualified as engineers, so that he was the only one of the boys with literary leanings, although their uncle Sir Richard Lodge and their aunt Eleanor Constance Lodge both became distinguished academic historians. They grew up in Liverpool, close to Sefton Park, and frequented the Rathbone family of Greenbank House. Life and works He was educated at Eastbourne College, Liverpool University and the University of Paris. He worked as an architect with Detmar Blow for some years, but otherwise lived on a private income provided by his father. O. W. F. Lodge's published works included What Art Is (1927); Six Englishmen (six tributes in verse, to Marlowe, Jonson, Shelley, Keats, Swinburne and William Morris); Summer Stories (1911), a collection of stories, prose poems and fables; Poems (210pp); Love's Wine Corked; a poem in twenty-four measures (1948); The Betrayer and other poems (1950); and The Things People Do, a collection of short stories published posthumously in 1966. He also wrote The Labyrinth: a tragedy in one act, based on Fair Rosamond by Thomas Miller (1847), which was first performed by The Pilgrim Players (which later became the Birmingham Repertory Company) in 1911.Sacred Texts Lodge married twice and had four children: Oliver (1922‚Äì2009) by his first marriage, to Winifred Atkinson, known always as Wynlane; and Belinda (1933‚Äì1996), Tom (1936‚Äì2012) and Colin (1944‚Äì2006) by his marriage, secondly, to the Welsh painter Diana Violet Irene Mabel Uppington (1906‚Äì1998). Marrying after a 12-year courtship, Lodge and his wife Wynlane settled at Upper Holcombe near Painswick, Gloucestershire, in a farmhouse belonging to Detmar Blow. After Wynlane's death in childbirth in 1922, Lodge lived in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, painting and writing, and frequented the Bloomsbury Group and the Catholic artists Eric Gill, David Jones and Sydney Sheppard. Ten years later Diana Uppington arrived on his doorstep answering his advertisement for a nude model (she had already modelled for both Eric Gill and Duncan Grant, after a short spell on stage with the Tiller Girls). She asked him if he liked poetry ‚Äì he replied that poetry was his life. After their marriage in 1932 they moved to a country cottage called Tanleather in Forest Green, Surrey, on the estate of Oliver's friend R. C. Trevelyan. Belinda and Tom were born there. Belinda's elder son, born in 1951, is the mathematician David Trotman. Lodge planned to settle in Paris with his young family in 1939 after spending a year in Valmondois with the anglophile French painter Charles Geoffroy-Dechaume and their families. After the outbreak of war Lodge returned to England and then took his young family first to Canada, during which period Oliver and Diana got to know well Lynn Chadwick (later a prominent sculptor) and his first wife the Canadian poet Ann Secord.The Times obituary of Diana Lodge, 14 April 1998 But very soon they moved to Maryland and settled in Virginia in the United States. Here Lodge taught English literature at various institutions including Ursinus College, Pennsylvania, Goucher College in Baltimore, and the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg. In Virginia, they first lived at \\"Bay Cottage\\", Naxera, until they moved to \\"The Little House\\", Elmington, Gloucester, Virginia. On returning to England in 1946 Lodge settled near Painswick, Gloucestershire, at Cud Hill House, on the Hilles estate of Detmar Blow's wife Winifred and son Jonathan (Lodge's godson), where the family stayed until 1959. After Lodge's death in 1955, his widow Diana Lodge changed her name by deed poll to Diana Kohr, taking the name of the Austrian economist and political scientist Leopold Kohr, who had befriended Oliver and Diana in Virginia during the Second World War. Diana changed her name back to Lodge in 1966 when she and Kohr separated. Lodge's will guaranteed his widow a sizeable income until she remarried, which was thus an obstacle to her eventual marriage with Kohr, as she explained in a 1993 television documentary about her life.Inner Journeys : a television documentary about Diana Lodge, by Jonathan Stedall, 1993 Some 200 letters written by O.

The regiment was raised in India in 1652 by the East India Company as the Company's first non-native infantry regiment. Over the following two centuries, the regiment was involved in nearly all of the East India Company's conflicts which consolidated British rule over India. The Royal Bengal Fusiliers was transferred to the command of the British Army in 1862 following the Indian Mutiny of 1857 and the end of Company rule in India. Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 104th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Fusiliers) to form the Royal Munster Fusiliers in 1881. History Sir Abraham Roberts, colonel of the regiment in the 1860s =Formation and consolidation of British rule= Soldiers of the 1st Bengal European Fusiliers, c.1850 The regiment was raised by the Honourable East India Company as a Guard of Honour in 1652. The regiment was initially involved in guarding the East India Company's factories along the Hugli River in Bengal which was India's richest province. In December 1756 it was renamed the Bengal European Regiment ‚Äì \\"European\\" indicating it was composed of white soldiers, not Indian sepoys - by Robert Clive who amalgamated the existing independent companies of non-Indian troops to form the regiment. The Mughal Empire, which had dominated India for centuries, was near collapse by the mid-18th century and the East India Company were fighting for supremacy with the growing French presence in India and becoming increasingly involved in local Indian politics. With the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, the regiment were soon fighting against the French and Mughals throughout India and saw action at the Battle of Plassey in June 1757, the Battle of Condore in December 1758 and the Siege of Masulipatam in March 1759. It also fought at the Battle of Buxar in October 1764 during the campaign against the Mughal Empire. The British victories in these battles confirmed their military supremacy in the region and transformed the East India Company from a trading company with a scattered presence in India to the ruling power of Bengal. The regiment was renamed the 1st Bengal European Regiment, on formation of the 2nd and 3rd Bengal European Regiments, in 1765. With its ruling status in Bengal confirmed, the East India Company began to expand its influence into neighbouring regions and the regiment went to take part in an action at Rohilkhand in April 1774 during the First Rohilla War. It fought at the Battle of Sholinghur in September 1781 during the Second Anglo- Mysore War and at skirmishes around Gujarat in 1782 during the First Anglo- Maratha War. After that it took part in an action at Rohilkhand in October 1794 during the Second Rohilla War. =Early nineteenth century= The regiment went on to fight at the Battle of Deeg in November 1804 during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. With the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the Royal Bengal Fusiliers would find themselves guarding Britain's interests in Asia for much of the early nineteenth century. Two companies were deployed to Macau in China, which the British had taken over from the Portuguese following the French occupation of Portugal, in September 1808 but returned to India in December 1808. A detachment went to the Dutch East Indies in 1810 and other detachments to Nepal and the Maluku Islands in 1814. The regiment saw some combat in skirmishes with the Pindaris in 1817 during the Third Anglo- Maratha War. After that it took part in operations against the Jat people in December 1825 during the Siege of Bharatpur. =The Victorian era= \\"The 1st Bengal Fusiliers Marching Down from Dugshai\\", after George F. Atkinson, 1857. Soldiers are depicted wearing campaign dress of grey shirts and white covered forage caps The regiment was deployed to Afghanistan in 1838 and saw action at the Battle of Ghazni in July 1839 during the First Anglo-Afghan War. Renamed the 1st Bengal (European) Light Infantry in 1840, it fought at the Battle of Ferozeshah in December 1845 and the Battle of Sobraon in February 1846 during the First Anglo-Sikh War. It became the 1st Bengal European Fusiliers, also referred to in contemporary official papers, with inverted word ordering, as 1st European Bengal Fusiliers, in April 1846.For example in the correspondence of Lt.Col. George Gladwin Denniss(1821-1862) (ed. P. Chantler, South Molton, 2010) who invariably placed the word \\"European\\" before \\"Bengal\\" It was deployed to the Province of Pegu in April 1852 during the Second Anglo-Burmese War. On the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion the order to march on Delhi was issued by Army Command in Shimla, and reached the regiment at Dagshai through Major George Ogle Jacob on 13 May 1857. After receiving the order, the regiment marched down from its rest station at Dagshai and was due to reach Umballa that evening.Correspondence of Lt.Col. George Gladwin Denniss II, 13/5/1857, ed. P. Chantler, South Molton, 2010 Jacob was mortally wounded at the Siege of Delhi on 14 September 1857. His grave at Rajpura Cemetery, Delhi states: \\"Sacred to the memory of Major George Ogle Jacob, 1st Bengal Fusiliers, who whilst commanding his Regiment fell mortally wounded at the storming of Delhi, on the 14th September 1857, aged 38 years.

Five members of the regiment were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions during the rebellion. After the Crown took control of the Presidency armies in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion, the regiment became the 1st Bengal Fusiliers in November 1859 and then the 1st Royal Bengal Fusiliers in May 1861. It was then renumbered as the 101st Regiment of Foot (Royal Bengal Fusiliers) on transfer to the British Army in September 1862. The regiment took part in the Ambela Campaign in 1863 and then embarked for England in late 1868. It was sent to Malta in October 1874 and transferred to Cyprus in July 1878 before setting sail for Halifax, Nova Scotia in November 1878. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 101st was linked with the 104th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Fusiliers), and assigned to district no. 70 at Ballymullen Barracks in Tralee.

It was first published by the Heron Press in early 1920,Mansfield, Katherine. Je Ne Parle Pas Fran√ßais. Hempstead: The jaaa Heron Press, 1919. and an excised version was published in Bliss and Other Stories later that year.Katherine Mansfield, Bliss and Other Stories, London: Constable, 1920. Plot introduction A French writer expounds his encounter with an English writer and all that that brought on. =Title explanation= The title is French for 'I do not speak French'. Those are the first words spoken to Raoul on Mouse's arrival, and is also a phrase he found written on a table at a small cafe he enjoys. Plot summary The narrator, Raoul, describes a caf√© he likes to go to, the matron, and the waiter. Then he recounts how, as a child, his maid would kiss his ears and give him cakes. He explains that he is a writer, lives in a rented flat, is 'rich' and has never dated women. Later, in the caf√© he orders a whisky, which he hates but orders because he intends to write about an Englishman. He then tells about his friend, Dick, singing an English song. He recounts how he met this friend, Dick, at a party, and how he was invited to dinner a few days later. There they talked about literature 'but not only of literature'; by the end of the dinner, Dick sang his song again, and Raoul started crying... From then on, they spent a lot of time together, at his flat or so. Out of the blue, Dick says he is leaving to England the following day and Raoul is offended. However, he then receives a nice letter from him, and finally another letter to say he is coming back indefinitely, and moving in with a woman and Raoul himself if he so wishes. After being bothered by his concierge, Raoul arrives at the train station, where he meets Dick and the woman, Mouse. They then go to a hotel by taxi together. There, after having Dick help the gar√ßon haul the luggage up the stairs, Mouse orders tea, and Dick asks Raoul to post a letter to his mother. Mouse starts to cry and admits that things are bad between her and Dick. Later, Raoul reads out loud a letter from Dick to Mouse, in which he is breaking up with her. She is in despair, as she had already told her friends they were married. At the end, Raoul says he never saw Mouse again, and he continues to go to seedy caf√©s.

Publishing History Richard Arthur Murry, Mansfield's brother- in-law (or Murry's younger brother), finished setting the type for the story on 9 November 1919.Norbun. 60. The story was originally published in a large format paper edition in simple green wraps. The title and the author's name, in all but one extant copy,Katherine Mansfield: An Exhibition. Austin: Humanities Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, 42-3. were on a pasted label on the wrapper. Mansfield's husband, John Middleton Murry, later gave his history of the story. He wrote that the pamphlet \\"was printed for private circulation by my brother [Arthur] and myself... The stitching and binding took us the whole of January. Of the original 100 copies, about 20 were spoiled, and of the 80 perhaps 60 actually issued.\\" Mantz, Ruth. The Critical Bibliography. NY: Ray Long and Richard R. Smith, 1931. 34. The Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin asserts that of the \\"60 [that] were actually completed... perhaps 30 [were] distributed, mostly for review.\\" Katherine Mansfield: An Exhibition. 43. The Heron Press was in the Mansfield/Murry house they called The Elephant right opposite Hampstead Heath on East Heath Road. Waiting For Godot Bookstore (Hadley, MA) claims on an internet book sale site that \\"OCLC locates only 21 worldwide holdings (18 of which are in American institutions).\\"Waiting for Godot Books. \\"Sale advertisement for Je Ne Parle Pas Fran√ßais.\\" American Book Exchange. N.D. Web. 2010. They also state that only a single copy has appeared at auction in the last thirty years [there are seven auction records listed in ABPC] since American Book Prices Current. Anthony Alpers writes that \\"this little private-press edition in which it first appeared is very rare... Few know the story in its intended form.\\" Alpers, Antony. The Life of Katherine Mansfield. NY: Viking, 1980. Print. The end of the story in the original version is considerably different from the story as it appeared in Bliss, as Constables' editor Michael Sadleir insisted on censoring sections, although Alpers said that they show the cynical attitudes to love and sex of the narrator Raoul (who was based on her lover Francis Carco). Her husband John Middleton Murry persuaded Sadleir to reduce the cuts slightly. At first Mansfield, who was writing from Menton, was reluctant to see the story censored: \\"No, I certainly won't agree to those excisions if there were 500 million copies in existence. They can keep their old ¬£40 & be hanged to them. Shall I pick the eyes of a story for ¬£40? I am furious with [Michael] Sadler [at Constable]. No, Ill [sic] never agree... The outline would be all blurred. I must have those sharp lines.\\" Mansfield, Katherine. The Collected Letters Vol. 3. Oxford: Clarendon, 1993, 273. By the following day she decided to leave the final decision to Murry: \\"I leave it to you. Youre [sic] my Cricket. If you agree to what they saywhy then, alls [sic] well (and I DO want the money.) Je t'aime.\\"Mansfield, Katherine, The Collected Letters Vol. 3. Oxford: Clarendon, 1993, 274. Those were not the last words she had for Murry on the subject of the altered text. The jacket for Bliss included these lines: \\"BLISS is the 'something new' in short stories that men will read and talk about and women learn by heart but not repeat.\\" Quoted by Margaret Scott in The Collected Letters Vol 4, p 137, note 3 This infuriated Mansfield who asked Murry, > Why didn't they have a photograph of me looking through a garter! But I was > helpless here ‚Äì too late to stop it ‚Äì so now I must prove ‚Äì no, convince > people ce n'est pas moi. At least if I'd know they were going to that no > power on earth would have made me cut a word. I wish I hadn't. I was wrong ‚Äì > very wrong.\\" Mansfield, Katherine, The Collected Letters Vol. 4. Oxford: > Clarendon, 1996, 137. The Original Text The original text has been restored in two scholarly editions, one edited by Antony Alpers (1984)Alpers, Antony, ed. The Stories of Katherine Mansfield Auckland: Oxford University Press, 1984. Print. and more recently in The Norton Critical Edition edited by Vincent O‚ÄôSullivan (2006).O‚ÄôSullivan, Vincent, ed. Selected Stories of Katherine Mansfield New York: W.W. Norton, 2006. Print. The latter is in print and is the one cited here. One of the censored passages comes as Duquette describes his experiences as a ten-year-old with the African laundress. The censored text is included in bold face: \\"One day when I was standing at the door, watching her go, she turned round and beckoned to me, nodding and smiling in a strange secret way. I never thought of not following. She took me into a little outhouse at the end of the passage, caught me up in her arms and began kissing me. Ah, those kisses! Especially those kisses inside my ears that nearly deafened me. \\"And then with a soft growl she tore open her bodice and put me to her. When she set me down she took from her pocket a little round fried cake cover with sugar and I reeled along the passage back to our door.\\"O‚ÄôSullivan 126. Shortly after Duquette muses about the fact he ‚Äúnever yet made the first advances to any woman‚Äù: \\"Curious, isn‚Äôt it? Why should I be able to have any woman I want? I don‚Äôt Look at all like a maiden‚Äôs dream . . . .\\" O‚ÄôSullivan 127. More substantial changes are made toward the end of the story. When Duquette is bidding farewell to a prostitute on the street: \\"Not until I was half-way down the boulevard did it come over me‚Äîthe full force of it. Why, they were suffering . . . those two . . . really suffering. I have seen two people suffer as I don‚Äôt suppose I ever shall again. . . . And . . . . ‚ÄòGoodnight, my little cat,‚Äô said I, impudently, to the fattish old prostitute picking her way home through the slush . . . . I didn‚Äôt give her time to reply.\\"O‚ÄôSullivan 143. Alterations continue at the end of the story: \\"And so on and so on until some dirty gallant comes up to my table and sits opposite and begins to grimace and yap. Until I hear myself saying: ‚ÄòBut I‚Äôve got the little girl for you, mon vieux. So little . . . so tiny. And a virgin.‚Äô I kiss the tips of my fingers‚Äî‚ÄòA virgin‚Äô‚Äîand lay them upon my heart.\\"O‚ÄôSullivan 144. The story‚Äôs original ending goes beyond the text as printed by Constable in England and Borzoi in the United States: \\"I must go. I must go. I reach down my coat and hat. Madame knows me. ‚ÄòYou haven‚Äôt dined yet?‚Äô she smiles. ‚ÄòNot, not yet, Madame. I‚Äôd rather like to dine with her. Even to sleep with her afterwards. Would she be pale like that all over? But no. She‚Äôd have large moles. They go with that kind of skin. And I can‚Äôt bear them. They remind me somehow, disgustingly, of mushrooms.\\"O‚ÄôSullivan 144.

Reich began composition of the work after a short visit to Ghana and observing music and musical ensembles there, especially under the Anlo Ewe master drummer Gideon Alorwoyie. His visit was cut short after contracting malaria. K. Robert Schwarz describes the work as \\"minimalism's first masterpiece.\\"Schwarz, K. Robert. Minimalists, p. 73, (Phaidon; 1996) () Compositional style =Phasing= The piece employs Reich's trademark technique of phasing. Phasing is achieved when two players, or one player and a recording, are playing a single repeated pattern in unison, usually on the same kind of instrument. One player changes tempo slightly, while the other remains constant, and eventually the two players are one or several beats out of sync with each other. They may either stay there, or phase further, depending on the piece. =Other techniques= K. Robert Schwarz characterized Drumming as a \\"transitional\\" piece between Reich's early, more austere compositions and his later works that use less strict forms and structure. Schwarz has also noted that Reich made use of three new techniques, for him, in this work: # \\"the process of gradually substituting beats for rests (or rests for beats) within a constantly repeating rhythmic cycle\\", or \\"rhythmic construction\\" and \\"rhythmic reduction\\" # combination of instruments of different timbres at the same time # incorporation of human voices in imitation of the sounds of the percussion instruments in the ensemble, including whistling effects Instrumentation and form In total, the work requires 9 percussionists. With the additional players, the piece can be performed by 12 or 13 players. The work falls into four parts, with the following instrumentation used in each: * Part One: 4 pairs of tuned bongo drums, played with double-ended wooden sticks (and one male voice, according to the original score) * Part Two: 3 marimbas, 2 or 3 female voices * Part Three: 3 glockenspiels, whistler, and piccolo * Part Four: complete ensemble The length of the piece can vary widely, as the number of repeats taken on any given measure is up to the performers. Recordings of the piece span between 55 and 84 minutes. The entire piece is structured around a single repeated rhythm, one measure of 12/8 long. This rhythm is built up note by note, in the \\"substitution of beats for rests\\" technique found in other of Reich's works such as Music for Pieces of Wood, Octet, Music for 18 Musicians, and others. After the rhythm is completely built up, two of the players phase to where they are playing the same pattern one quarter-note apart from each other, and the other bongo players play resulting patterns that can be heard as a result of the combination of the phased patterns. The rest of the piece continues to use the techniques of beat/rest substitution, phasing, and resultant patterns through its four movements. The transitions consist as follows: * Movement 2 begins by three marimba players playing exactly the same repeated pattern as the bongo players, fading in while the bongo players fade out. * Movement 3 begins similarly; three glockenspiel players begin doubling the marimbas (which by now are playing in their upper ranges), fading in while the marimbas fade out. * Movement 4 begins after movement 3 reduces its texture to one glockenspiel player, playing a single repeated note from the original pattern. Marimba and bongo players join, and build the pattern up again, note by note, until all nine percussionists are playing. The piece ends abruptly, on cue. Collaborations Choreographers such as Laura Dean, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, and Ginette Laurin have collaborated on dance performances with Reich on Drumming.

One of the first railways in southern England and the first in Dorset, the plateway was built by Benjamin Fayle, who was a wealthy Irish Merchant based in London and a friend of Thomas Byerley - Josiah Wedgwood's nephew. It was intended to take Purbeck Ball Clay from his pits near Corfe Castle to a wharf on Middlebere Creek in Poole Harbour, a distance of some . History Near contemporary accounts indicate that the line was built in 1805 and opened in 1806, and it is present on a map of 1811. On 16 August 1806, Fayle wrote to Wedgwood announcing the opening of the line and a reduction in the price of clay. The engineer was John Hodgkinson, who had worked with his cousin Benjamin Outram, a pioneering railway and canal engineer. Papers held in Corfe Castle Town Museum state that the contractor was named Willis. At the time the manager of the clay pits was Joseph Willis and tenant at Norden Farm, so this points to a possible \\"self build\\" by Fayle's men to John Hodgkinson's instructions. Initially the railway served clay pits to the east side of the road from Wareham to Corfe Castle, but shortly thereafter it was extended under the road to serve clay workings on the other side of the road. There are two tunnels under the road, serving different workings. The northern tunnel carries a plaque on its east face reading BF 1807. The southern tunnel has a plaque on its west face Dated in 1848, but as the tunnel is shown on earlier tithe maps, that is believed to be a rebuilding date. Workshops and a weighbridge were built near New Line Farm to the east of the road and weathering beds were also located here; these were dumps of newly dug clay which had to weather for up to a year to allow the clay to break down to make it workable. In about 1881 new pits were opened up at Norden to the south east of the New Line Farm works. New track was laid from near the workshop area to these pits, on a route planned to run alongside and to the west of the proposed Wareham to Swanage railway. When the London and South Western Railway line to Swanage was built, a standard gauge exchange siding was laid to allow clay to be transferred from the clay trucks to main- line trucks, but most of the clay continued to be hauled by horses to Middlebere Quay. At the same time a tunnel was provided under the main line railway for use by the plateway to the original workings. In the early 1900s, the line to Norden clay works had been extended over the main line railway to serve clay pits on its western side. This line was extended across the Wareham to Corfe Castle road by a level crossing to serve further clay pits to the north east. However, by this time the plateway's days were numbered. The channel at Middlebere was silting up, limiting the size of vessel that could approach the quay. The company already had a deeper-water quay at Goathorn on the southern shore of Poole Harbour, used for the export of clay from pits at nearby Newton. The Middlebere Plateway was abandoned in about 1907, when it was replaced by the Norden & Goathorn Railway, which connected Fayle's clay works at Norden with their works at Newton and thence to Poole Harbour at Goathorn. N&G; Railway took over much of the plateway's trackbed in the Norden area, including the exchange siding and the bridge over the main line railway. However the plateway's main route to Middlebere Creek, and the tunnels under the railway and road were all abandoned. Description As a plateway, the Middlebere Plateway differed from the edge railway that eventually became the norm, in that the flanges retaining the truck wheels on the line were on the rails (plates) rather than on the wheels. The plates were three feet long, L-shaped and made of cast iron, weighing 40 lb. They were supported on stone sleepers weighing 60-70 lb; the ends of the plates were held down by nails driven into wooden plugs inserted into holes in the sleepers. The gauge is generally quoted as being about 3 feet 9 inches, although some recent archeological investigations suggest it may have been as narrow as 3 feet 6 inches. The clay trucks were flange-less. They were hauled by horses and remained so throughout the line's 100-year life. Two horses worked in tandem pulling 5 wagons weighing almost a ton each and with a 2-ton capacity and making 3 round trips a day, giving an annual total of 9,000-10,000 tons. By 1865 and additional team of horses and wagons had been brought into use and passing places constructed to raise the annual tonnage to 22,000 tons. Horses continued to be used right up until 1946. The plateway was one of the first users of the patent axle that was designed by John Collinge of Bridge Road, Lambeth. This axle was largely used for road vehicles and a few other applications to rail vehicles. It implies that the wheels rotated on fixed axles, and, until its introduction, wheels had to be removed and axle arms greased at least once a day when travelling any distance. Remains A few remains of the Middlebere Plateway are still visible. The quay at Middlebere Creek has gradually fallen into disrepair and almost vanished. Some of the stone sleepers remain in place today, complete with holes where the rails used to be fixed, whilst others have been reused as paving stones at various locations. Others can be found in the walls at Middlebere farm. In many places the route across Hartland moor can be traced. The tunnel under the Wareham to Corfe road is now used by a stream draining the former clay working and is a listed building, although the north portal was buried when the road was realigned in the 1980s. The iron bridge over the main line railway, first built for the plateway and then used by Fayle's Tramway, still stands. The site of the clay works at Norden is now the location of the Norden station of the Swanage Railway, a heritage railway that has taken over the track of the Wareham to Swanage main line railway. The land of old clay processing works now provides a park and ride site whereby visitors can park at Norden and ride the train to Corfe Castle or Swanage. The Purbeck Mineral and Mining Museum is situated beside the station and is dedicated to Purbeck clay industry and its associated tramways on the Norden site.

Curcumin and curcuminoids, though having a structure resembling diferulic acids', are not formed that way but through a condensation process. Just as ferulic acid is not the proper IUPAC name, the diferulic acids also tend to have trivial names that are more commonly used than the correct IUPAC name. Diferulic acids are found in plant cell walls, particularly those of grasses.  Structures  There are currently nine known structures for diferulic acids. They are usually named after the positions on each molecule that form the bond between them. Included in the group are 8,5'-DiFA (DC) (or decarboxylated form) and 8,8'-DiFA (THF) (or tetrahydrofuran form), which are not true diferulic acids, but probably have a similar biological function. The 8,5'-DiFA (DC) lost CO2 during its formation, the 8,8'-DiFA (THF) gained H2O during its formation. 8,5'-DiFA (BF) is the benzofuran form. Ferulic acid can also form trimers and tetramers, known as triferulic and tetraferulic acids respectively. Chemical structures of nine known diferulic acids  Occurrences  They have been found in the cell walls of most plants, but are present at higher levels in the grasses (Poaceae) and also sugar beet and Chinese water chestnut. The 8-O-4'-DiFA tends to predominate in grasses, but 5,5'-DiFA predominates in barley bran. Rye bread contains ferulic acid dehydrodimers. In chufa (tiger nut, Cyperus esculentus) and sugar beet the predominant diferulic acids are 8-O-4'-DiFA and 8,5'-DiFA respectively. 8-5' Non cyclic diferulic acid has been identified to be covalently linked to carbohydrate moieties of the arabinogalactan-protein fraction of gum arabic.  Function  Diferulic acids are thought to have a structural function in plant cell walls, where they form cross-links between polysaccharide chains. They have been extracted attached to a few sugar molecules at both ends, but so far no definitive proof of them linking separate polysaccharide chains has been found. In suspension-cultured maize cells, dimerisation of ferulic acid esterified to polysaccharides occurs mostly in the protoplasm, but may occur in the cell walls when peroxide levels increase due to pathogenesis. In suspension-cultured wheat cells, only the 8,5'-diferulic acid is formed intraprotoplasmically with the other dimers being formed in the cell wall. Preparation Most diferulic acids are not commercially available and must be synthesised in lab. Synthetic routes have been published, but it is often simpler to extract them from plant material. They can be extracted from plant cell walls (often maize bran) by concentrated solutions of alkali, the resulting solution is then acidified and phase separated into an organic solvent. The resulting solution is evaporated to give a mixture of ferulic acid moieties that can be separated by column chromatography. Identification is often by high performance liquid chromatography with a UV detector or by LC-MS. Alternatively they can be derivatised to make them volatile and therefore suitable for GC-MS. Curcumin can be hydrolyzed (alkaline) to yield two molecules of ferulic acid. Peroxidases can produce dimers of ferulic acid, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide through radical polymerization. Uses Diferulic acids are more effective inhibitors of lipid peroxidation and better scavengers of free radicals than ferulic acid on a molar basis. History The first diferulic acid discovered was the 5,5'-diferulic acid, and for a while this was thought to be the only one.

History Moved by pity for prostitutes, Father John Eudes at first attempted to house them under the care of good and pious women. One of these women, Madeleine Lamy persuaded Pere Eudes that more was needed. Three Visitation nuns came to his aid temporarily, and, in 1641, a house was opened at Caen under the title of Refuge of Our Lady of Charity.Ory, Joseph Mary. The Origin of the Order of Our Lady of Charity, Le Couteulx Leader Press, Buffalo, New York, 1918 Other ladies joined them, and, in 1651, the Bishop of Bayeux gave the institute his approbation. In 1664 a Bull of approbation was obtained from Pope Alexander VII. That same year a house was opened at Rennes, and the institute began to spread. When the French Revolution broke out there were seven communities of the order in France.Steele, Francesca. \\"Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Refuge.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 12 Jun. 2013 The traditional religious habit of the Sisters from the Order of Our Lady of Charity was white, with a white scapular, a black veil and a large silver heart on the breast. That habit has been discarded. All the houses of this order are independent of each other, and each has its own novitiate, but the mother-house is still at Caen. The nuns wear a white habit and a large silver cross on the breast. To the three ordinary religious vows they add a fourth, viz., to devote themselves to the reformation of the fallen. The novitiate lasts two years. On 8 July 1855, Sister Jerome Tourneux of Rennes, France, established the first Foundation in North America in Buffalo, New York, and thus began the spread of the Mission of Our Lady of Charity in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In France they had seventeen houses: one each at Caen, Saint-Brieuc, Rennes, La Rochelle, Paris, Versailles, Nantes, Lyon, Valence, Toulouse, Le Mans, Blois, Montauban, Besan√ßon, Valognes, and two at Marseilles; in Italy, one at Loreto; and in Spain, one at Bilbao; and in Austria. The sisters came to England in 1863, building a large purpose built convent at Bartestree near Hereford and by 1910 also had houses at Waterlooville near Portsmouth, Monmouth, Southampton, and Northfield. By 1960 about 1,500 sisters served in forty-four communities of Our Lady of Charity in ten countries. Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd John Eudes had established his houses as separate and autonomous. Sister Mary of Saint Euphrasia was the superior of the house in Tours. The city of Angers asked that Sister Mary Euphrasia establish a Convent of Refuge there. She established a house in an old factory and called it \\"Bon Pasteur\\" (Good Shepherd). In 1831 she was appointed as Mother Superior of the House in Angers. However, neither the house in Tours, nor the one in Nantes was interested in expanding to Angers. Believing that the work would proceed more efficiently under a central administration, in April 1835, she obtained approval from Pope Gregory XVI for the Mother-House at Angers as the home of a separate institute known as Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd. Apostolate Their primary apostolate is to work with \\"women in need.\\" Ministries include: counseling, serving in parishes, counseling troubled teenage girls, day care for children and adults, rehabilitation and nursing care for the ill and elderly, people with AIDS, teaching in schools and religious education programs. Fusion with the Sisters of the Good Shepherd Feeling the need for a restructuring of the congregation, in 1944 an American Federation of sisters was founded, followed by a French Federation in 1945, an Irish Federation in 1948, and an English Federation in 1957. The member monasteries remained autonomous with the Federation President tasked with maintaining communication among member communities. A movement toward a more centralized organization continued to develop. The Latin Union, under a Superior General was formed in 1967. On 21 March 1979, the North American Union Sisters of Our Lady of Charity received its approval from the Holy See. In North America, they are located in: Hamburg & Newburgh, NY; Erie & Pittsburgh, PA; Wheeling, WV; & El Paso, TX; Carrollton, OH; Green Bay, WI; San Diego, CA; and Mexico & Canada.

Hierarchical data can therefore be naturally queried in .QL in a recursive manner. Queries written in .QL are optimised, compiled into SQL and can then be executed on any major relational database management system. .QL query language is being used in SemmleCode to query a relational representation of Java programs. .QL is developed at Semmle Limited and is based on the company's proprietary technology.  Language features  .QL has several language features to make queries concise, intuitive and reusable: * Extensible type hierarchy * Methods and predicates * Definition before use  Example query  The sample query below illustrates use of .QL to query a Java program. This is how one would select all classes that contain more than ten public methods: from Class c, int numOfMethods where numOfMethods = count(Method m m.getDeclaringType()=c and m.hasModifier(\\"public\\")) and numOfMethods > 10 select c.getPackage(), c, numOfMethods In fact, this query selects not only all classes with more than ten public methods, but also their corresponding packages and the number of methods each class has.

The dates of his birth and death have not been ascertained. An elegy which he composed during his youth, upon the Confiscation of the Books of the Law, is supposed by some scholars to refer to the burning of the Talmud in Paris about the year 1242; by others, to the confiscation of the Talmud in Aragon in 1264, as the direct result of the Barcelona controversy. If the latter view is correct, Bedersi may well have flourished about the year 1240 (Leopold Zunz, Z.G., p. 413). As appears from the letter sent by Bedersi to Don Vidal Solomon (·∏§otam Toknit, p. 4), he went early (perhaps in 1273) to Perpignan, where he attended the lectures of Joseph Ezubi. He returned often to Perpignan and took an active part in its communal affairs. A number of his letters, contained in MS. cviii (72) of the Vienna Hofbibliothek, are written to prominent Jews in Barcelona, asking them to aid their less fortunate coreligionists. At one time he lived at Arles, and in 1285, during the war of France with Roussillon, he took refuge in Narbonne. He seems at one time to have been rich, for in a poem he declares that he is independent and writes for his own pleasure. The compiler of his diwan relates that Bedersi sent money to the wandering poet Gorni (Luzzatto, Intro. to ·∏§otam Toknit, p. 4). Bedersi was a prolific writer. Several collections of his poems are still extant in manuscript in various libraries. The most complete manuscript is that in the British Museum, Add. No. 27,168. This contains an elegy on the death of his relative, David of Cabestan; several poems and letters addressed to Todros Abulafia and his companion, Abu al-·∏§asan Saul; poems dedicated to the physician of the king of Castile, Abu al-·∏§asan Me√Ør ibn al-·∏§arit; and the elegy mentioned above. Two of Bedersi's works were published, with an interesting introduction by Luzzatto, by G. Polak, Amsterdam, 1862: *·∏§ereb ha-Mithapeket (A Revolving Sword), a poem of 210 strophes, according to the numerical value of the word = 8 + 200 + 2. The author in this poem gives a brief account of Jewish poetry, the decadence of which he deplores. He praises the makamat (poems) of Al-Hariri of Basra, which he probably knew through the translation of several by Al-·∏§arizi *·∏§otem Toknit (Who Seals the Sum; compare Ezek. xxviii.12), a treatise on Hebrew synonyms. Another poetical work, entitled Bakashat ha-Lamedin, published at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, 1812, was attributed to Abraham Bedersi; but it is probable that this poem was written by his son Jedaiah Bedersi. Bedersi's works show the decadence of Jewish poetry at that time. His style is stiff and unintelligible, though he possessed a thorough knowledge of Hebrew.

Technical Specifications DataPower Appliances contain many specialized hardware components, including ASIC-based IPS, custom encrypted RAID drives, and (optional) hardware security modules. DataPower Appliances operate a single digitally signed firmware containing a Linux-based operating system and application stack. DataPower's firmware runs on a flash storage device. IBM refreshes and enhances the DataPower firmware image every 10‚Äì20 weeks. Users cannot run 3rd party applications on DataPower as they would need a traditional server and operating system. Instead of a traditional filesystem, DataPower runs with a collection of isolated virtual file systems called 'Application Domains.' As a result, DataPower can appear to its client connections to be any type of network file system with any type of folders and links. DataPower firmware is mostly used to perform electronic messaging functions. It can perform transformation and routing of messages as an enterprise service bus or protect web services interfaces and the architecture behind them from attacks. It helps to integrate any two applications by considering them as services. It is platform and language independent.

An outstanding opera singer, she represented the Russian vocal school at its best. Nezhdanova was born in , near Odessa, Ukraine, then in the Russian Empire. In 1899, she entered the Moscow Conservatory. Upon her graduation three years later she joined the Bolshoi Theatre, rapidly becoming its leading soprano. She often sang, too, at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg and also in Kiev and Odessa. Paris heard her in 1912, when she appeared opposite the great tenor Enrico Caruso and Caruso's baritone equivalent, Titta Ruffo. Antonina Nezhdanova Nezhdanova was the dedicatee of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Vocalise, and she was the first performer of the arrangement for soprano and orchestra, with Serge Koussevitzky conducting. She created a number of operatic roles. After the 1917 Russian Revolution she stayed on at the Bolshoi, unlike some of her fellow opera singers, who left their native country for the West. In 1936, she began to teach singing in Moscow and was appointed a professor at the city's conservatory in 1943. She was married to the conductor Nikolai Golovanov and died in Moscow in 1950. Nezhdanova made a number of recordings that display the beauty and flexibility of her voice and the excellence of her technique. She is considered by opera historians and critics to have been one of the finest sopranos of the 20th century.

She was a professor and head of the Department of Bacteriology at Howard University, publishing work on tuberculosis, immunology and dental caries, the response of gut microorganisms to antibiotics, and the blood type of African-Americans. During that period she was promoted to associate professor. Though there are gaps in Howard‚Äôs personnel records, Moore is believed to have continued to teach and conduct research on bacteriology at Howard until she retired in 1973. College years Ruth Ella Moore attended Ohio State University for both of her undergraduate and graduate levels. In 1925, she earned her Bachelor of Science degree, in 1927 her Masters of Science Degree and in 1933 her Ph.D. in Bacteriology. Her dissertation was on the Tuberculosis bacteria and the titles were \\"Studies on Dissociation of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis\\" and \\"A New Method of Concentration on the Tubercule Bacilli as Applied to Sputum And Urine Examination\\". Career During her graduate school years, she taught hygiene and English at Tennessee State College now known as Tennessee State University in Nashville. In 1940, she became assistant Professor of Bacteriology at Howard University College of Medicine. In 1948 she was appointed, and in 1955 she was made Head of the Department of Bacteriology. In 1957, Ruth stepped down from her leadership position but continued to teach and conduct research on bacteriology at Howard University. In 1960, she was appointed associate professor of microbiology. She retired in 1973 while holding position of the associate Professor of emeritus of microbiology until 1990. While in Howard, she conducted studies on blood groups and enterobacteriacea. Throughout her entire career she was a member of the American Public Health Association and the American Society of Microbiology. Moore was the first African-American to join the American Society for Microbiology. Moore was also a member of the American Association of Science, American Society of Immunology, the American Association of Microbiology and the American Public Health Association. Moore retired in 1971. Moore's publications include a 1938 discussion of the immunology of dental caries, publications in the 1950s on blood types in African-Americans. and a 1963 publication on the sensitivity of gut microorganisms to antibiotics. Honors She is believed to be the first African-American woman to earn a PhD in the natural sciences. She earned two additional honorary degrees. They included a doctorate in Literature from Oberlin College and a Doctor of Philosophy from Gettysburg University in 1973. In 2005, US representative Eddie Bernice Johnson introduced a bill recognizing Ruth Ella Moore as well as other scientists in the United States. Personal life Besides being a well known scientist, Ruth Ella Moore was a seamstress. Acquiring the traits from her mother who is a seamstress, Moore dabbled in fashion and loved elegant, classic styles of clothing. Several of Moore's garments were featured in works like The Sewer's Art: Quality, Fashion and Economy in 2009. She constructed garments for all occasions, from day to evening wear, and tailored to draped components. Moore's love for fashion definitely showed in the pieces she wore daily and her love for science also showed in the work she accomplished at Howard University before she unfortunately died in Rockville Maryland at the age of 91 (1994).

These tables, still extant in manuscript (Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris, MS. No. 10,901; Adolf Neubauer, \\"Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.\\" No. 2072, 2), enjoyed a great reputation.

Many manuscripts of these tables were retranslated from Latin into Hebrew. His father David ben Yom-Tov, also called David Bongoron, was identified in the past with the Portuguese Jewish philosopher David ben Yom-Tov ibn Bilia by some scholars, including the nineteenth century scholar Moritz Steinschneider.

Venues in previous years included the adjacent Cinematheque, Eeroni Aleph school and ZOA house. The first ICon was held in autumn 1998. ICon is normally three days long, though in previous years it featured a parallel film festival which lasted longer. The title is a contraction of \\"Israeli Convention\\". Graphically, \\"IC\\" resembles the first letter of the festival's name in Hebrew, hence the capitalization. ICon features a plethora of talks on subjects including literature, science, television, films, specific fandoms and general genre theory as well as writing and art workshops and a host of roleplaying games. The convention encourages cosplay, and includes a masquerade event. It normally features an original film, play or musical created by Israeli science fiction fans. ICon 2013 featured over 270 such events over the 3.5 days period. Rather than a dealers' room, ICon features a dealers' court through the festival lobby and the outdoors areas of the venue. The festival usually features a battle ring where costumed LARP players and visitors can battle against each other with soft simulated weapons. The annual Geffen Award ceremony for Hebrew and translated science fiction and fantasy literature has been held at ICon since 1999. The venue consists of the Eshkol Pais building, which features talks, a makeshift \\"caf√©\\" rest area, a tabletop games room and some of the dealers' court including a second-hand booth where visitors deposit used goods for sale. The Eeroni Aleph adjacent school is used for roleplaying games and allows out-of-town visitors to sleep inside for the duration of the night. Nearby venues, such as ZOA, are sometimes used as well on busier years. Past guests and guests of honor include authors Orson Scott Card, Guy Gavriel Kay, Steven Brust, Neil Gaiman, Daryl Gregory and Brandon Sanderson, as well as actor Chase Masterson and others. Each ICon is centered on a main theme. Themes in past years include identity, discovery, rejuvenation, \\"beyond the mirror\\" and cities. Author Tim Powers fights at the battle ring.

Overview  The nondescript beige structure, which cannot be identified in any way as a Jewish house of worship, is no longer in use. The tiny Jewish community in Bahrain, numbering approximately 35 out of a total population of 700,000, can rarely muster a minyan required for prayer. Nevertheless, Bahrain is one of the only Arab countries in the Persian Gulf with any kind of Jewish community or synagogue. The community also maintains a small Jewish cemetery. History In the late 19th century, Jews from Iraq, and some from Iran and India settled in Bahrain and subsequently established a synagogue. After the 1947 UN Partition Plan which envisaged partitioning Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, three days of protests and marches erupted. On the third day, the demonstrators began rioting. Jewish homes were looted and the only synagogue on the island in the capital city of Manama, was razed to the ground by foreign Arab rioters. Even though the tensions resulted in Jews emigrating to Britain and the United States, another synagogue was built for those who remained. Recently, as the synagogue is no longer in use, the Jewish community wanted to convert the building for another use or give it to charity, but the government would not allow it. They insisted it remained as a synagogue. In 2006, after the roof began to fall in, Abraham David Nonoo, the Jewish community‚Äôs unofficial leader and a member of Bahrain‚Äôs forty-man shura, or parliamentary council, undertook to renovate the synagogue out of his own funds, although Bahrain's Crown Prince Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa has offered to pay for the construction of a new synagogue on the same site.Low profile but welcome: a Jewish outpost in the Gulf , The Independent, 2 November 2007. At the time the government also offered the Jewish community a piece of land to rebuild the old synagogue which was destroyed in 1948 and not rebuilt.

He received an engineering degree from the University of Virginia, entered the ranks of American business executives in two major U.S. corporations, and later purchased and helped preserve historic Chatham Manor in Stafford County, Virginia which, upon his death, he gave to the National Park Service (as well as an adjacent bluff to the local government, which named the resulting park after him). Education and employment Pratt was a farm boy adept at fixing things. After a year at Randolph Macon College, Pratt matriculated at the University of Virginia and received an Engineering Degree in 1902. After beginning his business career with the DuPont Company and, particularly serving with note during World War I in its Washington state plant, Pratt was selected in 1919 by Pierre S. du Pont to work in a corporation newly invested in by du Pont and other significant, wealthy businessmenGeneral Motors Corporation, which was founded in 1908 by William Durant. Pratt was, in effect, DuPont's man on the inside, initially solely looking out for DuPont's interests. Pratt rose to become a member of the corporation's executive committee and, from the 1923 until 1968, served on GM's Board of Directors. He was later a company Vice President and is credited with supporting the idea of holding (as opposed to selling off) what became the Frigidaire Division of GM and encouraging the development of the coolant, Freon. At first, he was assistant to the President of the Company. Later, Alfred Sloan‚Äîone of GM's early executives and later President‚Äîcited John Pratt as \\"one of the best businessmen\\" he had ever known. Unheralded might be another adjective applied to Pratt. In 1931, he bought \\"Chatham Manor\\", an expansive Georgian, Colonial mansion on the Rappahannock River in Stafford County, VA, opposite Fredericksburg as his future retirement home. He paid $150,000 in cash for the property, roughly the equivalent of $2.4 Million in 2020. By moving to \\"Chatham\\", he was‚Äîin effect‚Äîmoving back to his hometown area. =War Resources Board= During World War II, Pratt was one of many \\"Dollar-a-Year\\" men  businessmen who aided adapting the U.S. economy to the war effort. He was appointed by President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt to serve on the War Resources Board.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 9, 12, 68, 80, Random House, New York, NY, 2012. . He later continued his public service as a member of the Lend-Lease Administration, in which capacity he came into contact with important leaders of his day, including United States Secretary of State George C. Marshall who visited Chatham to go duck hunting. In these capacities in Washington, D.C., Pratt also met General (and later president) Dwight D. Eisenhower who was a guest at Chatham. He traveled to London, as well, reporting back to Roosevelt about Britain's condition and readiness for the war. Personal life Pratt and his wife, Lillian, continued the restoration of the historic property throughout much of their lives. After she died in 1947 and he became tired of the constant flow of visitors arriving to tour the property which, in the Colonial era, entertained George Washington and, during the American Civil War, Abraham Lincoln. The extensive gardens, installed by the estate's earlier owners during the 1920s, were such a draw for curious visitors that he actually had them dug up and reinstalled in a more subdued design. Mr. and Mrs. Pratt had been deeply involved in the local community in their later years and were quiet philanthropists supporting University programs in Virginia and college educations for worthwhile community young people who had been identified for their potential by other religious and community leaders. In none of these endeavors did they seek publicity or recognition. Many of the late 20th Century leaders of the Fredericksburg area communities and businesses were later revealed to have been supported in their college education years by the Pratts. The community leaders of this era are only now retiring or, actually, passing away. After his wife died, Pratt continued to socialize with his former childhood friends in Fredericksburg, walking regularly into the city even though he could have afforded a chauffeur and any car in the GM fleet. His rumpled appearance belied his comfortable station in life while he continued his lifelong associations and played in weekly penny-ante poker games with his friends. Lillian Pratt died in 1947 and willed her extensive jewelry collection to the then-new Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia. Since the 1920s, encouraged by a family acquaintance, the businessman Armand Hammer, she had accumulated a large collection of Peter Carl Faberg√© jewelry, including five Faberg√© Imperial Easter Eggs; the Revolving Miniatures, Pelican, Peter the Great, Czarevich, Red Cross with Imperial Portraits examples, as well as pins and bracelets which were being sold by the then-new government of the Soviet Union to raise capital for the Soviet state. This collection, at the time the largest private collection of such items, had been initially acquired through purchases on her Lord & Taylor Department Store charge account. The \\"Lillian Pratt Collection\\" at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts is a key part of that institution's exhibits. Lillian Pratt is buried in Tacoma, Washington. John Lee Pratt's great-nephew was Darrell Forsythe Holmes, Jr., a well-known criminal defense lawyer and author with strong ties to Texas law enforcement where he served as Chief of Police in several cities. He wrote the non-fiction book \\"Marijuana Acquittal\\" among others. Death Upon his death in 1975, \\"Chatham Manor\\" and surrounding were bequeathed to the National Park Service, which now uses the estate for its headquarters facility in the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park as well as a free museum open to the public (but with more limited hours than the grounds and gardens). Pratt also willed a portion of the Chatham estate (an adjacent bluff overlooking the Rappahannock River) to the local community to be used as a park, and which was named in his honor. Pratt also gave a bequest to establish the local YMCA; and in his lifetime made major donations to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. At the time of his death, Fortune magazine listed Pratt as the \\"single largest shareholder\\" in General Motors, and it was reported that Pratt owned approximately 17.4 percent of the company.{citation needed} The remainder of his estate was auctioned, with the proceeds donated to the University of Virginia (his alma mater), Virginia Tech, Washington and Lee University and Johns Hopkins University. His cremated remains rest in Oak Hill Cemetery in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

The group is stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. The 4 OG is a direct descendant of the World War II 4th Fighter Group, the United States Army Air Forces VIII Fighter Command unit formed from the members of the Royal Air Force (RAF) Eagle Squadrons. These fighter squadrons of the Royal Air Force formed prior to the United States entry into World War II with volunteer pilots from the United States. When the United States entered the war these units, and the American pilots in them, were transferred to the United States Eighth Air Force, with the RAF Nos. 71, 121, and 133 Squadrons becoming the 334th, 335th and 336th Fighter Squadrons of the 4th Fighter Group, 65th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command. Today, the 4 OG consists of two operational fighter squadrons, the 335th and 336th; two fighter training squadrons, the 333d and 334th; and two support squadrons. The group provides command and control for two operational F-15E Strike Eagle squadrons and is responsible for conducting the Air Force's only F-15E training operation, qualifying crews to serve in worldwide combat-ready positions. Assigned Units McDonnell Douglas F-15E-46-MC Strike Eagle 88-1704 of the 334th Fighter Squadron The 4th Operations Group (Tail Code: SJ) consists of the following squadrons: * 333d Fighter Squadron \\"Lancers\\" F-15E (Red tail stripe) : Activated on 8 December 1957. F-15E training squadron * 334th Fighter Squadron \\"Fighting Eagles\\" F-15E (Blue tail stripe) : Established 22 August 1942, formerly No. 71 Squadron RAF. F-15E training squadron * 335th Fighter Squadron \\"Chiefs\\" F-15E (Green tail stripe) : Established 22 August 1942, formerly No. 121 Squadron RAF, F-15E operational squadron * 336th Fighter Squadron \\"Rocketeers\\" F-15E (Yellow tail stripe) : Established 22 August 1942, formerly No. 133 Squadron RAF, F-15E operational squadron * 4th Operations Support Squadron : Responsible for all facets of airfield operations, air traffic control, weather, aircrew life support and training, weapons and tactics training, airspace scheduling, range ops and wing flying hour program. History : For additional history, see Eagle Squadrons and 4th Fighter Wing =World War II= Spitfire MK V of the 334th Fighter Squadron, 4th Fighter Group in 1942. Note the RAF 71 Eagle Squadron markings on the fuselage with the USAAF emblem overlaid over the RAF roundel. North American P-51D Mustangs of the 335th Fighter Squadron, 1944 335th FS P-51D, 1944 The unit was activated in England in September 1942. The initial cadre for the group were former U.S. members of RAF Eagle Squadrons who had served in combat over Europe from October 1942 to April 1945. The American fliers of the Eagle Squadrons, which had begun fighting ten months before the Attack on Pearl Harbor, were taken into the U.S. Army Air Forces to form the 4th Fighter Group (FG)- based upon VIII Fighter Command order of 12 September 1942. This VIII Fighter Command order originated based upon the recommendation and urgent requirements provided by Brigadier General Hunter and his USAAF staff at RAF Bushey Hall. An official joint RAF/USAAF ceremony was conducted at RAF North Weald, near to the town of Epping, Essex, at noon, Tuesday, 29 September 1942. It was held after a typical brisk English rainstorm that left a misty, overcast sky and wet grounds for the remainder of the day. The ceremony was held adjacent to the airfield administration building on the concrete parking area. Present at this ceremony included USAAF leaders Brigadier General Frank O'Driscoll Hunter and Major General Carl A. Spaatz, Brigadier General Ira C. Eaker, U.S. and English war correspondents, Air Marshal Harold Edwards (RCAF officer), along with Air Chief Marshal Sir Sholto Douglas, RAF. The ceremony officiated both the commissioning of the 4th Fighter Group under the command of Colonel Edward W. Anderson (Manhattan, Kansas) USAAF, and the establishment of the airfield as a new airbase of the 4th Fighter Group. With such ceremonies presentation of awards are usually conducted.. Also, Along with Colonel Anderson, Brigadier General Hunter stepped forward and awarded these combat-experienced American pilots. Squadron commander William James Daley (Hemphill, Texas) was made a major in the USAAF and given his USAAF pilot wings, commencing command of the 335th FS that afternoon. The two other squadron commanders promoted to major and given their USAAF pilot wings of the USAAF were Carroll Warren McColpin (Buffalo New York) of the 336th FS, and Gregory Agustus \\"Gus\\" Daymond (Great Falls, Montana) of the 334th FS. The remaining 31 American pilots received their USAAF wings, as well. Following this award presentation, Air Marshal Douglas, who had earlier complained to Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold accusing these very same combat-experienced American pilots as prima donnas, stepped forward to the BBC and U.S. microphones with his typed-speech in hand and spoke to the assembled joint air force officers and enlisted personnel standing at attention on the wet concrete flightline.Arnold, Henry H. Global Mission (New York: Harper & Row, 1949), p. 219 Paying tribute to these American pilots in his typical clipped, political speech he said: Douglas was followed by General Spaatz who gave an official welcome to his battle-proven American fighter pilots: After these two speeches, the Royal Air Force and newly established 4th Fighter Group personnel marched by in \\"pass & review\\". Following the closing of this ceremony, pilots and guests were shown the new USAAF star (refer to: USAAF unit identification aircraft markings) that was earlier painted over the RAF emblem on the Spitfire V aircraft of the newly created 334th, 335th and 336th USAAF squadrons. The 4th Fighter Group began its historic rise to fame primarily following the appointment of Donald Blakeslee as the Group's Commander on 1 January 1944. Blakeslee successfully had the group re-equipped with Mustangs, and it is almost certain that on 6 March 1944, he was the first American plane over Berlin in his Mustang. The Fourth destroyed more enemy planes in the air and on the ground than any other fighter group of Eighth Air Force. The group operated first with Spitfires but changed to P-47s in March 1943 and to P-51s in late February early March 1944. On numerous occasions the 4 FG escorted B-17/B-24 bombers that attacked factories, submarine pens, V-weapon sites, and other targets in France, the Low Countries, or Germany. The group went out sometimes with a small force of bombers to draw up the enemy's fighters so they could be destroyed in aerial combat. At other times the 4th attacked the enemy's air power by strafing and dive-bombing airfields. They also hit troops, supply depots, roads, bridges, rail lines, and trains. The unit participated in the intensive campaign against the German Air Force and aircraft industry during Big Week, 20‚Äì25 February 1944. They received a Distinguished Unit Citation for aggressiveness in seeking out and destroying enemy aircraft and in attacking enemy air bases during the period 5 March ‚Äì 24 April 1944. The 4 FG flew interdiction and counter-air missions during the invasion of Normandy in June 1944 and supported the airborne invasion of the Netherlands in September. They participated in the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945, and provided cover for the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. =Cold War= 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group North American F-86 Sabres, South Korea, 1951 The 4th Fighter Group was inactivated at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, on 10 November 1945. The unit was reactivated at Selfridge Field, Michigan, 9 September 1946, as the United States began to rearm due to Cold War pressures. On 15 August 1947, under the Wing/Base (Hobson) reorganization plan, the 4th Fighter Wing was formed, and the 4th Fighter Group became its subordinate operational flying component. Following a period of training with F-80 Shooting Star aircraft, the 4th Fighter Group transitioned to F-86 Sabre jets in March 1949, just in time for advanced training and entry into the Korean War. In December 1950, the 4th Fighter Wing's flying component (now the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group) was the first unit to commit F-86 Sabre jets to that conflict. Lt Col Bruce H. Hinton shot down a MiG-15 on 17 December during the first Sabre mission of the war. Four days later, Lt Col John C. Meyer, a World War II ace, led a flight of eight sabres against 15 MiGs in the first major all-jet fighter battle in history. The flight downed six MiGs without sustaining any losses. By the end of the war airmen of the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Group had destroyed 502 enemy aircraft (54 percent of the total), becoming the top fighter unit of the Korean War. Twenty-four pilots achieved ace status. With the 4th Fighter- Interceptor Wing, the group moved to Japan following the Korean armistice in 1953, continuing training and tours to Korea. The group was inactivated on 8 December 1957 with its component squadrons assigned directly to the wing as the Air Force reorganized its wings into the tri-deputate structure. =Modern era= 4th Operations Group McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagles 89-0495 (336 FS), 88-1704 (334 FS) and 89-0485 (333 FS) On 22 April 1991, the 4th Operations Group was activated as a result of the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing implementing the USAF objective wing organization. Upon activation, the 4 OG retained the lineage and history of the 4th Fighter Group. The 4 OG was assigned the 334th, 335th and 336th Fighter Squadrons upon activation, all equipped with the F-15E Strike Eagle. In addition to the objective wing organization, the 4 TFW became the Air Force's first composite wing and was redesignated the 4th Wing. The 4th Wing incorporated under it all the people, KC-10 aircraft, and assets of the 68th Air Refueling Wing, a Strategic Air Command unit, with the 344th and 911th Air Refueling Squadron (ARS) being assigned to the 4 OG. With the reorganization of the USAF major command structure, the unit's parent organization became part of the new Air Combat Command on 1 June 1992. More changes occurred in the early 1990s. The 911 ARS was reassigned to Air Mobility Command bases in 1994 and 1995 and the F-15E formal training unit moved to Seymour Johnson in 1994 and 1995. The 333d Fighter Squadron returned to Seymour Johnson to accommodate the training mission and was assigned to the 4 OG. To accommodate the need to train more F-15E aircrews, the 334th Fighter Squadron became a training squadron on 1 January 1996. Fewer resources and the need to use all Air Force assets to meet increased operational commitments called for yet another reorganization as the 20th Century came to a close. The expeditionary aerospace force concept was implemented to conform to the Air Force vision to organize, train, equip, deploy and sustain itself in the 21st Century global security environment. Under the concept, the 4 OG is one of two on-call rapid response aerospace expeditionary groups. The Fourth was the first to assume this on-call mission on 1 October 1999. =Global War on Terrorism= In October 2001, in response to the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States, the 4 OG began flying Operation NOBLE EAGLE sorties, the first of its kind for the wing, providing coastal protection for Homeland Defense. In January 2002, the 4 OG arrived in Kuwait in support of Operations SOUTHERN WATCH and ENDURING FREEDOM, flying missions over Iraq and Afghanistan. On 1 March 2002, Operation ANACONDA was launched, and the group's mission was to provide close air support into Afghanistan. Operation ANACONDA ended 21 March 2002 with the 4 OG's greatest highlight being their performance at Roberts Ridge. Members of the 335th Fighter Squadron successfully suppressed enemy fire from al-Qaida troops, as Army and Air Force personnel retrieved stranded and fallen comrades. In January and February 2003, the 4th Operations Group joined other operational units in Southeast Asia. Two F-15E fighter squadrons deployed to Southwest Asia in support of OSW, which would later transition into support for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. On 18 April 2003, members of the 4th Operations Group returned to Seymour Johnson AFB after contributing to the initial U.S. led coalition invasion in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM.

It stars William Joyce, Heather Hewitt and Walter Coy. The film was shot entirely in Florida under the title Caribbean Adventure to disguise from potential investors the fact that it was a zombie film.Weaver, Tom. Del Tenney Interview in Return of the B Science Fiction and Horror Heroes: The Mutant Melding of Two Volumes of Classic Interviews, pg. 352, McFarland, 2000. The movie failed to find a distributor and was shelved until 1971 when producer/director/distributor Jerry Gross bought it and retitled it to form the exploitational-sounding double-bill I Drink Your Blood and I Eat Your Skin. The film follows the adventures of a playboy novelist who travels to Voodoo Island in the Caribbean to research a new book. While there he unexpectedly encounters a voodoo cult, whose leader intends to take over the world with an army of zombies.  Plot  Adventure novelist and playboy Tom Harris (Joyce) is sent from Miami Beach to remote Voodoo Island in the Caribbean to gather material for a new book. Harris's publisher Duncan Fairchild (Dan Stapleton) and Fairchild's wife Coral (Betty Hyatt Linton) accompany him. As they near the island, their small airplane runs out of fuel. Tom takes the controls from pilot Enrico and lands perfectly on a narrow beach. Tom sets out alone for a house he spotted from the air. On the way he stops to watch a young blonde woman swim naked in a jungle pond. Suddenly a tall zombie appears. Tom yells to warn her. He dives in and swims toward the zombie as she swims in the opposite direction. But Tom can't find the zombie. He asks a fisherman for help. The zombie, wielding a machete, attacks them and decapitates the fisherman. Tom fires four bullets into him to no effect. The zombie runs away when armed men arrive in a Jeep. The leader of the men introduces himself as Charles Bentley (Coy). When Tom asks him about zombies, Charles says there are none and that the islanders are \\"a very simple people\\" who can't comprehend that a man could be \\"deranged of mind, a homicidal maniac.\\" Back at the plane, Duncan, Coral and Enrico are frightened by islanders who are approaching in a threatening manner. Tom and Charles arrive. Charles orders the islanders to secure the plane. He introduces himself to Duncan as the overseer of Voodoo Island, which is owned by the never-seen Lord Carrington. They go to Charles's house. As Coral and Duncan admire the tropical sunset, Tom warns them that not all is as lovely as it seems. He asks the housekeeper about voodoo drums and human sacrifice, but she is a member of the voodoo cult and feigns ignorance. Before dinner that night, Tom meets the woman he saw swimming. She is Janine Biladeau (Hewitt), the daughter of scientist Dr. Augustus Biladeau (Robert Stanton). As the others gather Tom tells them of the zombie attack and says, \\"I heard a rumor there's an army of walking dead on this island.\\" Augustus immediately dismisses the notion, saying that the islanders use a plant-based narcotic that can cause physical and mental problems. Tom and Janine go for a walk in the moonlight. Zombies attack them and carry off Janine. Tom rescues her and escorts her back to the house. Privately, Charles tells Tom that Janine is at risk of being sacrificed because she is a blonde virgin. Janine and Tom fall into bed. Tom asks her to leave the island with him and the others the next day. But she refuses because she won't leave her father behind. Meanwhile, the cult performs a ceremony presided over by the masked Papa Neybo. The next morning, Tom tells Duncan to gather everyone at the plane so that they can leave. Janine has decided to go with them and to ask Augustus to leave as well. She takes Tom to Augustus's lab but before they can enter her friend Fernando warns them that Janine will be kidnapped and sacrificed that night. Augustus is in his lab experimenting with irradiated snake venom, which he hopes will cure cancer. He injects a man with it and the man immediately transforms into a zombie. Augustus asks Tom to take Janine away but says that it's too late for him to leave. Zombies attack the lab. Janine and Tom flee toward the beach. Tom, Duncan and Enrico manhandle the plane into the proper orientation for take-off. But zombies grab Janine and Coral. As Enrico starts the plane's engine, the tall zombie walks into its spinning propeller carrying a box of explosives. The resulting blast kills Enrico and destroys both airplane and zombie. Tom and Duncan dive into the sea to escape the zombies pursuing them. Duncan and Tom swim until they find a motor boat. They then disguise themselves as voodoo cultists and go to the ceremony to save Janine. Unknown to them, however, Augustus is watching. Just as Papa Neybo is about to behead Janine, Augustus throws a knife, killing Papa Neybo and revealing him to be Charles. Tom, Janine, Coral , Duncan and Augustus race back to the lab, the cultists and zombies giving chase. Augustus rigs his equipment so that it will blow up and destroy Voodoo Island, ending, he says, Charles's \\"insane\\" plan to take over the world with his army of indestructible zombies. As they escape in the boat, two cultists clamber aboard. Augustus is stabbed in the back before both cultists are killed. Dying, Augustus explains that the zombies are the accidental result of his experiments and when Charles discovered this, he hatched his scheme for world conquest. Augustus dies, the island explodes and the others sail back to Miami Beach.

It is a regional film, defined by regional horror film specialist Brian Albright as one that is \\"(a) filmed outside of the general professional and geographic confines of Hollywood; (b) produced independently; and (c) made with a cast and crew made up primarily of residents of the states in which the film was shot.\\" Although set on an island in the Caribbean, the movie was filmed in Miami Beach and Key Biscayne, Florida. Academic film critic Peter Dendle notes several problems that point to the production phase of I Eat Your Skin. He writes that \\"All aspects of writing, staging, and dialog are hopelessly contrived.\\" And as to the zombies themselves, he says that \\"The make-up effect consists of a coating of plaster over the face and neck (which apparently doesn't reflect decomposition, since it appears so quickly\\" and quotes James O'Neill as referring to them in his book Terror on Tape as \\"bug-eyed, crud-faced zombies\\". Tenney's original intent was to release the film - then known as Zombies - on a double-bill with Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster. I Eat Your Skin was produced on a $120,000 budget but didn't find a distributor and sat unreleased for six years. Tenney eventually sold the film to Gross for $40,000. Film critic and psychometrist Bryan Senn notes that \\"Even in 1964, shooting a horror film in black-and-white and expecting to find a decent distributor was an act of pure optimism.\\" Senn adds that when Tenney was asked in an interview what he thought of I Eat Your Skin, he \\"laughingly admitted, 'I didn't like it very much; I thought it was sort of silly.'\\" In another interview, Tenney said that the film was shot in three weeks, not his \\"usual\\" two weeks because Twentieth Century-Fox required him to use a union production crew. If he didn't, he said, the company wouldn't distribute the movie. Tenney felt that the union members were \\"slow and uncooperative.\\" He also said that delays were caused by a hurricane and by members of the cast and crew needing medical treatment for snakebites and illnesses contracted in Florida swamps during filming. I Eat Your Skin was given \\"parental warning\\" ratings by two organizations, a GP rating by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and an A-III rating by the Catholic News Service.  Distribution  I Eat Your Skin premiered in Los Angeles on 5 May 1971. It was distributed by Cinemation Industries to drive-in theatres with I Drink Your Blood on a \\"mandatory\\" double-bill; i.e., theatre owners were required to show both films as a double feature. I Eat Your Skin has had a long life on television and in revival theatres. On TV, Elvira's Movie Macabre aired the film twice, the first time in 1981 when the program was still a local show in Los Angeles and again in 2011 when the program was in nationwide syndication. It was also shown on Temple University TV in July 2016 as part of the Saturday Night Fright Special. And the non-profit Arroyo Channel in Pasadena, California ran the film in July 2018 on its Horror Host Theatre-Bordello of Horror program. Recent theatrical screenings include the Mahoney Drive-In in Lehighton, Pennsylvania in October 2015 and Quentin Tarantino's New Beverley Cinema in Los Angeles in January 2017. It was also screened as part of the Majestic Science Theatre 3000 film series at the Majestic Theatre in Corvallis, Oregon in October 2018.  Reception  A complaint made by reviewers is that despite the title I Eat Your Skin, no skin is eaten during the film. British film critic Phil Hardy has little to say about the film, good or bad. He notes that after failing to be distributed \\"for seven years,\\" it was \\"put on a double-feature programme advertised as 'Two great blood horrors to rip out your guts.'\\" In The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Dendle writes \\"Never mind the title - this is as mild as horror gets.\\" But he goes on to say that even I Eat Your Skin has its good moments. For example, \\"In an anomalously creative scene, a zombie blows up the protagonists' plane by casually walking into the propeller while holding a box of explosives - a zombie suicide bomber.\\" A review by Senn is also mixed. He writes that \\"Compared to the mean-spirited I Drink Your Blood, Tenney's co- feature is downright enjoyable\\" with zombies that \\"provide a few genuine shudders, and so fulfill the first rule of zombie cinema - that dead people should be scary.\\" But he finds little good to say about the film's technical aspects. He calls the jazz score \\"intrusive and quite often inappropriate,\\" says the movie is \\"flatly photographed and poorly lit\\" and opines that I Eat Your Skin \\"plays just below the competency level. Most scenes had to be overdubbed, and the poor-quality sound and (mis)matching show.\\" Critic Glenn Kay damns the film with faint praise. After noting the \\"bad effects, horrible dialogue, and a Muzak-inspired score,\\" he calls the movie \\"a goofball flick\\" and a \\"concoction [that] is fascinating, and like so many other films of the 1960s, it's almost entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good way.\\" British critic Jamie Russell's review is a bit harsher. He writes that I Eat Your Skin is a \\"laughable voodoo-esque tale\\" with \\"woeful zombies\\" that was \\"shelved for reasons obvious to anyone who has had the misfortune of sitting through it.\\" But he points out the film's historical place as part of the \\"bumper crop\\" of post-Night of the Living Dead movies, although adding that most of these movies \\"have slid into (mostly) deserved obscurity.\\" BoxOffice magazine thought little of the film at the time of its release, calling it \\"as old- fashioned as any B picture made in the Forties\\" and noting that \\"There is very little anyone could find remotely objectionable here, even a 'nude' swim scene being made an obvious cover-up.\\" It rated I Eat Your Skin as \\"fair\\" on its five-point very- poor-to-very-good scale, with The New York Daily News calling it \\"very poor.\\" In a review of the eight-film DVD box set Mad Monster Rally, David Cornelius of DVD Talk writes that \\"The film (...) went undistributed for six long years, and one look explains why: it's an utterly square attempt at early-60s hipness with a jazzy score and a hero (...) who fancies himself a [Sean Connery]-era James Bond, surrounding himself with platinum blondes.\\" Cornelius goes on to say that \\"Tenney pads the picture with a couple exploitation scenes of witch doctor rituals, and we fall asleep\\". Paul Pritchard of DVD Verdict simply calls I Eat Your Skin \\"just the type of cheap crap that sullies the good name of exploitation cinema.\\" References in Popular Culture A drive-in theater sign in the 2018 film The Other Side of the Wind advertises a double feature of I Drink Your Blood and I Eat Your Skin.

Lambert is perhaps best known today for making the second-oldest playable sound recording (1878) on his own version of the phonograph. Lambert also invented a typewriter on which the keyboard consists of one single piece. Work Lambert was born in Lyon, France; he relocated to the United States in 1876 and became a U.S. citizen in 1893. Twelve years after arriving in the U.S., Lambert, along with a friend John Thomson, founded The Thomson Water Meter Co. to manufacture their design of a water meter. In 1878 or 1879 he built his own version of Edison's sound recording device, the Phonograph, and recorded himself calling out the hours for an Experimental Talking Clock he was developing for the Ansonia Clock Company in Connecticut. However, the attempts to make a commercially viable \\"phonograph clock\\" proved unsuccessful. After being restored by Aaron Cramer, Lambert's talking clock is currently at the National Watch and Clock Museum in Columbia, PA, and is listed in The Guinness Book of World Records and in The Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound as the world's oldest playable recording. Until 2008 it was considered to be the oldest surviving sound recording but a phonautogram of Au Clair de la Lune by √âdouard-L√©on Scott de Martinville from 1860 has been found to pre-date it. However, Lambert's recording is still the oldest which can be played with its own original device, unlike the phonautogram which was played by optically scanning it and using a computer to process the scan into a digital audio file. Lambert completed his main invention, a typewriter on which the keyboard consists of one single piece. He sold it to the Gramophone Co. Ltd., for which he received US$20,000. Lambert's water meter company was sold outright to the Neptune Water Meter Co. and Lambert received $800,000. During his career he registered over 30 patents for, among other things, typewriters, water meters, a voting machine, and a double-decked car.

The settlement used to be a part of G√°rdony but declared its independence in December 1997. The settlement is first mentioned in writing in 1239, when villa Nowa (Nova) belonged to the V√©rtes estates of the Cs√°k clan. In 1447 it is mentioned as a noble name as Wyfalw (√öjfalu). The Family Zichy appeared as the landlord in √öjfalu during Turkish occupation. After the Turkish rule the serfs of Sereg√©lyes rented the land for some time. In 1784 the owner of the estate, J√°nos Zichy, the son of Ferenc Zichy had a castle built in √öjfalu and established a deer-park. The phrase Zichy in the name of the settlement refers to these earlier landlords, the members of the Zichy family. The hunting residence of de count is also in the village; currently the Mayor's Office functions in this building, therefore the building can only be observed from outside. The park and the forest of the castle offer active relaxation.

The map of Zichy√∫jfalu from 3rd Military Mapping Survey of Austria-Hungary. The name √öjfalu denotes a newly founded settlement. The distinctive anterior constituent of the settlement's name, the word 'Zichy' is a reference to the one-time landowners of the area, the members of the Zichy family. The first written mention of the settlement's name goes back to 1239, when Villa Nowa (Nova) was part of the V√©rtes estate of the Cs√°k clan. In 1447 the name of the settlement appeared as Wyfalw (√öjfalu), a nobiliary forename. The members of the Zichy family became the local landowners as early as the period of the Turkish Conquest. The Hungarian landowners in this period lived in Gy≈ër and the Turkish ones in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. After the expulsion of the Turks the area was leased to the villeins of Sereg√©lyes, who, in 1717 requested the renewal of the leasing contract because they could not make a living from their lands The boundaries of √öjfalupuszta and the neighbouring estates were fixed in 1745. In 1784 Ferenc Zichy became the landowner of the farmstead. In this period it consisted of six houses, in which 18 families, a total of 91 people lived. √öjfalupuszta was affiliated to the chapter of Sereg√©lyes. The census of 1786/87 mentioned 61 local inhabitants. In the middle of the 19th century √öjfalupuszta (called Zichy√∫jfalu from 1898 onward) was characterised by feudal backwardness. Development was blocked by the existence of the feudal estate and no improvement occurred until capitalism began to develop. Progress was dependent on the development of the estate and due to this fact it was very slow. The inhabitants of √öjfalu were also dependent on the estate for their living and they were mostly household servants and daily workers. There were no villeins in the settlement, which meant that there were no peasant movements either. The number of inhabitants depended on the demand of the labour market. √öjfalu in this period was administered from Sereg√©lyes. The landowner also lived at Sereg√©lyes, and he was also the owner of several other farmsteads in the vicinity of the market town. The area of the √öjfalu farmstead was 2721 acres, out of which 2100 acres were ploughland, 417 acres meadow and 204 acres pasture. The √öjfalu estate had no swamps, orchards, vineyards or large wooded areas. It was the members of the Zichy family who launched the capitalistic development of their estate in the middle of the 1870s. They recognised the outstanding potentials of their land and utilised these qualities. The land was extremely fertile and yielded good crop. Corn production and animal husbandry were the most significant occupations in the area. Payment at √öjfalu did not differ from payments labourers received elsewhere for agricultural work. Agricultural workers were most often paid in kind. The members of the Zichy family achieved outstanding economic results at the end of the 19th century. Their income on the other hand did not contribute to the social and economic rise of the estate workers. The majority of agricultural workers in this period was from Sereg√©lyes and because of this their revolts always coincided with those ones at Sereg√©lyes. The agrarian movements were common in the area from 1897-1906. The landowners spent their income on their own good. J√°nos Zichy had a mansion built at √öjfalu and established a menagerie. As a shareholder he took part in the construction works of the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r-Pusztaszabolcs railway line. He also planned to build a post office at √öjfalu. Cultural life in these circumstances was under the influence of the church. The majority of √öjfalu's population was Roman Catholic with Calvinists in minority. Both religious congregations were administered from Sereg√©lyes until as late as 1949. The school was run by the Roman Catholics, but the children of Calvinist families were also allowed to attend it. In the 1870s J√°nos Zichy donated an annual sum of 400 forints for school maintenance. When this support was withdrawn by him, the school ceased to operate in the village. Following this there was no permanent village school at √öjfalu for two and a half decades. The establishment of a loading platform at the railway station of √öjfalu and the construction of a narrow- gauge railway line made the selling of agricultural products easy and the production intensive. Around 1900 the capital became the main market for the agricultural products grown at √öjfalu. During the war J√°nos Zichy leased his estate to tenants. In the last war month, in October 1918 there was a good deal of tension felt among the inhabitants of the settlement. In the first weeks of the Soviet republic of 1919 the farmstead became an independent cooperative. From the mid-20s onward Zichy once again leased his property to tenants. The area got in the centre of 2nd world war military activities from 1944 onward and the fights lasted until the end of the war. The population was evacuated and the armed struggles came to an end only on 21 March 1945. In the spring of 1946 the idea of becoming independent was raised in the village, but it was opposed by the authorities at Sereg√©lyes as well as by the county administrators. Local inhabitants found employment on the state farm. The leaders of the farm were able and willing to support the settlement financially as well. Permanent workers were settled down in the village, and, as a result, the number of local inhabitants began to grow. New settlers were given not only job opportunities but also housing and building sites. Large- scale construction began. Due to the rise of population figures local affairs could no longer be directed from Sereg√©lyes, another settlement of the area. The establishment of a local office of administration did not improve the situation either. In the mid-1950s local economy was so strong that it could take its share from public duties. The problems of education were also about to be solved A new school building was erected in the village from 1957‚Äì59 and it has been functioning as a school up to now. The electrification of the settlement failed in 1948, but in 1956 √öjfalu was linked to the national network. The number of inhabitants was continuously on the rise and because of this the question of administrative changes had to be raised in this period. About 80% of the village population was employed by the State Farm of Ag√°rd. Ag√°rd, as well as G√°rdony had a tremendous influence on life at √öjfalu. The participants of the Village Assembly on 14 September 1962 voted for the unification of G√°rdony and √öjfalu. From the originally 2434-acre area of √öjfalu 1689 acres were annexed to G√°rdony. After unification the settlement underwent a period of development. Several streets were established and paved in the village, sidewalks were also paved. The inhabitants also participated in the programme of development and they did a lot of voluntary work. Shopping facilities also improved. Village shops were formerly run by the agricultural cooperative of Sereg√©lyes, and now they were taken over by the local √ÅF√âSZ (cooperative). The road leading from the railway station to Csirib major was paved and a regular bus service was operated between √öjfalu and G√°rdony, the administrative centre. In the 1970s the local inhabitants began to leave the settlement. This was a steady process and giving out new building sites did not improve the situation. In the period after the changing of the political system this tendency slowed down, since it became increasingly difficult for people to find jobs in the industrial plants nearby. Transport was also increasingly problematic and the inhabitants had difficulties in reaching the administrative centre or the mayor's office. Local inhabitants were increasingly confined to the area of Zichy√∫jfalu. This is why they were more and more aware of the fact that the joint local government of G√°rdony and Zichy√∫jfalu did not pay enough attention to the well being of Zichy√∫jfalu and did not spend enough money on them. No capital was invested in this part of the settlement and no new projects were initiated. The opinion of the local inhabitants was that they could benefit from a new local government, the representatives of which would consider Zichy√∫jfalu's needs. In addition to these changes the economic preconditions for becoming independent were also present in the village.

It portrays the moment in which the hunter Actaeon bursts in where the goddess Diana and her nymphs are bathing. Diana is furious, and will turn Actaeon into a stag, who is then pursued and killed by his own hounds, a scene Titian later painted in his The Death of Actaeon (National Gallery). Diana is the woman on the right side of the painting. She is wearing a crown with a crescent moon on it and is being covered by the dark skinned woman who may be her servant. The nymphs display a variety of reactions, and a variety of nude poses. In 2008‚Äì2009, the National Gallery, London and National Galleries of Scotland successfully campaigned to acquire the painting from the Bridgewater Collection for ¬£50 million. As a result, Diana and Actaeon will remain on display in the UK, and will alternate between the two galleries on five-year terms. To 2005 Diana and Actaeon is part of a series of seven famous canvases, the \\"poesies\\", depicting mythological scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses painted for Philip II of Spain (after Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor had declined Titian's offer to paint them for him).Brigstocke, 180 and 183-4 The work remained in the Spanish royal collection until 1704, when King Philip V gave it to the French ambassador. It was soon acquired by Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans, nephew of Louis XIV, and Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV, for his collection, one of the finest ever assembled. After the French Revolution, the Orleans collection was sold to a Brussels dealer by Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans in 1791, two years before he was guillotined.Brigstocke, 11 This dealer then exhibited many pictures from the collection (including the Titians) in London. The largest share of the collection was thus bought in 1798 by the coal-magnate Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, including this painting, Titian's Diana and Callisto (from the same mythological series of seven paintings), eight paintings by Poussin, three Raphaels and Rembrandt's Self-Portrait, aged 51. The third Duke of Bridgewater was probably inspired to buy the paintings by his nephew, Earl Gower, the ancestor of the Dukes of Sutherland. Certainly, on Bridgewater's death five years after the purchase, he bequeathed the Titians and the rest of the collection to Gower, who put it on display to the public in his London house ‚Äì it has been on public display ever since. On first seeing the collection there, William Hazlitt wrote \\"I was staggered when I saw the works ... A new sense came upon me, a new heaven and a new Earth stood before me.\\". On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the collection was moved from London to Scotland. Between 1945‚Äì2009, the Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto (with other paintings from the collection, known collectively as \\"the Bridgewater loan\\" or \\"the Sutherland Loan\\"The loan includes a total of 26 paintings, sixteen from the Orl√©ans Collection. ‚Äì Brigstocke, 11) were on long-term display at the National Gallery of Scotland, in Edinburgh. As well as Hazlitt, during their time on public display they have inspired artists such as JMW TurnerPaul Hills, \\"Titian's Fire: Pyrotechnics and Representations in Sixteenth-Century Venice\\", Oxford Art Journal 2007 30(2), pages 185‚Äì204 and Lucian Freud ‚Äî Freud described the pair as \\"simply the most beautiful pictures in the world\\". 2008‚Äìpresent The Sutherland collection has passed by descent to the 7th Duke of Sutherland, (most of whose wealth is contained in the paintings collection), but in late August 2008 the 7th Duke announced that he wished to sell some of the collection in order to diversify his assets.He had previously sold another Titian from the loan ‚Äî the Venus Anadyomene ‚Äî to the NGS in 2000. He had offered them as a pair to the British national galleries at ¬£100 million (a third of their overall estimated market price) if they could demonstrate, by the end of 2008, the ability to raise that sum ‚Äî if not, the pair or other paintings from the Bridgewater collection would be put on public auction early in 2009. Within days of the Duke's decision, the NGS and the National Gallery, London had announced they would combine forces to raise the sum, initially in the form of ¬£50 million (or a demonstration that this money could be raised) to purchase Diana and Actaeon and paid over three years in instalments and then ¬£50 million for Diana and Callisto paid for similarly from 2013. Though the campaign received some criticism for the Duke's motives or (from John Tusa and Nigel Carrington of the University of the Arts London) for distracting from funding art students, it gained press support from both the tabloid and broadsheet print media in the UK ‚Äì imitative nude photoshoots of it were featured in both The Sun (using the newspaper's Page 3 models photoshopped onto the painting) and The Mirror (including the actor Kim Cattrall and featured in a piece by Andrew Graham-Dixon on The Culture Show). On 14 October 2008 the appeal received ¬£1 million from the Art Fund and on 19 November this was followed by ¬£10 million from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. From 22 October to 14 December 2008Originally running until 30 November, the exhibition was extended by public demand on 19 November. it was put on display in Room 1 of the National Gallery in London to aid the public appeal ‚Äì the only other painting in this temporary exhibition was the related The Death of Actaeon from the London National Gallery's collection, and they were illustrated by the relevant passages from Book 3 of Ovid's Metamorphoses in the John Dryden translation. Speculation began when the original 31 December deadline passed without definite news and the Scottish Government's announcement of a contribution of ¬£17.5 million in January 2009 triggered a political row, with Ian Davidson questioning the deal at a time of economic hardship. There was also controversy over attempts to dilute the guarantee that the duke would sell no other of the paintings from the Sutherland Loan should the two Titians be bought. However, on 2 February 2009 it was announced that, thanks to the deadline being extended to raise more funds and finalise the payment plan for Diana and Callisto, the ¬£50 million had been raised and Diana and Actaeon would be acquired. The final sum was made up of ¬£12.5 million from the Scottish Government, ¬£7.4 million from public donations, ¬£12.5 million from the National Galleries in London, ¬£10 million from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, ¬£2 million from the Monument Trust, ¬£4.6 million from the National Galleries of Scotland and ¬£1 million was secured from the Art Fund. Diana and Actaeon will thus be displayed in Scotland for five years, then in London alongside The Death of Actaeon for five years, on an alternating basis.

The company was previously named Chelsea Roller Mill. They are known for their products being packaged in a recognizable, small box with the brand's logo in blue. Jiffy was created as the first prepared baking mix in the United States by Mabel White Holmes. The company is now run and managed by her grandson, Howdy Holmes, a former Indianapolis 500 and CART driver. Holmes became the company's CEO in 1995. In March 2013, the company had around 350 employees, and in 2015 employs about 300 workers and produces 1.6 million boxes of its products each day. Its corn muffin mix accounts for 91 percent of the company's retail sales, and the company's retail market in October 2013 was $550 million. History  Various Jiffy mix products, date unknown Chelsea Milling Company is a family-operated company with roots in the flour milling business dating back to 1802. Originally a commercial operation that sold only to other businesses, its first baking mix designed for sale to consumers was created in the spring of 1930 by then-owner Mabel White Holmes. At the time, it was marketed as a way to make biscuits that was \\"so easy even a man could do it.\\" Operations Most of the company's products are handled, processed and produced in-house, which includes grain storage, the grinding of grains into flour, product mixing and box manufacturing. Equipment repair is typically performed by company personnel. A significant amount of product ingredients are sourced from Michigan-raised crops, including \\"most of the wheat and some of the sugar.\\" Some sugar and shortening is imported from the states of Illinois and Indiana. The company began offering free tours of its facilities and operations to the public in the 1960s, and continues to do so today. Expansion corn muffin mix In 2008, the company began expansion into the food service and institutional industries due to a decline in the home-baking products market. In 2015, this expansion effort was significantly increased, in order to better-enable the company to fulfill the needs of these industries and markets. Expansion plans were in part based upon company projections predicting that many company employees will be retiring between 2006 and 2018. In 2015, 173 of the company's employees are qualified for retirement. Expansion plans include the introduction and implementation of more modern equipment, which requires fewer personnel to operate, and an increased capacity for storage. In 2013, as part of the plans to keep the company moving forward into the future, a new research and development facility was built that cost over $6 million. The company plans for the expansions to conclude by fall 2017. In 2013, Chelsea Milling Company produced 180 million boxes of Jiffy mix during their busy season, which runs from September through January. Today As of 2015, Chelsea Milling Company produces and markets 19 mixes, which are distributed to all 50 U.S. states and 32 other countries. In 2015, the company embarked upon a significant expansion. As of 2015, the company has around a 65 percent market share in the prepared muffin mix category in the United States, and a 90 percent share of the corn muffin mix market, per industry estimates and estimates by Howdy Holmes. The company avoids all advertising for its products, and spends no money on advertising. Holmes has stated that the company's employees earn more pay compared to the industry standard, and also enjoy better benefits compared to the average in the industry. In March 2013, production worker salaries averaged $47,000 annually. The company also offers various resources and classes for its employees. It has been reported that Holmes is on a first name basis with most of the company's employees, and that it is a friendly work environment. Chelsea Milling Company has received offers from debt-financing companies and also from corporations that are interested in taking over the company. Holmes has stated that he prefers to maintain local control of the company, stating in an interview, \\"I didn't want a 28-year-old brat from Wall Street telling me how to run my company.\\" Holmes also stated that the company's local nature contributes to their customer loyalty. Products Jiffy corn muffin, baking and pie crust mixes The company's main products are muffin mixes, including those for corn muffins (including a vegetarian variety), banana muffins, chocolate muffins, and several others. Additional products include brownie mix, cake mixes, pie and pizza crust mixes, frosting mixes, and multi-purpose baking mixes. The vegetarian corn muffin mix uses a mixture of palm and soybean oil in place of lard. Multi-purpose mixes purveyed by the company are a pancake and waffle mix, buttermilk biscuit mix and a general \\"baking mix\\". The company's corn muffin mix is its most popular brand, and has around a 90 percent market share in the corn muffin mix category in the United States. In 2013, 14 of the company's products were also manufactured in institutional- sized packaging, which is sold to institutions such as hospitals and schools, among others. Publications * 248 pages.

His work has involved streams, estuaries and tropical forests but focused increasingly on human-dominated ecosystems in the US and Latin America. His research reflects his interest in understanding and developing analyses and computer simulation models of the complex systems of nature and humans and their interactions. Halls focus has been on energy as it relates to economics and environment. His focus is studying material and energy flows referred to as Industrial ecology, and applying this perspective, to attempting to understand human economies from a biophysical rather than just social perspective. =Systems ecology= Hall, and other biophysical economic thinkers are trained in ecology and evolutionary biology, fields that break down the natural world as done also by physicists. These views hold the global economy in a different perspective that mainstream economists do not share. Central to Halls argument is an understanding that the survival of all living creatures is limited by the concept of energy return on investment (EROEI): that any living thing or living societies can survive only so long as they are capable of getting more net energy from any activity than they expend during the performance of that activity.https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/10/23/23greenwire-new-school-of- thought-brings-energy-to-the-dis-63367.html?pagewanted=all N.Y.

In the 1980s, Hall and others hypothesised, \\"Over time, the Dow Jones should snake about the real amount of work.\\" Twenty years later, a century's market and energy data shows that whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average spikes faster than US energy consumption, it crashes: 1929, 1970s, the dot.com bubble, and now with the mortgage collapse.http://www.greenpeace.org/international/about/deep- green/deep-green-jan-2009 Greenpeace article Retrieved November-3-09 Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (a Romanian-born economist whose work in the 1970s began to define this new approach) models the economy as a living system. Like all life, it draws from its environment valuable (or ‚Äúlow entropy‚Äù) matter and energy, for animate life, food; for an economy, energy, ores, the raw materials provided by plants and animals. And like all life, an economy emits a high-entropy wake, it spews degraded matter and energy, that is... waste heat, waste gases, toxic byproducts, the molecules of iron lost to rust and abrasion. Low entropy emissions include trash and pollution in all their forms. Matter taken up into the economy can be recycled, using energy; but energy, used once, is forever unavailable to us at that level again. The law of entropy commands a one-way flow downward from more to less useful forms. Thus, Georgescu-Roegen, paraphrasing the economist Alfred Marshall, said: ‚ÄúBiology, not mechanics, is our Mecca.‚Äùhttps://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&ref;=opinion N.Y.Times article on energy systems Retrieved November-3-09  Books  * 1977 : Hall, C.A.S. and J.W.

The temple claims it was founded in 850 by Ennin, the third chief abbot of the sect. George Sansom states Ch≈´son-ji was founded by Fujiwara no Kiyohira in 1095. Ch≈´son-ji was designated as a Special Historic Site in 1979 and in June 2011 was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as a part of the \\"Historic Monuments and Sites of Hiraizumi\\". History At the beginning of the 12th century, large-scale temple construction was carried out by Fujiwara no Kiyohira, the founder of the Northern Fujiwara clan. The temple was built to placate souls of all who died in the Former Nine Years War and the Latter Three Years' War. Kiyohira, who had been forced into bloody battles and lost his family in the war, resolved to bring peace to the region based on an ideal society following the teachings of Buddha. Per the Azuma Kagami (the official history of the Kamakura shogunate) the temple contained more than 40 halls and pagodas, and over 300 monks' residences. Kiyohira's son Fujiwara no Motohira continued this plan, and commissioned his own great temple, M≈çts≈´-ji, nearby. M≈çts≈´-ji was completed by his son, Fujiwara no Hidehira, who also commissioned Mury≈çk≈ç-in. Hiraizumi flourished for nearly one hundred years, until its destruction by the forces of Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1189. Ch≈´son-ji survived the conflict, but fell into decline. In 1337 fire destroyed much of the temple; however, more than 3,000 National Treasures and Important Cultural Properties survived. During the Edo period, it was partially rebuilt by the Date clan of Sendai Domain and became a subsidiary temple of Kan'ei-ji in Edo. It was visited by Matsuo Bash≈ç during his travels while writing the Oku no Hosomichi. Konjiki-d≈ç  The Konjiki-d≈ç () is a small building completed in 1124, which still conveys an image of what Ch≈´son-ji looked like in its prime. The building is covered with gold leaf on both the interior and exterior. Inside, the decorations use mother-of-pearl inlays, woodwork, metalwork, lacquerwork and paintings, bringing together many aspects of late Heian period arts and crafts It is one of two buildings that survive from the original Ch≈´son-ji temple complex, the other being a sutra repository. The building also serves as a mausoleum containing the mummified remains of the leaders of the Northern Fujiwara clan. The building measures five-and-a-half meters on each side and is eight meters tall. The interior of the building contains three altars, one for each of the first three Fujiwara lords. Each altar had a seated Amida Ny≈çrai surrounded by standing Kannon Bosatsu and Seishi Bosatsu, six Jiz≈ç Bosatsu and two Niten statues. One Niten figure is now missing. The building was rebuilt from 1962 to 1968. The mummies were last examined in 1950. It is assumed that the mummy of Fujiwara no Kiyohira was placed under the central altar. Fujiwara no Motohira's remains were identified as he is known to have died of a cerebral hemorrhage. His mummy was found under the northwest altar. Fujiwara no Hidehira's remains were found under the southwest altar next to a casket containing the head of his son Fujiwara no Yasuhira who was beheaded in 1189. The Konjiki-d≈ç formerly sat outdoors in the open air. In 1288 it was covered with a wooden structure to protect it from the elements. Today it sits behind thick acrylic glass within a concrete building (constructed in 1965) and is visible only from the front and sides. Sh≈çgyo ≈åba, a maki-e lacquer artist, helped to restore the interior lacquer work in 1964.

As with many other IMRO members of the time, historians from the North Macedonia consider him an ethnic Macedonian and in Bulgaria he is considered a Bulgarian. Vlahov declared himself until the early 1930s as a Bulgarian and afterwards as an ethnic Macedonian.Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , p. 235.During the 20th century, Slav Macedonian national feeling has shifted. At the beginning of the 20th century, Slavic patriots in Macedonia felt a strong attachment to Macedonia as a multi-ethnic homeland... Most of these Macedonian Slavs also saw themselves as Bulgarians. By the middle of the 20th. century, however Macedonian patriots began to see Macedonian and Bulgarian loyalties as mutually exclusive. Regional Macedonian nationalism had become ethnic Macedonian nationalism... This transformation shows that the content of collective loyalties can shift. Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Ethnologia Balkanica Series, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2010, , p. 127. However such left-wing Macedonian activists, former members of the BCP and the IMRO (United) never managed to get rid of their strong Bulgarophile sentiments, and thus practically continued to feel themselves as Bulgarians even in Communist Yugoslavia.Palmer, S. and R. King Yugoslav Communism and the Macedonian Question, Archon Books (June 1971), p. 137.According to the Macedonian historian Academician Ivan Katardzhiev all left-wing Macedonian revolutionaries from the period until the early 1930s declared themselves as \\"Bulgarians\\" and he asserts that the political separatism of some Macedonian revolutionaties toward official Bulgarian policy was yet only political phenomenon without ethnic character. This will bring even Dimitar Vlahov on the session of the Politburo of the Macedonian communist party in 1948, when speaking of the existence of the Macedonian nation, to say that in 1932 (when left wing of IMRO issued for the first time the idea of separate Macedonian nation) a mistake was made. Katardzhiev claims all this veterans from IMRO (United) and Bulgarian communist party remained only at the level of political, not of national separatism. Thus, they practically continued to feel themselves as Bulgarians, i.e. they didn't developed clear national separatist position even in Communist Yugoslavia. –ê–∫–∞–¥–µ–º–∏–∫ –ö–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—ü–∏–µ–≤, –ò–≤–∞–Ω. –í–µ—Ä—É–≤–∞–º –≤–æ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª–Ω–∏–æ—Ç –∏–º—É–Ω–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–æ—Ç, –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—ò—É –∑–∞ —Å–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ \\"–§–æ—Ä—É–º\\", 22 j—É–ª–∏ 2000, –±—Ä–æ—ò 329. Life He was born in Kƒ±lkƒ±≈ü (Bulgarian/Macedonian Kukush, in present-day Greece) and attended the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki. After that he emigrated to the Principality of Bulgaria and graduated from secondary school in Belogradtchik. Vlachov also studied chemistry in Germany and Switzerland, where he took part in socialist circles. However, he graduated in these subjects from Sofia University. Here he enrolled in the Bulgarian Social Democratic Workers' Party. In 1903, Vlahov entered a military service in an officer's school in Sofia. Then he worked as a teacher in the Bulgarian Men's High School of Thessaloniki where he was active in IMRO. During this period, he was arrested by the Ottoman authorities. In 1905, Vlahov was released and went back to Bulgaria where he worked as a teacher in Kazanlak. In 1908, after the Young Turks revolution he began working in the Bulgarian secondary school in Thessaloniki again. In the next few years, Vlahov was politically active as a member of the Ottoman Parliament as a representative from the People's Federative Party (Bulgarian Section). After the dissolution of the PFP in 1911, he became a member the Ottoman Socialist Party and in 1912 was elected again as a deputy in the Ottoman Parliament. After the Balkan Wars, Vlachov was a representative of the Kingdom of Bulgaria in high diplomatic and administrative positions in Odessa, Kiev, Pristina and Vienna. After World War I and the reestablishment of IMRO in 1920, Vlahov was elected as alternate member of its Central Committee, representing the left wing. At that time he was a Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Varna. Todor Alexandrov urged him to establish a contact between IMRO and Soviet Russia. As a messenger served Krastyo Rakovski, his best man and prominent figure of the Comintern. On behalf of IMRO, Vlahov departed in July 1923 to Moscow. So in 1924, IMRO entered negotiations in Vienna with the Comintern about collaboration between the communists and the Macedonian movement and the creation of a united Macedonian movement. Vlahov helped the subscription of the so-called May Manifesto about forming a Balkan Communist Federation and cooperation with the Soviet Union. After the subsequent rift between the organization and the Communists, the new leadership headed by Ivan Mihailov excluded him from the organization and he was sentenced to death. In 1925, he was one of the founders of the IMRO (United) in Vienna. He also became a member of Bulgarian Communist Party. During the late 1920s, he worked in France, Germany and Austria as a Comintern publicist. During this period he was chased by IMRO and against him were organized several failed assassination attempts. In 1932 members of IMRO (United), put for the first time the issue of the recognition of a separate Macedonian nation in a lecture in Moscow.–ü—Ä–æ–∏–∑—Ö–æ–¥—ä—Ç –Ω–∞ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏—è - –°—Ç–µ–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–∞ –æ—Ç –∑–∞—Å–µ–¥–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∏—è –ù–∞—É—á–µ–Ω –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –≤ –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è –ø—Ä–µ–∑ 1947 –≥.

In 1992, Davis authored Black American Women in Olympic Track and Field and co-authored a Thurgood Marshall biography. Early life Born in Washington, D.C., the son of John P. Davis and Marguerite DeMond Davis, Mike D. Davis grew up in the bosom of the dignified black middle class of Washington D.C. and New York City. His father, John P. Davis was a graduate of Harvard Law School and his mother was a graduate of Syracuse University. John P. Davis became prominent for his work with the Joint Committee on National Recovery and the founding of the National Negro Congress in 1935. He went on to found Our World magazine in 1946, a full-size, nationally-distributed magazine edited for African-American readers. He also published the American Negro Reference book, covering virtually every aspect of African-American life, present and past. Mike Davis was the grandson of Dr. William Henry Davis and the Reverend Abraham Lincoln DeMond In 1943, the first lawsuit challenging segregated schools in Washington, D.C., was brought in Michael D. Davis's name by his father, John P. Davis. The Washington Star was highly critical of an African-American lawyer legally challenging the District's Dual school system when the principal of Noyes School refused to admit Mike Davis at five years of age, stating that the District citizens had long accepted separate schools for blacks and whites and that the suit brought by John P. Davis would cause even deeper divisions in the nation's capital. The U.S. Congress, in response to John P. Davis's suit, appropriated federal funds to construct the Lucy D. Slowe elementary school directly across the street from his Brookland home in the neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Davis attended the Fieldston school in New York, New York. As a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, and a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), he worked closely with Martin Luther King Jr., and was a leader of the student sit-in movement. He was arrested many times in Atlanta's bus stations and department stores. Journalism Ralph McGill, publisher of the Atlanta Constitution, hired Davis as the paper's first African-American reporter. McGill became his mentor and friend. Davis went on to Vietnam as the Afro-American Newspapers war correspondent. During his 18 months in Vietnam, he reported on combat activities of black service people in the Afro's 13-state circulation area. When he returned home, he joined the Baltimore Sun. He was a staff member of the San Diego Union, where he covered Governor Jerry Brown, the now-defunct Washington Star, an editor of NBC television news in Washington, D.C., and a reporter for the Washington Times. His work has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and he received several Front Page Awards from the American Newspaper Guild. The NAACP gave him an award for his coverage of Vietnam.

It is located in the Orange Sub-basin in of water. History Discovered in 1974, the license has been held by a number of companies including Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron Texaco and Energy Africa. In 2004, Tullow Oil acquired Energy Africa for US$570 million and with its 90% interest in the license. Later Tullow Oil sold 20% of the project to Itochu. The remaining 10% is held by Namibian state oil company Namcor. On Tuesday, 18 September 2007, shares of Tullow Oil declined by more than 3.0% after the group announced that it had to abandon the Kudu-8 exploration well offshore Namibia and that a second well planned nearby won't be drilled. In 2010, Namcor and Russian gas company Gazprom agreed to establish a special purpose company to take a majority stake in the Kudu gas field. In 2017, BW Kudu, a subsidiary of BW Offshore, entered into a Farm-Out Agreement for a 56% stake of the Kudu license. Namcor holds the remaining 44% stake in the license. Reserves The field is estimated to contain of proven natural gas reserves however more recent exploration and analysis suggests that reserves could reach with potential up to .

Later in her U.S. Navy career she was renamed Kane County (LST-853)‚Äîafter counties in Illinois and Utah‚Äîbut never saw active service under that name. LST-853 was laid down on 30 August 1944 at Seneca, Illinois, by the Chicago Bridge & Iron Co.; launched on 17 November 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Ellen Scott De-Coursey; and commissioned on 11 December 1944, Lt. Charles B. Salsbury in command. After shakedown off Florida, LST-853 departed New Orleans for the Pacific 19 January 1945. She loaded troops and equipment on the west coast before steaming from Seattle 10 March. Sailing via Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Guam, she arrived at Saipan 25 April. The landing ship embarked units of the 1878th Engineer Aviation Battalion, then sailed on the 27th for Okinawa. Arriving 6 days later in the midst of enemy air raids, LST-853 discharged men and equipment on this strategic base which lay at the gateway to Japan. She returned to Saipan 24 May and, during the remaining months of the war, shuttled troops and equipment among the Marianas, Philippines and Okinawa staging areas for the planned invasion of Japan. The enemy's acceptance of Allied peace terms obviated an invasion, so LST-853 then operated in the Far East, transporting occupation forces until early December. Arriving Saipan 13 December 1945, she embarked veterans of the Pacific fighting in the Marianas and sailed for the United States in January 1946. After arrival on the West Coast, LST-853 then sailed to Astoria, Oregon; and decommissioned at Vancouver, Washington, 24 July 1946. While berthed in the Columbia River with the Pacific Reserve Fleet, she was named Kane County 1 July 1955. Under provisions of the Military Assistance Program, she was transferred to the Republic of Korea 22 December 1958, and served the ROK navy as Suyeong (LST-813). LST-853 earned one battle star for World War II service.  ROKS Suyeong  The ship was transferred to the Republic of Korea on 22 December 1958, and renamed ROKS Suyeong (LST-813).According to globalsecurity.org, the Korean name of the ship is Suyongbong. She was later redesignated LST-677 and retired on 29 Dec, 2005. Following her retirement, she was put on display as a museum ship and tourist attraction in Donghangpo.

It was transferred to the Pakistan Army on independence in 1947, and amalgamated with the 14th, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments in 1956, to form the Punjab Regiment. History =Madras Army= The 1st Punjab Regiment had its antecedents in the old Madras Army of the British East India Company, which was largely responsible for the establishment of British rule in south and central India. Its senior battalion was raised as the 3rd Battalion of Coast Sepoys in 1759, making it the senior-most surviving infantry battalion of the British Indian Army. The 2nd Battalion was raised in 1761 as the 7th Battalion of Coast Sepoys, while the 3rd Battalion was raised in 1776 as the 16th Carnatic Battalion. This was followed by the 5th Battalion in 1788 as 29th Madras Battalion and the 10th Battalion in 1794 as 34th Madras Battalion. These battalions underwent several changes in nomenclature until 1824, when they were designated as the 2nd, 6th, 16th, 22nd and 24th Regiments of Madras Native Infantry. Their men were mostly enlisted from South India and consisted of Muslims and Hindus. The 4th Battalion was an oddity as being a survivor of the Bengal Army, most of whose units were disbanded following the Indian Rebellion of 1857‚Äì58. It was raised in 1776 as the 30th Battalion of Bengal Sepoys. In 1861, it was designated as the 1st Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry. It mostly recruited Hindu Brahmans from Oudh. All the battalions of the regiment played an important role in the early military campaigns of the East India Company and were actively engaged in the wars against the French, Mysore and the Marathas. Their first major engagement was the decisive Battle of Wandiwash in 1860, which ended French colonial ambitions in India. This was followed by forty years of constant warfare against the Sultans of Mysore, and then the Marathas chieftains. In the Second Maratha War of 1803‚Äì05, the 1st and 10th Battalions fought in the Battle of Assaye under General Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, while the 4th Battalion fought in the Battles of Laswari and Agra in 1803, and Bhurtpore in 1805. The performance of the 1st and 10th at Assaye was much appreciated and they were permitted the word \\"Assaye\\" with the device of an elephant on their colours and appointments. The two battalions were again engaged against the Marathas during the Third Maratha War of 1817‚Äì19, which decisively broke the Maratha power in India. The regiment also made overseas forays, when the 2nd and 10th Battalions took part in the expeditions to Bourbon Island and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean in 1810, and the 3rd and 5th served in the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824‚Äì26. In 1840, the 1st and 2nd Battalions took part in the First Anglo-Chinese War. Their performance was much appreciated and as a reward, they were the only two battalions of the Indian Army authorized to bear a golden dragon wearing the imperial crown upon their regimental colours along with the battle honour of \\"China\\". In the latter part of the 19th century, the regiment did not see much action, although all of its battalions served in Burma. 300px After the conquest of Sindh and the Punjab in the 1840s, British focus shifted towards the northwest and the Madras Army was largely reduced to garrison duties. This greatly affected its morale and efficiency. By the turn of the century, the reputation of Madrassi units had suffered considerably and they were either disbanded or reconstituted with northerners. Among the latter were the five battalions, which would go on to form the 1st Punjab Regiment in 1922. In 1902, the South Indians were mustered out and replaced with Punjabi Muslims, Jat Sikhs and Rajputs in the 1st, 2nd and 10th Battalions. Next year, the 3rd and 5th Battalions were also reconstituted with Punjabi Muslims, Sikh Jats and Hindu Jats. Under the Kitchener Reforms of 1903, these battalions were redesignated as the 62nd, 66th, 76th, 82nd and 84th Punjabis; thus severing almost a hundred and fifty years of association with Madras. Meanwhile, the 1st Bengal Infantry was redesignated as the 1st Brahmans. =First World War= During the First World War, except for the 1st Brahmans, all battalions of the regiment served in the Mesopotamian Campaign, while the 62nd and 76th Punjabis also served at Suez Canal during the Turkish offensive of 1915. Captain Claude Auchinleck, later Field Marshal and the last Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, served with the 62nd Punjabis in Egypt and Mesopotamia.350px * 62nd Punjabis ‚Äì Egypt, Mesopotamia, Aden. * 66th Punjabis ‚Äì Mesopotamia.

In 1919, the 66th, 76th and 82nd Punjabis participated in the Third Afghan War. In 1921‚Äì22 a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions in 1922. Among these was the 1st Punjab Regiment; most senior among the infantry regiments of the Indian Army. The line-up of battalions for the 1st Punjabis was:190px * 62nd Punjabis ‚Äì 1st Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment * 66th Punjabis ‚Äì 2nd Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment * 76th Punjabis ‚Äì 3rd Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment * 1st Brahmans ‚Äì 4th Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment * 82nd Punjabis ‚Äì 5th Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment * 84th Punjabis ‚Äì 10th (Training) Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment * 1st (Territorial) Battalion 62nd Punjabis ‚Äì 11th (Territorial) Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment The new class composition of the 1st Punjab Regiment, based at Jhelum, was Punjabi Muslims, Rajputs, Muslims from Hazara and Sikhs. The Elephant of Assaye and the Imperial Dragon superimposed over the Star of India were chosen as its new emblem. The regiment's uniform was scarlet with green facings. In the inter-war period, the 1st Punjab Regiment saw extensive service on the North West Frontier of India. In 1931, the 4th Battalion was disbanded due to retrenchment in the Indian Army. In 1937, King George VI was gazetted as the Colonel-in-Chief of the 1st Punjab Regiment. =Second World War= * 1st Battalion ‚Äì India, Iraq, North Africa, Burma, Singapore, Dutch East Indies.340px * 2nd Battalion ‚Äì India, Burma, Dutch East Indies. * 3rd Battalion ‚Äì India, North Africa, Eritrea, Syria, Italy. * 5th Battalion ‚Äì India, Burma, Japan Whether it was surrender to Japanese ?. * 6th Battalion ‚Äì Raised in 1940.

During the Second World War, the 1st Punjab Regiment suffered a total of 5510 casualties, including 1291 killed. The 2nd Battalion received more gallantry awards than any other unit of the Indian Army. These included a posthumous Victoria Cross to Subedar Ram Sarup Singh for gallantry in action on Kennedy Peak in Burma in 1944. The 3rd Battalion was nominated for parachute training in June 1946 to join the 2nd Indian Airborne Division. However, soon after completing its training in 1947, the 3rd (Para) Battalion 1st Punjab Regiment was engaged in quelling communal riots and in July, was detailed to join the Punjab Boundary Force, formed to keep the peace on the new East-West Punjab border. The 5th Battalion was sent to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. =Post-independence history= On the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the 1st Punjab Regiment was allotted to Pakistan Army. At the time, the active battalions were 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 7th. Sikhs and Rajputs were transferred to the Indian Army and the regiment's new class composition was fixed as Punjabis and Pathans. In November, Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck, Supreme Commander of the Indian and Pakistan Armies was appointed Colonel of the 1st Punjab Regiment and the regiment was authorized to wear a grass-green hackle with regimental berets. In 1948, the 14th Battalion was re-raised in response to the war with India in Kashmir, where the 2nd Battalion again distinguished itself and Captain Muhammad Sarwar became the first recipient of Nishan-i-Haider, Pakistan's highest gallantry award. In 1956, a major reorganization was undertaken in the Pakistan Army and larger infantry groups were created by amalgamating the existing infantry regiments. As a result, the 1st Punjab Regiment was amalgamated with the 14th, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment. The four regimental centres were also merged and the combined centre moved to Mardan.

However, because of the Potomac River separating Northern Virginia from the city, the two systems have evolved largely independently. At present, most major bus routes, including all that cross the Potomac, are operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), while several smaller systems are city- or county-owned.Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, , October 2005 Since the Washington Metro opened to Virginia, most of the bus routes have terminated on either side of the Potomac River, where passengers can transfer to the rapid transit system, or to one of the few WMATA Metrobus routes that cross the river (Route 38B).  Trolleys  Northern Virginia did not have any street railways until 1892, when the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon Electric Railway (WA&MV;) opened an electric trolley line between Alexandria and Mount Vernon. It merged with the Washington, Arlington and Falls Church Railway (WA&FC;) in 1913 to form the Washington-Virginia Railway. The company entered bankruptcy in 1924, and in 1927 the two former systems were split. The WA&MV; was bought by the owner of the Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Rapid Transit Company, a competing line of buses, and last ran in 1932; the WA&FC; was reorganized as the Arlington and Fairfax Railway and operated until 1939. A third system, the Washington and Old Dominion Railway (W&OD;), began in the 1850s as the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad, a steam railroad. It was leased by the newly formed W&OD;, which in 1912 connected the line to the electrified Great Falls and Old Dominion Railroad. Electric trolleys last ran in 1941, but the company continued to operate freight trains (and passenger trains until 1951) until 1968.  Local buses  =WMATA Metrobus= Until 1973, when WMATA began operating buses, the local buses in Northern Virginia were operated by two companies. The Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company (AB&W;) mainly operated along and south of Columbia Pike, while the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company (WV&M;) mainly operated along and north of Arlington Boulevard. =Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company= The AB&W;'s first route was along Columbia Pike, now the Columbia Pike Line, in 1921. It eventually acquired a number of other routes, including several local Alexandria routes. =Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company= The WV&M; acquired several routes in the late 1920s, mainly operating west from Rosslyn. In 1947, the WV&M; absorbed the Arlington and Fairfax Motor Transportation Company, the successor to the Arlington & Fairfax Auto Railroad, but closed the route in 1948.  Intercity buses  Until 1987, when Greyhound Lines acquired Continental Trailways (part of the Trailways Transportation System), there were two systems of intercity buses - Greyhound and Trailways - in Northern Virginia. , the only two routes still operated are southwest to Charlottesville via U.S. Route 29 and south to Richmond via U.S. Route 1. Greyhound's system once included three lines: one west to Winchester along State Route 7, operated by Capitol Greyhound Lines, one west to Winchester via U.S. Route 50, operated by Atlantic Greyhound Lines, and one south to Richmond via U.S. Route 1, operated by Richmond Greyhound Lines. These were all started in the 1920s and joined Greyhound by the early 1930s. =Virginia Trailways= Virginia Trailways, officially Virginia Stage Lines, had lines west on State Route 55 to Front Royal, west on U.S. Route 211 to Luray, southwest to Charlottesville via U.S. Route 29, and south to Richmond via U.S. Route 1 and State Route 2. The first one of these operated by Virginia Stage was to Charlottesville; by 1936, it was operating all four. The company joined Trailways and changed its business name to Virginia Trailways in 1938.

It is written in first person and is a sympathetic account of the life of Empress Dowager Cixi - from her humble beginnings to her rise as the Empress Dowager. Names within the story are different in spelling but retain the same pronunciation - allowing the reader to identify each relevant character to his or her real life counterpart. Empress Orchid was also a 2006 nominee for the Richard and Judy Best Read of the Year Award. Plot summary The novel follows the life of a young Manchu girl named Orchid Yehonala. The story begins with the death of her father who was once a governor of Wuhu. His death left Orchid, her two siblings and her mother in poverty. His family travel to his birthplace Peking with his coffin for burial. Once in Peking, they move in with a distant uncle and his mentally retarded and opium addicted son Ping (also known as 'Bottle'). Orchid gets a chance to better her life when Emperor Hsien Feng issues a decree stating that he is looking for \\"future mates\\". Orchid is eligible because she is Manchu and that her father was the rank of \\"Blue Bannerman\\". She is chosen as the Imperial consort of the fourth rank. Her official title is Lady of the Greatest Virtue. There are a total of 7 Imperial consorts, and over 3000 concubines within the Forbidden City. Nuharoo is pronounced Empress, ranking her first out of the 7 Imperial consorts. Once in the Forbidden City, Orchid befriends a eunuch called An-te-hai, who is assigned as her servant along with numerous other eunuchs and maids. A friendship begins to form between the two, and she appoints him as her first attendant. As the months pass, Orchid becomes more desperate. The official duty of an Imperial consort is to sleep with the Emperor and produce male heirs, but Orchid has yet to be summoned. Without completing that duty, an Imperial consort risks being unacknowledged for the remainder of her life. Knowing this, Orchid decides to bribe Chief Eunuch Shim in order to gain Emperor Hsien Feng's attention. Her tactic works and she soon becomes the Emperor's favourite consort. During her time as the favourite, Orchid learns more about the current history of China, and the inner workings of the Forbidden City. Later on within the story, Orchid becomes pregnant. She gives birth to the Emperor's first male heir Tung Chih amidst nationwide celebration. However, after the birth of his son Emperor Hsien Feng begins to lose interest in Orchid. Part of this is due to Nuharoo's plot to disrupt Orchid's life. The emperor becomes ill as political situations in China worsen. Foreign powers are beginning to invade China, demanding that the emperor grants them the right to establish trade and port. The weak emperor is unable to defend his empire from the combined strength of the intruding forces and the royal family flees the capital when the enemies approach Peking. Emperor Hsien Feng dies whilst in exile. Nonetheless, Orchid's life is still in danger from Su Shun (a corrupt official) as the Emperor has not yet named an heir. Later on in the novel Orchid persuades Hsien Feng to name Tung Chih as the new Emperor, with herself and Nuharoo as co-regents. Su Shun is named as the head of the Board of Regents. As Su Shun had previously expected to gain more power from the death of Hsien Feng without Orchid's interference, tensions between the two increase. Orchid is now granted the title \\"Empress of Holy Kindness Tzu Hsi\\". Nuharoo becomes the \\"Empress of Great Benevolence Tzu An\\". Orchid knows that her new position does not guarantee her safety as she is still restricted by the actions of Su Shun. With the assistance of An-te-hai and Prince Kung Orchid manages to successfully arrest and punish Su Shun and his associates, on the grounds that they had tried to organise a coup d'√©tat. The novel ends with the official burial of Emperor Hsien Feng and the hint of a new relationship between Orchid and General Yung Lu.

She is the author of over 25 books, including Third Degree, Twenty Minute Shakespeare, and Fat Like Me and The Banquo's Son Trilogy. She also teaches English at the local high school. Biography =Early life= Tania Roxborogh was born in Christchurch. When Tania was 3, her alcoholic father left home and she moved to Te Puke with her mother. In 1972, at the age of 7, her mother met another man, who had 4 sons and a housekeeper who also had 4 children. They all moved in together and moved around Northland for the next few years. They finally settled in Titoki, west of Whangarei where Tania and her siblings attended Mangakahia Area School. However, in 1977, the family once again moved. By 1980, Tania had lived in 12 different houses and gone to 7 different schools. Moving around made Tania's childhood unsettled and unhappy, so during her 5th form year in 1981, she travelled down to North Canterbury to live with her father. Unfortunately, this still did not work out and Tania did not want to go back to her mother, so she contacted Social Welfare who arranged for her to stay in Hawarden in a foster family. Education Tania attended Whangarei Girls High School from 1979-1981 and Hawarden Area School (now Huranui College) from 1981-1982. In 1985, Tania began studying at Massey University in Palmerston North. Three years later, she went to Auckland Teacher's College and the following year began teaching English. In 2015, she graduated from the University of Otago with a second B.A. This time in MƒÅori Studies. =Marriage and children= In December 1989, Tania married Phillip Roxborogh. Her daughter Mackenna was born three years later in 1992 and Brianna, four years after that, in 1996. =Other= * In 2002, Tania Roxborogh sat the Bursary English exam after a challenge from her Year 13 class as she hadn't taken it herself before and was taking her students through it. * In 2003, she underwent a gastric bypass operation after struggling with a serious weight problem as a result of her pregnancies and has been a vocal advocate for the positive results of the procedure. * In 2006, she was awarded the Dunedin College of Education's Children's Writer in Residence which led to the family relocating from Auckland to Dunedin. * In 2010, her novel, Banquo's Son was shortlisted for the New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards, awarded a notable book from Storylines: the Children's Literature Foundation of New Zealand as well as winning the YA section of the 2010 LIANZA awards. * Roxborogh's novel, Bastion Point, won the junior fiction category in the 2017 Book Awards for Children and Young Adults Content and style of writing Roxborogh's earlier works contain much biographical material. Many of the situations her characters find themselves dealing with are sourced from specific events in her own life. For example, the car accident Jeremy suffered in Runaway is exactly what she experienced. In Third Degree, a story about a 19-year-old university student Ruth, memories of a 10-year-old self are lifted straight from the memories of the time Roxborogh ran into her stepfather who was carrying a pot of boiling hot water. She was scalded very badly and suffered third degree burns. During her time in hospital she was not just scarred physically but was also subjected to a medical experiment. Roxborogh's parenting books (No, it's Not Okay and Kids Behaving Bravely) reflect her observations and research associated with teaching adolescents. These two she co-authored with guidance counseller Kim Stephenson. Philosophical and/or political views Tania Roxborogh is a non-denominational Christian. Her brother-in-law John Roxborogh is a theologian. Tania's motto for life is best said in Langston Hughes's poem 'Dreams': \\"Hold fast to dreams for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly...\\" Bibliography * Performing with Purpose (1996) * Fifteen Minute Shakespeare (1997) * If I Could Tell You...

Count Alexander Kolowrat-Krakowski at the studio in 1916 Sascha-Film, in full Sascha-Filmindustrie AG and from 1933 Tobis-Sascha-Filmindustrie AG, was the largest Austrian film production company of the silent film and early sound film period. History The business was established in 1910 by Alexander Joseph \\"Sascha\\", Count Kolowrat- Krakowsky as the Sascha-Filmfabrik (\\"Sascha Film Factory\\") in Pfraumberg - P≈ôimda in Bohemia, and relocated in 1912 to Vienna. On 10 September 1918, after the merger with the film distributors Philipp & Pressburger, the business became the Sascha-Filmindustrie AG. With epic films such as Alexander Korda's Prinz und Bettelknabe (\\"Prince and Beggar\\") (1920) and Michael Curtiz's Sodom und Gomorrha (1922) as well as Die Sklavenk√∂nigin (\\"The Slave Queen\\") (1924), the company rose to be one of the most successful European film producers. In 1933 the German enterprise Tobis-Tonbild-Syndikat was amalgamated with the company, known formally from then on as the Tobis-Sascha- Filmindustrie AG. In 1938, in the context of the Anschluss, by which Austria was annexed to the Third Reich, the concern passed into the ownership of the National Socialist government and was re-founded as Wien-Film GmbH. Its best- known director of the period to the end of the war was Gustav Ucicky. After the end of the war the name Sascha-Film was re-established for a couple of decades, and in the 1950s and 1960s produced light entertainment films.

Segments from the program are uploaded to YouTube, and there is also an official video podcast. Planet Nerd was nominated for Best Comedy Program in the 2008 Antenna Awards, which celebrate the best of Australian community television, though they did not win the award.C31 : The Antennas : Nominations On 17 September 2008, a new interview with Rocket Boom creator, Andrew Baron, was posted on the Planet Nerd web site. While no other new content has appeared, the original twelve episodes were repeated multiple times by Channel 31, as late as June 2009. It was also broadcast on Triangle TV in New Zealand in 2007. Content Aimed at the geek demographic, Planet Nerd offers a variation on the variety show format, with host Dan Walmsley acting as an anchor, sometimes accompanied by one of the other presenters, throwing to various segments which include documentaries, reviews and sketches. Each week the hosting segments are filmed in a different context, often forming a series of linked sketches themselves. =Documentaries= Aside from the overt comedic content, Planet Nerd also features original, semi-serious documentary segments which explore and celebrate various facets of geek culture. Subjects have included the roleplaying and wargaming convention Arcanacon, RoboGames, Sony's Wonder Technology Lab and National ICT Australia. A similar semi- regular segment is \\"Geek of the Week\\", in which a subject is interviewed by Ben McKenzie about their nerdy hobbies or profession.

Early life A native of Dominica, West Indies, he moved to the U.K. in 1954 to complete his education. He joined the Hammersmith Borough Brass Band as a trumpeter while working as its council surveyor. He later switched to trombone and formed an amateur band playing jazz. Beginning 1958 he performed at the Cellar Club in Soho, then joined bands led by Teddy Layton and Sonny Morris. During the 1960s, he was a member of the Terry Lightfoot and Alex Welsh bands and played with Edmundo Ros. He played trombone and sang in the blues band Dillingers with saxophonist Don Mackrill and bassist Ronnie Shapiro, the brother of Helen Shapiro. Allandale appears to have been involved with a group called Romeo Z. A promotional release of \\"Come Back Baby Come Back\\" backed with \\"Since My Baby Said Goodbye\\" was released by CBSon 31 March 1967. He co-wrote both songs. During the previous year, Romeo Z contributed a song to the film Kaleidoscope. A single-sided promo 45 of the track was released on KAL 1. New Orleans Knights In the early 1960s Allandale led the New Orleans Knights, possibly also referred to as The Jazz Knights, who were regulars on the trad jazz circuit. The New Orleans Knights included drummer Colin Miller who, years later, joined the Chris Barber Band; banjo player Eddie Edwards; and drummer Laurie Chescoe. Two singles were released as the Landsdowne Jazz Series by Columbia in the UK in 1962. One of the singles, \\"Little Hans\\", had Allandale credited as the new music arranger. The Foundations In 1967 he became a member of the multi-racial English soul group The Foundations, playing in the horn section with Jamaican saxophonists Mike Elliott and Pat Burke. He played on their hits \\"Baby, Now That I've Found You\\", \\"Back on My Feet Again\\", \\"Build Me Up Buttercup\\" and \\"In the Bad Bad Old Days\\" and was a member of the band until it broke up in 1970. Songwriting He wrote a number of songs that were recorded by the Foundations as well as other artists. The first appearance of his song writing efforts was on the flip side of the Foundations third single, \\"Any Old Time (You're Lonely And Sad)\\" called \\"We Are Happy People\\". This song was also recorded by a Scandinavian group called Slams Creepers, backed with \\"I Just Couldn't Get You Out of My Mind\\" and released in 1968 on Bill BT 128. It was also released as the flip side to a 1969 single, \\"Remains To Be Seen\\", recorded by Irish show band The Pacific Show Band, released on Tribune TRS 125. It was also re-recorded by The Foundations featuring Colin Young and appeared on their 1968 Marble Arch album. Other songs written by him was the Foundations minor hit \\"Born to Live, Born to Die\\" which Allandale served as musical director. \\"I Can Feel It\\", \\"Who Am I ?\\" and \\"Solomon Grundy\\". This latter song which appeared on the album, Digging The Foundations, was covered by Pye labelmates Pickettywitch, and a Hong Kong- based beat group, Danny Diaz & The Checkmates. It was the song that Polly Brown and Pickettywitch were first noticed with when they appeared on ITV's Opportunity Knocks television talent show. It was also the B-side of Pickettywitch's 1969 debut single \\"You've Got Me So I Don't Know\\". In 1972 a group called Tramp Sonic released a single on RCA called \\"You're A Man\\" backed with \\"Catch A Southbound Train\\". Allandale wrote the tunes for both sides as well as produced them. \\"You're a Man\\" appeared on the Hits Vol.3 Dance Classics album in 1992. The song was credited to Tramps. With James Mpungo he wrote \\"Ave Africa\\", which appears on Sunburst's 1976 album. Later years Some time after the Foundations broke up he went to Zambia with a soul band to play for its independence celebrations. He also joined other musicians in a band that played African jazz and the band became popular locally. He taught music to students in Zambia. learned carving crafts, and then moved to Kenya. He was a member of the band Sunburst and played on the group's 1976 album, Ave Africa. After four years in Africa he returned to England. In 1977 he played jazz with Laurie Chescoe, a former bandmate from his early jazz years. He tried to reunite with Tim Harris, the former drummer for The Foundations, but was unsuccessful. He opened a junk shop with his partner Olive in Peckham, South London. In 1981 Allandale went to Paris and worked with Sam Woodyard, former drummer with the Duke Ellington orchestra. He moved to a commune near the Pyrenees and was a founding member of the St Andre Blues Band.

Penny, 210-211 for the dating. The canvas was commissioned by the patrician Vendramin family, and portrays, as was the typical Venetian custom, only male members of the dynasty. It includes the brothers Andrea and Gabriele Vendramin, and Andrea's seven sons. However Andrea was apparently only three years older than Gabriele, which one would not think from the two figures here. It remains uncertain which is which.Gould, 286, who seems to favour Gabriele as the standing figure. The three young boys kneeling on the left were added later by another artist, and are markedly lower in quality. The figures are next an altar holding a reliquary of the True Cross, which still exists. This was connected with a miracle in 1370-82 depicted by Vittorio Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini and other artists - when accidentally dropped into a canal during a congested procession it did not sink but hovered over the water, evading others trying to help, until an earlier Andrea Vendramin dived in and retrieved it.JSTOR The Miraculous Cross in Titian's \\"Vendramin Family\\", Philip Pouncey, Journal of the Warburg Institute, Vol. 2, No. 3 (Jan., 1939), pp. 191-193 This Andrea had been presented with the relic in 1369, in his capacity as head of the confraternity or Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista; they still hold the relc and its reliquary.Penny, 215-218; Gould, 285 Both the large Bellini painting, The Miracle of the True Cross near San Lorenzo Bridge, of 1496-1500,, and the Carpaccio of 1494, are now in the Accademia museum in Venice. Titian's painting has been described as, \\"one of the greatest group portraits in history\\". It balances youth and wisdom as well as demonstrating the power of this family and their public commitments to the Republic. The relic is a central part of the portrait and was seen as both a symbol of the Serene Republic, and a personal symbol for the Vendramin family. The painting was clearly designed for a specific location, presumably in one of the various Vendramin palaces in Venice, perhaps on a stairway. The lighting and very low vanishing point suggest that the primary viewing point was anticipated to be at the left of the canvas, with the lower edge at about head height.Penny, 211 History The painting remained in Venice until at least 1636 when it was bought by Anthony van Dyck who was painter at the court of Charles I. After his death it was claimed as the property of Lady Anne Middleton by her son, Sir John Wittewronge. After claiming possession Sir John sold the painting to Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, one of Van Dyck's major patrons, and passed by descent through the Earls and Dukes of Northumberland and Somerset until 1929, when it was bought by the National Gallery.Gould, 286 At some point it has been cut down on both sides and at the bottom.Gould, 284 References Sources  Penny, Nicholas, National Gallery Catalogues (new series): The Sixteenth Century Italian Paintings, Volume II, Venice 1540‚Äì1600, 2008, National Gallery Publications Ltd, External links *National Gallery Category:1543 paintings Category:Collections of the National Gallery, London Vendramin Category:Dogs in paintings by Titian Category:Paintings by Titian ","title":"Portrait of the Vendramin Family"},{"id":"11538506","text":"The Journal for the Academic Study of Magic (JSM) was the journal of the Society for the Academic Study of Magic (SASM), a multidisciplinary group formed in 2002 by Alison Butler and Dave Evans of the University of Bristol.

A pioneer of Austrian cinema, he founded the first major film studio Sascha-Film in Vienna.  Life  Count Leopold Kolowrat and his children, 1903 He was born in what is now Glen Ridge, New Jersey,filmreference.com which was then part of the now-neighboring town of Bloomfield. He was the son of Count (1852‚Äì1910) and his wife Nadine Freiin von Huppmann-Valbella (1858‚Äì1942), the daughter of a successful cigarette manufacturer from Saint Petersburg. He had three siblings: Bertha, Friedrich and Heinrich. The reason \\"Sascha\\" Kolowrat-Krakowsky was born in the US is described in a letter of March 30, 1984, from his nephew Count Colloredo- Mansfeld to the Austrian film scholar Walter Fritz: After Count Leopold Kolowrat had been granted a reprieve by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, the family returned to Austria-Hungary. Sascha Kolowrat studied at the Catholic University of Leuven (present-day Katholieke Universiteit Leuven) in Belgium where he became a member of the German Catholic fraternity Katholische Academische Verbindung Lovania Leuven. He served in the army and was able to speak many European languages. After he had met Charles Path√© in Paris in 1909, he got into cinematography, besides his interests in motorcycle and car racing, aviation and ballooning. In 1909, he privately filmed a car racing at the Semmering Pass. After the death of his father in 1910 and the inheritance of his estates in Bohemia, Alexander Kolowrat founded the Sascha-Film factory and a film laboratory at his castle Gro√ü Meierh√∂fen (today Velk√© Dvorce) in Pfraumberg (P≈ôimda). In 1912, he moved to Vienna and founded the Sascha- Filmfabrik on Pappenheimgasse 2/Treustra√üe in Brigittenau. One of his first productions with Sascha-Film was the documentary Die Gewinnung des Erzes am steirischen Erzberg in Eisenerz (\\"The Ore Mining in the Styrian Erzberg in Eisenerz\\"). In 1915, he took over the film branch of the k.u.k. Kriegspressequartier (War Media Quarters) in Vienna and also produced several propaganda movies during World War I. Kolowrat memorial at the Wien-Film studio, Vienna-Sievering Kolowrat-Krakowsky worked with many actors, e.g. the then-obscure Marlene Dietrich and Willi Forst, who both performed in the 1927 silent film Caf√© Elektric directed by Gustav Ucicky. He did important pioneering work in all film genres of the time. The high points of his artistic work were the productions of monumental silent movies like Sodom and Gomorrah (1922) or Die Sklavenk√∂nigin (1924), both directed by Michael Curtiz, on the Laaer Berg in Vienna-Favoriten. In 1916, he erected Austria's first huge studio in Vienna-Sievering. Together with his Sascha-Film company, he was the owner of several cinemas. He personally loved to attend the M√ºnstedt Cinema in the Prater park, as well as the Burgkino and the Opernkino. In the Vienna Prater, west of the Rotunde, he erected \\"Old London\\" in 1920 for film shots, similar to the \\"Venice in Vienna\\" theme park nearby, but smaller. The count owned a large city palace on Wenceslas Square in Prague. An enthusiastic mobilist he financed the development of a lightweight sports car (\\"Sascha- Wagen\\") designed by the Austro-Daimler engineer Ferdinand Porsche, which ran at the 1922 Targa Florio with Alfred Neubauer at the wheel. Kolowrat died of cancer in 1927 in Vienna, aged 41. He would be referenced in the hit Dietrich- von Sternberg film collaboration Dishonored (1931), in which Marlene Dietrich plays a spy whose civilian name is Marie Kolowrat.

John Wiley & Sons, pp. 767 Nucleotidyltransferases are transferase enzymes of phosphorus-containing groups, e.g., substituents of nucleotidylic acids or simply nucleoside monophosphates. The general reaction of transferring a nucleoside monophosphate moiety from A to B, can be written as: :A-P-N + B \\\\rightleftharpoons A + B-P-N For example, in the case of polymerases, A is pyrophosphate and B is the nascent polynucleotide.

The attachment of an AMP (adenylylation) or UMP (uridylylation) can activate or inactivate an enzyme or change its specificity (see figure). These modifications can lead to intricate regulatory networks that can finely tune enzymatic activities so that only the needed compounds are made (here: glutamine). Role in DNA repair mechanisms Nucleotidyl transferase is a component of the repair pathway for single nucleotide base excision repair. This repair mechanism begins when a single nucleotide is recognized by DNA glycosylase as incorrectly matched or has been mutated in some way (UV light, chemical mutagen, etc.), and is removed. Later, a nucleotidyl tranferase is used to fill in the gap with the correct base, using the template strand as the reference.

He promoted the Ostsiedlung by introducing German settlers and customs into the duchy, established many towns, among them Prenzlau, Szczecin, Gartz, Anklam, Stargard, Gryfino, Police, Pyrzyce, Ueckerm√ºnde and Goleni√≥w. He was also known for his generous ecclesiastical foundations, and supported the extension of the secular reign of the Cammin bishops in the Ko≈Çobrzeg area. Duke Barnim died at the town of DƒÖbie (Altdamm), today part of Szczecin. The Minnesinger Meister Rumelant wrote a dirge in his honour. Marriages and issue Between 4 September 1238 and 18 July 1242, Barnim I married firstly with Marianna (d. 27 June 1252), whose parentage is disputed: she was either identified as a daughter of King Eric X of Sweden,Pope Gregory IX issued a dispensation to \\"- duci Pomeranie\\" for his marriage to \\"neptem...Regis Dacie\\" despite 4th grade of consanguinity, dated 4 September 1238.

They had one daughter: *Anastasia (b. 1245 ‚Äì d. 15 March 1317), married in 1259 to Henry I the Pilgrim, Lord of Mecklenburg.

The novel is told from the perspective of a woman named Mattie Ross, who recounts the time when she was 14 and sought retribution for the murder of her father by a scoundrel, Tom Chaney. It is considered by some critics to be \\"one of the great American novels.\\" The novel was adapted for the screenplay of the 1969 film True Grit starring Kim Darby, Glen Campbell, and John Wayne. Six years later, in 1975, Wayne reprised his Academy Award-winning role as the tough hard drinking one-eyed lawman in the sequel film Rooster Cogburn. In 2010, Joel and Ethan Coen wrote and directed another film adaptation of the same name. In November 2010, The Overlook Press published a movie tie-in edition of the second film version of True Grit. Plot summary The novel is narrated by Mattie Ross, churchgoing elderly spinster distinguished by intelligence, independence, and strength of mind. She recounts the story of her adventures fifty years earlier, in 1878, when she undertook a quest to avenge her father's murder by a drifter named Tom Chaney. She is joined on her quest by Marshal Reuben J. \\"Rooster\\" Cogburn and a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (pronounced \\"La-beef\\"). As Mattie's tale begins, Chaney is employed on the Ross's family farm in West-Central Arkansas, near the town of Dardanelle in Yell County. Chaney is not adept as a farmhand, and Mattie has only scorn for him, referring to him as \\"trash\\" and noting that her kind-hearted father, Frank, hired him only out of pity. One day, Frank Ross and Chaney go to Fort Smith to buy some horses. Ross takes $250 with him to pay for the horses, along with two gold pieces that he has always carried, but he ends up spending only $100 on the horses. Later, Ross tries to intervene in a barroom confrontation involving Chaney. Chaney kills him, robs the body of the remaining $150 and two gold pieces, and flees into Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) on his horse. Mattie hears that Chaney has joined an outlaw gang led by the infamous \\"Lucky\\" Ned Pepper and wishes to track down the killer. Upon arriving at Fort Smith, she looks for the toughest deputy US Marshal in the district. That man turns out to be Reuben J. \\"Rooster\\" Cogburn, an aging, one- eyed, overweight, trigger-happy, hard-drinking man. Mattie is convinced that he has \\"grit\\" and that his reputation for violence makes him best suited for the job. Playing on Cogburn's need for money, Mattie persuades him to take on the job, insisting that she accompany him as part of the bargain. During their preparation, a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf appears. He has been tracking Chaney for four months for killing a senator and his dog in Texas, and he hopes to bring him back to Texas dead or alive for a cash reward. Cogburn and LaBoeuf take a dislike to each other, but after some haggling, they agree to join forces in the hunt, realizing that they can both benefit from each other's respective talents and knowledge. Once they reach a deal, the two men attempt to leave Mattie behind, but she proves more tenacious than they had expected. They repeatedly try to lose her, but she persists in following them and seeing her transaction with Marshal Cogburn through to the end. Eventually, she is jumped by Cogburn and LaBoeuf, who had hidden themselves from view, and LaBoeuf begins to spank Mattie. Mattie appeals to Cogburn, and he orders LaBoeuf to stop. At this point, Mattie is allowed to join their posse. Together, but with very different motivations, the three ride into the wilderness to confront Ned Pepper's gang. Along the way, they develop an appreciation for one another. Film and television adaptations In 1969, the book was adapted as a screenplay by Marguerite Roberts for the Western film True Grit directed by Henry Hathaway and starring Kim Darby as Mattie Ross, Robert Duvall as \\"Lucky\\" Ned Pepper, Glen Campbell as LaBoeuf, Jeff Corey as Tom Chaney, and John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn (a role that won John Wayne Best Actor at the Academy Awards). A film sequel, Rooster Cogburn, was produced from an original screenplay in 1975, with John Wayne reprising his role, and Katharine Hepburn as an elderly spinster, Eula Goodnight, who teams with him. The sequel was not well received, and the plot was considered a needless reworking of the plot of True Grit combined with elements of The African Queen. A made-for-television sequel aired in 1978 entitled True Grit: A Further Adventure and starring Warren Oates and Lisa Pelikan. The TV-movie featured more adventures of Rooster Cogburn and Mattie Ross. In 2010, Joel and Ethan Coen released another film adaptation of the novel, also entitled True Grit, with thirteen-year-old actress Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross, veteran actor Jeff Bridges playing Rooster Cogburn, Matt Damon as LaBoeuf, Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned, and Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney. Their version, focusing on Mattie's point of view, follows the novel more closely than the 1969 film. The Coen movie is shot in settings more typical of the novel. (The 1969 film was shot in the Colorado Rockies and the Sierra Nevada, while the 2010 film was shot in Santa Fe, New Mexico as well as Granger and Austin, Texas.) In November 2010, The Overlook Press published a movie tie-in edition of True Grit, featuring an afterword by Donna Tartt to accompany the 2010 film adaptation. It reached #1 on The New York Times's Bestseller List on January 30, 2011.

The University of Wisconsin Press) 11-limit tonality diamond, part of the basis for Partch's music theory Part of the keyboard of the Chromelodeon Genesis of a Music is a book first published in 1949 by microtonal composer Harry Partch (1901‚Äì1974). Partch first presents a polemic against both equal temperament and the long history of stagnation in the teaching of music; according to Alex Ross, this is \\"the most startling forty-five-page history of music ever written\\". In particular, Partch holds Johann Sebastian Bach responsible for \\"the movement toward equal-tempered tuning, which meant that composers could not absorb the scales of other world traditions; and the urge to make music ever more instrumental and abstract.\\" He then goes on to explain his tuning theory based on just intonation, the ensemble of musical instruments of his own invention (such as the \\"Surrogate Kithara, a struck- string, harplike instrument\\", and the guitar with movable frets he used to compose Barstow), and several of his largest musical compositions. The book has been highly influential to succeeding generations of microtonal composers, including Lou Harrison, Ben Johnston, and James Tenney. A revised and enlarged second edition was published just before Partch's death in 1974. Concepts Partch presents 4 \\"basic monophonic concepts\\": #Consonance and dissonance: \\"The ear informs us that tones which are in small-number proportion, say in the relation of 2 to 1, are strong, clear, powerful, consonant.\\"Partch (2009), p.86-90. . #*\\"The smaller the number involved in the [interval] ratios, the more consonant the ratio; the larger the numbers, the more dissonant\\".Dunn, David (2000). Harry Partch: An Anthology of Critical Perspectives, p.27-8. . #\\"Dual Identity\\": \\"Every ratio of a Monophonic system is at least a dual identity.\\" #*\\"Odentity [is] determined by the odd-number ratio component of the numerator, and another one, the Udentity [is] determined by the odd-number component of the denominator. A ratio thus always belongs to two tonalities, an Otonality in accordance with its Odentity, and an Utonality in accordance with its Udentity.\\" #Minor: \\"Under-number Tonality, or Utonality (\\"minor\\"), is the immutable faculty of ratios, which in turn represent an immutable faculty of the human ear.\\" #*See: Arithmetic progression and Undertone series #History: Music has appeared to have advanced up the harmonic series throughout history. #*Pythagorean tuning is 3-limit, \\"just intonation\\" often refers to 5-limit tuning, while Partch uses an 11-limit tuning. Partch admirer Ben Johnston uses 31-limit or higher \\"extended just intonation\\".

Career  Abdul Kerim Pasha's first battle was when the Russian general Oganovski launched an offense into the hills west of Manzikert, in 1915. Abdul Kerim Pasha counterattacked against the Russians and defeated Oganovski at the Battle of Manzikert, and captured the town of Manzikert. However Nikolai Yudenich, replaced Oganovski, as Russian commander, and counterattacked, re-taking Manzikert. Yudenich ordered a retreat from Manzikert, as he was outnumbered by Abdul Kerim Pasha's army, and Kerim pursued. Yudenich defeated Kerim at the Battle of Kara Killisse. Pasha retreated back to Manzikert. In February 1916, Kerim suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Erzurum. After the battle, Kerim was removed from his position as commander. In December 1916, he was shortly reinstated as commander of the XX Corps, which was sent to support Bulgaria and Germany on the Salonika Front, but already in May 1917, the force was dismantled and recalled to Mesopotamia, where the troops were urgently needed.

The play is called a \\"play with music\\", rather than a musical. Synopsis The action takes place in the eighteenth century. The benevolent Thomas Coram has recently opened a Foundling Hospital in London called the \\"Coram Hospital for Deserted Children\\". Unscrupulous men, known as \\"Coram men\\", take advantage of the situation by promising desperate mothers to take their unwanted children to the hospital for a fee. The story follows a range of characters, focusing on two orphans: Toby, saved from an African slave ship; and Aaron, the deserted son of the heir to an estate, as their lives become closely involved with this true and tragic episode of British social history.Edmunson, H.

SLC19A2 is a thiamine transporter. Mutations in this gene cause thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by diabetes mellitus, megaloblastic anemia and sensorineural deafness.  Structure  The SLC19A2 gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 1 in position 24.2 and spans 22,062 base pairs. The gene produces a 55.4 kDa protein composed of 497 amino acids. In the encoded protein (TC1), a multi-pass membrane protein located in the cell membrane, the N-terminus and C-terminus face the cytosol. This gene has 6 exons while the protein has 12 putative transmembrane domains, with 3 phosphorylation sites in putative intracellular domains, 2 N-glycolysation sites in putative extracellular domains, and a 17-amino acid long G protein-coupled receptor signature sequence. The thiamine transporter protein encoded by SLC19A2 has a 40% shared amino acid identity with the folate transporter SLC19A1. The N-terminal domain and the sequence between the C-terminal domain and sixth transmembrane domain are required for proper localization of this protein to the cell membrane.Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM¬Æ. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. MIM Number: {603941}: {11/22/2017}: . World Wide Web URL: https://omim.org/  Function  The encoded protein is a high- affinity transporter specific to the intake of thiamine. Thiamine transport is not inhibited by other organic cations nor affected by sodium ion concentration; it is stimulated by a proton gradient directed outward, with an optimal pH between 8.0 and 8.5. TC1 is transported to the cell membrane by intracellular vesicles via microtubules.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the SLC19A2 gene can cause thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome (TRMA), which is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by megaloblastic anemia, diabetes mellitus, and sensorineural deafness. Onset is typically between infancy and adolescence, but all of the cardinal findings are often not present initially. The anemia, and sometimes the diabetes, improves with high doses of thiamine. Other more variable features include optic atrophy, congenital heart defects, short stature, and stroke. A 3.8 kb transcript is expressed variably in most tissues, highest in skeletal and cardiac muscle, followed by medium expression placenta, heart, liver, kidney cells and low expression in lung cells. In melanocytic cells SLC19A2 gene expression may be regulated by MITF.  Interactions  This protein interacts with CERS2.

SLC19A3 is a thiamine transporter.  Function  ThTr-2 is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane thiamine transporter that lacks folate transport activity. It is specifically inhibited by chloroquine.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene cause biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease (BBGD); a recessive disorder manifested in childhood that progresses to chronic encephalopathy, dystonia, quadriparesis, and death if untreated. Patients with BBGD have bilateral necrosis in the head of the caudate nucleus and in the putamen. Administration of high doses of biotin in the early progression of the disorder eliminates pathological symptoms while delayed treatment results in residual paraparesis, mild mental retardation, or dystonia. Administration of thiamine is ineffective in the treatment of this disorder. Experiments have failed to show that this protein can transport biotin.

Early years Garrison graduated as valedictorian of the 1959 class of Roanoke Catholic High School, aged 17. He was president of his fraternity at the University of Virginia, where he received an undergraduate degree in 1963, and then a law degree in 1966. From there he became an assistant commonwealth's attorney in his home town of Roanoke, and by 1969, at age 27, became the youngest person elected as the Commonwealth's Attorney. National politics, and Watergate In 1971, he moved to Washington to be staff counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, and just 16 months later, he joined the staff of newly elected Vice President Spiro Agnew as legislative liaison. After Agnew resigned in 1973, Garrison began working on the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment staff, and eventually replaced the committee's chief minority counsel, Albert E. Jenner Jr., who called the impeachment case against Nixon persuasive. In an obituary The Washington Post wrote: > Garrison, then 32, was the last-minute replacement chosen by the committee's > 17 Republicans to present the minority view of the case against Nixon. With > just days to prepare, he submitted a 41-page argument against impeachment. > > \\"By all accounts, Sam Garrison did not exactly hit a home run\\", reporter > William Greider wrote in The Washington Post on July 23, 1974. \\"But his > performance satisfied the senior Republicans who wanted someone, for > appearance's sake if nothing else, to argue the soft spots in the Judiciary > Committee's evidence.\\" > > \\"The question,\\" Mr. Garrison said at the time, \\"is whether the public > interest would better be served or not served by the removal of the > president.\\" Back to Roanoke Garrison later moved back to Roanoke, and later ran into financial and legal problems. The Washington Post noted: \\"He was a partner in a failed Roanoke restaurant and disco. The business had $1 million in debts when it closed, and Mr. Garrison declared bankruptcy. His partner, left with the debt, conspired to kill him to recover $300,000 in insurance, a court later found. In 1980, as a court-appointed attorney representing a bankrupt mobile home firm in Georgia, Garrison was indicted in a $46,000 theft from its trust. He was convicted and disbarred and served four months of a one-year sentence. (In 1993, the Virginia Supreme Court restored Garrison's law license). In 1982 he publicly revealed that he was gay. Subsequently, he joined the Democratic Party and became active in party politics and in the gay rights movement, among other things, unsuccessfully campaigning for Virginia to repeal its anti-sodomy laws. He was appointed in 2003 to the Virginia Council on Human Rights by Governor Mark R. Warner.

XJTLU‚Äôs first batch of students graduated in August 2010 with 97 percent continuing their studies overseas on masters or doctorate programmes, ten percent of whom went to study at universities ranked in the world‚Äôs top ten (based on the University Ranking Chart by The Times, 2010). December 2010 saw XJTLU invest six million RMB in research for academic performance. By January 2011, XJTLU headed the list of Top 10 Sino-Foreign Cooperative universities in China. In a visit to the University on 25 September 2016 UK Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation Jo Johnson MP called XJTLU an \\"extraordinary achievement\\". =Funding= The government company Suzhou Education District Investigation (SIPEDI) has funded much of XJTLU's development and continues to play a large role in its success. SIPEDI has already spent around 130 billion RMB on XJTLU, mainly on funding facilities such as buildings and laboratories. =Context= A number of British universities have set up satellite campuses and joint ventures in China, including the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), an overseas campus of the University of Nottingham situated in the city of Ningbo, and the Surrey International Institute-DUFE, an academic partnership institution between University of Surrey and Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE) in Dalian. In 2010-11, China was the third most popular destination for UK TNE students, after Malaysia and Singapore: and there are almost 36,000 UK TNE students in China. American universities have also sought a presence in China. New York University Shanghai (NYU Shanghai) is the third degree- granting campus established by New York University, after New York City and Abu Dhabi, established in 2012 in partnership with East China Normal University of Shanghai. However, such strategies have proven controversial. A 2007 report, edited by Anna Fazackerley, cautioned British universities that they must acquire a more thorough understanding of Chinese higher education policy if they were to succeed in building successful strategic alliances over the long-term.British Universities in China: The Reality Beyond the Rhetoric. An Agora Discussion Paper Campus Entrance of North Campus Perkins+Will =Location= The campus is situated in 111 Renai Road, Suzhou Dushu Lake Science and Education Innovation District in Suzhou Industrial Park, 12 km east of the historic center of Suzhou, and 90 km west of Shanghai. With 2,500 years of rich history and culture, Suzhou has sustained an average annual economic growth-rate of more than 15 per cent since the beginning of China's \\"reform and opening up\\" period, its local GDP being ranked as the fourth largest in China, just after Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Suzhou Industrial Park is the location for more than 2,100 international companies, more than 100 of which are Fortune 500 companies, including Siemens, Samsung and Nokia.Suzhou Industrial Park Suzhou Industrial Park is home to more than 20,000 expatriate workers. Situated in the heart of the complex, Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong-Liverpool University forms part of that international community. The new XJTLU campus, to be constructed in the city of Taicang, is proposed that it will open in 2020. =North Campus= Its campus has been developed in two phases. The first phase focused on the North Campus, which was completed in autumn 2013. The overall campus plan was designed by the American architecture firm Perkins+Will. The University's iconic Central Building was inaugurated in autumn 2013 and designed by the British-Asian architecture firm Aedas. It was nominated in the 2014 World Architecture Festival. =South Campus= The second development phase focuses on the South Campus, where building started in summer 2013. The first phase of the South Campus was opened to the public on 26 July 2016, as a major part of the University‚Äôs 10th anniversary celebrations. Architecturally it contrasts the North Campus and features modern designs that complement the surrounding area. British architects BDP were responsible for the design of the South Campus. = Taicang Campus = Taicang Campus is located in the Taicang High-Tech Development Zone, north- east of Suzhou. = XJTLU Learning Mall = The XJTLU Learning Mall (XJTLU-LM) acts as an innovation and entrepreneurial research and development hub as well as project and partner center. It will promote the concept of lifelong learning for the XJTLU and Greater China extended learning community. It will also work jointly with core XJTLU departments and premier external partners, collaborating on critical innovation projects and initiatives. The XJTLU-LM officially launched on 22nd May 2020, welcoming its first round of new partners: AliCloud, McGraw-Hill, AMT, Skillshare, Talespin, YouYong XinDao, CiWei, Hujiang, and more. The XJTLU-LM will provide online and onsite space, or ‚Äústorefronts,‚Äù for top global partners to share their learning content with its user audience. It will integrate onsite and online programmes developed by the university, industry and external partners, offering them as learning resources to a wide net of different education consumers. The overarching goal of the XJTLU-LM is to act as an engaging innovation community, allowing its collaborators freedom to develop their resources within its creative hub. The online XJTLU-LM space will be an online community platform, creating a centralized location for content from XJTLU schools as well as premier global partners, which all users can access. The onsite XJTLU-LM facility, which is currently under construction, will be one kilometer in length, and occupy space in the core circle which unites the entire XJTLU Entrepreneur College (Taicang) campus and schools. In this space, XJTLU Learning Mall partners can host individual community spaces, leveraging their resources and contributing to a symbiotic ecosystem of learning - online and onsite, campus to community. Leadership XJTLU‚Äôs Board of Directors oversees the University‚Äôs governance and the senior management team leads the strategic direction and day-to-day operations. In August 2008 Professor Xi Youmin, a scholar in management, was appointed as the Executive President of Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong-Liverpool University. He is also Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liverpool. Academics XJTLU offers a range of degree programmes including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and Ph.D, with many of these having achieved accreditation by prestigious international bodies confirming the university's commitment to high level international education. The Department of Architecture's undergraduate degree programme BEng Architecture is validated by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). The Master of Architectural Design MArchDes has received candidate course status for validation at Part 2 level by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 2016. The Department of Biological Sciences' undergraduate BSc Bio Sciences is accredited by the Royal Society of Biology (RSB). The International Business School Suzhou (IBSS) at XJTLU was established in January 2013 by Professor Sarah Dixon, currently has eight undergraduate programmes and eleven postgraduate programmes in the fields of management, economics, finance, accounting, finance and business. IBSS has received accreditation from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and in June 2018 became the youngest business school to be accredited by EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS). It also has ACCA, CIMA, CPA Australia and ICAEW accreditation and recognition.  Awards  In December 2011, XJTLU was given the title of Most Influential Sino-Foreign Higher Education Institution in China at the Fourth China Education Annual Gala. Since the foundation of the Department of Architecture at Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University (XJTLU) in 2011, its students have won a number of important awards, including a third prize in the prestigious CTBUH Tall Building Student Design Competition. Architecture students were awarded already four times at the IDEERS Earthquake Safe Design Competition in Taiwan, and twice at the National Architectural Education Symposium, at which annually the best design studio works from schools of architecture across China are awarded. Research Research centers have been established at XJTLU to support research and development. In cooperation with Suzhou Industrial Park, the local government has funded XJTLU 10 million RMB annually for research. =International students= In 2016, there are around 500 international students at the university. To encourage students from the University of Liverpool to spend time studying at the XJTLU campus, the Year in China programme allows undergraduate students to spend one year at XJTLU, following XJTLU's BA China Studies degree classes. XJTLU also has a number of opportunities for visiting and exchange students from universities around the world.

It is a rare EP recorded by the band in Sydney radio studio Triple M featuring only three songs all from their 1998 album Internationalist. As is printed on the cover of the EP, there were only 800 copies pressed. Some copies of the album were given away by Triple M as competition prizes, some sold for charity and some simply distributed to Australian music stores, though due to low supply, these were collected very quickly by fans. Cover art The cover art is taken from the inside sleeve of Internationalist. It was used also as the cover of \\"Already Gone\\" prior to the EP's release. Notably as it contains the same image as the cover of \\"Already Gone,\\" that same song features as the first track from the EP, while the other two songs were not released as singles at all. The artwork has been tweaked to fit this EP, however. The sleeve from Internationalist and the cover of \\"Already Gone\\" both display the artwork as predominantly autumn colours with the person in the foreground in blue overalls, while the Triple M version has been desaturated of colour except the ground in the image has been recoloured to red (from brown in the other image). The image itself is of a farmer raising his arms as aeroplanes fly overhead. The art style is art deco and very simplistic. The typesetting of the band's name and all other text is the same as that of the cover of Internationalist and all of its singles. Songs The songs featured on the EP were all originated from Internationalist. \\"Already Gone\\" was released as a single earlier in 1998 and is the first track. The second track is \\"Private Man\\" which is written about the pressures of celebrities, and draws indirect references to former INXS lead singer Michael Hutchence. The third song \\"Hindley Street\\" is a song of duality, with the verses complaining of being homesick and the troubles of fame, while the choruses then mock the verses pointing out the luxuries of celebrity. The song is named after a street in a red light district of Australian city Adelaide. The song also gives its name to a large fan network of Powderfinger fans \\"Hindley Site\\".Hindley Site (2007), Hindley Street, retrieved on 17 July 2007.

Ahlemann et al. (eds.), Strategic Enterprise Architecture Management: Challenges, Best Practices, and Future Developments, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2012 Overview The fundamental prerequisites for effective EAM are a current, consistent baseline of information about the as-is landscape and an integrated planning process from demand to budget to reach the to-be landscape. The enterprise architecture function also involves reviewing and consolidating detailed architecture decisions and migration plans to identify efficiencies, advance standardization, and align business and IT priorities. As IT architectural layers, business support processes, and organizational structures become more sophisticated and prone to constant change, EAM will only result in haphazard business and IT alignment if the primary focus is on delivering sets of technically based models. This approach is only helpful insofar as it depicts the enterprise architecture as a snapshot in time, but it offers no reiterative process support to develop architecture solutions and test against different scenarios, benchmarks, and standards as dictated by the ever converging business and IT strategy. Moreover, a model-centric approach is prohibitively time-intensive to keep updated and leaves too much room for error as changes to the architecture occur unchecked and isolated in the heads of small groups of architecture specialists. Instead, the EAM effort has to bring the highly distributed knowledge of all experts to the table and allow every participant to provide such knowledge and input in the terms that best fit the experience and expectations of the contributing stakeholders. Application Successful enterprise architecture programs are approached from a management perspective as opposed to a modeling perspective. A new generation of EA Planning tools are emerging that support not only the modeling of the architecture, but also the creation of roll-out and implementation plans for continuous IT improvement over time. An important aspect of this approach is support of collaboration amongst a wide group of stakeholders from both business and IT including C-level, IT strategists, planning teams, technology implementers, and business analysts, who contribute to the EA management and planning process. In this way EAM supports sustainable business strategy realization.

He has been a core member of the music group Afro Celt Sound System since the recording of the first album Volume 1: Sound Magic in mid-1995 and has twice been nominated for a Grammy Award. As of 2010 the recorded output of the group has so far been exclusively released by Peter Gabriel's Real World Records. (The next two albums, Volume 2: Release and Volume 3: Further in Time earned the afore-mentioned Grammy Nominations). The group recorded and released three more albums Seed, Pod (an album of remixes and re-workings), and Volume 5: Anatomic. Martin has written film music for several feature films, including Hotel Rwanda and the Lebanese film Bosta. History Martin commenced his musical career in 1979, joining UK band The Enid on bass guitar and keyboards a few months after completing a BA Hons degree in music. His most notable contribution to the band's catalogue was \\"Once She Was\\", an arrangement of the folk song melody \\"Scarborough Fair\\". He remained a member until 1981, citing his increasing dissatisfaction with the whimsical vocally-based direction that the band was taking as his reason for leaving. With fellow ex-Enid keyboard player William Gilmour he formed the instrumental rock band Craft, who recorded an album which was released in 1984. He subsequently focused on studio building and sound engineering for the rest of the 1980s, notably at Utopia and Swanyard Studios before designing and building his own studio in North London, England in 1991. Sonic Innovation opened in 1992 and has been the headquarters for the majority of Martin's music production, recording, cd mastering and film music composition activities ever since.

Vegetable DAG oil, for example, contains 80% DAG75-3 Nutritional benefits of Enova oil and is used as a 1:1 replacement for liquid vegetable oils in all applications.Novel Food Information: Vegetable Diacylglycerol Oil  How it works  DAGs and TAGs are natural components in all vegetable oils. Through an enzymatic process, the DAG content of a combination of soy and canola oils is significantly increased. Unlike TAG, which is stored as body fat, DAG is immediately burned as energy. With DAG-rich oil containing more than 80% DAG, less of the oil is stored as body fat than with traditional oils, which are rich in TAG. Excess calories consumed by the body are converted into fat and stored, regardless if it is consumed as DAG or TAG.  FDA designation  DAG oil was designated as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by an outside panel of scientific experts, and their conclusion has been reviewed and accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This GRAS determination is for use in vegetable oil spreads and home cooking oil. In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has approved DAG oil to manage serum triglycerides after a meal, which leads to less build-up of body fat.  Side effects  Because DAG oil is digested the same way as conventional vegetable oils, the potential side effects are no different than those of conventional oil. In addition, studies with animals and human subjects have shown no adverse effects from single-dose or long-term consumption of DAG-rich oil. It has also been found that fat-soluble vitamins' status is not affected by the consumption of DAG-rich oil.H. Watanabe et al. Fat-soluble vitamin status is not affected by diacylglycerol consumption. Ann Nutr Metab. 2001; 45: 259-264  Research  Studies indicate that DAG oil has numerous health benefits, including reducing post-meal blood triglyceride levels.H. Taguchi et al.

Long- term ingestion of dietary diacylglycerol lowers serum triacylglycerol in type II diabetic patients with hypertriglyceridemia. J Nutr. 2001; 131: 3204-3207 Clinical studies in Japan have also shown that DAG oil may increase overall metabolism, helping reduce the amount of fat already stored in the body.KC Maki et al.

The company is cited as considering suspending the sales of Enova Brand Oil sold in North America. On the same day, Hagoromo Foods, maker of Sea Chicken brand of canned tuna, and Satonoyuki, maker of tofu products, have voluntarily suspended number of products made with Econa Cooking Oil sold in Japan. In its press release announcing the temporally suspension of Econa line of products, Kao cites questions raised by European researchers on the uncertain health effect of fatty acid glycidyl esters. It states that fatty acid glycidyl esters contained in the products are introduced as by-product of deodorization process, but maintains that the main ingredient DAG (Diacylglycerol) is proven safe, and says it plans to resume sale after reducing the amount of fatty acid glycidyl esters introduced in its production method.

Early life He was born in New York, New York to immigrants from Austria. He graduated in 1889 with a specialization in electricity, and did field work working on electric plants in Cuba, Mexico, and throughout the U.S. Back in New York City he worked for both St. George's Trade School and the New York Trade School. His reputation there brought him to the attention of Andrew Carnegie, who was looking for leadership for his new educational venture in Pittsburgh. Carnegie Tech years Carnegie and William H. Frew, chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Carnegie Institute and Carnegie's lawyer in Pittsburgh, hired Hamerschlag in 1903 as the first director of the fledgling Carnegie Technical Schools, as the project was first called. Its aim was not to compete with the nearby University of Pittsburgh, but to provide practical vocational training in the industrial trades and to offer 3-year diplomas, not bachelor's degrees. And so the building of the campus began, and the hiring of faculty, and the school was launched. Hamerschlag built the campus in partnership with Carnegie himself and the architect Henry Hornbostel. While the campus grew, the school found it difficult to compete. Industrial unions had their own apprenticeship programs, and it was challenging to attract and retain faculty, most of whom preferred to work for degree-granting institutions. So in 1912, the Carnegie Technical Schools were renamed Carnegie Institute of Technology. Hamerschlag then led the development of bachelor's and master's degree programs, and the college took off. When Andrew Carnegie died in 1919, the funding of the college, which had come from Carnegie himself, came under scrutiny by the estate, now controlled by the Carnegie Corporation of New York. It commissioned a survey in 1921 and the report recommended that the college broaden its sources of funds for the future. Hamerschlag, who did not have a seat on the board, felt excluded from the decision and the new direction being charted. He resigned in 1922. He returned to New York and reestablished an engineering practice. Hamerschlag died in 1927. At Carnegie Mellon, Hamerschlag‚Äôs name is still honored through Hamerschlag Hall, the home of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, as well as Hamerschlag House, a freshman dorm which was all-male since its founding in the ‚Äò60s but was made co-ed in 2018.

Fictional character biography  Reuben Cogburn was born on July 15, 1825. Cogburn was a veteran of the American Civil War who served under Confederate guerrilla leader William Quantrill, where Cogburn lost his eye. He was married first to an Illinois woman who left him to return to her first husband after bearing Cogburn a single, extremely clumsy son, Horace, (of whom Cogburn says in, \\"He never liked me anyway\\"). Cogburn is described as a \\"fearless, one-eyed United States Marshal who never knew a dry day in his life.\\" He was \\"the toughest marshal\\" working the Indian Territory on behalf of Judge Isaac Parker,Isaac \\"Hanging Judge\\" Parker the real-life judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas (having criminal jurisdiction in the Indian Territory, as the bailiff repeatedly announces in both films). When Cogburn goes to court in True Grit, it shows that Cogburn shot a total of 64 men in eight years, killing 60 ‚Äì not counting the men he killed after the first of the Rooster Cogburn film, as then it would have been 70 shot and 66 killed. He killed 23 in four years and 60 by eight, all of whom he claimed to have killed in self-defense, in the line of duty, or fleeing justice. In the 1969 film, Cogburn helped a headstrong 14-year-old girl, named Mattie Ross (Kim Darby), along with Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Glen Campbell), to track down Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), the man who drunkenly killed her father. In the sequel, he teamed up with elderly spinster Eula Goodnight (Katharine Hepburn) and an Indian boy named Wolf while on the trail of the desperado, Hawk (Richard Jordan), who had stolen a shipment of nitroglycerin from the United States Army and killed family members of both Goodnight and Wolf. Cogburn lived in Fort Smith, Arkansas, in the back of a Chinese dry-goods store, along with the proprietor, his friend and gambling buddy Chen Lee, and an orange tabby cat named after Confederate General Sterling Price for his entire life as a marshal. In the 2010 film, while Cogburn demonstrated a ruthless attitude towards the criminals and fugitives he pursued, he was generally very fair with Mattie and was shown to have a distaste for what he viewed as unnecessary cruelty. When LaBoeuf is birching Mattie for her refusal to return to Fort Smith, Cogburn demanded that he stop, and drew his pistol in threat to make LaBoeuf stop. Later in the film, when Cogburn and Mattie witnessed two children caning a mule with sharpened sticks, Cogburn quickly intervened, cutting the mule loose and roughly throwing the two children onto the ground in retaliation. After Mattie was snakebitten, he rode through the night, holding her, in order to get her medical care. When the horse collapsed, he mercy-killed it with his revolver and then carried her a long distance in his arms to get her to a doctor, both saving her life and proving he really had the true grit Mattie thought he did. Cogburn's relationship with LaBoeuf was strained throughout the film, with the two arguing frequently. Cogburn often made light of the Texas Rangers, much to LaBoeuf's outrage, and irritatedly criticized LaBoeuf's tendency to talk long-windedly. Likewise, LaBoeuf patronized Cogburn for being an ineffective drunk who routinely relents to Mattie's stubbornness. Their greatest point of contention came during an argument about their military service during the American Civil War, during which Cogburn ended their agreement of splitting the reward on Tom Chaney when they brought him back to Texas when LaBoeuf insulted Capt Quantrill. He did, however, thank LaBoeuf for saving his life when \\"Lucky\\" Ned Pepper was about to kill him and said he was in his debt before leaving with the snakebitten Mattie and promising to send help back. In both True Grit films, Cogburn confessed to having robbed something after the war before becoming a marshal, a bank in his youth in the 2010 film, and a federal paymaster in the 1969. He spoke admiringly of Quantrill, with whom he served during the Civil War. Twenty-five years after the Tom Chaney hunt, Maddie received a note from The Marshal with a Flyer enclosed, saying Rooster Cogburn was travelling with a Wild West show. However, Cogburn died three days before she arrived while the show was still in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and was buried in a Memphis, Tennessee, Confederate cemetery. When Mattie arrived in Memphis and learned of his death, she had his body removed to her family farm plot in Yell County Arkansas and has visited it over the years. His gravestone shows his full name to be Reuben Cogburn, a fact which he gave freely in the 2010 version of the film ‚Äì and in the 1975 sequel to the original movie before that. In adaptations The novel was adapted into a 1969 film, 'True Grit, and from that a 1975 sequel entitled 'Rooster Cogburn was also produced. The character was also featured in a made-for-television sequel, entitled True Grit: A Further Adventure, made in 1978. The Coen brothers released a new film version of the novel in 2010.Coens to remake True Grit, Hurriyet Daily News (March 30, 2009). In the 1969 and 1975 theatrical releases, Cogburn was portrayed by John Wayne. Unusually for Wayne, who usually portrayed straitlaced heroes, Cogburn is portrayed as a curmudgeonly antihero. The 1978 TV sequel starred Warren Oates in the featured role. The 2010 film stars Jeff Bridges as Cogburn. John Wayne won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Cogburn in the 1969 film. On January 24, 2011, Bridges was nominated for the same award for his portrayal of Cogburn.

It is the second largest shopping mall in the state of Georgia, the largest being the Mall of Georgia in Buford, Georgia. The mall is anchored by Dillard's, Nordstrom, Von Maur, and Macy's. Perimeter Mall is different from other shopping malls in Atlanta in that it includes open-air shops, upscale restaurants, and salons, connected by gardens and paths. It also features valet parking. It can be accessed by MARTA's Dunwoody station, which opened at the southwest corner of its parking lot in 1996. History Perimeter Mall opened in 1971 and was the fourth mall to open in DeKalb County, after Avondale Mall in 1964, North DeKalb Mall in 1965, and the Gallery at South DeKalb in 1968. Its original anchor stores were Rich's and JCPenney, which made it very similar in design and layout to the nearby Greenbriar Mall. Perimeter Mall was the first mall in metro Atlanta to be located outside of I-285. In 1977, the first Great American Cookie Company store opened at the mall. In 1982, an additional wing that included a Davison's was added. This gave the mall a T shape. Davison's became Macy's in 1986, In 1998, the mall was expanded again. In February 1998, Nordstrom opened its first location in the Southeast, a 230,000 square foot store in the mall. JCPenney closed in 2000, and the store was demolished to make way for a new Dillard's, which opened in 2005. The Rouse Company, the original owner of the mall, sold the property to General Growth Properties in 2003. Rich's became Rich's-Macy's in 2003 and the original Macy's closed and became Bloomingdale's the same year. Rich's-Macy's became just Macy's in 2005. On January 4, 2012, Macy's announced that it would close the Bloomingdale's location in the mall. On January 5, Von Maur announced that it would take over that location and would set up its second location in Georgia at the mall. In 2013, the food court was renovated and a Chipotle Mexican Grill was added. In 2015‚Äì2016, the mall underwent renovations including new ceramic flooring, new lighting, modern seating areas, updated restrooms and new signage. Some of the mall's original 1970s decor was replaced. In March 2016, the Pinkberry location in the mall closed. It had opened in 2014. In March 2017, the Bebe Stores location in the mall closed.

Even his family call him \\"Your Honour\\".Queen's Counsel Official Site Retrieved October 2012 Edward Longwind is a barrister and junior tenant at 4 Lawn Buildings. He aspires one day to be as pompous as Sir Geoffrey. Helena is a very junior tenant. She is young, beautiful, and - for the moment anyway - idealistic. She was the first female pupil in Chambers and has been trying to open up the stuffy windows of 4 Lawn Buildings ever since. Richard Loophole is a solicitor-advocate and senior partner in the firm of Fillibuster and Loophole. He is overpaid and - for the most part - underworked, unlike his luckless assistants, who regularly have to work over the weekend as Richard saunters off to play golf with his clients. Quentin Crawley is a pupil barrister in 4 Lawn Buildings and all around dogsbody. His grasp of law is slender at best and his appearances in court are inevitably fumbled. He lives in permanent terror of being found out and booted out of Chambers. Mr Sprocket is a client and endlessly unlucky litigant. He is invariably given terrible (and expensive) advice, usually resulting in a failed case and likely bankruptcy. Rachel is Richard's assistant solicitor. Like Helena she still retains some idealism and can dimly remember why she went into law in the first place.

The river is used as an outdoor classroom for students of Fluvial Geomorphology. The geology of the river consists of three different rock types. At the top of the river there is the Devonian Quartzite (Metamorphic), in the middle of the river there is the Permo-Triassic Marl (Sedimentary) and the lower part of the river consists of Jurassic Limestone (Sedimentary). The first two rock types are impermeable meaning there is little drainage for the river but the river depth becomes smaller as the water flows over the permeable limestone which will allow water to pass through.

Although Lutheran Services in America was established in 1997, LSA continues the one-and-one- half century practice of organized Lutheran efforts to serve those in need. Many of these social ministry organizations were established in the mid-19th century as hospitals or orphanages. New organizations continue to be developed as contemporary needs are identified. More than a quarter-million volunteers and staff members treat acute and chronic illnesses of body and mind, provide care for the whole person in need, and strengthen and empower individuals and families to care for themselves, for one another, and for their communities.

It was found in M√∂jbro, which is about 8 kilometers north of √ñrsundsbro in Uppsala County, Sweden, which is in the historic province of Uppland. The runestone is on display at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. Formerly placed in the 3rd century, the inscription and drawing are now mostly placed in the 5th or early 6th centuries. History Although the stone has been known since the initial surveys of runestones in Sweden during the 1600s, its exact original location is not known. The runestone is in height and made of granite. It is considered to be fragile. To protect the stone and its shallow inscription, it was moved in 1948 from M√∂jbro to the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities. Drawing The M√∂jbro Runestone is notable not only for being one of few runestones in Proto-Norse, but also for showing what is considered to be an artistically crafted image of a rider on a horse with two dogs. It is believed to have been inspired by continental Germanic images of victorious warriors on horses and that it ultimately derives from the motifs of horsemen common on tombstones of members of the Roman cavalry in late Roman Empire era art. Inscription Tracing of the inscription by Oscar Montelius (1905). The inscription is to be read from right to left, and from bottom to top. It transliterates as :frawaradaz / anahahaisla[g]ina/z. Several interpretations have been put forth for the inscription, but the only thing that can be said with certainty on the interpretation of the inscription is that Frawaradaz is the name of a man (and even the interpretation of the name is debated). The most common view is that the final part of the inscription is to be read as slaginaz \\"slain\\", indicating that the stone is a memorial and that it says that Frawaradaz was slain. Hempl (1900), by contrast, read langiniz, reading the letter transliterated [g] above as a bind rune (ligature) for ng (/≈ã/). George Hempl, , The Mj√∏rebro Runic Stone: And the Runic Ligature for ng, PMLA 15 (1900) The middle part of the inscription, reading anahahai or similar, has given rise to a wide variety of tentative interpretations, most of them assuming that it gives additional information on the person of Frawaradaz or on the circumstances of his death, including \\"ƒÄna, the one-eyed\\", \\"the noble\\", \\"on the racer\\"/\\"on his steed/horse\\", \\"of Hagho\\", \\"in Hagho\\". Gr√∏nvik (1985) gives an alternative interpretation inasmuch as he has the slaginaz refer to the horse, not the dead man, reading \\"FrawarƒÅdaz [is buried here] - Over [the dead one] the horse was slaughtered.\\" Elmevik (1978) interprets the final word as laikƒ´naz, preceded by the copula is: FrawarƒÅdaz ainahƒÅh«£ is laikinaz. The ainahƒÅh«£ is interpreted as \\"the only high one\\" (=the one most noble of all), and the is laikinaz either as \\"is eager to fight\\" or \\"is killed intentionally\\" or \\"is killed by witchcraft\\". Krause (1966) segments the top line of text into \\"ana hahai slaginaz.\\" \\"Hahai\\" here is interpreted as \\"hanhƒì,\\" indicating both the occurrence in speech of the aspirant h preceded by a vowel and a nasal to be realised as nasalised vowel (explaining the representation as \\"hahai\\" instead of expected \\"hanhai) and the development of the Proto-Germanic dative ending from /-ai/ to /-ƒì/ over time. This second indication would suggest that the spelling on the M√∂jbro Runestone is an inherited, archaicised spelling from earlier Proto-Germanic.The inscription is thus interpreted to mean \\"on (his) steed slain.\\" References Other sources *The article M√∂jbrostenen in Nationalencyklopedin (1994).

Born Jes√∫s Laviera Sanches, in Santurce, Puerto Rico, he moved to New York City at the age of ten, with his family, to reside in the Lower East Side. Throughout his life he was involved in various human rights organizations, but was best known as a renowned Nuyorican poet.. Note that other sources give his year of birth as 1951, and occasionally his date of birth as September 5. But the NYT obituarist reports that the date, May 9, 1950, was that provided by Laviera's family. An obituary for NBC Latino describes him as \\"one of the greatest representatives of the Nuyorican movement.\\"  Early years and education  Laviera was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico and moved to the Lower East Side of New York City in 1960 with his mother and siblings at the age of nine. He attended Catholic school in the United States where is teachers urged him to change his name to Abraham because they felt that Jes√∫s was unfit for someone of Latino descent who did not understand English. As a result, he chose to go by the name \\"Tato\\", a nickname given by his brother. After graduating high school in 1968, he studied at Cornell University and later at Brooklyn College. However, he never received a degree from either school. Instead, he committed the majority of his time to social and community work. Laviera served as the director of University of the Streets, a nonprofit organization focused on providing educational opportunities for underprivileged individuals. Additionally, he was a director of the Hispanic Drama Workshop, and a creative writing professor at Rutgers University. While still in Puerto Rico, his mother studied under Juan Boria, an acclaimed poet and performer who was inspired by Afro-Caribbean culture. This early exposure introduced him to the world of Puerto Rican poetry that he later infiltrated. Tato initially began writing as a means of reestablishing the name that was taken from him earlier in his life.  Personal life  Laviera had a daughter, Ruth Ella, and a son, Che Malik, who died in 2005. Tato suffered from diabetes, which caused a complications and interruptions in his work. In 2004, he was deemed legally blind due to complications with diabetes. He then revisited his passion for community work, working with the American Association for diabetes, where his main initiative was promoting awareness representing Latinos who suffered from the disease. He even founded the Jes√∫s A. Laviera One-Day with Diabetes Project which allowed him to incorporate his adoration for poetry. He hosted events during which poets could speak about how diabetes has affected their lives and offer support to the Hispanic community. Following some years of financial and health problems, Laviera fell into a diabetic coma. Shortly after he died, on November 1, 2013 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan.  Career  Laviera began writing poems and jingles at a very young age. He claims this lead him to discover the \\"wealth of characters and attitudes\\" that poetry contains.Luis, William. \\"From New York to the World: An Interview with Tato Laviera\\". Callaloo Laviera's poetry, which is written sometimes in Spanish, sometimes in English, more often in Spanglish, addresses language, cultural identity, race, and memory, particularly as it affects the transculturated lives of Puerto Ricans in the United States. Laviera uses the sublets of each language to contribute to his rich symbolism and metaphor that are commonplace in his poetry. His mastery of both languages sets him apart from many Latino writers of his time. Tato claims that the most important aspect of his poems is the title, explaining that \\"the words of the title are the ultimate essence.\\" Laviera was keen on performing his works of poetry in front of audiences in a musical manner. Live recitation of poetry is an important aspect of the Nuyorican movement as it better portrays the spirit of the poems. Scholar William Luis describes Laviera's work as follows: \\"His poetry is full of the music of bomba and plena, and of rap and preaching. However, it is also socially minded and historical in content. Indeed, his poems are a conglomeration of voices, songs, dialects, and cultures producing a unique synthesis which is moving, instructive, and aesthetically appealing\\". Laviera prides himself in giving a voice to all of the people, cultures, and nations he represents through his poetry. Since he believes he belongs equally to two nations, the United States and Puerto Rico, he opted to focus on the positives of biculturalism, rather than adverse aspects like some of his counterparts. Nicol√°s Kanellos's Hispanic Literature of the United States: A Comprehensive Reference describes him as \\"the inheritor of the Spanish oral tradition, with all of its classical formulas, and the African oral tradition, with its wedding to music and spirituality.\\"  Famous works  = La Carreta Made a U-Turn (Houston: Arte P√∫blico Press, 1979) = This was his first major book of poetry and was a response to Ren√© Marques' La Carreta in which he details the story of a family who ends up returning to Puerto Rico after migrating to the United States in search of more opportunities and a better life but instead is faced with a disheartening reality. Laviera disputes this view and instead \\"picks up where Marques left off\\" and portrays a more accurate story of the Puerto Rican migrant in which they do not return to their homeland, which is based on historical data.Flores, Juan, John Attinasi, and Pedro Pedraza. ‚Äú\\"la Carreta Made a U-turn\\": Puerto Rican Language and Culture in the United States‚Äù. Daedalus 110.2 (1981): 193‚Äì217. Web... La Carreta Made a U-Turn was extremely successful and received well by its readers. In fact, shortly after its publication Laviera was invited by President Jimmy Carter to an event at the White House for distinguished American poets. =Enclave (Houston: Arte P√∫blico Press, 1981) = In this poem, Laviera celebrates Puerto Rican heritage in New York. Unlike many of his other works which concentrate on larger scale events and take a collective perspective, Enclave is intentionally personal. Laviera focuses on the individual lives of those who inhabit the Puerto Rican enclave within New York. Tato celebrates the Puerto Rican-American experience, through his soulful and powerful songs. This poem was a recipient of the American Book Award of the Before Columbus Foundation. This collection focusses on the individual and delivers a gallery of portraits of the unconquerable people of the enclave, whose lives are brought forth via the rhythmic songs ‚Äúen clave.‚Äù = Mainstream Ethics‚Äî√âtica Corriente (Houston: Arte P√∫blico Press, 1988) = Mainstream Ethics is a poem which explores the place that Hispanics hold in the United States. Amidst a pressure to conform to he standards of the bustling Metropolis culture, Laviera emphasizes the importance of his own culture as a Puerto Rican American. From his perspective, he asserts that Hispanic culture, art, and language are transforming the United States, rather than falling victim to it. This poem serves as a message to encourage Hispanic Americans to hold fast to their culture of origin, and individual identities. This text explores the terrestrial and verbal imperatives of Hispanics in the United States. Mainstream Ethics affirms that Hispanic linguistics, folklore, art and past are transforming the national culture and identity of the United States. It is not the role of Hispanics to follow the commands of a norm, an elusive mainstream, but to instead remain faithful to their communal and distinct identities to both lay claim to mainstream territory and to disprove its existence. = AmeR√≠can (Houston: Arte P√∫blico Press, 1999) = In this poem, Laviera redefines his nationality and takes pride in being both a Puerto Rican and an American living in the United States. He establishes a new identity, called AmeR√≠can which is the harmonious blend of the two composed of \\"mainland and island traditions.\\" Calder√≥n, H√©ctor. Hispania 70.4 (1987): 806‚Äì807. Web... Tato uses the pronoun 'we' to signify the collective experience of multiculturalism for the entire generation of Puerto Rican-Americans. The first section of this collection celebrates the range of various traditions and cultures making up the American people. It is a plea for an end to prejudice. The latter two sections of the collection are built on the motifs of ethnic exchange and the place of the borique√±o in that greater scheme. = Mixturao and Other Poems (Houston: Arte P√∫blico Press, 2008‚Äì09) = One of Tato Laviera's distinguishing characteristics is his celebrations of the diverse languages that exist within America. This poetry collection combines English and Spanish to celebrate the author's bilingual and bi-cultural background as well as the growing representation of these dynamics in the United States. Various sections of this collection discuss gender, borders, and cultural folklore. He also rights about the sense of alienation that immigrants often suffer from as they can feel isolated from their native and adopted cultures. His usage of language allows readers to get a grasp of his own dual cultural identity.  Honors and achievements  = 1982 American Book Awards = Honored for his book of poetry, Enclave Tato Laviera Theatre One year after his death, his legacy was honored by the New York arts community when the Taino Towers housing complex, his last place of residence, renamed its Red Carpet Theatre for him.  Archives  The Tato Laviera PapersThe Tato Laviera Papers are held at the Archives of the Puerto Rican DiasporaArchives of the Puerto Rican Diaspora Centro de Estudios Puertorrique√±os, Hunter College, CUNY. The collection \\"provides insight into Laviera's life and career, as well as into the Nuyorican poetry movement, of which he was an early member. Consists of correspondence, manuscripts, typescripts, notebooks, press clippings, articles, flyers, event programs, posters, photographs, and audio and video recordings.\\"  See also  * List of Puerto Rican writers * List of Puerto Ricans * Puerto Rican literature * Latino Poetry  Notes   References  * . * .

It is the remake of a Telugu movie Sivayya, which was also produced by D. Suresh Babu. Plot summary Govind Narang (Sunil Shetty) is an honest and chivalrous man from a small village in Punjab. He falls in love with Sudha (Sushmita Sen), but marries his mentor's daughter, Pushpa (Suman Ranganathan), to save her from public ridicule. Pushpa was impregnated by a police officer who refuses to marry her. She does not love Govind and hates Sudha with a passion. Together with her brother, Laxman (Sharad Kapoor), Pushpa tries to expel Sudha from the village, but is unsuccessful. When Laxman finds out about Pushpa's infidelity, he poisons her. After his wife's death, Govind relocates to Mumbai with his sister, Ratna (Shraddha Nigam). He meets beautiful Gitika (Namrata Shirodkar) and they fall in love. One day, as Govind defends the honor of a young girl from the brother of a hoodlum, Johnny Handsome (Sharat Saxena), he generates hatred and animosity. Johnny is humiliated by Govind and swears vengeance with the help of Sadanand Kutty (Gulshan Grover) and Karim Khan Toofani (Govind Namdeo). On the other hand, Govind befriends Ram Sevak (Alok Nath), and with his help and assistance of a landowner, he arranges the purchase of a large plot of land so that hawkers and small shop-owners could set up their businesses. But nothing goes according to plan. The plot of land and the owner turn out to be fake, Ram Sevak turns out to be a member of the gangsters, and Govind gets all the blame. His sister is openly raped, and Govind himself gets seriously wounded in broad daylight before the very eyes of the people he defended. Govind is then helped by Sudha, and he decides to exact revenge. He files an FIR against everyone in the neighbourhood who witnessed what happened to his sister, except the culprits themselves. When they are brought to court, he condemns everyone for their attitude, and then tells them to be brave and fight the criminals. Encouraged by this, the entire neighbourhood decides to take on the gang. They attack the gangsters with bottles when they come to threaten them in the locality, and then move on to Johnny Handsome's office, breaking everything and attacking all the goons. They join Govind and Sudha to attack the gangsters and arrest them. The criminals are sentenced to death and everything returns to normal.

Elbe 17 is the third largest dry dock in Germany, located in Hamburg (Germany) and administrated by shipbuilding company Blohm + Voss.

During World War II, it was used for repair work only and also served as an air shelter (housing up to 6000 people). After the war, the huge floatable metal gate was scrapped and the dock served as a berth.

Jack Lake is a lake and reservoir in the municipalities of Havelock-Belmont-Methuen and North Kawartha, Peterborough County in Central Ontario, Canada, about 100 mi (160 km) directly northeast of Toronto and at the edge of the Canadian Shield in the northeastern portion of the Kawartha lakes region. The lake is in the Great Lakes Basin, and serves as a small headwater pond for the Trent-Severn Waterway. The Dispersed rural community of Jack Lake is on the northwest shore of the lake, (dispersed rural community) reached by Peterborough County Road 52 / Jack Lake Road from the community of Apsley, about to the north on Ontario Highway 28. Geography The lake can be generally characterised as having a fairly irregular shape, dominated by three deeply indented main bays and having numerous smaller or tertiary bays. Named bays are Brooks Bay at the northwest, Callahan Bay at the middle east, Long Bay at the south, McCoy Bay at the southeast, Rathbun Bay at the middle east, Redmond Bay at the north, and Sharpe Bay (the largest) at the west. The primary inflows are Apsley Creek at the northwest and Redmond Creek (at Redmond Bay) at the north, and the primary outflow is Jack Creek leaving over a small dam at the south. Jack Creek flows to Stony Lake, Clear Lake, the Otonabee River, Rice Lake and the Trent River to Lake Ontario. The dam at the outflow to Jack Creek controls water released into the Trent-Severn Waterway to maintain a guaranteed minimum depth on that waterway. The average water level at the dam varies between a minimum of in January and a maximum of in May. Jack Lake is at an elevation of . Natural history The lake served as a field research centre, water quality monitoring site and testing or analysis base for Environment Canada's National Water Research Institute (NWRI) through into the 1990s. Specific and longitudinal research work has been supported by a variety of academic centres and universities over the past few decades. Work done during this period has helped to improve understanding of how freshwater environments are impacted upon by development, recreation and wider changes within the natural environment. Jack Lake was originally home to bass and trout. As the lake developed as a tourist attraction in its own right, and as a feeder lake within the wider catchment that supports the Trent-Severn Waterway, fish species such as muskellunge, walleye, rock bass, and perch were also introduced from approximately the 1920s. More recently, Black Crappie have been introduced and are a primary target for summer and winter fisherman. Ongoing provincial and federally supported environmental stewardship and related work experience initiatives occur on the lake from year to year. Recreation There is a resort on the north-western shore of the lake.

A police duty belt (sometimes referred to as a gun belt, \\"duty rig\\" and/or kit belt) is a belt, typically constructed of nylon or leather used by police and security officers to carry equipment easily in a series of pouches attached to the belt, in a readily-accessible manner, while leaving the hands free to interact. This belt can carry any number of useful items, ranging from handcuffs to guns. The Duty belt came into use in the early 1900s, in lieu of carrying the required equipment in greatcoat pockets or additional bags. These early types were almost exclusively made of dark coloured leather with simple pockets or clip systems attached, such as the Sam Browne belt. However, there are some issues with the use of a duty belt, with the large amount of equipment carried on modern duty belts often carrying more than 20 lbs (9 kg) of equipment. Many police officers develop health conditions, such as chronic back problems, as a result of this reducing the effectiveness of the officer.  History  Many police forces in the United Kingdom began with a uniform consisting of a swallow-tail coat and top hat.Staffordshire Police history retrieved June 22, 2007 A pillbox or kepi hat along with a frock coat were introduced in the 1860s, along with helmets designed especially for protection against attack and the weather. Truncheons themselves had been introduced as early as 1764,Metropolitan Police history retrieved June 22, 2007Where have all the batons gone? retrieved from here on June 24, 2007 however it was not until 1994 that police forces in the UK started to nationally standardise their uniform prompting the introduction of the duty belt to contain such equipment, instead of previously having their staff carry equipment in their handbags or adapted pockets. In the case of the earliest equipment carrying, a cutlass or firearm was usually clipped to the belt of the frock coat. In fact pockets themselves were not introduced until the early 1900s in some cases.Police Uniforms Throughout History retrieved April 20, 2014 Before duty belts, British female officers carried their truncheons, which were shorter than the male version, in their handbags along with their police notebook as a matter of routine. Male officers carried handcuffs, whereas female officers were not permitted to without special permission. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Sam Browne belt was in popular use by police officers in the USA. Composition = Material = Most duty belts have a width of 2-1/4 inches and are either made of ballistic nylon or leather.Genat p. 45 Many Canadian police departments have had officers complain of having back pain due to their supposedly rigid leather belts. In response, many Canadian departments are now switching to nylon belts because they are considered by some to be more flexible. The Service de Police de la Ville de Montr√©al (SPVM), the second largest municipal police service in Canada, gave a contract to a consulting firm in order to find more ergonomic solutions. In Australia, instead of belts the WA Police are trending towards wearing vests with more equipment in them than belts due to back problems, and maneuverability. Older belts used to fail under the weight of whatever was carried; recently, manufacturers have introduced double-ply belts which retain their shape and can withstand the weight of the equipment. Nylon duty gear is generally less expensive, lighter, and easier to maintain than leather gear of comparable quality. However, leather gear is generally regarded as having a more traditional and professional appearance. To combine the best of both materials, companies like Bianchi manufacture nylon duty gear that has the appearance of leather. = Color = The most common color for duty belts in service with law enforcement personnel and security officers is black; however, there is some variation. In some instances, brown leather is used in place of black, which is generally only chosen for cosmetic purposes ‚Äî usually because it is more suited to the color scheme of the officers' uniforms.  Application  Duty belts wrap around the officer's waist and fasten with a buckle at the front. This is often protected by a velcro cover to prevent release of the belt by anyone other than the officer. = Belt keepers = In the past, many belts would sag and move around while around the waist while an officer was engaging in a physical activity. Belt keepers wrap around the duty belt and trouser belt, ensuring that the belt stays in place, even when the officer is taking something from the belt or engaging in an altercation with a suspect. = Belt suspenders = A three-way buckle. Belt suspenders allow the wearer to move a portion of the weight of the belt onto the shoulders, reducing the weight imposed on the lower back. This also means that the belt does not have to be worn as tightly, cutting down on pressure exerted on the stomach and waist area. However, there are also safety concerns over suspenders, as they can be used against the officer in the event of a struggle, but newer versions such as break off act like a clip-on tie when pulled, reducing the risk of any injury to the officer. = Fasteners = Traditionally, belts have been fastened using a metal buckle; however, this type is changing for a number of reasons. Now plastic buckles are more common, and many incorporate a three-way buckle system for added security. An example of this is the 'Coplock' system, which requires the wearer to depress a third release catch before the buckles may be separated; this is to decrease the chance of the belt being released by anyone but its wearer. Plastic buckles are often favored over the traditional metal versions, because when in use it is much easier to adjust the length of the belt to suit the officers' natural curves, whereas with the metal belt buckles it was only possible to have the belt at pre-set lengths, determined by the position of the holes in the belt, therefore making it difficult to suit an officer personally. Equipment Equipment commonly carried on the belt includes: handcuff, radios, baton, hand-held protection devices such as pepper spray, firearms and ammunition, taser, flashlights, batteries, gloves, pens, pencils, keys, multi-tool, window punch etc. The equipment carried largely differs from country to country, and between areas in the same country not only because of choice but natural hazards ‚Äî e.g. pepper spray would freeze in very cold climates. In some countries officers carry a knife.Stering p. 30 = Handgun holster = A handgun holster securely holds the officer's firearm. It has between one and three locking points to keep the gun in place and may have a cord attached to the firearm to prevent theft of the weapon. = Radio pouch = nightsticks, sidearms, handcuffs and radios clipped onto their duty belts. The radio pouch securely holds the officer's portable personal radio or handheld transceiver (HT). There are 2 popular radio pouch designs. The first consists of an L-shaped bar which the radio rests on, and is secured by a loop around the middle of the radio. The second is a two-piece design consisting of a radio pouch and a swivel. The radio is held in the pouch by a loop over the top, then the pouch is attached to the belt by a swivel. This design allows the radio to be easily removed from the belt for handheld use. Often, an external speaker microphone is attached to the radio, usually clipped to the officer's uniform shirt. Recently, in-ear monitoring has become more common, with a smaller lapel microphone clipped to the shirt. This in-ear system supplements or replaces the older lapel microphone. A 'Push to Talk' button is usually located at the radio, or extended to a separate switch located elsewhere on the officer. =Handcuffs= Chain link or hinged Handcuffs are commonly carried at many different locations on the belt, and using a variety of pouches, such as open and closed top holders and handcuff loops. Wise officers position the handcuffs to be in convenient locations for easy retrieval in a struggle with an offender. Recently, concerns have been aired that carrying handcuffs on the back of the belt may be unsafe, due to the pressure exerted on the small of the back by the cuffs and case, while seated. Although this may not be a problem for beat officers, who patrol an area on foot, this can cause severe problems in vehicle-based 'response' officers. Over time, the handcuff case may cause a rupture in the L-5 disc of the back , and cause pinching of the Sciatic nerve ‚Äî thus numbing the officer's left leg, severely affecting his or her running ability. Some officers choose to carry their handcuffs in the small of back position, but do not utilize a handcuff case, meaning that one side of the handcuffs is pushed between the officer's belt and trousers (or simply tucked into his or her trousers), and the other side is allowed to hang loose on the outside. This method is often utilized by plain clothes officers who do not wear a belt of any sort, and therefore are unable to use a proper handcuff case. Modern British police officers who carry handcuffs openly have an adapted holder designed to accommodate the cuffs at an angle, with a speed release mechanism. Rigid Speedcuffs with a plastic grip fitted to allow easy manipulation and storage on a duty belt Because of the rigid bar in this type of handcuffs, these tend to occupy more space on a belt whereas the chain link could be folded; the rigid type decreases the number of possible wearing positions. Typically, the cuffs are worn in a specially designed holster at a 45¬∞ angle, on either the left or right side of the officer, depending on whether they are left- or right-handed. These types of handcuffs are known as speedcuffs or quickcuffs, as the rigid bar design allows the officer to easily control the suspect and a much quicker placement on the wrist of the offender. Rigid handcuffs are most popular in the UK.  Others  Some officer supplement their standard handcuffs with disposable restraints ('zip ties'), such as the ASP Tri-Fold (TM) restraints, which can be carried in a pocket or in a specialized pouch on the belt. = Chemical sprays (aka pepper spray or mace) = CS spray holder. Aerosol chemical irritants are also commonly carried by police officers. The four most common formulations are: OC, CS, CN tear gas, or PAVA Spray. They are referred to as control sprays, pepper spray or mace. One method of carrying these is in a detachable holder, attached to the wearer by a belt loop and a lanyard. This provides the officer with both an easy, fast method of bringing their spray in a position for use against a suspect and also a secure way of carrying it, as the lanyard means that it is always within reach of the officer, and they have a method of drawing it back should it fall. Another method of carriage that is used, and is more basic, is to simply contain the canister in a pouch, secured by either a velcro or button fastener. For the canister to be ready for operational use, most pouches of this type contain a coiled spring at the bottom bringing the canister into reach above the neck of the pouch when the cover is undone. Some officers who carry a taser did not carry OC in the past, due to concerns of safety (ignition of the propellant) and limited belt space; the taser and OC are often considered to be approximately the same level of force. This has largely changed in the US, as the Taser is more effective , and the OC sprays are now nonflammable. =Taser= The taser (Thomas A. Swift Electric Rifle) is normally carried in a one- or no-point locking holster slanted across the front of the officer's duty belt. = Portable lighting =  Primary flashlights  Law enforcement and security officers often have a large and powerful flashlight for duty use which is often carried on the belt, with an even more powerful one in the car. These lights are usually rechargeable and stay on the charger when not in use. Long, cylindrical flashlights tend to be carried in a flashlight ring. Rings are simple and inexpensive, and are convenient for flashlights which are not regularly carried. However, the flashlight‚Äîwhich is often heavy‚Äîis permitted a great amount of vertical and horizontal freedom which can make the light insecure and uncomfortable to carry. Examples of popular primary flashlights: * Maglite Instrument MagCharger * Streamlight SL20XP-LED * Surefire 10X Dominator * Pelican 8060 LED * UTG handheld South Australian Police officers in February 2006 wearing duty belts.  Secondary flashlights  Because of the size and weight of most primary lights, and sometimes agency policy, many officers choose to carry a smaller secondary flashlight for everyday tasks. These lights are usually rechargeable and are kept in a holder on the duty belt. Examples of popular secondary lights: * Streamlight Stinger / Polystinger * Pelican 7060 LED * SureFire G2/G3 * SureFire 8AX/8NX Commander * Niton Tactical L.E. Professional Range * Blackhawk Nite-Ops Gladius * LED Lenser P7/T7  Auxiliary flashlights  Rechargeable flashlights have been known to fail at inappropriate times. Because of this, many officers carry additional non- rechargeable flashlights. These lights must be small, light, bright and absolutely dependable. These lights may be kept in a holder on the belt, or in a trouser pocket. These flashlights often use CR123 3.0 volt lithium or alkaline 1.5 volt AA battery cells. Examples of popular auxiliary lights: * Surefire E1B Back-Up  Weapon lights  To allow for better weapon control, officers often attach a dedicated flashlight directly to the firearm. These lights tend to be especially small, light, robust, and use non- rechargeable batteries. They sometimes have special features available, such as laser emitters. Examples of popular weapon lights: * Surefire X300/X400 series * Streamlight TLR series * Blackhawk Night-Ops Xiphos * Surefire 618/918 shotgun fore-end family  Special purpose lights  Some equipment has built-in lighting to better enable the officer to perform a task without having to use an additional light. For example, the Streamlight Cuffmate has integrated LEDs so that the officer can see keyholes on his handcuffs when restraining a suspect in darkness. = Magazine pouch = Spare magazines or speedloaders are carried to reload a gun. Magazines may be carried in a vertical position, or in a horizontal position. The advantage of carriage in a vertical, upright position is that the magazine occupies less space on the belt and therefore more magazines can be carried. The advantage of horizontal carry is that greater comfort is provided, and magazines are in a position that makes it easier for an officer to retrieve and load them into the handgun. There is also variation in the number of magazines a pouch holds. The norm is for two magazines to be carried, but there are also variants which allow for carriage of more, or less, dependent on the needs of the officer. Also, similar to holders of other items of equipment, these can be found with either an open top design, or a closed design fastened either with a press stud or velcro. Other pouches hold a single magazine but are attached to the front of the officer's firearm holster. = Baton holder = There are several types of baton holders for officers who have fixed or collapsible batons. For fixed straight and side-handle batons, they use a ring which keeps the baton in place, but can slide out when the officer is running or engaging in an altercation with an offender, and a fixed baton usually has to be removed before the officer can sit in their patrol vehicle. In the UK, where the police are not generally equipped with firearms, they use a cross-draw holster for their extendable batons, which is on the opposite side of their strong hand, facing forward. When an officer needs to draw the device from a cross- draw baton holster, they would be required to reach across their front to the other side of the belt, where the baton is, undo a thumbsnap (these baton holders have open tops, but are considered secure) and pull the baton out of the pouch. These holders also allow the baton to be stored while extended to allow the officer to arrest a suspect without the officer having to drop their baton or collapse it, which could take time and allowing the suspect to stage a counterattack or escape. Elsewhere, officers can choose to have a closed baton pouch or an open top baton pouch for their extendable batons. Open top baton pouches are considered by some officers to be a safety concern as there is no thumbsnap to undo, as an officer may be unaware of the baton being taken from him or falling out when moving. = Key holder = Universal handcuff key. Noise reduction is a major issue for an officer who may have to silently stalk a suspect. A 'silent' key keeper uses a velcro pad to prevent noise. Other types of key holders include models which work in the same way as a tape-measure, automatically retracting keys after use. A hidden key keeper, which is concealed in a belt, is mostly used for the storage of spare sets of handcuff keys. = Disposable gloves = Either nitrile or latex disposable gloves are useful when handling subjects that may have infectious diseases when rendering First aid or making an arrest. Another use is to protect evidence at a crime scene. Numerous companies manufacture dedicated pouches designed specifically to hold disposable gloves, as well as multi-purpose pouches that can hold either pagers, disposable gloves, or any other such small objects that will fit within the pouch. An officer who does not have sufficient room on their belt for a dedicated glove pouch will often simply carry a pair of gloves in their trouser pocket. = Knife pouch = It is often necessary for police officers to carry either a knife, or a multi-tool. The former is not just used as a self-defense weapon, but also as a utility tool for the cutting of various objects ‚Äî such as, for example, a car seat belt which an officer may have to quickly cut in order to remove an injured person from a motor vehicle. A multi-tool can be used in a number of different situations, depending on its specific design. It may be used as a knife, and may also be used in the assembly or disassembly of various items in the field, to facilitate their repair. It also has a limited use as a method of entry tool. Officers may also choose to carry a window-punch which is a small metal point on the end of a hammer-type handle, which the officer can use to break a window either to access a car or a residence. = First aid kit = Since police officers may be the first to arrive at a medical incident, officers may wear a first aid pouch containing some basic life saving equipment, which is useful while waiting for an ambulance to arrive. This equipment may include: medical gloves, CPR mask and antiseptic wipes. It is not common practice for American police officers to carry first-aid equipment beyond examination gloves on their duty belt, but they usually keep such equipment in their nearby patrol car. More expensive equipment, such as Automatic External Defibrillators, may be assigned to a few patrol cars.  Country-specific equipment  =British police= Unlike most other police forces, officers in British forces are not generally equipped with firearms. The standard equipment for officers of the British police forces includes Hiatts handcuffs, an Airwaves radio, PAVA spray and ASP baton. Taser-trained officers also carry their X26 or X2 taser on the belt, and all officers may also wear option pouches containing first-aid items or documentation. British police officers, and those of the Hong Kong Police Force, can also carry their warrant cards on their belts, although it is not a widespread use. Firearms trained officers may carry their sidearm on a belt, however drop-leg holsters are the norm. Officers of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, one of the small number of routinely armed forces, typically carry their sidearms and magazines on their duty belt.  Concerns and remedies  American police officers often carry more than 20 lbs (9 kg) of equipment. Many police officers develop health conditions, such as chronic back problems, as a result of this. Officers with back problems sometimes use suspenders, which transfer some of the belt's weight to the shoulders, reducing the amount of weight concentrated at the waist. Some officers are also switching to harnesses. This harness goes over their stab vest or ballistic vest and reduces the need for officers to keep reaching around to get their equipment. Some officers have even stored their equipment in pockets of their coats or trousers, however this is not recommended if an officer needs to reach for the equipment quickly.

The church has a tower with three bays, western tower with six chiming bells and clock face, and has been subject to various changes throughout its history, with one of the most substantial changes occurring at around the 15th century. It has a nineteenth-century manor house in its own grounds, known as Crawley Park. The Crawley Park estate is privately owned, and features some preserved and listed wooden-framed medieval cottages. The village also has The White Horse public house, which is described as \\"A substantial corner pub on the main road through the village, it consists of a single U-shape room wrapped around a central bar counter along with some outside picnic benches\\". Other amenities in the village include Husborne Crawley Lower School which was built by The Duke of Bedford in 1867, and was set up to ensure that the poorer families who worked on the estates, could have educated children. Husborne Crawley also has a village hall, called \\"The Reading Room\\", which is used by the community for meetings, social gatherings and parties. History The parish is first mentioned in a document of 969 setting out the boundaries of Aspley Guise, by its original name of Hysseburnan. Within the Domesday Book which was commissioned by William the Conqueror (1066‚Äì1087), found that the parish of Husborne Crawley was divided into two manors. The parish was still considered two areas in the Middle Ages, one called Crawley and the other Husborne Crawley, the first was considered to be in the south part of the parish and the other to be the northern part. The parish of covers an area of 1,610¬Ω acres, with a large portion (863 acres) of it being open grassland and also a large amount of arable land (414 acres). Population A graph showing the total Husborne Crawley Population from 1801‚Äì2011, as reported by the Vision of Britain website and Census information. Husborne Crawley has a population of 237 according to the 2011 census. Increasing from a population of 217 according to the 2001 census. From the graph, the total population has changed large amounts for a small parish, decreasing more recently possibly due to people moving closer to larger local areas such as Leighton-Linslade or Dunstable as they are the larger Parishes in the area. There are some gaps in the information as none was available, however clearly there has been a general decrease until very recently where the population has increased again. The changes have not been large enough and are more gradual to be from an event that might alter populations rapidly. Economy A chart showing the occupations of the population in Husbourne Crawley through genders in the year 1881, as reported by the VisionofBritain websiteA chart showing the occupations of the population in Husbourne Crawley in the year 2011, as reported by the office for national statistics website. The population and their occupations have changed vastly over time, as land use has changed and as the demographic of the population has changed also. From the occupations shown in the graph of 1881, they were mostly employed in agriculture and manufacturing, with very few of the occupants having jobs with professional titles, or working in offices or commercial companies. The population as of 2011 had occupations that are more professional, office workers, and managers. The occupations that require manual labour still exist but are often more skilled trades or machine operators. Throughout the history of the parish its main industry has been agriculture, yields crops of wheat, barley and beans come from the areas very rich soil base. Transport The M1 Motorway is Husborne Crawley's main transport infrastructure, and is about one mile North East on the Bedford Road from the village, accessible via the roundabout system at junction 13. The Bedford Road also goes west to Milton Keynes which is about ten miles away. Husborne Crawley is served by Ridgmont railway station which is located away on the other side of the M1 Motorway at Junction 13. London Midland trains serve the station, which also acts as a transport route for workers at an Amazon.com warehouse which is located on the other side of the M1. There are 7 local bus services that run from Husborne Crawley, the largest operator is Centrebus which operates three of the seven main services. Geology The geology of Husborne Crawley is made up of greensand sandstone, although there are areas of mudstone layered within the sandstone which is part of the Oxford Clay Formation. The soil is therefore mostly sandy and partially clay, with some smaller areas of mixed soil including; sand, alluvium, gravel, clay and silt.

A knife switch is a type of switch used to control the flow of electricity in a circuit. It is composed of a hinge which allows a metal lever, or knife, to be lifted from or inserted into a slot or jaw. The hinge and jaw are both fixed to an insulated base, and the knife has an insulated handle to grip at one end. Current flows through the switch when the knife is pushed into the jaw. Knife switches can take several forms, including single throw, in which the \\"knife\\" engages with only a single slot, and double throw, in which the knife hinge is placed between two slots and can engage with either one. Also, multiple knives may be attached to a single handle and can be used to activate more than one circuit simultaneously. Current uses Though used commonly in the past, knife switches are now rare, finding use largely in science experiments where the position of the switch may be plainly seen in demonstration. The knife switch is extremely simple in construction and use, but its exposed metal parts present a great risk of electric shock, and the switch is subject to arcing when opened at higher voltages, which poses a further risk of shock or burns to the operator and can cause fires or explosions under certain conditions. Open knife switches were supplanted by safety switches with current carrying contacts inside a metal enclosure which can only be opened by switching off the power. In modern applications, automatic switches (such as contactors or relays), and manual switches such as circuit breakers are used. These devices use a snap action mechanism which opens the switch contacts rapidly, and feature an arc chute where the arc caused by opening the switch is quenched. These devices also prevent injury due to accidental contact, as all of the current carrying metal parts of the switch are hidden within or surrounded by insulating guards.

For some years before these attempts were made to found a football club, but in a city dominated initially by rugby league with the likes of Hull F.C. and Hull Kingston Rovers this proved difficult. The first season for Hull City consisted of friendly matches; because of the time of founding, City were unable to apply for membership to The Football League for the 1904‚Äì05 season. The early matches were played at The Boulevard, home of rugby league side Hull FC. On 1 September 1904, City's debut match took place against Notts County; with 6000 in attendance at the Boulevard, City notched up an impressive start holding the more experienced County to a 2‚Äì2 draw. Hull's first taste of competitive football came in the FA Cup, but they were eliminated, after a replay, in the preliminary round against Stockton, the score was 7‚Äì4 on aggregate. After uneasy relationships with landlords, Hull City moved to Anlaby Road Cricket Ground. Football League Finally, after playing 44 friendly fixtures the previous season, Hull City were entered into the Football League Second Division for the 1905‚Äì06 season. Other teams competing in the league that season included the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea, as well as Yorkshire rivals Leeds City, Bradford City and Barnsley. Indeed, it was Barnsley who they faced in their first game, beating them 4‚Äì1. Eventually, Hull would finish fifth. The following season a new ground was built for Hull City across the road from the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, City continued to finish consistently in the top half of the table. They came agonisingly close to promotion in the 1909‚Äì10 season, recording what would be their highest ever finish in their history (a record which will be surpassed at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 Premier League season); Hull finishing third, level on points with second placed Oldham Athletic, they missed promotion on goal average by the slim margin of 0.29 of a goal. Before the First World War, Hull reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1915, beating out West Bromwich Albion, Northampton Town and Southampton, before eventually going out to Bolton Wanderers in a 4‚Äì2 away defeat. Post-War In cup competitions, the club's greatest achievement was in 1930, when they reached the FA Cup semi-final. The cup run saw Hull knocking out Leeds United and eventual Champions of the Second and Third Division; Blackpool and Plymouth Argyle respectively. They then knocked out Manchester City, to meet Newcastle United in the FA Cup quarter finals. The first leg at St James' Park finished as a 1‚Äì1 draw, but in the replay Hull beat Newcastle 1‚Äì0. The semi- final match against Arsenal took place at Elland Road in Leeds, the game ended 2‚Äì2, and was taken to a replay. Arsenal knocked Hull City out at Aston Villa's home ground, the game ended 1‚Äì0. In 1948‚Äì49, managed by former England international Raich Carter, Hull City won the Third Division (North), and their new Boothferry Park ground saw a crowd approaching 50,000 for the Christmas Day game against Rotherham United, and exceeding that for the FA Cup 6th round tie with Manchester United; the attendance of 55,019 still remains a record today. Yo-yoing between the second and third tiers of English football, Hull City had promotion seasons from the third to the second division again in 1959 and 1966, winning the third division championship in that latter season. Still, however, top flight football eluded the club. They came close several times in the early 1970s under the player-management of Terry Neill, but were not able to secure promotion before Neill left to join Tottenham Hotspur in 1974. Another player-manager, John Kaye succeeded Neill, but the club's form slowly deteriorated over the following years, eventually culminating in a disastrous 1977‚Äì78 season that saw four men (Kaye, Bobby Collins, Wilf McGuinness, and Ken Houghton) take charge of the team on its way to being relegated in bottom place. The following season saw Hull struggle for consistency, before recovering well in the second half of the season to finish a respectable 8th place. This form was not carried forward into the 1979‚Äì80 season, however, and manager Ken Houghton was sacked in December 1979 after a two-month winless run left them near the bottom of the table. Wales manager Mike Smith was recruited to take over, and a strong end to the season saw Hull avoid relegation by a single point. This just staved off the inevitable, however, and a thoroughly disastrous 1980‚Äì81 season saw the club finish bottom again, resulting in their first-ever relegation to the fourth tier. Two relegations in three years had a dire effect on the club's finances, which in turn helped lead to a dismal start to their first season in Division Four. An upturn in form later in the season saw them finish in 8th place, but it wasn't enough to save Smith's job, and he was made redundant two months before the season ended. The low ebb saw the arrival of unlikely looking saviours in the form of a chairman (Don Robinson) and manager (Colin Appleton) from the footballing outpost of Scarborough F.C. Promotion to Division Three followed in 1983, with a young team featuring the likes of future England international Brian Marwood, future England manager Steve McClaren, fearsome centre-forward Billy Whitehurst, and the prolific goal-scorer Les Mutrie. When Hull City missed out on promotion by 1 goal the following season, Appleton left to manage Swansea City. Hull City reached the Second Division in 1985 under new player-manager Brian Horton, and again nearly earned a second successive promotion, this time finishing in 6th place. The two following seasons saw Hull only able to record mid-table finishes, however, and Horton was controversially sacked shortly before the end of the 1987‚Äì88 season. Former Leeds United manager Eddie Gray replaced Horton, but was himself sacked at the end of the following season, following a disastrous run that saw them win only one of their last twenty games. 1989-90 proved another very inconsistent season, with Colin Appleton returning for a second stint as manager, only to resign after just five months, following the club's worst-ever start to a league campaign. Stan Ternent took over from Appleton, and oversaw a remarkable upswing in form that saw the team manage a respectable 14th-place finish. This proved a false dawn, however, and Hull's start to the 1990‚Äì91 season was almost as bad as the previous one, including a humiliating 7-0 thrashing by West Ham. Ternent was sacked shortly after the turn of the year with the club well adrift at the bottom of the table, with Terry Dolan replacing him. Despite an initial upturn in form after Dolan's appointment, and there being only two relegation spots that year due to league restructuring, it proved too little, too late, and Hull were relegated back to the Third Division, the beginning of what would prove a 14-year absence from the second tier. Striving to survive: 1990s Hull finished 14th in the Third Division in 1991‚Äì92, meaning that they would be competing in the new Football League Division Two. In their first season in the rebranded division, Hull narrowly avoided another relegation but the board kept faith in Dolan and over the next two seasons they achieved secure mid table finishes. But terrible form in 1995‚Äì96 condemned Hull to relegation to Division Three. Dolan was fired by new chairman David Lloyd after Hull failed to get anywhere near the top of Division Three in 1996‚Äì97, with former England international Mark Hateley taking over the manager's job. By this stage, financial problems were taking their toll on the Tigers and it was starting to look as though the club would go out of business before long. And Hull's league form was steadily deteriorating to the point that relegation to the Conference was looking a real possibility ‚Äì which surely would have meant the death of the club. The 1997‚Äì98 season would prove to be arguably the worst in the club's history, with the club earning just 41 points; any other season this would almost certainly have seen Hull relegated to the Football Conference, but Brighton and Hove Albion and Doncaster Rovers both had unbelievably poor campaigns, and instead it was Doncaster who were relegated, with Hull recording their lowest ever finish in 22nd place. Lloyd stepped down as chairman that summer and was replaced by Nick Buchanan, while Hateley departed in November 1998 to be replaced by 34-year-old veteran player Warren Joyce, who steered the club to safety after being anchored to the foot of the table ‚Äì Hull City fans refer to this season as \\"The Great Escape\\". After this feat, Joyce was perhaps unlucky to be replaced in April 2000 by the experienced Brian Little. Little breathed new life into Hull and managed to get good results out of the players, despite briefly being locked out of Boothferry Park by the bailiffs and with liquidation looking a real possibility. Hull qualified for the Division Three playoffs in 2000‚Äì01, and lost in the semi finals. But things could have been much worse ‚Äì at least the Hull City fans still had a football club to support. A boardroom takeover had eased the club's precarious financial situation and all fears of closure were banished ‚Äì had the club been relegated to the Conference the previous season, it is extremely unlikely that this takeover would have taken place. =The Tigers on their way up= Kingston Communications Stadium. Recent picture of Boothferry Park New Chairman Adam Pearson ploughed funds into the club, allowing Little to rebuild the team with the aim of immediate promotion. Hull occupied the Division Three promotion and playoff places for much of the 2001‚Äì02 season, but Little was sacked two months before the end of the season and Hull slipped to 11th under his successor Jan M√∏lby. Hull began the 2002‚Äì03 season as most people's favourites for promotion from Division Three, but a terrible start to the season saw relegation look more likely than promotion and Molby was sacked in October as the Tigers languished fifth from bottom in the league. Peter Taylor was named as Hull's new manager and in December 2002, just weeks after his appointment, Hull relocated to the impressive new 25,400-seat Kingston Communications Stadium after 56 years at Boothferry Park. After this move, Hull's attendances were some of the best in the division but their results were rarely this impressive and they were unable to finish above 13th place in the final table. Hull's new stadium was one of the most impressive stadiums outside the Premier League and it has helped influence an upturn in Hull's fortunes after a decade of misery. The two seasons which followed the opening of the new stadium were hugely successful. Hull were Division Three runners-up in 2003‚Äì04 and League One runners-up in 2004‚Äì05 ‚Äì back-to-back promotions ‚Äì which took them into the Championship, the second tier of English football. 2005‚Äì06 was hardly the most exciting season in the history of Hull City football club; it was more a season of consolidation after two successive promotions. Hull finished 18th in the final table ‚Äì a comfortable 10 points clear of relegation and their highest league finish for 16 years. 2006 and onwards =Championship struggles= English Football League System 1983‚Äì1984 to 2012‚Äì13 (last position shown: 9 May 2013, 2nd in the Football League Championship) The successful stint at Hull City saw Peter Taylor's name linked with the Charlton Athletic manager's job before it was given to Iain Dowie. On 13 June 2006, Peter Taylor left Hull to take up the job vacated by Dowie at Crystal Palace, a club at which he had enjoyed considerable success as a player. Phil Parkinson was confirmed as his replacement on 29 June 2006, with Hull paying Colchester (with whom Parkinson was still under contract) ¬£400,000 compensation. Phil Brown, who had recently departed his job as manager of Derby County, joined the club as Parkinson's assistant. Defender Leon Cort became Hull's first million-pound player when he followed Peter Taylor to Crystal Palace for a fee of ¬£1,250,000. Parkinson wasted no time in spending the majority of this money on strengthening the City squad in readiness for the 2006‚Äì07 season. Chairman Adam Pearson has stated his ambition to take Hull into the top flight for the first time in their history ‚Äì and he believed Phil Parkinson was the manager to do it. However, their dismal start to the 2006‚Äì07 season was hardly the form of a team attempting to gain promotion, and on 4 December 2006 Parkinson was sacked as manager with Hull in the relegation zone, despite having spent over ¬£2 million on players. Parkinson had achieved two notable firsts, under his management Hull City won for the first time ever on live television and also won a penalty shoot-out for the first time. Phil Brown was appointed as caretaker manager, and by 4 January 2007 Hull had moved out of the relegation zone and Brown was rewarded with a contract as their new manager until at least the end of the season. Hull's Championship game against Sunderland AFC on 17 March 2007 at the Stadium of light saw an attendance of 38,448, a record to a Hull City game since they visited Stamford Bridge on 14 May 1977. Hull City all but secured their place in the Championship next season with a 1‚Äì0 victory away at Cardiff City, on 28 April 2007. This left them 3 points clear of Leeds United, the only side with a chance of overtaking them, but with a vastly superior goal difference this was only a mathematical possibility. This crucial goal was scored by Dean Windass, who had rejoined his hometown club on loan from Bradford City. By 4 May, due to a lack of any realistic chance of them remaining in the Championship, Leeds went into administration and in doing so received the 10 point penalty such a move incurs. This deduction left Leeds at the bottom of the championship on 36 points, securing Hull's place in the Championship for the 2007‚Äì08 season. Wembley Stadium before the Championship play-off final against Bristol City Phil Brown and players celebrate on promotion to the Premier League in 2008 =Championship success= That summer saw Adam Pearson move on, declaring that he felt he had taken the club as far as he could and new investment would be required to progress further. He sold the club to a consortium headed by new Chairman Paul Duffen and severed his ties with the club, eventually taking over as Chairman of Derby County. Under Duffen and manager Phil Brown Hull City improved greatly on their relegation battle of 2006‚Äì07 and qualified for the play-offs after finishing the season in third place. They beat Watford 6‚Äì1 on aggregate in the semi-finals and played Bristol City in the final on 24 May 2008, which Hull won 1‚Äì0 at Wembley Stadium, with Hull native Dean Windass scoring the winning goal. Their ascent from the bottom division of the English football league to the top in just five seasons is the third fastest ever. =Premier League football= The 2008‚Äì09 season saw the Tigers play in the Premier League with home games at the KC Stadium. Hull City sold out all 20,500 season tickets. Hull have released four of their players: David Livermore, Jay-Jay Okocha, Frank Belt and Brewster Frizzell. Despite being one of the favourites for relegation, they began life in the Premier League in great form, beating Fulham 2‚Äì1 on the opening day in their first ever top flight fixture. With only one defeat in their opening nine games, Hull City found themselves (temporarily) joint top of the table, third on goal difference, following a 3‚Äì0 victory over West Bromwich Albion ‚Äì ten years previously they had been bottom of tier four of the league. Hull City's form never replicated the highs of the early autumn, winning only two more games over the remainder of the season. Despite the drop in form and slow slide down the table, Hull City went into the final game of the season in 17th place and above the drop zone. They ultimately lost the game against Manchester United 0‚Äì1, however Newcastle United and Middlesbrough also lost their games against Aston Villa and West Ham respectively, thus securing a second Premier League season for Hull City. On 10 June 2009, Hull City were officially announced as part of the Barclays Asia Trophy 2009. In this 4-team tournament Hull City competed against two English sides, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United, as well local side Beijing Guoan, who they beat 5‚Äì4 on a penalty shoot out after a 1‚Äì1 draw. On 31 July 2009, Hull City faced Tottenham Hotspur in the final of the Barclays Asia Trophy and were defeated 3‚Äì0. On 6 August 2009, Hull City acquired American international striker Jozy Altidore on loan from Spanish side Villarreal, with an option to buy him after the 2009‚Äì10 season. On 29 October 2009 chairman Paul Duffen resigned his position with the club and was replaced by former chairman Adam Pearson on 2 November 2009 and on 15 March 2010 manager Phil Brown was relieved of his duties after a run of four defeats left Hull in the relegation zone. Brown's replacement was former Crystal Palace and Charlton boss, Iain Dowie and the appointment was met with some disbelief by supporters who were hoping for a \\"bigger name\\" replacement. Dowie's first move as manager was to bring Tim Flowers and Steve Wigley onto his backroom staff, with former Hull City manager Brian Horton joining Phil Brown on gardening leave. =Return to the Football League= Hull City's relegation from the Premier League was confirmed on 3 May 2010, after a 2‚Äì2 draw at Wigan Athletic. On 3 June, season tickets for the club's 2010‚Äì11 season in the Football League Championship went on general release sale. After relegation, the club handed over their share on Friday, 4 June. Phil Brown's contract as manager was confirmed ended on 7 June 2010, and the search for his replacement was to continue past mid-June as the club confirmed that Iain Dowie would ultimately not be retained in a managerial capacity. Nigel Pearson was confirmed as the new manager on 29 June, lured from Leicester City in part by the Championship ambitions of the Tigers. Perceived lack of support at the Midlands club and permission to bring along staffers Craig Shakespeare and Steve Walsh from the Foxes helped seal the deal. On 10 November 2010, it was announced that father and son Assem Allam and Ehab Allam were to take over Hull City in a deal worth ¬£150 million. =Return to the Premier League under Steve Bruce= On Saturday 4 May 2013 it was confirmed Hull City would return to the Premier League after a dramatic 2‚Äì2 draw against Cardiff City on the final day of the season after fellow promotion challengers Watford lost 2‚Äì1 against Leeds United at home. In the 2013‚Äì14 season they achieved their highest ever league finish of 16th and were runners-up to Arsenal, losing 3‚Äì2 after extra-time, in their first ever FA Cup Final appearance. There were relegated from the Premier League on the final day of the 2014‚Äì15 season, but made an immediate return by beating Sheffield Wednesday in the 2016 Football League Championship play-off Final at Wembley Stadium. =Premier League= On 22 July 2016, the BBC reported that manager Steve Bruce had resigned from his position. This was later confirmed by the club, which also announced that Mike Phelan would act as caretaker manager. On 13 October 2016, Phelan became Hull's permanent head coach. On 3 January 2017, head coach Phelan was sacked by Hull City, less than three months after being made permanent. The decision was made following a 3‚Äì1 away defeat to West Bromwich Albion the previous day, leaving the Tigers bottom of the Premier League and three points adrift of safety. On 5 January 2017, the club announced the appointment of Marco Silva as the new head coach until the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. Hull were relegated back to the Championship on 14 May 2017, following their 4‚Äì0 away defeat to Crystal Palace. On 25 May 2017, following relegation from the Premier League manager Marco Silva resigned. On 9 June 2017, the club announced the appointment of Leonid Slutsky as head coach. On 3 December 2017, Leonid Slutsky and Oleg Yarovinsky left the club by mutual consent after a run of bad results. On 7 December 2017, Nigel Adkins was appointed as head coach on an 18-month contract and Andy Crosby was appointed as his assistant. He led the team to finish in 18th at the end of the season in the Football League Championship. The following season, despite being in the relegation zone after 19 games - an upturn in form saw the Tigers to finish in an impressive 13th place - helped on by star man Jarrod Bowen. However, Adkins resigned at the end of the season after rejecting a new contact. On 21 June 2019, Grant McCann was appointed as head coach on a one-year rolling contract. The team made a promising start to the 2019‚Äì20 season and were in 8th place after the win at Sheffield Wednesday on New Years Day. But on the last day of the January transfer window they sold two of their best players ‚Äì Jarrod Bowen and Kamil Grosicki. The team only managed one win, for the remainder of the season, on 2 July 2020 against Middlesbrough, and finished last in the division. They were relegated to EFL League One.

It was directed by William Dieterle and written by Milton Gunzburg, Alvin Meyers, John Balderston, and Wells Root. It stars Van Heflin as Johnson, Lionel Barrymore as his nemesis Thaddeus Stevens, and Ruth Hussey as first lady Eliza McCardle Johnson. The film depicts the events surrounding the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson, and \\"presents its title character as Lincoln‚Äôs worthy successor who runs afoul of vindictive Radical Republicans.\\"Kauffman, Bill (2011-12-02) Redford Goes Ron Paul, The American Conservative Like most U.S. historical films made during World War II, Tennessee Johnson has a strong underlying theme of national unity. The movie shows Johnson as a visionary who heals the rift between North and South despite the efforts of his shortsighted foes. In a climactic scene, he delivers an impassioned speech to the senators sitting in judgment of him, and warns them that failure to readmit the former Confederate states will leave America defenseless before its overseas foes. The scene is pure fiction; Johnson never appeared in person at his trial. Plot Runaway tailor's apprentice Andrew Johnson (Van Heflin) wanders into the Tennessee town of Greeneville. He is persuaded to settle there. He barters his services to the librarian, Eliza McCardle (Ruth Hussey), in return for her teaching him to read and write, and eventually marries her. Stung by the injustice of the monopoly of power by the landowners and with the encouragement of his wife, Johnson starts organizing political meetings. One is broken up by the powers that be; in the resulting fighting, one of Johnson's friends is killed. He dissuades the others from resorting to violence. Instead, he is talked into running for sheriff and is elected. By 1860, the eve of the American Civil War, he has risen to the United States Senate. When war breaks out, Johnson breaks with his state and stays loyal to the Union. As a general, he becomes a hero defending Nashville against a siege. Abraham Lincoln chooses him for his vice president in part because they share similar views on reconciling with the South after the war is won, unlike powerful, vengeful Congressman Thaddeus Stevens (Lionel Barrymore). When Lincoln is assassinated, Johnson succeeds to the presidency. After he refuses to accept a deal offered by Stevens, the latter starts impeachment proceedings against the president, with himself as chief prosecutor. Johnson stays away from the trial on the advice of men who fear he would lose his temper. With his cabinet members denied the right to testify, however, Johnson appears at the very end and makes a stirring speech‚Äîan event which never actually occurred. The vote is close, with 35 judging him guilty and 18 not, but Senator Huyler is unconscious and unable to vote.

The station has an alternative rock format branded as blvd 102.1. History Originally based in and licensed to Montmagny, CFEL-FM received its first licence in December 1986 and replaced CKBM 1490, an unrelated station which closed due to a bankruptcy in 1983.CRTC proceedings from March 21, 2006 (in French), paragraph 3977 .

Accessed July 13, 2007. History Diet Pepsi Max was introduced in the United States on June 1, 2007, and in Canada in March 2008. \\"Diet\\" was dropped from the name in early 2009. On June 29, 2015, PepsiCo announced several product changes which, among other changes, announced that Pepsi Max would be renamed in North America as Pepsi Zero Sugar. It is not known if it will come into trademark conflict with Coca-Cola, which uses the \\"zero\\" moniker for Pepsi Max's primary competitor Coca-Cola Zero, as well as Sprite Zero. The unrelated international drink will retain the Pepsi Max name. Marketing Pepsi Zero Sugar competes in the energy drink market, as is implied by it being marketed as an 'Invigorating Cola.' Compared with other common energy drinks, Pepsi Zero Sugar gives the consumer a relatively low dose of caffeine. Pepsi Zero Sugar provides 5.75 mg caffeine per 30ml, while Red Bull provides 9.64 mg/30ml, AMP Energy provides 8.93 mg/30ml, Monster Energy provides 10 mg/30ml, and Cocaine brand soda provides 33.14 mg/30ml. Pepsi Zero Sugar commercials present the beverage as an alternative to Diet Pepsi. In 2007, the official marketing website for the product contained an 'odd cast' featuring a spoofed telethon urging viewers to donate yawns and uses the slogan 'WAKE UP PEOPLE'. Also, there was a featured commercial of a spoof on the Dallas Cowboys offensive coordinator yawning, when calling a play, thus, causing Tony Romo to be sacked, he was then replaced by Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones who gives him a Diet Pepsi Max. The scene then cuts away to the words \\"WAKE UP PEOPLE\\" while a voiceover shouts the slogan. An ad for the product that ran during the 2007 Super Bowl featured the song \\"What Is Love\\" by Haddaway, and showed people sleeping in inappropriate places and at inappropriate times, while bobbing their heads to the rhythm of the song. After the 2009 Super Bowl commercial aired, another, more recent campaign (including television and radio advertisements) has emphasized that the product is intended to be a men's diet cola. In one commercial, entitled \\"I'm Good,\\" men are shown in various dangerous and painful situations, and after each brief sequence, the \\"injured\\" actor states, \\"I'm good!\\" The take-away message is that men can handle anything, except for the taste of the average diet cola. Pepsi Max is intended to be the diet cola that men will enjoy. Another commercial entitled \\"Ingredients\\" shows men in various situations listing fictitious ingredients that essentially make Pepsi Max seem \\"tough.\\" The fictitious ingredients include pepper spray (as a sweetener), scorpion venom, crushed Viking bones, and the saliva of a rabid wolverine. The actors also state that the can is made from the hull of a nuclear submarine, and subsequently crush the cans in their bare hands, stating, \\"I just crushed the hull of a nuclear submarine.\\" This commercial ends with \\"Maximum Taste, No Sugar, and Maybe Scorpion Venom. Pepsi Max, the First Diet Cola for Men,\\" signaling a definitively different message than the one used in the \\"WAKE UP PEOPLE\\" advertisements. These more recent commercials have portrayed Pepsi Zero Sugar consumers as unremarkable, average, and heavy men, explicitly identifying the target market. For Super Bowl XLIV in July 2010, Pepsi Max did a reboot of a well-received ad that ran during the 1995 Super Bowl XXIX. In the original ad, a pair of delivery drivers from Coca-Cola and Pepsi began a tentative friendship while listening to\\"Get Together\\" by The Youngbloods; in a peacemaking gesture, the two rivals taste each other's soda. But the friendship ends in humorous conflict when the Coca-Cola driver refuses to return the (superior) Pepsi product. The new ad riffed on the same story, with the drivers this time coming to blows over the then-Pepsi MAX at the expense of Coca-Cola's much more popular Coke Zero, with the song \\"Why Can't We Be Friends?\\" by the American funk band War as the soundtrack. In 2011, Snoop Dogg was featured in an ad campaign around the time of Super Bowl XLV. In early 2010, Pepsi released a limited edition called \\"Pepsi Max Cease Fire.\\" It is Diet Pepsi Lime in the Pepsi Max formula, and is being cross-promoted with Doritos Burn flavors. In July 2010, Pepsi Zero Sugar, then under the Pepsi Max name, was once again redesigned, this time to match its global branding. In the process, Pepsi Max began using the medium- sized \\"smile.\\" The \\"Max\\" typeface was changed to appear similar to what is used worldwide, and a distorted blue background borders the Pepsi globe. A can of Pepsi Max in the previous design (July 2010‚ÄìAugust 2016) Pepsi MAX was also advertised by \\"Uncle Drew\\" with the slogan \\"Get Buckets.\\" Richard Speight, Jr. is the \\"Pepsi Max\\" delivery guy for all commercials the last two years, with ads featuring major baseball and football stars, and also with Snoop Dogg and 4-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon, who worked with Pepsi Max in 2013 to create Pepsi Max & Jeff Gordon Present: Test Drive, along with Road Trip to the Race Track two years prior. Pepsi Max also sponsored Gordon's Hendrick Motorsports teammate Kasey Kahne during the 2013 Cup Series season. Pepsi Max's current slogan in the US is \\"Maximum taste. Zero calories.\\" Coke Zero, also known as Coca-Cola Zero, is Pepsi Zero Sugar's primary competing product, which was introduced in 2008. In August, 2017, Coke Zero changed its name to Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, or Coke Zero Sugar, as well as changed its taste by tweaking the blend of natural flavors proprietary to Coca-Cola. Pepsi sponsored the Superbowl LI Halftime Show, naming it \\"The Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl LI Halftime Show\\" with its headlining performer being American Singer-Songwriter Lady Gaga. This halftime show became the most watched Superbowl Halftime Show in history.

Structure The formiminotransferase (FT) domain of formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase (FTCD) forms a homodimer, with each protomer comprising two subdomains. The formiminotransferase domain has an N-terminal subdomain that is made up of a six-stranded mixed beta-pleated sheet and five alpha helices, which are arranged on the external surface of the beta sheet. This, in turn, faces the beta-sheet of the C-terminal subdomain to form a double beta-sheet layer. The two subdomains are separated by a short linker sequence, which is not thought to be any more flexible than the remainder of the molecule. The substrate is predicted to form a number of contacts with residues found in both the N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains. In humans, deficiency of this enzyme results in a disease phenotype.

The holotype specimen, recovered in 2005, is currently held by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing. It was found in the Jianshangou fossil beds, dated to 124.6 million years ago. Three additional specimens have been reported, though only one of those has been definitively identified as belonging to Hongshanornis. This latter specimen was found in the Dawangzhangzi fossil beds, which are about 122 million years old. Hongshanornis is a member of the group Hongshanornithidae, to which it lent its name. It is closely related to Longicrusavis, which existed alongside Hongshanornis in the Dawangzhangzi ecosystem, and is very similar to the later Parahongshanornis from the Jiufotang Formation. Description Hongshanornis longicresta was a small species, especially compared to other early ornithuromorphs (birds with a modern tail anatomy), about the size of a thrush, and adult specimens are estimated to have weighed about in life, with a wingspan of about . Interpretive drawing of specimen DNHM D2946, showing location of gizzard stones The skull in all known specimens is poorly preserved, but in general appears to have had a narrow snout compared to the closely related Longicrusavis. The teeth were very small and are poorly preserved in all known specimens. At first, this led scientists to conclude that the teeth were absent in both the upper and lower jaws, probably replaced with a beak. However, later study of the type specimen showed that tooth sockets were present in the preserved parts of the jaw, and comparison with related forms showed that it did have teeth. The discovery of a more well preserved specimen confirmed the presence of teeth in at least the maxilla (middle of the upper jaw) and dentary (lower jaw). The snout appears to have lacked feathers, though whether it was only covered in skin or some parts bore a beak is currently unknown. The describers of Hongshanornis noted a unique bone in the end of the lower jaw which they equated with the beak-bearing \\"predentary bone\\" similar to the one found in ornithischian dinosaurs. Such bones have also been found in more advanced birds like Hesperornis. Supporting Information However, other scientists have pointed out that the \\"predentary\\" (or, technically, mandibular symphysial ossification) of Hongshanornis lacks the characteristic pits and grooves associated with the beak in early beaked birds like Archaeorhynchus, and that the presence or absence of any beak is unclear. The original describers of Hongshanornis noted the apparent presence of a large feathered crest on the head, though the feather traces are extremely poor quality and it may be an artifact of preservation. A second specimen from different fossil beds did not have long feathers on the head, but rather showed feathers which became shorter closer to the snout. The wings were long and broad, but tapered and pointed at the tips. The first few primary flight feathers were much shorter than the rest. The total wing area was 0.016 square meters. The wing digits bore small claws, with the claw on the first finger (the alular digit) much larger than that of the second finger (major digit). Hongshanornis is characterized by very long legs, with the lower leg (tibiotarsus) more than one and a half times longer than the upper leg (femur). The toes were long and thin, with small claws. The first toe (hallux) was very small, and the second toe was much shorter than the fourth. The third toe was longest. Restoration The bones of the tail have not been preserved in any known specimen, but comparison with related species suggest it was short with a small, plowshare-shaped pygostyle bone, to which the tail feathers anchored. A mass of muscles, called the rectorial bulb, probably was present to control the fanning of the trail feathers. The tail feathers were long, with symmetrical vanes. There were at least 10 tail feathers (rectrices), more than in other primitive fan-tailed birds. The overall shape of the tail was rounded and wedge-shaped when viewed from above; due to the symmetrical feathers, the sides of the tail were probably not held fully fanned into the wind but swept back, forming a partially fanned wedge, as in some modern birds like accipiters, tyrant flycatchers and sunbitterns. Biology =Diet and ecology= Skull of specimen DNHM D2945, highlighting teeth Due to the assumption of toothlessness, hongshanornithids were originally interpreted as having a very specialized diet and ecology, perhaps as waders or shorebirds due to their slim snouts and long legs. However, the confirmation that they did in fact have teeth in both jaws has led to a re- interpretation of their ecological niche. Though still considered probably wading birds, they probably had a more generalized diet than previously assumed, with the different snout shapes present in different members of the group indicating niche portioning within a general wading ecology (Hongshanornis lived alongside the closely related Longicrusavis, and both were very similar to each other except for the shape of the snout). One specimen of Hongshanornis preserved several gizzard stones (gastroliths) of various sizes, which is usually an indication of an herbivorous diet. Another specimen originally assigned to the genus Hongshanornis preserved fossilized seeds in the crop; however, this specimen was subsequently transferred to a distinct taxon Eogranivora edentulata. =Flight= Diagram of the wing and tail profile The wings of H. longicresta were broad and tapered, with an average wing area and wing loading compared to modern birds in the same size range. The presence or absence of slotting at the wing tips cannot be determined with known specimens, but modern birds with similar size and wing shape tend to lack wing slotting. The absence of wing slotting would suggest that Hongshanornis tended to fly mainly at relatively high speeds. Given the overall wing shape and comparison to modern birds, Hongshanornis probably flapped continuously when flying at lower speeds, and switched to bounding flight (rapid flapping alternating with periods of ballistic forward motion with the wings partly folded) at higher speeds. Overall, the wing and tail anatomy, and therefore probably flight style, of Hongshanornis was similar to many medium-sized passerine birds.

It was previously classified as a variety of S. purpurea subsp. venosa (var. burkii). The proposition for the plant to be named a new species arose in 1999. This proposition was based on three main factors: S. rosea has larger flowers on shorter stalks; it produces light pink petals, a feature no other species in the genus exhibits; and it has a somewhat different pitcher structure than S. purpurea.Rice, B.A. 2006. The Carnivorous Plant FAQ: Sarracenia rosea. Accessed 1 June 2007. A form which lacks anthocyanins has been described as Sarracenia rosea f. luteola. The species is native to the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern United States, and has been found from Mississippi to Georgia. However, the areas in which the plant occurs are being developed, so the species's habitat is threatened. However along with Sarracenia psittacina, this species readily colonizes drainage ditches along highways throughout the gulf states providing a somewhat more sustainable albeit less natural habitat. S. rosea is appreciably more shade-tolerant than the other members of the genus. Botanical history Sarracenia rosea was first identified by the American botanist Edgar T. Wherry as a \\"mutant\\" form of S. purpurea in 1933 based on specimens collected by Frank Morton Jones in 1910 near Theodore, Alabama and Wherry's own collections in 1932, likely also from southern Alabama. These plants differed from S. purpurea in the rose-pink petals and nearly white style (S. purpurea has deep maroon petals and the style is typically green). Wherry sent specimens to Louis Burk, a Philadelphia horticulturalist, who confirmed Wherry's field observations in greenhouse-grown plants. Wherry followed this revelation and suggested naming the variety in honor of Burk, but it remained unpublished.Schnell, D.E. 1993. Sarracenia purpurea L. ssp. venosa (Raf.) Wherry var. burkii Schnell (Sarraceniaceae)a new variety of the Gulf coastal plain. Rhodora 95: 6-10. Based on the morphological differences from the southern subspecies, S. purpurea subsp. venosa, and the geographic isolation of the populations with pink petals along the Gulf Coast, the American botanist Donald E. Schnell formally described this taxon in a 1993 issue of Rhodora, the journal of the New England Botanical Club. Schnell decided to place this taxon at the rank of variety below subsp. venosa as S. purpurea var. burkii, honoring Louis Burk as Wherry had suggested 60 years earlier. In 1999, however, botanists Robert Naczi, then a professor of biology at Northern Kentucky University, and Frederick and Roberta Case elevated the variety to species rank, naming it Sarracenia rosea. They compiled morphological data from specimens of S. purpurea and S. rosea and found significant differences in scape height, petal size, pitcher \\"lip\\" thickness, and pitcher leaf morphology. All of this evidence, combined with the allopatric distribution that does not overlap with S. purpurea, lead the authors to determine the Gulf Coast populations with pink petals are worthy of recognition at species rank. They chose to assign a new epithet, rosea, to the species rather than utilize the varietal epithet burkii as allowed under article 11.2 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature to avoid confusion and express the color of the flowers in the species epithet.Naczi, R.F.C., E.M.

In English it is known as Nara, butter-nuts, or butterpips; in one of the Khoisan languages it is locally called «Énaras or «Énara (\\"!\\" is pronounced with a click, somewhat like the \\"tsk\\" when English people are tutting, tsk- tsk-tsk). Description It is a dioecious, leafless, phreatophyte (meaning its roots penetrate deep down to water near the water table) that is found in sandy deserts but not stony plains, in areas with access to ground water such as ephemeral rivers and paleochannels, where sand accumulating in the shelter of its stems can form hummocks up to 1000‚Äì1500 m2 in area and 4 meters in height. Its stems may rise more than a meter above the hummocks, while its system of thick taproots can extend up to 50 m downward. The plant is leafless, so modified stems and spines 2‚Äì3 centimetres long serve as the photosynthetic \\"organs\\" of the plant. The plant can survive many years without water. Ecology Its sand-binding characteristics also help nara form microclimate within the desert dunes. These microclimates provide food and shelter for a variety of vertebrates. Presence of the nara plant is associated with significantly increased soil microdiversity likely due to the shade it provides and the attraction of foraging mammals which contribute to organic matter. Acanthosicyos horridus typically occurs in the absence of other vegetation due to the harshness of the climate, though Eragrostis spinosa and Stipagrostis sabulicola grasses may grow between its hummocks. It is regarded as a keystone species because its melons, seeds, shoots, and flowers are food sources for beetles, gemsbok, and ostrich, while small rodents such as Rhabdomys pumilio, Desmodillus auricularis, and Thallomys nigricauda take shelter amid the spiny tangle of its stems. The katydid Acanthoproctus diadematus feeds on the plant, moving between different bushes at night.  Uses  Acanthosicyos horridus fruit in Sossusvlei in Namibia The melon fruits average 1 kg and are pale green and spiny. Within it has a sweet, aromatic, watery, yellow-orange pulp. The large edible seeds, white to cream in color, are known as butter-nuts or butterpips. These have been exported for use in baked goods.Grubben, G.J.H. & Denton, O.A.

Applicants have to apply in personin case of a child under 14, accompanied by a parentat the local police department or at a Greek Consulate Authority. Upon submitting all the requirements (special portrait photo, issuing request, and fee), the police department begins the issuing procedure. All passports are manufactured centrally at the N.P.C main building in Athens. Depending on the circumstances, passports are issued in 3 to 9 business days and must be picked up at the police department in which the issuing request was made. For this, an applicant must carry with her/him a special receipt they received after applying. Standard passports are valid for a period of 5 years for people 14 years old and older, and 3 years for children under 14 (after the official edition of the 135th Presidential decree in 2007). Greek passports cannot be extended. A holder has to make a request for a new one if his/her passport expires within the next six months of the request and he/she plans to use it after the expiry date. The issuing of a standard adult passport costs ‚Ç¨84.40, while that of a child costs ‚Ç¨73.60. Reissuance of an existing and still-valid passport with no blank pages is possible with a validity date equal to the previous passport and a cost of ‚Ç¨53. Visa free travel Visa requirements for Greek citizens Visa requirements for Greek citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Greece. As of 3 July 2018, Greek citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 183 countries and territories, ranking the Greek passport 6th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index (tied with the Australian passport).

Such laws have been irregularly enacted in all 50 U.S. states since 2002, with the last 3 states having no privacy laws protecting citizens as late as 2016. New Mexico only passed their privacy law in 2017 and South Dakota and Alabama in 2018 . These laws were enacted in response to an escalating number of breaches of consumer databases containing personally identifiable information. The first such law, the California data security breach notification law,SB 1386, Cal. Civ. Code 1798.82 and 1798.29. was enacted in 2002 and became effective on July 1, 2003.SB 1386 Senate Bill As related in the bill statement, law requires \\"a state agency, or a person or business that conducts business in California, that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information, as defined, to disclose in specified ways, any breach of the security of the data, as defined, to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.\\" In addition, the law permits delayed notification \\"if a law enforcement agency determines that it would impede a criminal investigation.\\" The law also requires any entity that licenses such information to notify the owner or licensee of the information of any breach of the security of the data. In general, most state laws follow the basic tenets of California's original law: Companies must immediately disclose a data breach to customers, usually in writing. California has since broadened its law to include compromised medical and health insurance information. Where bills differ most is at what level the breach must be reported to the state Attorney General (usually when it affects 500 or 1000 individuals or more). Some states like California publish these data breach notifications on their oag.gov websites. Breaches must be reported if \\"sensitive personally identifying information has been acquired or is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person, and is reasonably likely to cause substantial harm to the individuals to whom the information relates.\\"https://www.bakerlaw.com/files/uploads/documents/data%20breach%20documents/state_data_breach_statute_form.pdf This leaves room for some interpretation (will it cause substantial harm?); but breaches of encrypted data need not be reported. Nor must it be reported if data has been obtained or viewed by unauthorized individuals as long as there is no reason to believe they will use the data in harmful ways. The National Conference of State Legislatures maintains a list of enacted and proposed security breach notification laws. A number of bills that would establish a national standard for data security breach notification have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, but none passed in the 109th Congress. In his 2015 State of the Union speech, President Obama proposed new legislation to create a national data breach standard that would establish a 30-day notification requirement from the discovery of a breach. The European Union implemented a breach notification law in the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (E-Privacy Directive) in 2009, specific to personal data held by telecoms and Internet service providers. This directive has to be implemented by national law until 25 May 2011. Furthermore, the traffic data of the subscribers, who use voice and data via a network company, is saved from the company only for operational reasons. However, the traffic data must be deleted when they aren‚Äôt necessary anymore, in order to avoid the breaches. On the other hand, the traffic data are necessary for the creation and treatment of subscriber billing. The use of these data is available only up to the end of the period that the bill can be repaid based on the law of European Union (Article 6 - paragraphs 1-6 ). Regarding the marketing usage of the traffic data for the sale of additional chargeable services, they can be used from the company only if the subscriber gives his/her consent (but, the consent can be withdrawn at every time). Also, the service provider must inform the subscriber or user of the types of traffic data which are processed and of the duration of that based on the above assumptions. Processing of traffic data, in accordance with the above details, must be restricted to persons acting under the authority of providers of the public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services handling billing or traffic management, customer enquiries, fraud detection, marketing electronic communications services or providing a value added service, and must be restricted to what is necessary for the purposes of such activities.

History Holland, who was a member of Steppenwolf for a short period between 1979 and 1980 and released Get Up with The B'zz in 1982, would recruit Batio (then still a session musician) to form his own band in 1984. Shortly after releasing Little Monsters in 1985, the band split up and members concentrated on other projects. Batio would form Los Angeles, CA based metal band Nitro in 1988 and release a pair of albums on Rhino/Rampage before going solo. Also in 1988, Joey Cetner would team up with vocalist/guitarist Kevin Lee and others as Kevin Lee & The Lonesome City Kings. The group released their MCA debut Restless in 1993 , featuring Holland's Brad Rohrssen on drums. Tom Holland went on to front a number of bands, including Raw Dogs, Tommy Holland & Bad Blood and House of Holland. In 1998 a compilation album, Wake Up the Neighbourhood, was released, which featured songs from the Little Monsters sessions, including five which appeared on the album itself and five other previously unreleased tracks. Shortly after the initial pressing, another track from those sessions, \\"Nobody Else\\" was added as a bonus track. In 2003, Little Monsters was re-issued on CD by Wounded Bird. Holland have reunited sporadically since their initial break-up, including a September 2013 benefit gig for drummer Brad Rohrssen who was diagnosed with oral cancer in 2013. Rohrssen was featured in a 2017 video for Forward Science where he told his story in order to spread awareness about the disease. Popular culture The song \\"Wake Up The Neighbourhood\\" was featured on the official soundtrack for the film Girls Just Want to Have Fun starring Shannen Doherty, Sarah Jessica Parker and Helen Hunt.

Border issues Uttara Kannada district was a part of Bombay Presidency during the British rule. Before reorganization of the States, the district was in Bombay State. The local Konkani-speaking people had close connections with Mumbai then. They had matrimonial relations also with the people in Bombay. Many Marathi-medium schools had also been established in Karwar and Joida taluks. Marathi films were released often in Karwar. The visit of Marathi drama troupes from Mumbai and Pune was an annual feature. However, Konkani-speaking people were disenchanted when Marathis began to claim that Konkani was a dialect of Marathi. They disputed it and asserted that Konkani had independent status as a language. It was the Konkani-speaking people led by late P.S. Kamat who argued before Mahajan Commission that Karwar was an integral part of Karnataka. News and media The Kali News is one of the major local newspapers in the region.

Fusion of these two recursive computations into a single recursive pattern then avoids building the intermediate data structure. This is an example of deforestation, a program optimization strategy. A related type of function is a metamorphism, which is a catamorphism followed by an anamorphism. Formal definition A hylomorphism h : A \\\\rightarrow C can be defined in terms of its separate anamorphic and catamorphic parts. The anamorphic part can be defined in terms of a unary function g : A \\\\rightarrow B \\\\times A defining the list of elements in B by repeated application (\\"unfolding\\"), and a predicate p : A \\\\rightarrow \\\\text{Boolean} providing the terminating condition. The catamorphic part can be defined as a combination of an initial value c \\\\in C for the fold and a binary operator \\\\oplus : B \\\\times C \\\\rightarrow C used to perform the fold. Thus a hylomorphism : h\\\\,a = \\\\begin{cases} c & \\\\mbox{if } p\\\\,a \\\\\\\\\\\\b \\\\oplus h\\\\,a' \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,where \\\\,(b, a') = g\\\\,a & \\\\mbox{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} may be defined (assuming appropriate definitions of p & g). =Notation= An abbreviated notation for the above hylomorphism is h = [\\\\\\\\![(c, \\\\oplus),(g, p)]\\\\\\\\!]. Hylomorphisms in practice =Lists= Lists are common data structures as they naturally reflect linear computational processes. These processes arise in repeated (iterative) function calls. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to generate a temporary list of intermediate results before reducing this list to a single result. One example of a commonly encountered hylomorphism is the canonical factorial function. factorial :: Integer -> Integer factorial n  n  0 = 1  n > 0 = n * factorial (n - 1) In the previous example (written in Haskell, a purely functional programming language) it can be seen that this function, applied to any given valid input, will generate a linear call tree isomorphic to a list. For example, given n = 5 it will produce the following: factorial 5 = 5 * (factorial 4) = 120 factorial 4 = 4 * (factorial 3) = 24 factorial 3 = 3 * (factorial 2) = 6 factorial 2 = 2 * (factorial 1) = 2 factorial 1 = 1 * (factorial 0) = 1 factorial 0 = 1 In this example, the anamorphic part of the process is the generation of the call tree which is isomorphic to the list \`[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\`. The catamorphism, then, is the calculation of the product of the elements of this list. Thus, in the notation given above, the factorial function may be written as \\\\text{factorial} = [\\\\\\\\![(1,\\\\times),(g, p)]\\\\\\\\!] where g\\\\ n = (n, n - 1) and p\\\\ n = (n = 0). =Trees= However, the term 'hylomorphism' does not apply solely to functions acting upon isomorphisms of lists. For example, a hylomorphism may also be defined by generating a non-linear call tree which is then collapsed. An example of such a function is the function to generate the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence. fibonacci :: Integer -> Integer fibonacci n  n  0 = 0  n  1 = 1  n > 1 = fibonacci (n - 2) + fibonacci (n - 1) Call tree for \`fibonacci 4\`. This function, again applied to any valid input, will generate a call tree which is non-linear. In the example on the right, the call tree generated by applying the \`fibonacci\` function to the input \`4\`. This time, the anamorphism is the generation of the call tree isomorphic to the tree with leaf nodes \`0, 1, 1, 0, 1\` and the catamorphism the summation of these leaf nodes.

History  In July 1869, a call was made for interested citizens to gather ‚Äúfor the purpose of collecting and perpetuating the historical reminisces of Berks County.‚Äù Following the first meeting in August, the Historical Society of Berks County was incorporated on December 13, 1869. The first president was the Honorable William M. Hiester. After a period of stagnation, President Albert G. Green revived the Society in 1898. Meetings were held in the Exchange Building located on North 6th Street in Reading, PA. The first female member was Kate E. Hawley, wife of Reading Eagle founder Jesse G. Hawley, a charter member. The Historical Society first started collecting objects in June, 1898. Its first building, purchased in June 1904 from the Reading Gas Company, was located at 519 Court Street. At that time, membership was 150. Less than ten years later, the burgeoning Historical Society needed a larger building, and J. Bennett Nolan led the search for a new structure. The cornerstone for the present building was laid in the summer of 1928, and construction was completed the following year. Designed by architect Charles H. Muhlenberg of Muhlenberg Brothers, to be a fireproof structure to house the collection and archives, it is made of concrete and brick. The present facility was dedicated on October 1, 1929. It is located at 940 Centre Avenue in Reading, PA. Needing more office, display, and storage space, the Historical Society embarked on a fund raising campaign in the 1980s. The new building addition was opened in 1988, providing the library with its own dedicated storage and research space. Again faced with storage concerns, the Historical Society took possession of its first off-site property in 2000. Known as the Hendel House, it is located directly across from Centre Park at 746 Centre Avenue. In 2016, The Historical Society divested of the ornate Victorian structure, which is now in private hands. In 2005, the Historical Society purchased the former M&T; Bank building at 160 Spring Street, directly behind the main building located at 940 Centre Avenue. Formally named The Henry Janssen Library, this premier research facility opened to the public on November 11, 2008 after extensive renovations.

It consists of a platinum cast of an 18th-century human skull encrusted with 8,601 flawless diamonds, including a pear-shaped pink diamond located in the forehead that is known as the Skull Star Diamond. The skull's teeth are original, and were purchased by Hirst in London. The artwork is a memento mori, or reminder of the mortality of the viewer. In 2007, art historian Rudi Fuchs, described the work as \\"out of this world, celestial almost. It proclaims victory over decay. At the same time it represents death as something infinitely more relentless. Compared to the tearful sadness of a vanitas scene, the diamond skull is glory itself.\\" Costing ¬£14 million to produce, the work was placed on its inaugural display at the White Cube gallery in London in an exhibition Beyond Belief, with an asking price of ¬£50 million. This would have been the highest price ever paid for a single work by a living artist. Production The base for the work is a human skull bought in a shop in Islington. It is thought to be that of a 35-year-old European who lived between 1720 and 1810. The work's title was supposedly inspired by Hirst's mother, who once asked, \\"For the love of God, what are you going to do next?\\" Designed and sculpted by Jack du RoseJack du Rose , official website and manufactured by the Piccadilly jewellers Bentley & Skinner, 8,601 flawless pav√©-laid diamonds, weighing in total , over a platinum cast, cover the entirety of the skull. At the centre of the forehead lies a pear-shaped pink diamond, the centrepiece of the work. All diamonds used for the work are said to be ethically sourced. Hirst stated the idea for the work came from an Aztec turquoise skull at the British Museum. However, artist John LeKay, a friend of Hirst's in the early 1990s, said the work is based on a skull covered with crystals which LeKay had made in 1993. LeKay said, \\"When I heard he was doing it, I felt like I was being punched in the gut. When I saw the image online, I felt that a part of me was in the piece. I was a bit shocked.\\" Exhibition On 1 June 2007, For the Love of God went on display in an illuminated glass case in a darkened room on the top floor of the White Cube gallery in St James's, London with heavy security.BBC news report, retrieved 1 June 2007.

Music (UK), retrieved 11 June 2007 During November‚ÄìDecember 2008, Hirst exhibited the diamond skull at the historic Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, amidst public controversy. The skull was exhibited next to an exhibition of paintings from the collection of the museum that were selected and curated by Hirst. According to Wim Pijbes, the museum director, there wasn't controversy amongst the board members. He explained that the exhibition \\"will attract people‚Äîand give a new aspect to the image of the Rijksmuseum as well. It boosts our image. Of course, we do the Old Masters but we are not a 'yesterday institution'. It's for now. And Damien Hirst shows this in a very strong way.\\" A Belgian journalist in response remarked how the installation of the diamond skull at the Rijks was \\"an intentionally quite controversial project\\". For the Love of God was also displayed in the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, Italy, and at Tate Modern, London between 4 April 2012 and 25 June 2012. The work was displayed at Hirst's first solo exhibition in the Middle East, at the Relics Exhibition of Doha, Qatar from 10 October 2013 to 22 January 2014.Relics Exhibition: Diamond Skull Artwork Between 16 September and 15 November 2015 the skull was displayed at Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo, Norway. http://afmuseet.no/en/utstillinger/2015/damien-hirst Sale Damien Hirst, the creator of the work, was part of the consortium which bought it. Hirst said that the work was sold on 30 August 2007, for ¬£50 million, to an anonymous consortium. Christina Ruiz, editor of The Art Newspaper, claims that Hirst had failed to find a buyer and had been trying to offload the skull for ¬£38 million.Owen, Glen and Dunbar, Polly. Daily Mail, 9 September 2007. Immediately after these allegations were made, Hirst claimed he had sold it for the full asking price, in cash, leaving no paper trail. The consortium that bought the piece included Hirst himself.Evening Standard The avant gardener 19 May 2009 In the 6 February 2012 issue of Time Magazine, Hirst elaborated, in his \\"10 Questions\\" interview: \\"In the end I covered my fabrication and a few other costs by selling a third of it to an investment group, who are anonymous.\\" Harry Levy, vice chairman of the London Diamond Bourse and Club, said \\"I would estimate the true worth of the skull as somewhere between ¬£7 million and ¬£10 million.\\" Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs would expect ¬£8.5 million in VAT payments, if Hirst really did receive ¬£50 million. David Lee, editor of The Jackdaw, commented \\"Everyone in the art world knows Hirst hasn't sold the skull. It's clearly just an elaborate ruse to drum up publicity and rewrite the book value of all his other work.\\" Media reporting and reviews The media coverage of the \\"sale\\" of the diamond skull was extensive and led some to question to what extent the announcement of the sale was some kind of media art, especially as the \\"sale\\" continues to be in question. This was further supported by the performative nature of the Sotheby's exhibition and auction of Hirst's artwork the following year. In an article in The Guardian, Germaine Greer said, \\"Damien Hirst is a brand, because the art form of the 21st century is marketing. To develop so strong a brand on so conspicuously threadbare a rationale is hugely creative - revolutionary even.\\" Richard Dorment, art critic of The Daily Telegraph, wrote: \\"If anyone but Hirst had made this curious object, we would be struck by its vulgarity. It looks like the kind of thing Asprey or Harrods might sell to credulous visitors from the oil states with unlimited amounts of money to spend, little taste, and no knowledge of art. I can imagine it gracing the drawing room of some African dictator or Colombian drug baron. But not just anyone made it - Hirst did. Knowing this, we look at it in a different way and realise that in the most brutal, direct way possible, For the Love of God questions something about the morality of art and money.\\" Ralph Rugoff of the Hayward Gallery in London criticised the work as a mere decorative object, saying \\"It's not challenging or fresh. It's a decorative object which is not particularly well done.\\"Hirst's ¬£50m skull? It's no more than a 'decorative object' (The Independent, March 8, 2008) Robert Preece, an art critic of Sculpture magazine, wrote of the Sotheby's sales of Hirst's work: \\"I am not concerned with the details of these sales. What matters to me is that they were announced‚Äîunleashed, picked up, printed, reprinted, accelerated, translated, and multiplied across global media.\\" The performative nature of Hirst's work was later addressed in the exhibition at Tate Modern, \\"Pop Life: Art in a material world,\\" which critic Ben Lewis found very offensive: \\"... the gallery texts have the temerity to claim that the greed- fuelled auction sale was a work of performance art in itself. That‚Äôs just the same as Stockhausen calling 9/11 a work of art.\\" Artistic responses In June and July 2007 Polish artist Peter Fuss presented his work \\"For the laugh of God\\" at the exhibitions in Gda≈Ñsk and London parodying Damien Hirst's For the love of God. The work was a plastic human skull covered in \\"artificial diamonds\\".Peter Fuss, For the laugh of God A photo of the work thrown out with rubbish bags outside the White Cube gallery was a spoof by artist Laura KeebleLaura Keeble \\"Forgotten Something?\\" who created a replica skull with 6522 Swarovski crystals.Rawlings, Ashley. \\"Damien Hirst‚Äôs ¬£50m artwork trashed: London‚Äôs White Cube Gallery gets bored with Hirst‚Äôs diamond skull, chucks it out\\", with photo of the spoof, tokyoartbeat.com, 18 July 2007.

Every Maltese citizen is also a citizen of the European Union and a Commonwealth citizen. The passport, along with the national identity card, allows for free rights of movement and residence in all member states of the European Economic Area, as well as Switzerland. Physical appearance Maltese passports share the common design standards of European Union passports. The cover is burgundy with the coat of arms of Malta emblazoned in the centre. The words \\"UNJONI EWROPEA\\" (English: European Union) and \\"MALTA\\" are inscribed above the coat of arms, with \\"PASSAPORT\\" (English: Passport) and the international biometric passport symbol below. =Passport note= The passport contains a note from the issuing authority addressed to the authorities of all other states, identifying the bearer as a citizen of Malta and requesting that they be allowed to pass and be treated according to international norms. The note inside of a Maltese passport states: Visa requirements 650pxthumbcenterCountries and territories with visa-free or visa-on-arrival entry for holders of Maltese passport Visa requirements for Maltese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Malta. As of January 8th, 2019, Maltese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 182 countries and territories, ranking the Maltese passport 9th in the world according to the Henley Passport Index. Additionally, Arton Capital's Passport Index ranked the Maltese passport 5th in the world in terms of travel freedom, with a visa-free score of 161 (tied with Australian, Icelandic, Malaysian, and New Zealand passports), as of 20 October 2018. Maltese citizens can live and work in any country within the European Economic Area (consisting of the states of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association) as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Investment-based citizenship scheme  Malta began a citizenship by investment scheme in 2014 known as the Individual Investor Programme (IIP) where non-citizens could apply for Maltese citizenship in exchange for a significant contribution to a national development fund and other Maltese investments, contingent on maintaining residence in Malta and passing criminal background checks. Henley & Partners was originally appointed as sole agent to administer the IIP, but the Maltese government later opened the scheme to Maltese firms too. The procedure is overseen by the Citizenship Unit of the government's Identity Malta Agency. The number and background of persons granted Maltese citizenship based on investment is unknown, as the Maltese government does not publish such data. Malta's Data Protection Commissioner confirmed that the publication of the number of passport buyers and their country of origin ‚Äúmay prejudice relations with a number of the countries of origin‚Äù and that revealing the agencies that handled their application ‚Äúcould reasonably be expected to prejudice commercial interests and, ultimately, the competitiveness of approved agents as it would reveal commercially-sensitive information‚Äù. The list of persons who were naturalised Maltese in the year 2015 includes over 900 names (listed by first name) without indication of previous/second citizenships and of reasons for naturalisation. This was criticised as not transparent enough. Most \\"investors\\" are understood to be interested in acquiring Maltese citizenship only as a tool to exploit EU citizenship rights and reside elsewhere in the Union, including the UK. The European Parliament had objected to the programme as a sell-out of EU citizenship. The income from Malta's passport sale amounted to ‚Ç¨163.5 million in 2016. Of this, 70% is deposited in the so-called National Development and Social Fund (NDSF), which was set up in July 2016. The use of the fund by the government is not regulated. = Criticism = The scheme has often come under fire for being a fraudulent scheme where the Maltese Government sells EU citizenship to anyone willing to pay the price, legitimately or illegally, to the detriment of the Maltese people and the European Union as a whole. Many who were granted a Golden Passport were found to be large-scale international criminals with ties to money laundering in multiple countries. The background checks performed on those willing to pay for citizenship have been criticized as being almost non- existent. Although the scheme is leaving money in the Maltese economy, it is doing so at the expense of the average Maltese citizen, as the Golden Passport scheme is partly responsible for the enormous inflation of the Maltese Housing Index since its introduction. This phenomenon occurs because passport applicants are required to purchase or rent a property in Malta in order for the passport to be granted. Many of these properties have been found to left vacant with the owner in many occasions never even stepping foot in Malta. With the contraction of the housing supply playing its part in pushing property prices to record levels, the average Maltese citizen is being priced out. With rents also on the increase the island has started to see the prevalence of homelessness, something which before these last few years was non-existent in Malta.

She was laid down on 12 February 1908 and was commissioned on 5 May 1909. The boat was used in the first successful U-boat trap. The tactic was to use a decoy trawler to tow a submarine. When a U-boat was sighted, the tow line and communication line was slipped and the submarine would attack the U-boat. Operating with the trawler Taranaki, C24 sank in the North Sea off Eyemouth on 23 June 1915.

History The tunnel was built as part of the Midland Railway connecting Bedford and Hitchin, and from there to London between 1853 and 1857. Contrary to popular belief the line lost its passenger services before the cuts of Dr. Beeching, they were withdrawn on 1 January 1962 along with goods services between Hitchin and Shefford. Goods services between Shefford and Bedford succumbed to the Beeching Axe on 28 December 1964. Built of blue engineering bricks, the tunnel is ovoid in shape and runs at a very slight gradient to allow drainage; however, it is perfectly straight. The tunnel has no blast relief ducts, due to its lack of curves and relatively short length, allowing good air passage. Regular niches were cut into the wall to allow maintenance on the permanent way during running hours. Finally, both portals were capped with stone and it covers a total length of 882 yards. The tunnel today The tunnel has lain derelict for over 40 years, but is in fair condition, with the Hitchin end back-filled to within 7 feet of the tunnel roof and the Bedford end bricked up with gratings for local bats. However, public access holes have been closed at both ends. Entrance to the tunnel is not recommended, due to bats and standing water accumulation. The Bedford Portal is still visible in its cutting, but the Hitchin Portal is entirely covered in undergrowth. Nature reserve The land above the tunnel is Old Warden Tunnel nature reserve, which is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire.Wildlife Trust: Old Warden Tunnel The tunnel in fiction The tunnel makes a brief appearance in Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines. This scene was filmed shortly after the tunnel had been closed to traffic, before the rails were lifted. The now-demolished Bedford Power Station can be seen in the far distance.

The Communion of Christ the Redeemer is a Christian denomination that embodies Convergence worship and ministry and Anglican traditions. The church describes itself as Bible-believing, Spirit-filled, and liturgical/sacramental. CCR is in full communion with the Anglican Province of America. The CCR has dioceses throughout the United States, and is assisting in the development of other national churches including in Tanzania and Venezuela. There is also one congregation of the CCR in Mexico. The current President of the College of Bishops is Bishop Richard W. Lipka of Maryland. History The CCR was formed in February 2007 by six bishops who had previously been affiliated with the Charismatic Episcopal Church. These six were soon joined by other bishops and clergy from the U.S. and other countries. In 2008 the communion entered into full communion with the Anglican Province of America, which is a Continuing Anglican jurisdiction. Faith and Worship The magisterium of the CCR includes the sacred scriptures (the New Testament and the Old Testament) as the primary source of faith, doctrine and practice. The church accepts the canon of Scripture defined as received by the ancient undivided Church, including the deuterocanonical books which are utilized for ‚Äúexample of life and instruction of manners,‚Äù but the church does ‚Äúnot apply them to establish any doctrine.‚Äù The church holds to the three ancient creeds: Apostles‚Äô, Nicene, and Athanasian. It also accepts the dogmatic statements of the seven Ecumenical councils, and ‚Äúthe ecumenical consensus of the undivided Church.‚Äù Worship is liturgical in form, with most congregations using various editions of the Book of Common Prayer, while some also use Roman Catholic rites. The church encourages its members to seek and utilize spiritual gifts in their worship and ministry. Organization The CCR has a College of Bishops which meets four times a year. All bishops are equal, and there is no authoritative office beyond that of bishop. The College elects a President, Vice President, and Treasurer who serve for four-year terms. The church upholds the historic three-fold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons and considers that apostolic succession has been received through the line of Carlos Duarte Costa and the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (ICAB). The CCR utilizes Roman Catholic ordination rites for its clergy in order to maintain a strong line of apostolic succession.

They are known throughout the field to be on the cutting edge of polka music. FreezeDried mixes polkas with other music styles such as Latin music, zydeco, gospel music, dixieland music and rock music. Their efforts have been inspiring other traditional polka bands to be more creative in their approach to new material, musical arrangements and showmanship. FreezeDried did not stop at their quest for musical diversity. In 2006, FreezeDried continued to progress in the vocal area by adding a female vocal trio. Affectionately known as \\"The Icicles\\", the singers bring flavors of motown and soul to the FreezeDried sound. FreezeDried members are Ted Okrzesik Jr., John Krawisz, John Okrzesik Sr., Dan Okrzesik Sr., A.J. Okrzesik, and Andrew Okrzesik. The record label of FreezeDried is Chrome Pierogi Recording and is an Indie label. Since 1998, venues such as the Taste of Chicago, Minnesota State Fair, WGN radio, numerous town summer fests, and an array of local clubs have been enjoying the fresh sounds of the FreezeDried experience.

He led the Henry Hart Minstrels, was proclaimed a \\"social necessity\\" in Indianapolis, Indiana, and was the leader of a family musical group that Emma Lou Thornbrough called \\"the best-known group of colored entertainers in the state.\\" Early years (1839-1866) Henry Hart was born on June 8, 1839 in Frankfort, Kentucky. His father, Frederick Hart, was born in Boone County, Kentucky, and his mother, Judith Brown, in Frankfort. Possibly the only archival source of this parental information is Henry Hart's death certificate. One nineteenth-century source of information about Hart's early years is an article in The Pacific Appeal, San Francisco, California, October 25, 1879.

The 1850 US Census for Franklin County, Kentucky, lists Frederick Hart, age 70, mulatto, and Judy Hart, 40, mulatto, and the 1860 US Census, Lorain County, Columbia Township, Elyria Post Office, June 1, 1860, lists Frederick Hart, 80, and Juda Hart, 40. (Perhaps \\"Juda Hart\\" was \\"Judy Hart\\", and there was a mistake regarding her age in the 1860 census, or perhaps Frederick Hart had remarried.) These census records indicate that in 1860 the Hart family lived near Cleveland in Lorain County, and they imply that Henry Hart had moved to the Cleveland area in connection with his father's move. (Henry Hart's name is missing from the 1850 and 1860 censuses.) The 1866 city directory of New Orleans lists Henry Hart as living at 98 Felicity Street. It seems likely that in 1866, the full name of Prescott's Museum was Burnell & Prescott's Museum and Zoological Institute, as advertised in New Orleans newspapers. Henry Hart's wife, Sarah F. Hart, was born September 6, 1849. According to her death certificate, she was born in Indiana to John Smith, birthplace unknown, and Angline Mason, born in Arkansas. (Other records indicate that the correct spelling is Angeline.) Evansville years (1867-1878) During the years that Henry Hart resided in Evansville, his compositions were published.

Sam Lucas, ... , Jake Hamilton the banjoist, Brown and Mills ... were with him. They made one trip through Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky and Indiana, and then disbanded. It was during this season that Henry wrote his best songs, and they were first sung under his own leadership by his own singers. They were greeted with considerable applause and attracted some attention, especially among other minstrel singers ... Soon after the company disbanded, but long before the songs were published, Col. Wagner, Milt. Barlow, and other celebrated end men, had obtained copies from the composer, and sung them with great success throughout this country. \\"'Keahve dat' possum\\" was first sung by Sam Lucas. After he left the company he had it published in Boston by John F. Perry, and claimed it as his own, and it was only after a long epistolary discussion that Henry Hart obtained a public acknowledgement that he was the genuine author. > > \\"Carve dat Possum\\" may have been Hart's best known melody. It is listed at > Wikipedia in the 1875 article under Sam Lucas's name instead of Hart's. The > song has been arranged and performed many times since 1875. It can be > downloaded from American Sheet Music, Library of Congress. The 1870 United States Census for Vanderburgh County, Indiana, shows that four members of the Hart family resided together. Aside from Henry and Sarah, there is Estela (correct spelling: Estella), age 4, born in Louisiana, and Archeline Selten (correct spelling: Angeline Selden), age 43, born in Indiana. The next household listed includes Moses Selden, age 61, born in Kentucky. Other records imply that Angeline was Sarah's mother; the relationship to Moses Selden is uncertain. The 1870-71 Evansville City Directory shows that Henry Hart was a barber, with shop located at 25 Locust Street and residence on Oak Street between 7th and 8th Streets. The latter property matches a deed dated June 25, 1870, for real estate sold to Henry Hart for $1300.00. The card catalogs for Vanderburgh County Grantee Index of Deeds and Grantor Index of Deeds show that during the years 1870 to 1908 there were several property transactions in which individual grantors were Henry, Sarah, and Angeline. In 1870, a daughter named Lillian was born to the Harts, but she did not survive infancy. Lillian was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in a family lot which now includes Henry, Sarah, and several of their daughters, as well as Angeline Selden, who died in New Orleans in 1875. Moses Selden, who died in 1889, was buried elsewhere in the same cemetery. Within nineteenth-century minstrelsy, there were white minstrels who used \\"burnt cork,\\" but there were also African- American minstrels such as Henry Hart. As already noted, in 1874, Hart organized his own minstrel troupe and performed in four states. Here is what a reviewer wrote for The Kokomo Democrat: > Henry Hart's original colored minstrels gave the best entertainment of the > kind last Friday night ever put on the boards in this city. Their > representation of the Southern plantation negro's is without precedent. To > the lovers of \\"burnt cork\\" everywhere we would say, there is nothing of > vulgarity or low slang in the performances of this troupe to give offence to > the most fastidious of refined society. Indianapolis years (1879-1915) It appears that Henry Hart published no further compositions after moving his family to Indianapolis in 1878 or 1879. In the capital city, his musical and social skills led to his rise as a social musician. As his daughters were born, he, and probably also Sarah, taught them to play instruments. In 1901, The Indianapolis News paid tribute to Hart in an article captioned \\"A Social Necessity.\\" About half of the article is quoted here: > Any one in Indiana who has not danced to the fascinating measures of Henry > Hart's violin has missed a treat. It's an open secret that when a dance is > contemplated the first person visited in regard to arranging a date for it > is Henry Hart. If there is an anniversary approaching, \\"Henry,\\" as every one > calls him, must be secured, and if it happens to be in the social season, > say from the middle of September to the middle of February, or just after > Easter, or in June, when the weddings begin to bloom ... > Mr. Hart alone is not all of \\"Henry Hart's music.\\" He has a family of > interesting daughters, and as they grow up to young womanhood, and even when > quite small, they take their part in the orchestra.

An article in The Indianapolis World describes her as \\"the only colored harpist in this country,\\" in connection with her concert in Washington, D.C. at the Metropolitan A. M. E. Church. Perhaps the most insightful account of Myrtle's fine harp is given her father's obituary in The Indianapolis News: > Hart's Orchestra, as it was called, was of stringed instruments and composed > of members of his own family. In 1893, the year of the world's fair at > Chicago, Hart sadly wanted a harp for one of his daughters ...

Hazel Hart Hendricks Henry Hart's daughter Hazel became a teacher in Indianapolis. In 1928 she became principal of school #37, and the 1930-31 Butler University Bulletin shows that she received a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Education. On Sept. 5, 1935, she led a group of twenty-four members of a \\"novelty band\\" from her school in a performance in the central auditorium in Frankfort, Indiana. The band was returning in a bus when an accident occurred. Hazel died the next morning. The Indianapolis Star described the accident and included a tribute by Daniel T. Weir, assistant superintendent of schools: > She was an accomplished musician ... The band ... is unique in that none of > the instruments used are musical instruments. It was organized by her at the > request of a few pupils of the school after they had demonstrated to her > that they could produce good entertainment although the music might not be > of the highest quality. It was the pleasure which it gave the children which > led her to carry on this work. She always went with the band to its > engagements and played the piano accompaniment for it while one of the > youthful members wielded the baton and announced the numbers. Many will > recall the pleasure they had in hearing and seeing this band in its numerous > performances throughout this and neighboring cities ... The school of which Hazel was principal is now the Hazel Hart Hendricks School. References * Chicago Daily News, July 23, 1895, \\"Is A Gifted Harp Player.

It is located 420 km north east of Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, and 27 km east from the town of Inharrime. The capital of the province, the city of Inhambane, is approximately 2 hours drive away towards the North East. The correct Portuguese spelling is Z√°vora, and some maps refer to the area as \\"Ponta de Z√°vora\\", Portuguese for \\"Tip of Zavora\\" or \\"Praia de Z√°vora\\" meaning \\"Beach of Zavora\\". The origin of the name Zavora is not known. There is also a fish called Zavora-pypvis (Afrikaans language), or translated Zavora-pipefish. The biological name is Halicampus zavorensis from the family Syngnathidae. According to one reference it is a fish found in Western Indian Ocean: known only from one specimen from Zavora, Mozambique and two from Sur, Oman. The word Zavora is also used as a surname in some languages and therefore the town's name could have originated from a person. Although the local people can speak Shangaan and Portuguese, the local language is Chopi. English is limited to mostly businesses and lodges. Zavora is mostly known for its beautiful natural reef and one of few remaining lighthouses along this coast. The reef makes it a popular vacation location and attracks many visitors during holidays, especially, South Africa. There remains some old buildings that still exist from after the Portuguese left Mozambique. These are currently used as accommodation by a local lodge. In general the local people are poor and needy. Local uplifting projects do exist by missionaries and international organisations.

K. Breslauer (2 June 1888 ‚Äì 15 April 1965), was an early Austrian film director, also an actor, screenwriter and author.  Life  = Career as actor and screenwriter = Hans Karl Breslauer was born in Vienna, the son of the proprietor of a coffee-house, which it was intended he should take over. Instead he became an actor. His first engagements were in Cologne, Wiesbaden and Vienna. From 1910 Breslauer was active in Berlin as a screenwriter. He produced about 40 filmscripts for the film companies Duskes, Messter, Vitascope, Mutoscope and Biograph.Ludwig Gesek (ed.): Kleines Lexikon des √∂sterreichischen Films. Vienna 1959, Namenslexikon p. 5 From 1914 he is supposed to have had his first directing job with Sascha-Film in Vienna, but this has been called into question because of the lack of evidence about directing in these years.Armin Loacker: Johann Karl Breslauer. In: Guntram Geser (ed.), Armin Loacker (ed.): Die Stadt ohne Juden. Verlag Filmarchiv Austria, Vienna 2000, pp.169‚Äì171 (available online in the programme for Filmhimmel 06 on pp. 12‚Äì14 (PDF) He can be shown however to have had an acting role in the Viennese Regent-Film production Zu sp√§t ges√ºhnt (1916). = Career as film director = Breslauer's first demonstrable directorial involvement was in 1918 in the Sascha-Film production Ihre beste Rolle. After World War I he worked as a director for Leyka-Film and Biehl-Film. In 1919/1920 he was vicepresident of the Film Directors' Club of Austria. From 1921 Breslauer regularly directed for Mondial-Film, under whose roof he set up his own production company, H.K.B.-Film. Its first films were Lieb' mich, und die Welt ist mein (1924) and Strandgut (also 1924), which he shot in 1923 on Corsica and the French Riviera. On some productions, for example Oh, du lieber Augustin (1922), he also claimed responsibility for the screenplay. At the end of 1923 Breslauer began filming Hugo Bettauer's successful novel, Die Stadt ohne Juden (\\"City Without Jews\\"). Today both the book and the film seem like a premonition of what was to happen in Europe from 1933, but at the time were intended as comedy and designed to have a wide popular appeal. Breslauer therefore changed a number of details during filming, as a result of which various allusions to the real world deliberately intended by Bettauer, were lost. A clearly noticeable example of this is the change in the name of the city from Vienna, as it was in the book, to Utopia in the film. The reason for most of the deviations from the original was to reduce the political controversy of the film in order to avoid problems with censorship and alienating public opinion. Nevertheless, in many showings of the film, which was not as successful as the book had been, there were disturbances from National Socialists. The film, which was until 2015 thought lost, or partially lost, has now been restored. It provides insight into the \\"normality\\" of anti- Semitism in the 1920s.Peter W. Marx: Stadt ohne Juden ‚Äî Antisemitismus als Thema im Unterhaltungsfilm der 1920er Jahre. Kurzrezension zu Geser/Loacker ‚ÄûDie Stadt ohne Juden‚Äú, 2002 After Die Stadt ohne Juden no further film work by Breslauer is known. The film newspaper Mein Film reports of his directing on a Sascha-Film production Der fliegende Haupttreffer, but this apparently never came to anything. His departure from the film world may well be explained by the crisis caused across the entire European film industry by the massive expansion of the cheap American film market from Hollywood, which put most European film producers under enormous pressure, including those in Austria, where most film production companies went out of business. In October 1925 Breslauer married the actress Anna (or Anny) Milety, who had taken the female lead in many of his films. = Career as journalist and author = From the 1930s Breslauer was very active as a writer. He was a member of the Reichsschrifttumskammer (\\"Reich Chamber of Authorship\\") and published under the pseudonym \\"Bastian Schneider\\". Between 1934 and 1939 he regularly wrote amusing contributions for the Grenzboten in Bratislava (then Pressburg), from 1936 to 1942 for Das kleine Blatt in Vienna and additionally from 1938 to 1944 for the Kleine Volks-Zeitung, also in Vienna. From 1940, the same year in which he joined the Nazi Party,Bundesarchiv Berlin, dossier \\"Hans Karl Breslauer\\" he contributed light pieces to newspapers across the entire Third Reich, for example the Breslauer Neueste Nachrichten, the Essener Allgemeine Zeitung and the Leipziger Tageszeitung. After the end of World War II Breslauer and his wife moved to Loibichl near Mondsee in Upper Austria, where they rented rooms in a guesthouse. He continued to publish, now writing mostly short fiction under his own name and the pseudonyms \\"Jenny Romberg\\" and \\"James O'Cleaner\\". Success eluded him from now on, and he died impoverished in Salzburg Hospital on 15 April 1965.

Completed in 1933, she participated in the Second World War. During the war, Starfish, part of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla, conducted five uneventful war patrols in the North Sea. On 9 January 1940, during her sixth patrol, she attacked a German minesweeper off Heligoland Bight, but after the attack failed and her diving planes jammed, Starfish was repeatedly attacked with depth charges. Badly damaged, she was forced to surface, and sank after all her crew were rescued by German ships. Design and description The S-class submarines were designed as successors to the L class and were intended to operate in the North and Baltic Seas.Harrison, Chapter 16 The submarines had a length of overall, a beam of and a mean draught of . They displaced on the surface and submerged.Chesneau, p. 49 The S-class submarines had a crew of 38 officers and ratings. They had a diving depth of .McCartney, p. 4 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater.Bagnasco, p. 110 On the surface, the first-batch boats had a range of at and at submerged. The boats were armed with six 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in the bow. They carried six reload torpedoes for a grand total of a dozen torpedoes. They were also armed with a 3-inch (76 mm) deck gun. Construction and career Ordered on 16 March 1931, HMS Starfish was laid down at Chatham Royal Dockyard on 29 September 1931 and was launched on 14 March 1933. She was commissioned later that year, on 27 October 1933. At the onset of World War II, Starfish was a member of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla. From 23‚Äì26 August 1939, the 2nd Submarine Flotilla deployed to the war bases at Dundee and Blyth.Rohwer, p.1 On 24 August 1939, Starfish, under the command of Lt. Thomas Anthony Turner, departed her homeport for it first patrol, southwest of Stavanger, Norway. On the First of September, a rating on board Starfish suffered a severe injury to the head, and her commander decided to return to port. When Britain declared war with Nazi Germany on 3 September, this became her first war patrol although she arrived at Dundee later that day. On the eleventh, she left port for her second combat patrol, in the same area as the first. After an uneventful patrol, Starfish returned to Dundee on 21 September. Starfish departed port on 4 October for her third war patrol, to the northwest of Bergen, Norway. On 17 October, she finished her uneventful third patrol at Rosyth. On 28 October Starfish left Rosyth for a patrol in the North Sea, off Dogger Bank. Again her patrol was uneventful, and Starfish returned to Blyth on 7 November. She left again for her fifth patrol, southwest of Norway, then later to the west of Denmark. On 8 December, Starfish ended her patrol, which had been uneventful, at Blyth. On 6 January 1940, Starfish departed for her sixth and last combat patrol, off Heligoland Bight. On 9 January at 10:40 (UTC), she sighted the German minesweeper M-7 and attacked it in position . However, the attack failed because, due to drill errors, the torpedoes were not fired. Starfish commenced a second attack but her diving planes jammed, and her commander decided to submerge to the deep bottom to conduct repairs. According to Captain Turner in his postwar report, Starfish was located by the German minesweeper, who dropped two depth charges which caused no damage. At 10:50, a crew member asked for permission to restart one of the motors to prevent the gyro from wandering. Permission was granted, but no sooner the motor had been started, four depth charges were dropped directly above the boat, causing widespread damage. At 14:40, another attack was carried out, and twenty depth charges exploded close to the submarine's hull, damaging rivets and causing leaking. By 18:00 Starfish was severely flooded, and her commander, seeing the Germans would not leave, gave the order to surface at 18:20. She was forced to drop her ballast keel, coming up at a 45¬∞ angle due to flooding. All crew were rescued and taken as prisoners of war, and Starfish sank shortly after. In July 1940, a diving mission was sent to locate her wreck and secret documents, but the attempt was unsuccessful.HMS Starfish, uboat.net Notes References    * Category:1933 ships Category:British S-class submarines (1931) Category:Lost submarines of the United Kingdom Category:Maritime incidents in January 1940 Category:World War II shipwrecks in the North Sea Category:World War II submarines of the United Kingdom Category:Submarines sunk by German warships ","title":"HMS Starfish (19S)"},{"id":"11540432","text":"J.

WM reference 25898 The War Memorials Register (WMR), formerly the UK National Inventory of War Memorials, was founded in 1989https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/ph- war-memorials-030709.pdf to build a comprehensive record of every war memorial in the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Based at the Imperial War Museums (IWM) in London, the database has so far recorded over 68,000 war memorials. These records are available in an online database available on the IWM website. It is a volunteer-led project, with a group of volunteers based at the IWM and fieldworkers from around the country working to record and update war memorial information. The key information recorded includes: location, description, category, inscription, names recorded and photographs. War memorials are defined as any tangible object which has been erected or dedicated to commemorate war, conflict, victory or peace; or casualties who served in, were affected by or killed as a result of war, conflict or peacekeeping; or those who died as a result of accident or disease whilst engaged in military service. This includes memorials to civilian casualties and animals. While most memorials commemorate the First and Second World Wars, all conflicts are covered, from the Roman conquest of Britain to current-day actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

They were issued exclusively by the Argentine Federal Police up to 2011. Their primary use is to facilitate international travel. Argentine passports are valid for travel all over the world, but some countries require a visa. For traveling within South America (except the Guyanas), Argentines do not need to use a passport, as they may use their National Identity Document (DNI). On June 15, 2012, the Argentine Interior Ministry announced the immediate introduction of biometric passports. The new passports will have unique numbers (alphanumerical combinations, with 3 letters and 6 numbers), a significant change from the current policy, where passport numbers were the national ID number of the holders (with an N after it).  Bureaucracy  In accordance with Presidential Decree 2015/66, in order to get an Argentine passport, a person must go to the nearest Civil Registry and present his/her National Identity Document, birth certificate and a proof of marital status (unless single). If the person is an Argentine citizen by naturalisation rather than by birth, a Citizenship Certificate (carta de ciudadan√≠a) must also be presented. Citizens under the age of 18 may only get a passport with parental authorization. Argentines living outside the country must follow the same procedure at an Argentine Embassy or Consulate. Regular Passport price is 550 ARS. Applicants usually receive their passports via postal mail within 15 days. There is an express service (48 hours) for 1250 ARS and an ultrafast passport for 3675 ARS (550 ARS + 200 US$),http://www.clarin.com/sociedad/pasaporte-ahora-electronico- cuesta_0_719928149.html= only available at Ministro Pistarini International Airport in Buenos Aires, with the possibility of getting a passport in only 15 minutes, if there are any proofs (as a printed ticket) of an international flight for that same day. Since January 2011, in all cases, Argentine passports are valid for 10 years. Beforehand, they were only given in 5-year- periods. Passports are not issued to persons who are under arrest because of criminal offenses, or to those who appear as 'dangerous' in accordance with the South American Police Agreement of 1920.  Regular passport  In accordance with Mercosur regulations, it is blue-covered, with the legend MERCOSUR written on its top, followed by the country's name in Spanish (REP√öBLICA ARGENTINA), the national coat of arms and the word PASAPORTE (Passport). A biometric passport has the e-passport symbol at the bottom. It has a data page with a machine-readable zone and a digital photograph of the passport holder.

Passport message  Passports of many countries contain a message addressed to authorities of other countries identifying the bearer as a citizen of the issuing country, requesting that he or she be allowed to enter and pass through the other country, and requesting that, when necessary, he or she be given assistance consistent with international norms. In Argentine passports, the message is in Spanish, English, Portuguese and French. The message is: In Spanish: ::En nombre del Gobierno de la Rep√∫blica Argentina, la autoridad que expide el presente pasaporte ruega y solicita a todos aquellos a quienes puede concernir, dejen pasar libremente a su titular y prestarle la asistencia y protecci√≥n necesaria. In English: ::The Government of the Rep√∫blica Argentina hereby requests all whom it may concern, to permit the bearer to pass without delay or hindrance and in case of need, to give all lawful aid and protection.

Other types of passport  The Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issues diplomatic passports (blue- covered) to Argentine diplomats accredited overseas and their eligible dependents, and to citizens who reside in Argentina and travel abroad for diplomatic work. The Ministry also issues official passports (green-covered) to Government employees assigned overseas, either permanently or temporarily, and their eligible dependents, and to members of Congress who travel abroad on official business. Under special circumstances, if a woman is stateless but married to an Argentine citizen, the Federal Police will issue a Pasaporte de Esposa de Argentino (Argentine wife's passport) in order to leave the country. The same applies for persons under the age of 18 who were adopted by Argentine parents.

The medal is made of silver and is accompanied by a prize and a certificate. The original Duddell award was instituted by the Council of The Physical Society in 1923 to the memory of William du Bois Duddell, the inventor of the electromagnetic oscillograph. Between 1961 and 1975 it was awarded in alternate odd-numbered years and thereafter annually. In 2008 the award was renamed in honour of Dennis Gabor, the Hungarian ‚Äì British physicist who developed holography, for which he received the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physics.

In the film, Marion was played by actress Peg Hillias. Marion Saltmarsh was born an unknown seaside community in New Hampshire, and met her future husband, Charles Partridge, fresh from law school, when he visited her father's Baptist church. They married, and eventually moved to the community of Peyton Place, where he became the town's most prominent lawyer. After her marriage, she deserted the Baptists, whom she had been affiliated with since she was a little girl and joined the congregationalists, for she thought that they were the best church in town. As she became part of the Peyton Place Community, she became more interested in possessing things, rather than cherishing what she had. She and Roberta Carter, although the latter didn't live on Chestnut Street, which was the most desirable street in Peyton Place, became best friends. Marion was well known for being extremely judgmental towards people who didn't meet up to her extremely high standards. She had a lot of animosity towards people she didn't necessarily like, most notably Constance MacKenzie and her daughter, Allison. Marion always believed that she was the paragon of morals and virtue, but in reality, she was extremely cruel to those she didn't like; also she was more than a little bit selfish. One of her most frequent enemies was Dr. Matthew Swain, Peyton Place's doctor, who incidentally was one of her husband's closest friends. She had no liking for his way of telling her the truth. When he told her something she didn't want to hear, (That she had menopause, and that she was over forty) she demanded that he would no longer be consulted on by her. Instead, she would rather go to Dr. John Bixby in the nearby town of White River, where she would be told exactly what she wanted to hear. Later on, she would viciously gossip about Selena Cross, who had killed her incestuous stepfather, and she was angered that Charles didn't want to prosecute Selena, because she had killed him in self-defense. (He had raped her and would have done so again, had she not killed him) She was one of the few people in Peyton Place who was so angry that Selena was acquitted and she was instrumental in spreading all the talk about her. To some degree, she was Lucas Cross' only ally, because, characteristically, she selfishly thought of what he had done for her (he had built their kitchen shelves) and not that Selena would have been traumatized again. Her role was expanded in the sequel Return to Peyton Place. She was instrumental in the vicious firing of Michael Rossi from his job as principal of the Peyton Place Schools, due to his unqualified support of Allison for writing her book, \\"Samuel's Castle\\". (The book offended her sensibilities) Although at first, she worked in concert with Roberta Carter to remove Mr. Rossi, Roberta eventually reversed her decision and rehired him to his position; angering Marion in the end; and this ended their friendship. After that, Roberta had been killed by her vicious daughter in-law, Jennifer Burbank Carter, when she pushed her down a flight of stairs, breaking her neck. Obviously, Marion didn't attend her funeral, unless she felt that she had to, as a part of the community. Again, this kept true to her very selfish nature. In the 1957 movie, Marion was a member of the school board, and was known for her pettiness; gossiping, and, like the book, was very selfish. She supposedly saw Allison and her friend Norman Page, swimming in the nude (It had really been Rodney Harrington and Betty Anderson; Allison and Norman were wearing swimming attire) and she had called Constance and Evelyn (Allison and Norman's mothers, respectively) to spread the news.
