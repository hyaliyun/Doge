Early life  Evgeny Chubarov was born in the village of Nizhneye Bobino in Bashkiria on 11 December 1934. Chubarov's father was Armenian, his mother was a Bashkir. He almost didn‚Äôt go to school, working on a collective farm pasturing colts as a teenager. His passion for painting appeared in childhood, partly under the influence of his father. In his youth, Chubarov wanted to have a prestigious profession, so went to his uncle‚Äôs house in Zlatoust to study to become an engraver at a vocational school there. After graduating from the school, Chubarov entered the army and served five years in the Baltic Fleet.  1950s‚Äì60s  In 1959, Chubarov went to Saratov and then to Zagorsk (now Sergiev Posad), where he worked at the restoration studio of the sculptor Dmitry Tsaplin. In 1961, he married Lyudmila Gukovich, a pediatrician who worked in Istra. They lived in rented rooms that they had found by chance. In 1963, his paintings March and Factory Landscape (views of the Zagorsk Optical and Mechanical Plant) appeared at an exhibition of young artists in Moscow. Factory Landscape was published in Iskusstvo magazine just a few months after Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, had criticized artists who were focused on the European avant-garde. During these years, Chubarov conceived a passion for creating wooden sculpture. He got the material he needed thanks to useful contacts with an engineer from a brick factory in Zagorsk. According to his wife's memoirs, the works were life-size portraits that resembled photos of the victims of Auschwitz. The paintings and graphics of the 60s clearly show Chubarov's interest in Eros, both physical and psychological. An example is the 1969 canvas where a woman sits on a man's lap. The man's head is a dark green square with carelessly scribbled eyes and a mouth. The treatment of male characters as geometric shadows can be found in other works of that period. Chubarov understood the male as an impersonal work in progress. It is the basic stage of production of subconscious impulses.  1970s‚Äì80s  In the 1970s and 1980s, Chubarov moved from simple compositions towards a new interpretation of the relationship between painting and the body. He created his famous series of powerful multi-figure ink compositions on paper. Compositionally, his work inherits Christ Carrying the Cross by Bosch (1515‚Äì1516), the expressionism of Boris Grigoriev in his Faces of Russia (1920‚Äì30s) and Pavel Filonov‚Äôs analytical experiments. If Chubarov had previously painted some characters in easily readable relations, in the 70s and 80s, he created situations with maximum tightness and filled the canvas with more and more faces and bodies that were rarely bound by a common storyline. In Fight (1982), Chubarov equates the surface of the canvas to the body and skin, erasing the border between the figurative and the body. Later, that understanding of the surface of the canvas propelled him to the ultimate objectlessness. The motives of Fight would remain throughout the artist‚Äôs period of pure abstraction and would move into many of his drawings. Other paintings of the 1980s are full of references to hidden and demonstrative sexuality‚Äîfrom the image of a gravedigger to characters with chopped-off limbs or signs of rigor mortis on their faces. For several decades, Chubarov had been working on a series of stone sculptures. At the Sculpture Park in Moscow, there is a composition consisting of 283 stone heads. The heads form a separate wall covered with bars; the structure, as well as the meaning of the work‚Äîa monument to victims of Stalinist repression‚Äîdid not originate with the artist. It was created by the park administration, which accepted these sculptures as a gift in the mid-1990s. In 1986, Chubarov was admitted to the Union of Artists.  Years abroad  The Soviet part of Chubarov‚Äôs biography is not so rich in external events, and there is no evidence that the artist tried to become part of the underground. His name did not appear on the list of those artists who tried to exhibit independently. At the invitation of art dealer Gary Tatintsian, he traveled to Berlin and New York City, where his style underwent its last transformation. Chubarov moved from impressionism to pure abstraction and succeeded. He was awarded a Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant and participated in exhibitions on equal footing with the greatest artists of the post-war generation. Chubarov came to abstraction at the moment when it stopped being a political gesture of emancipation from the formal requirements of art. Such a late step beyond the narrative art emphasizes his internal independence from the artistic context he had to work in. Chubarov managed to concentrate on the painstaking creation of non-figurative painting primarily as a thing, an object in different dimensions, from the ornamental to the psychological. Chubarov considered himself an heir of the Russian \\"archaic\\" culture, drawing a parallel between his technique and the ideas of Malevich's Black Square. Working in his unique style, along with the iconic representatives of the Soviet art, such as Ilya Kabakov, Andrey Monastyrsky and Erik Bulatov, Chubarov embodied in his paintings the idea of a new era‚Äôs philosophy, visually identifying energy of the world around him, and transforming abstract symbols into images of reflection displaced in the conceptual art energy.  1990s  Starting in the early 1990s, Chubarov's main task in painting became a transition to abstract painting at several levels, deprived of \\"dark passion\\". On the contrary, compared to the works of his Soviet period, his painting at this time was optimistic . Previous experience in painting anarchic corporality during the 1970s and 1980s allowed Chubarov to abandon self-revealing symbols. The artist refused close contact with the canvas, which is characteristic of abstract expressionism and which transforms into the fixation on a gesture, as in Pollock‚Äôs works, or into speculative space of pure color, as in Rothko‚Äôs paintings. Chubarov created paintings to be seen both closely and from a distance. Chubarov and his wife came back to Moscow at the end of the 90s. They settled in an apartment in Mytishchi, visited by many key figures in nonconformist and official culture, including Ernst Neizvestny and Ilya Kabakov.  Exhibitions  Chubarov's monumental works were exhibited at well-known venues in Europe and the United States, and later in Russia. At group exhibitions, Chubarov's works were exhibited together with the paintings of classic artists of the twentieth century‚ÄîMel Bochner, Frank Stella, Sol LeWitt, Damien Hirst, Peter Halley and Stephan Balkenhol. A series of multi-figure compositions was included in the permanent exhibition at the State Tretyakov Gallery. In 2015, the Gary Tatintsian Gallery held a memorial show devoted to the artist's 80th anniversary.

He was Minister of Agriculture from 1911 to 1913 and Minister of the Interior from 1917 to 1920. In 1913 he was a candidate for the presidency of France. He is known for the \\"H√¥tel Pams\\", a mansion in Perpignan that was redesigned and decorated to his taste, and is now a conference center. Early years Jules Pams was born on 14 August 1852 in Perpignan, Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, to a leading family in that city. His great grandfather came from humble origins and rose to become vice- consul to the Republic of Genoa. His grandfather, a successful businessman of Port-Vendres, became vice-consul to Sardinia. Jules Pams attended the lyc√©e Charlemagne and then the Faculty of Law of Paris. After graduating he became an attorney in Perpignan. In 1889 Pams ran for election to the legislature on the Radical list but was not elected. He became a member of the general council of the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales department in 1892, representing the canton of Argel√®s-sur-Mer. He was a member of the general council for thirty six years, and its president for fifteen years. Madame Jules Pams by Jacques-√âmile Blanche In 1888 Jules Pams married Jeanne Bardou, one of the heiresses of the JOB cigarette paper company founded by Jean Bardou. Her father, Pierre Bardou, son of the founder, had bought several properties on the rue Saint-Sauveur (rue E. Zola) between 1852 and 1872 and built a town house on the site illuminated by a magnificent glass roof. Pams and his wife lived in this house, and after the death of Pierre Bardou in 1892 employed the architect and designer L√©opold Carlier (1839‚Äì1922) to transform it. The renovation in 1894‚Äì97 added gold, marble and onyx throughout, with marquetry furniture and paintings by Paul Gervais. The \\"H√¥tel Pams\\" became the social focus of the wealthy elite of the city. Jeanne died in 1916. Pams married Marguerite Holtzer in 1918. National politics Pams ran again for election as a deputy in 1893 and was elected in the first round. He was reelected in 1898 and 1902. He was elected to the Senate on 25 December 1904, and was reelected in 1909, 1920 and 1927. He was mainly involved in issues related to wine and the marine. Pams was appointed Minister of Agriculture on 2 March 1911 in the cabinet of Ernest Monis, and retained this portfolio in the subsequent cabinets of Joseph Caillaux and Raymond Poincar√©, leaving office on 17 January 1913. Pams was the originator of the appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e of the sweet wines of his region. He arranged the great naval review on 15 September 1911 in Port-Vendres. On 2 March 1913 he inaugurated the new road from Banyuls to Cerb√®re. In 1913 Georges Clemenceau encouraged Pams to stand for election as President of France, but he was beaten in the second round of voting by Poincar√©. Pams was relatively obscure by comparison to the very experienced Poincar√©. As the Socialist Jean Jaur√®s said, \\"In these difficult times, how can the Radicals offer France and the Republic a man who has never revealed, either in opposition of in office, either in debate or in action, any real measure of ability?\\" On 16 November 1917 Pams was appointed Minister of the Interior by Clemenceau. In April 1919 Pams circulated instructions to prefects that interpreted the 1905 law of separation of church and state as meaning crosses were allowed in monuments in cemeteries, but not on monuments on public roads. After retiring from the ministry on 20 January 1920 Pams went into semi-retirement, although in 1927 he was a delegate to the 8th meeting of the League of Nations. Jules Pams died at the age of 77 on 12 May 1930 in Paris after a long illness.

Kompass acted as a whistleblower when he advised French authorities about a report on child sexual abuse carried out by French Peacekeepers in the Central African Republic between December 2013 and July 2014. The French authorities rapidly took action to investigate the allegations in the report. The investigations of fourteen soldiers are still ongoing. However, the OHCHR chief, Prince Zeid bin Ra'ad, found that Anders Kompass had breached the OHCHR rules of conduct by not seeking the approval of his superior prior to passing on the report to the French. Prince Zeid also stated that the report included names and addresses of victims of the abuse, thereby putting them at risk for stigma and retaliation in their home communities. Therefore, he suspended Kompass from his position. However, the suspension was found to be unlawful by the United Nations Dispute Tribunal on 6 May 2015. Prince Zeid then proposed to dismantle the field operations unit of the OHCHR, which effectively would have removed Kompass' position from the organization. Meanwhile, the United States and other member states criticized the UN leadership for seeming to spend more efforts on discrediting Kompass for disclosing the sexual abuses rather than on holding the abusers themselves accountable for their crimes. On 22 June 2015, after much criticism in the media, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed an independent panel to investigate the matter. The UN panel cleared Anders Kompass from any wrongdoing and concluded that he did indeed have the authority to share the information in the report with the French authorities. The panel also found that the concerns of risks to the victims by including their identities in the report had been largely exaggerated. On 8 June 2016, Kompass announced his resignation from the United Nations, citing \\"the complete impunity for those who have been found to have, in various degrees, abused their authority, together with the unwillingness of the hierarchy to express any regrets for the way they acted towards me\\".https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36481372 On 12 October 2017, Kompass was appointed Swedish Ambassador to Guatemala.

It is considered by some to be merely an aspect of postmodernism whilst others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of expressionist architecture. The style is characterised by the use of analogy and metaphor as the primary inspiration and directive for design. Well known examples of this can be found in the Palm Mosque at the King Saud University in Riyadh by Basil Al Bayati, based upon the form of a palm tree, the Lotus Temple in New Delhi, by Fariborz Sahba, based on a lotus flower, the TWA Flight Center building in New York City, by Eero Saarinen, inspired by the form of a bird's wing, or the Sydney Opera House, in Australia, by J√∏rn Utzon that is derived from the sails of ships in the harbour. Certain architects have also been known to utilise metaphors as a theme throughout their work such as Le Corbusier and the open hand motif. This to him was a sign of \\"peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive.\\" Perhaps the most prominent voice of the Metaphoric architectural school at present is Dr. Basil Al Bayati whose designs have been inspired by trees and plants, snails, whales, insects, dervishes and even myth and literature. He is also the founder of the International School of Metaphoric Architecture in M√°laga, Spain.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, Brazil and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, and Australia. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of severe weather, including strong thunderstorms, strong winds, and hail. There were 1,059 tornadoes reported in the United States in 2016, of which 976 were confirmed. Worldwide, 130 fatalities were reported: 99 in China, 18 in the United States, five in Uruguay, four in Brazil and two in Italy and Russia each. 2016 was slightly below-average in terms of tornadic activity, but near-record tornado numbers occurred in February. Synopsis Tornado activity was expected to be low during the first quarter of 2016 due to a major El Ni√±o event that would last into early spring. However, this did not come to fruition, as 2016 had the third most active first two months of the past 10 years, only behind 2008 and 2007. A significant outbreak impacted the southeastern and South Atlantic states on February 23 and 24; 61 confirmed tornadoes occurred, including four which were rated EF3. Seven fatalities occurred as a result of the outbreak. The generally above-average trend continued, to a much lesser degree, throughout the month of March, which saw 84 confirmed tornadoes. April, by contrast, was below average in terms of tornadic activity, with 142 confirmed tornadoes across the United States in the space of the month. On April 15, a large F3 multiple-vortex tornado struck the city of Dolores in Uruguay, demolishing over 400 buildings and causing five fatalities. Beginning in May, however, tornado activity increased, with a significant tornado outbreak affecting the central United States from May 7 through May 10, producing the first EF4 tornado of the year. In the middle of the month, it was relatively quiet; however, from May 22 through May 26, another significant outbreak occurred, which produced multiple strong to violent tornadoes. A tornado family impacted southwestern Kansas near Dodge City in the evening of May 24; five of the tornadoes were rated EF3, though no fatalities occurred. The most significant tornado of the event was a high-end EF4 wedge tornado which tracked through Ottawa and Dickinson Counties in central Kansas. A split-level home to the north of Abilene was swept away; numerous vehicles including a Freightliner truck and a combine harvester were tossed and mangled beyond recognition, and a set of railroad tracks near Chapman were bent horizontally. An additional 11 tornadoes were confirmed on May 26; however, most were weak. June was somewhat below average in terms of tornadic activity; 90 tornadoes were reported over the course of the month, of which 87 were confirmed. In the evening of June 11, an EF3 tornado impacted the city of Baker, Montana, demolishing several homes and a steel-framed barn. In the early afternoon of June 23, an isolated violent tornado impacted the outskirts of Yancheng in the Jiangsu province of China, where numerous homes were leveled, several vehicles were tossed, cell phone towers were destroyed and trees were completely debarked and denuded. The China Meteorological Association assigned the tornado a rating of EF4. July saw near-average tornadic activity throughout the United States, with 104 tornadoes being reported over the course of the month, though no significant outbreaks occurred. Tornadic activity in August was near-average in the United States, with 92 tornadoes having been reported as of August 27. In the evening of August 24, a rare outbreak of tornadoes impacted the states of Indiana and Ohio, along with the Canadian province of Ontario, with significant damage occurring in and around Kokomo, Indiana, Woodburn, Indiana, and Windsor, Ontario.

Rain totals of up to 24 inches were recorded in northern Louisiana, with the highest total near Monroe, Louisiana. =March 15= High-end EF2 damage to a house on the outskirts of East Moline, IL. During the morning of March 15, the Storm Prediction Center introduced an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms for west central Illinois, southeastern Iowa, and northeastern Missouri, with a 10% chance of tornadoes for the same areas. The enhanced risk area was expanded westward in subsequent outlooks. That night, a small tornado outbreak occurred in eastern Iowa and western Illinois. A high-end EF2 tornado tracked near Rapids City, Illinois, injuring 10 people and destroying homes in a semi-rural subdivision near East Moline, while an EF0 touched down near McCausland, Iowa, causing minor tree damage.

On the afternoon of April 26, the Storm Prediction Center issued a PDS tornado watch for most of the state of Oklahoma as well as portions of central Texas. A 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes extended from Nebraska to Texas, and multiple intense tornadoes were expected. However, the wind profile that evening did not support sustained supercell thunderstorms. As a result, only scattered weak tornadoes occurred, though EF1 tornadoes caused minor to moderate damage in parts of Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Weak tornado activity continued the following day in Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Kentucky, including an EF0 and an EF1 that caused minor damage in the western part of Omaha.

However, a strong EF2 tornado caused considerable damage to outbuildings and high-voltage transmission line poles near Catharine, Kansas. On May 9, a significant tornado event unfolded across Oklahoma, as several strong to violent tornadoes touched down and caused severe damage in several parts of the state. A violent EF4 stovepipe tornado (the first EF4 of 2016 and the first violent tornado in the United States since an EF4 in Garland, Texas on December 26) near Katie, Oklahoma killed one person, leveled and swept away multiple homes, and left behind an extensive swath of ground scouring, while a large EF3 wedge tornado from the same parent supercell caused major damage near Sulphur. An EF3 tornado that tracked from near Connerville to Bromide destroyed a house and killed one person. An extremely large EF3 multiple- vortex tornado reached a maximum width of about as it passed near Boswell, snapping and denuding numerous trees, destroying mobile homes, heavily damaging frame homes, and toppling two large metal power line truss towers along its path.

About 15 tornadoes were reported in that day in Rostov, Luhans'k, Stavropol' and Volgograd oblasts. Most of them didn't cause any damage. However, one of them, the strongest, was classified as an F3 that caused damage along a path, injuring five people in the process. =May 15 (Brazil)= Two nighttime F2 tornadoes affected rural areas in the state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil, destroying homes and cars. The tornadoes caused 4 deaths and 21 injuries.http://osoldiario.clicrbs.com.br/sc/noticia/2016/05/cerca-de-95-das- casas-de-ponte-alta-do-norte-no-planalto-serrano-de-santa-catarina-estao-sem- luz-5802410.html\\" =May 22‚Äì26= The EF4 Solomon-Chapman, Kansas tornado shortly after formation. During the week of May 22‚Äì27, a southwards dip in the jet stream occurred in the West near Colorado, with favorable thermodynamics advecting northwards and setting the potential for a tornado outbreak. In the early afternoon of May 22, an Enhanced risk was issued by the Storm Prediction Center for extreme southwestern Kansas, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and northern Texas. Numerous tornadoes touched down along the dryline that evening, with the strongest tornadoes touching down in Texas. This included a large, rain- wrapped EF3 tornado that destroyed homes and vehicles near Big Spring. Another EF3 destroyed oil pump jacks near Garden City, while two EF2 tornadoes in the same general area snapped numerous trees and power poles, damaged additional pump jacks, and destroyed a mobile home. Less widespread tornado activity occurred on May 23, with mainly scattered weak tornadoes occurring across central and southern Plains. However, a large nighttime wedge tornado caused EF3 damage to metal pylon power poles near Turkey, Texas that night. A significant outbreak of strong tornadoes affected Kansas on May 24. A single cyclic supercell produced nearly a dozen highly-visible tornadoes near Dodge City, with several reports of multiple tornadoes on the ground simultaneously. A total of five EF3 tornadoes and three EF2 tornadoes were confirmed in western Kansas that evening, affecting rural areas near Dodge City, Jetmore, Ness City, Lewis, and Kinsley. Scattered weak tornadoes were also observed across other parts of Kansas and other states as well. Less significant activity was expected on May 25, and only a few tornadoes occurred, though this included a half-mile wide EF4 wedge tornado that tracked from near Solomon to east of Chapman, Kansas. This violent tornado obliterated farm homes, debarked trees, bent railroad tracks, and mangled farm machinery and vehicles beyond recognition, though only eight minor injuries occurred along the path. Another significant outbreak of tornadoes occurred was expected to occur across Kansas on May 26, and a Moderate Risk with a 15% hatched risk area for tornadoes was issued by the Storm Prediction Center. Despite this, early initiation of storms combined with an unfavorable wind profile prevented a significant outbreak from occurring. However, a high-end EF1 tornado caused considerable damage in Bryan, Texas, while an EF2 and an EF1 occurred simultaneously near Navasota, resulting in heavy damage. Despite producing numerous strong to violent tornadoes, this outbreak sequence only affected rural areas, resulting in no fatalities and few injuries. 98 tornadoes were confirmed as a result of the outbreak sequence. June 92 tornadoes were reported in the United States in June, of which 87 have been confirmed. =June 11= On the evening of June 11, an isolated EF3 tornado struck the town of Baker, Montana, destroying six homes and damaging at least 50 more.

In Ohio, a long-tracked EF1 tornado touched down in Waynesville before lifting in Wilmington, damaging trees, homes, outbuildings, and a convenience store along its path. Overall this outbreak produced 23 tornadoes and no deaths. =June 23 (China)= A violent EF4 wedge tornado produced catastrophic damage as it impacted the outskirts of Yancheng in Jiangsu Province, China on the afternoon of June 23. Thousands of masonry construction homes were destroyed, many of which were leveled. Trees were debarked, vehicles were tossed and destroyed, and metal power line pylons and truss towers were bent to the ground. Schools and manufacturing plants sustained major damage as well. 99 people were killed and 846 others were injured, many of them critically. The tornado traveled approximately from Banhuzhen to Wutanzhen, with a maximum width of about making it one of the widest tornadoes on record. July 104 tornadoes were reported in the United States in July, however, 108 have been confirmed. =July 7= Five tornadoes touched down across parts of Kansas and Missouri on the evening of July 7, two of which were strong and caused significant damage in Greenwood County, Kansas. The first was a large and slow-moving EF3 wedge tornado that swept away a poorly anchored house, obliterated corn crop, and snapped and denuded numerous trees near the Otis Creek Reservoir.

The tornado was spotted in the Port Area at around 4:30 PM and it was seen traveling towards the districts of Intramuros and Sampaloc, and then to Galas and New Manila in Quezon City. It toppled trees, electrical posts and destroyed property along its way. Among those hit and damaged was the National Press Club building in Intramuros. Parts of the glass staircase of the NPC was destroyed and as well as some of makeshift eateries in front. Several houses were reported damaged and a number of residents were injured in the Baseco compound in Tondo and at least 1,000 residents were evacuated from the tornado. The area is adjacent to the Port Area where the twister was believed to have formed. The twister also shattered the glass door of a 24-hour convenience store and toppled some trees on G. Tuazon Street. = August 20 = On August 20, 2016, a storm system produced multiple weak tornadoes across portions of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Two EF0 tornadoes, part of a very weak tornado family of 6, caused damage and extensive power outages in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area. Most damage occurred to trees and utility poles, but some damage to homes and structures happened mostly due to trees falling on them or weak construction. No fatalities or injuries resulted from this event. = August 24 = Farm machinery mangled beyond recognition by a high-end EF3 tornado near Woodburn, Indiana. An unusual late-season outbreak of 24 tornadoes impacted Indiana, Ohio, and Ontario on the afternoon and evening of August 24, some of which were strong and damaging. This outbreak was largely unexpected, as the Storm Prediction Center only issued a slight risk that day, with the tornado threat limited to a 2% threat area across parts of Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois. Despite this, numerous tornadoes touched down further to the east across parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes. The first tornado of the event was an EF2 that caused damage to 30 homes and several outbuildings near Linnsburg, Indiana. Later that day, an EF3 tornado struck the southern part of Kokomo, Indiana, damaging or destroying 1,000 homes, several apartment buildings, and a Starbucks, as well as downing many trees and power lines. A high-end EF3 tornado near Woodburn, Indiana swept away a poorly anchored house, obliterated well-built barns, scoured farm fields, debarked trees, and mangled several vehicles and pieces of farm machinery. A car was carried at least 585 yards into a field by this tornado, and a combine was thrown 200 yards. As the tornado activity pushed into Ohio later that evening, significant tornadoes continued to touch down as a large, multiple-vortex EF2 tornado caused major damage to farmsteads near Cecil, Ohio, while another strong EF2 tornado caused severe damage to homes, barns, and a business near Defiance. Further to the north, a high-end EF2 tornado ripped through parts of Windsor, Ontario, severely damaging several factories and industrial buildings along the E.C. Row Expressway, one of which was completely leveled. Multiple vehicles were severely damaged, including several large cube vans that were dragged through a parking lot. Garbage dumpsters were thrown up to 120 yards away, power poles were snapped, and large amounts of sheet metal was wrapped around guard rails and power lines. Trees were downed and homes sustained structural damage in residential areas as well. Another tornado developed over the Detroit River before moving ashore and striking Lasalle, Ontario at EF1 strength, causing roof, window, and siding damage to homes as well as downing many trees and damaging several boats. The outbreak produced numerous other weak tornadoes across the region before coming to an end. No fatalities occurred as a result of the outbreak. = August 27‚Äì28 = Scattered tornadoes occurred across the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, and Michigan during a two-day period. Most of these tornadoes remained over open country, though a few caused damage. On August 27, a large EF1 tornado tossed small trailers, destroyed a small barn, and snapped and uprooted many trees near Emerado, North Dakota. An EF3 tornado near Hillsboro ripped the roof and exterior walls from a well-built house, severely damaged a grain elevator, and destroyed half of a metal building. The following night, a multiple-vortex EF2 tornado snapped numerous trees and power poles, completely destroyed a barn, and caused considerable roof and wall damage to two homes near Gary, Minnesota. Eight tornadoes were confirmed in total.  September  36 tornadoes were reported in the United States in September; however, 40 have been confirmed. = September 28 (Australia) = A severe thunderstorm event, which struck parts of the Australian state of South Australia, including the capital Adelaide, generated seven confirmed tornadoes with three rated as strong as F2, in what was the largest tornado outbreak ever recorded in the state. An F2 filmed near Wilmington was powerful enough to bend large electricity towers in half, contributing to a total statewide power outage, as well as destroying several farm sheds and outbuildings. Three other damaging tornadoes were officially analysed by the Bureau of Meteorology in the Mid North region, with houses un-roofed, grain silos destroyed and large areas of trees uprooted. The storm outbreak also resulted in tennis-ball sized hail, damaging straight line winds and intense rainfall.  October  23 tornadoes were reported in the United States in October, of which 21 have been confirmed. = October 6 = On October 6, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for severe thunderstorms in the Kansas area, including the risk of tornadoes. Several tornadoes touched down, including two unseasonably strong tornadoes to the east of Salina. The first of these two tornadoes was an EF2 that snapped trees and completely destroyed a barn. The second was a large EF3 stovepipe tornado that obliterated a double-wide manufactured home, tossed farm equipment, snapped and denuded trees, and rolled a Jeep 200 yards. Further to the east, tornadoes also touched down in Illinois and Iowa. This included an EF1 tornado that tracked from Davenport to Cordova, damaging trees, vehicles, and homes along its path. A homeless shelter in downtown Davenport sustained damage from this tornado. A total of 11 tornadoes were confirmed. = October 14 = On October 14, an extratropical cyclone moved through the Pacific Northwest, causing a rare strong tornado in Oregon. The tornado began as a large waterspout before moving ashore. The tornado was assigned an EF2 rating in the town of Manzanita, where the tornado left behind torn off roofs, damaged homes, and destroyed businesses. Many trees and power lines were downed as well. A total of 129 homes and two businesses were impacted. No severe injuries were reported. November There were 69 tornadoes reported in the United States in November, of which 50 have been confirmed. =November 5 (Italy)= Along the west coast of central Italy, a strong F2 tornado developed over the ocean and moved inland as it struck the town of Ladispoli, to the northwest of Rome. Numerous vehicles were damaged, road signs were destroyed, and large trees were uprooted in town. Boats were damaged near the waterfront, and a crane collapsed. Multiple six to nine-story residential buildings sustained severe damage to balconies, windows, and walls, including one that sustained total collapse of a large portion of one of its exterior walls. One person was killed by falling masonry in this area. The tornado continued to the northeast and damaged a railway station before reaching rural areas near Ceri. Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted, while several cottages, restaurants, villas and farms sustained damage. Some of these structures sustained major damage to roofs and walls, and vineyards in the area suffered heavy damage. The tornado continued into the Ponton dell'Elce area, causing significant roof damage to homes and to a church. The tornado then struck Cesano, where structures sustained total roof and wall loss, vehicles were flipped, trees and signs were downed, and structures that remained standing were bombarded by projectiles. Another fatality occurred in this area as a man was killed in his vehicle by a falling tree. Numerous large trees were snapped and uprooted at Veio Regional Park before the tornado passed near Morlupo. Light poles, signs, and trees were downed in this area, roofs were blown off, and a van was rolled before the tornado dissipated. Two people were killed and many others were injured. Surveyors noted that while officially rated F2, some of the damage could potentially be considered F3. =November 27‚Äì30= EF3 damage to a post office building in Ocoee, TN. On November 27, a storm system produced two EF0s and an EF1 in South Central Nebraska, causing minor damage. On November 28, the SPC issued an Enhanced risk of severe weather for Louisiana and Mississippi. Only one tornado touched down in the threat area, a brief EF0 that remained over a rice field near Marksville, Louisiana. However, the surface low associated with system produced a few EF0 tornadoes in Iowa. Minor damage occurred in the towns of Radcliffe and Parkersburg, the latter of which was devastated by an EF5 tornado in May 2008. The next day, the SPC issued a Moderate risk for central Mississippi and portions of Louisiana, Alabama, and Tennessee. This included a large 10% hatched risk area for tornadoes, and a smaller 15% hatched risk area for tornadoes across northern Mississippi. Throughout the late afternoon and evening, multiple supercell thunderstorms developed. Hail and winds battered Mississippi, and several EF1 tornadoes caused minor to moderate damage in rural areas of the state. After sunset, the event rapidly escalated into a significant outbreak as the intensifying supercell thunderstorms pushed into Alabama, and significant tornadoes began touching down. An EF2 tornado near Belgreen snapped many trees and injured one person when a house was damaged and shifted on its foundation. Two EF2 tornadoes moved through Winston County and heavily damaged or destroyed multiple homes, mobile homes, and outbuildings, and also snapped numerous trees and power poles near Arley and Double Springs. An EF2 tornado touched down over Monte Sano Mountain in eastern Huntsville, snapping and uprooting many trees, and damaging numerous homes as it passed through several subdivisions, a few of which had roofs torn off. A horse riding arena was also destroyed by the Huntsville area tornado. An EF3 tornado passed near the towns of Danville and Neel, causing major structural damage to industrial buildings, homes and a fire station. A motorcycle shop was leveled, vehicles were tossed, and several mobile homes were completely destroyed as well. At around midnight and into the very early morning hours of November 30, the storms moved into northeastern Alabama and southern Tennessee. A powerful EF3 tornado ripped directly through the town of Rosalie and to the north of Ider, killing four people and injuring nine others. The Rosalie/Ider tornado destroyed homes and mobile homes, churches, and businesses along its path. A shopping plaza in Rosalie was leveled by the tornado, and a daycare center near Ider was reduced to a bare slab. Further to the north, strong tornadoes were impacting communities in Tennessee, including an EF3 that severely damaged the town of Ocoee. The Ocoee post office and fire station were destroyed, two people were killed in town, a cell phone tower and a metal truss tower were knocked down, and 20 people were injured. A high-end EF2 tornado struck Athens, destroying several businesses and manufactured homes, heavily damaging a large church complex, and injuring 20 people. A few homes sustained major structural damage and a double-wide mobile home was completely destroyed by another high-end EF2 tornado that passed near Whitwell and Dunlap. After sunrise, additional weaker tornadoes touched down in Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. This included several brief tornadoes that caused minor to moderate damage in and around Atlanta. A high-end EF1 downed many trees and damaged numerous homes in Simpsonville, South Carolina as well. Overall, the outbreak produced 48 tornadoes, killed six people, and injured many more. December 14 tornadoes reported in the United States in December, however, 19 have been confirmed. =December 25= A small tornado event affected Kansas and Nebraska on Christmas Day. In Kansas, EF0 tornadoes occurred near the towns of Kismet, Ensign, Bucklin, Greensburg, and Alton. These tornadoes caused minor damage to homes, trees, grain bins, and outbuildings. In Nebraska, an EF1 tornado near the town of Funk snapped power poles, and damaged irrigation pivots and trees. No injuries or fatalities occurred as a result of these tornadoes.

It is designed and painted by art collective the toyists. The Dot is a former gas container of which only two still exist in Europe. The toyists painted this monumental industrial object and linked it with the theme of Live with energy. History Toyist Dejo (founder of Toyism) came up with the idea of painting the gas globe in Emmen in 1997. After the first meetings in 2005 with the owner of the gas container, energy company Essent (later called Enexis), it would still take until 2008 before the project could finally be put in motion. This was partly due to the establishment of the foundation Living Industry, which deals with the reuse of industrial properties and the redevelopment of industrial sites. After the municipality of Emmen agreed with the project, a scaffolding of eight stories was built around the 22 meter high gas container. On the 27th of July the artist started the project of painting The Dot.Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 116. Former gas container Transformation The transformation of the former (blue) gas container took several months to complete, from mid July 2009 until the unveiling on June 4 in 2010, with a winter break of two months. The project had 17 toyists from 7 different countries working for 6000 hours, they painted an area of 1250 m2 in multiple layers.Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 61. Theme The theme of this art work is live with energy. Figurative imagery in the painting tells the story of the history of energy production. There are four sub designs based on the four elements of life: earth (raw energy), water (hydroelectric power), fire (solar energy) and air (wind power). Each sub- design presents the combination or contrast of old and new forms of energy production and their applications (the sciences). In addition to these four fundamental themes, there is a single, central figure: the tree. The tree is a metaphor for life, energy, growth, development, and change. The province of Drenthe with its rich history of peat production is also represented in the painting. In addition, in the form of standalone motifs, general applications or containers of energy such as ecobunny lights and battery-insects can be seen moving throughout the whole painting.Beek, W. van der (2012), Toyism behind the mask. Zwolle: Publisher Uitgeverij De Kunst, pp. 108. Design of The Dot Restoration In the summer of 2015 The Dot was repainted. Over the years the paint had peeled off and The Dot needed to be restored to its former state. The toyists set up a crowdfunding project and, when enough money was collected, started the restoration. In 2013 the toyists did a similar project in Keflavik, Iceland called Uppspretta.

Considered one of the best special forces in the world, is also one of the best Takavar units in the Iranian Armed Forces, with decades of military and combat experience both at home and specially in overseas operations in neighbouring countries. It is one of the most exclusive units in IRGC, having at least 6000 members, all of them volunteers and handpicked from the best and most capable units in the IRGC Ground, Air and Sea forces. Together with the Qods Force operatives and the Sepah Navy Special Force marines, they are considered la cr√®me de la cr√®me of the IRGC, its top tier units and the best soldiers within the Corps.  Origin  ‚ÄúSaberin‚Äù means the patient ones. According to commanders, the unit‚Äôs name is inspiredby the Quranic verse Al-Anfal 8:65, which states: ‚Äú0 Prophet! Inspire the believers to conquer all fear of death when fighting, [so that,] if there be twenty of you who are patient in adversity, they might overcome two hundred; and [that,] if there be one hundred of you, they might overcome one thousand‚Ä¶‚Äù After the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), the IRGC Ground Forces saw the need to establish a special forces unit capable of undertaking difficult combat operations from land, sea, and air. This would be a different function than the Qods Force, the external operations unit. In the year 2000, the then IRGC commander, General Mohammad Ali Jafari funded the Saberin unit. The current Saberin commander is Brigadier General Sadegh Mahmoudi. According to Brigadier General Morteza Mirian, the commander of Saberin operations against PJAK in 2012 and deputy commander of IRGC Ground Forces Operations Directorate, the unit emulates from tactics deployed by 11 special forces units, particularly the British Special Air Service. They also studied the U.S. and Israeli special forces. As with any IRGC unit, the Saberin Brigade is a strong ideological military force. Thus, the unit places two essential requirements among its fighters to possess: First, faith , extreme loyalty and ideological commitment to the Islamic Republic, and second, a rigorous technical knowledge and combat skills on the battlefield. The Saberin is known for its special emphasis on sniper training, producing some of the best snipers in the Iranian Armed Forces.  Description  Despite being one of the newest units in the IRGC, having been created in the 2000, its one of the most battle-hardened troops of the IRGC, with hundred of operations inside and outside Iran againts terrorist and subversive elements . Recently, it has been specially active in conflicts around the region, such as Syria and Iraq. As a result, the unit, has transformed itself, toghether with the Quds Force, in an essential part of the Iranian expeditionary forces and in the symbol of its power projection in the region. IRGCGF Saberin units are highly trained in specialized capabilities, such as raiding, hostage rescue, heliborne assault, counter- terrorism operations and special reconnaissance. Some Saberin personnel use ultralight aircraft and are capable of conducting operations in a wide range of terrain and environmental conditions, including mountains, deserts, and swamps. Saberin personnel have also deployed to Syria to support Iranian combat operations. The Department of Defense's 2010 Military Power of Iran report:http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/IranReportUnclassified.pdf ‚ÄúEach Provincial Corps in the IRGCGRF possesses a unit, called Saberin, which has special operations capabilities. These units rotate to the northwest to perform counter-insurgency against Kurdish PJAK and to the southeast to operate against Jundallah, and recently have been directly involved in other conflicts of the region, such as Syria.‚Äù The Unit, has a close relationship with other special forces of the Iranian Armed Forces, specially with the 65th NOHED Brigade, having received training from them regularly since its foundation.

History The hotel was built 1897 by German army officer Roberto Bahlcke. Its main shareholders were Ernesto Tornquist, Juan Kurth, Roberto Bahlcke and Mar√≠a Herbert de Kraeutner. Over the years, the results were not as expected, and in 1905 the shareholders unanimously decided the dissolution and liquidation of the company. It subsequently passed into the hands of Walter and Ida Eichorn, Germans with strong ties to the German expatriate community in Argentina and supporters of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. The Argentine government seized the hotel following the nation's March 1945 declaration of war against Germany. The government cited the hotel as representing enemy property. Successive efforts to operate and revitalize the hotel continued through the 1960s, at which point the property finally ceased to house guests. In subsequent years the vacant property was repeatedly vandalized. The hotel closed in 1965 and never again received guests. Plans to turn it into a casino eventually collided with the historical and architectural importance of the building, and it was declared Historical Monument in 1988. In recent years the hotel has been partially restored and reopened by the local municipal authority as a tourist destination. =Notable guests= Notable guests that frequented the hotel include families of the Argentine aristocracy such as the Martinez de Hoz, Tornquist, Bianchi, Roca, Bunge, Anchorena, Blaquier, and Peralta Ramos. Other famous guests include: * Nicaraguan poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o * scientist Albert Einstein * Berta Singerman * Hugo del Carril * Arturo Toscanini Italian conductor  In popular culture  A conspiracy theory, propagated by the History Channel in its series Hunting Hitler, is that Adolf Hitler visited La Falda and stayed at the home of the owners of the Eden Hotel for a short time during his travels throughout South America after World War Two.

The character made his first screen appearance on 21 October 2013. Snow won the role after auditioning in early 2013. Originally contracted for a three-month guest role, producers signed him permanently. Matt's backstory detailed him leading a tough life growing up in the Mangrove River area. He arrives to study at Summer Bay High following the school burning down. Matt is characterised as a troublemaker who lacks self-belief because of his upbringing. No one had ever given him the attention he needed to better his life. He also has a keen interest in music which is explored during his tenure. Initially bullying other characters, writers paired him romantically with Sasha Bezmel (Demi Harman) and provided a home for the character with Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou). Alongside these characters Matt is depicted on a journey trying to turn his life around. His relationship with Sasha was developed with many problems. His father Gray Page (Craig Ball) was written into the series only for him to use and manipulate Matt. Snow has singled out the storyline for developing Matt into a more \\"three-dimensional\\" character. Sasha and Matt briefly became estranged while Gray was in the series, but the duo later reconciled. They continued try to make their relationship successful, but when Harman quit the series writers were tasked with separating them. Following her departure, Matt's dark-side was revisited which culminated in an ATM robbery, arrest and a storyline focused on alcoholism. Producers then lined up a controversial relationship story for the character. Matt has sex with Charlotte King (Erika Heynatz), who turns out to be his new biology teacher. The two decide to carry on their affair regardless. Snow has said the storyline helped his character finally mature. Matt's behaviour has drawn attention from various television critics. A writer from the South Wales Echo branded him a \\"troubled soul\\" and a Sunday Mail reporter suggested that Matt was incapable of making a sensible decision. The character made his final appearance on 21 March 2017, following Snow's decision to leave the show. Casting Snow attended an audition for the character in early 2013 and won the part. He told Nick Houghton from The Toowoomba Chronicle that he was nervous ahead of the audition and did not expect to win the role. However, he received a call back the next day and won the part. He then went to Sydney to shoot his scenes. Snow was initially contracted for a three-month stint. Of his casting, Snow said \\"It is an absolute privilege to be on Home and Away. It truly is an iconic show and I am very proud to be a part of it.\\" Snow later signed a contract to stay with the show for three-years. Snow called his character a \\"troubled kid\\", who does not where he fits in. The actor added \\"He is a bit confused about life and definitely ruffles people's feathers in the Bay.\\" The character debuted on- screen during the episode airing on 21 October 2013. Development =Characterisation and introduction= Having grown up in Mangrove River he has been conditioned to wide his vulnerable side because it is viewed as weak by other residents. He has developed a \\"screw you\\" mentality which makes him appear as a troublemaker. He is an intelligent character but has no time for school work and lacks self-belief that he can succeed. The show's official website reveals that in the character's backstory those around him never gave him the attention to try and better his life. They added that even if they did Matt would have rebelled because he is suspicious of those that claim to care about him. Matt had been hurt and disappointed by those closest to him and he learned to be defensive letting people get close to him. They concluded that \\"he operates very much on the philosophy that it‚Äôs better to never try, than run the risk of trying and failing.\\" Snow described Matt as a \\"troubled kid from the wrong side\\" and he is unsure of where he fits into Summer Bay. He added \\"He is a bit confused about life and definitely ruffles people‚Äôs feathers in the Bay\\". Matt is introduced into the series as a former pupil of Mangrove River High who comes to Summer Bay to study after his previous school burned down. Upon his arrival be misbehaves and expresses his dislike of his new classmates and teachers. Matt's other old classmates join in causing trouble at Summer Bay High and they argue about having to wear school uniform. He takes a dislike to Sasha Bezmel (Demi Harman) and begins to bully her. Harman told a TV Week reporter that \\"Matt is very mean to Sasha. To put it plainly, he is just a jerk and annoys everyone.\\" =Music= Snow was a member of a band and he revealed that Matt also has a musical background which would be introduced on-screen. The storyline began when Matt was reluctant to perform in public and his friends become concerned. A reporter from TV Soap noted \\"music may be Matt's passion but he's still steadfastly refusing everyone's efforts to embrace his dreams.\\" Kyle Braxton (Nic Westaway) tries to get Matt to perform at the Summer Bay High formal in the place of his girlfriend Phoebe Nicholson (Isabella Giovinazzo). Matt refuses Kyle's offer and Phoebe incorrectly assumes that Matt has performance anxiety. Her advice is not well received and Matt insists that he is not nervous about performing. Phoebe impulsively hosts a concert and invites Matt on stage to perform but he angrily exits the venue. When Sasha finds Matt he confesses that he cannot perform because his drive for a music career caused an incident which endangered the lives of his relatives. Matt also played a role in a high- profile cameo appearance from singer Ed Sheeran. When Matt sees the singer he convinces him to perform at Angelo's restaurant. Snow branded filming the scenes as an \\"awesome experience\\". =Relationship with Sasha Bezmel= \\"Sasha and Matt are in love. They're supposed to be together, but life is really tearing them apart, which is really sad.\\" ‚Äî Demi Harman (pictured) speaking on Matt and Sasha's doomed relationship. The show devised a relationship storyline for Matt with Sasha. The two characters were described in Australian magazine Woman's Day as \\"polar opposites from one another\\". The duo spend time together working on the school election campaign. Sasha was in a relationship with Spencer Harrington (Andrew J Morley) but he is preoccupied with family problems. Sasha helps Matt to write an election speech and he kisses her. Morley told Rebecca Lake of TV Week that \\"the kiss comes as a shock to Sasha but she doesn't push him away. Spencer's not at the forefront of her mind in that moment.\\" The storyline also began a feud between Matt and Spencer, Morley added \\"he presses Spencer's buttons and tells him about the kiss.\\" Matt's bragging causes Spencer to punch him and break-up with Sasha. They begin dating but Matt begins to feel insecure because he believes that he is not good enough for Sasha. He boasts about the intimate moments he shares with Sasha. When she discovers his betrayal Sasha is left hurt. Matt realises he may lose her and declares his love for her in the hope she will continue their relationship. Snow told Stephen Downie of TV Week that he and Harman \\"worked hard to develop their character's relationship. He believed that Sasha's influence throughout their relationship has helped Matt to mature. He's gone from being a bully from Mangrove River to being a bit more grown up, which is nice.\\" Snow added that Sasha tells Matt when he is being stupid which makes them get along better. Writers devised relationship problems between the two when they introduce Matt's father, Gray Page (Craig Ball). Gray is released from rehab and locates Matt and punches him in the face. He blames Matt for the breakdown of his family while he was away. Matt takes pity on his father and hires a caravan for him to stay in and buys him food. Sasha becomes concerned that Gray is manipulating Matt. Despite needing to study, Gray manages to lure Matt away to spend time with him. This prompts Sasha to voice her concerns but Matt accuses her of ruining his family. The argument causes the pair to become distant for a while as Gray continues to manipulate Matt. Snow labelled the introduction of his character's father as his favourite storyline of 2014. He explained that his involvement with Gray made Matt a more \\"three-dimensional\\" character. He added \\"you got to see where he's from. It gave an insight into what Matt's like.\\" When their relationship recovers, it faces yet more problems. Matt goes for a late-night swim with Evelyn MacGuire (Philippa Northeast) which angers Sasha. A show publicist told Susan Hill of the Daily Star that Matt thinks Sasha is overreacting because the swim was innocent. They added \\"all they did was go for a swim. But Sasha thinks it was completely inappropriate.\\" Harman decided to leave the series to pursue other projects. The show devised an exit storyline for Sasha which meant that her relationship with Matt would come to an end. It begins when Sasha takes Matt away to the city but decides to check out universities. Snow told Downie (TV Week) that Matt does not want to know because he fears it will end their relationship. But fearing that Sasha will leave him anyway, he dumps her. Snow explained that \\"it's not like he's fallen out of love with her, but breaking up with Sasha is almost a self-sacrificing thing.\\" As an Inside Soap columnist noted, \\"the strain of their long-distance love takes a heavy toll\\". Matt is then banned from Sasha's dorm room and she considers moving to a university closer to Summer Bay. Worried that she is about to ruin her career and future plans Matt decides to end their relationship. The pair agree to try to give their relationship another chance. But the distance begins to prove difficult, Harman stated that \\"It‚Äôs stressful on both of them. They can both see things are not as easy as they once were.\\" Sasha and Matt decide to accept their relationship is over and she leaves to live at university. Off-screen Snow and Harman began a relationship together too and Harman told Colin Vickery of News.com.au that it was a case of life imitating art. Their relationship made it feel as though it was real and not acting when filming the character's goodbye scenes. Harman hoped that viewers could see the realism when watching the scenes. She added that leaving the show and moving to Melbourne away from Snow, just like Sasha did from Matt, which led to the characters separating had worried her in respect of her own romance. Harman believed that not many actors in the industry had been in their scenario. One which she defined as lovers acting out the break-down of a relationship but in reality remaining together. Snow described the final break-up scenes as \\"a real tear-jerker\\". =Drinking and robbery= Producer Lucy Addario revealed that the break-up proved a testing time for Matt and hinted he would return to his old ways. In the weeks that followed Matt's behaviour becomes increasingly self-destructive and he turns to crime. The development begins when Matt begins to drink heavy. He tries kisses Evie who does not welcome his advances. Her boyfriend Josh Barrett (Jackson Gallagher) attacks Matt when he learns the truth. Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) becomes concerned that Matt is drinking too much and has a problem. She had previously taken him into her home and helped him through his troubles. She finds Matt collapsed on the floor as a result of too much alcohol. She manages to save him but blames herself for not supporting him while she was in a coma. Matt is involved in a robbery at an ATM in Mangrove River while he is out drinking alcohol. Police officer Katarina Chapman (Pia Miller) examines CCTV and identifies Matt as being on the scene. She brings Matt in for questioning over the incident and he claims he cannot remember anything because he was drunk at the time. Snow explained that his character thought he had gotten away with the crime. He even forgot about it himself but it is now \\"back to haunt him\\". Leah refuses to believe that Matt is guilty and accuses Kat of targeting Matt because of his past. But Leah finds a bundle of money hidden in Matt's mattress and is then convinced he is responsible. Matt feels ashamed of himself when Leah confronts him as he has let her down. Snow told Downie that \\"to let Leah down is a massive thing, he feels horrible about it.\\" Leah is also suffering from an aneurysm and needs to rest. But the revelation causes her stress and Matt's drinking endangers Leah's life and his future. =Charlotte King= Erika Heynatz plays Charlotte King In June 2015, Addario spoke of her intention to play a \\"rebound relationship\\" for Matt. But she warned that it would remain a secretive relationship because Matt believes other characters will not approve. Matt meets Charlotte King (Erika Heynatz) and they sleep together. Heynatz and Snow did not have time to get better acquainted before they filmed their character's first passionate encounter. Heynatz told Kerry Harvey from Stuff.co.nz that it worked well for the scene, which was a \\"sexy chance meeting, inherent with all its awkward moments.\\" She added that a \\"lasting connection\\" develops between the two characters, but branded their relationship a dangerous one. Charlotte does not realise that he is a student and she has taken the role of Summer Bay High's new biology teacher. Despite learning this, the pair decide to carry on their affair. Matt confides in Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi) about the relationship, she disapproves and urges him end it. Charlotte does try to stop it, but when Matt kisses her she succumbs to her feelings. Heynatz said that their initial interaction was a \\"innocent mistake\\", but her character would be judged by viewers for carrying on with their romance. Writers continued to keep the pair together as they played Leah, who was unbeknownst to their affair, convincing Charlotte to personally tutor Matt. Snow said it was continuing the tradition of Matt getting into \\"sticky situations\\" as Charlotte turned out to be a \\"crazy\\" character. Snow told Downie that the storyline really interested him because it was often shown from Matt's point of view. He believed it furthered a trend in storyline's exlploring why Matt behaves certain ways. Matt would often lack self-belief but with Charlotte he became confident. He branded the character \\"Char-nado\\" and added that Charlotte was always \\"using her womanly charms to put a spell on him\\". He believed that Matt's experiences with Charlotte helped the character to mature and drew comparisons to the Shakespearen play A Midsummer Night's Dream. Despite their relationship ending, Snow noted that his character \\"really doted on\\" Charlotte. Snow was 23 at the time while Heynatz was 40. Snow said that he had fun filming the storyline. He reflected that he tried to do the best job he could to make it appear truthful and justify their relationship. =Relationship with Maddy Osborne= In 2015, Producers lined up yet another relationship for the character. Matt develops feelings for Maddy, despite him going out with his good friend Oscar MacGuire (Jake Speer). Clementi told Downie that there are some \\"serious vibes\\" from Matt, but Maddy is oblivious to them. Matt has hope that he may have a chance with Maddy when she has a serious argument with Oscar. She added that Maddy and Oscar do not have \\"that spark\\" but are good together. Oscar enlists Matt to help sort his problems. Matt finds the situation difficult because he tries to remain calm when talking to Maddy about her relationship. But he wants to tell her how he feels and this makes him a \\"tangled mess of emotions\\". Speer told Downie that Matt and Oscar had formed \\"such a bizarre friendship\\". One that began with Matt bullying Oscar and ended in them being firm friends. But their friendship was ruined when they fight over the same girl. The pair begin a relationship but writers devised a series of problems for the characters. Matt decides to drop out of university which angers Maddy. Then Matt is arrested in connection with Charlotte's murder. She leaked a sex tape of them online and the police wrongfully believe he killed her in an act of revenge. Matt is worried about how Maddy will react to the sex tape. Snow said that his character is \\"completely blindsided by it\\". Matt is criticised online by trolls and Maddy defends him. But following her supportive post, she becomes their target of the online bullying. But Maddy soon fears that she is being followed and harassed. Snow said that Matt feels guilty and blames himself for Maddy's situation. He added \\"if anyone should have to deal with this it's him\\". But Matt is furious when he reads certain comments and goes to the station to report the trolls. Snow praised the storyline because online bullying is a current issue many have to deal with. =Departure= After four years in the role, Snow's departure from Home and Away was confirmed in March 2017. Snow left the show on 21 March, along with Philippa Northeast, who plays Matt's love interest Evelyn MacGuire. Matt and Evelyn left Summer Bay for Vietnam, shortly after holding a ceremonial wedding. Snow admitted that he was \\"apprehensive\\" during his last day on set, but thought the ceremony, with Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) as the celebrant, was the \\"perfect parting gift.\\" Reception A writer from TV Week said \\"There's no denying it. Home and Away's Sasha and Matt have more chemistry than a nuclear power plant. While their colleague Shannon Molloy branded him a \\"troubled teen\\" character and weighed up his time in the show, stating \\"he isn't taking much seriously at the moment. He's mucking up as a school captain, pushing the new Summer Bay High principal's buttons and treating his girlfriend like rubbish.\\" A writer from TV Soap observed \\"having grown up in a poor household with a single mum, Matt's 'me against the world' attitude rubbed plenty of people the wrong way.\\" Of his bad attitude they added \\"you could see the chip on his shoulder from a mile away.\\" But they believed the character also had hidden depths concluding that \\"behind the tough, cocky exterior lies a decent young man who's had a pretty difficult life.\\" TV Week's Stephen Downie insulted the character for not caring about his future, stating \\"what a turkey\\" he was behaving like towards Sasha. A writer from the South Wales Echo said they were thankful that Matt decided to stop drinking and branded him a \\"troubled soul\\". A Sunday Mail reporter suggested that Matt was incapable of making a sensible decision. They noted that alls Matt needed to do was to cooperate with authorities to avoid jail time for robbery, but they were not holding their breath. Susan Hill (Daily Star) liked the character's appearance and branded him \\"hunky Matt\\".

Water quality is sometimes affected after heavy rainfall due to upstream farm effluent, and combined sewer outfalls in the river as it passes through the town. This in turn can affect the bathing water quality on the beach immediately next to the river, after heavy rain. Several initiatives have improved the situation recently, with the EA liaising with local farmers and water companies to improve water quality.

During a mass-marriage function organised by Jacket, eight grooms and a bride out of the 25 couples to be married go missing due to the efforts of Jacket's archenemy MLA Maurdhamuthu (Aadukalam Naren). Murugan manages to get seven grooms and a bride back, but a groom is still missing. To save Jacket's reputation, he asks his best friend Sakkarai (Soori) to pretend to marry Pushpa (Reshma Pasupuleti), a local dancer and item girl who is known to everyone in the village, despite being betrothed to Hamsavali. Unfortunately for Sakkarai, a photo showing him marrying Pushpa is published in the tabloids and goes viral on social media, forcing Hamsavali to break her engagement with Sakkarai unless he divorces Pushpa. Sakkarai asks Pushpa to sign the divorce notice, but she refuses to sign unless Sakkarai brings Jacket in front of her and tells her to do so. To add to Sakkarai's woes, Pushpa even moves in with him. Meanwhile, Murugan falls in love with Archana (Nikki Galrani), the daughter of a restaurateur whose main ambition is to become a police officer. Archana's father finds out about Murugan's association with Jacket and asks him to give 10 lakhs to Jacket so that his daughter could become a sub-inspector and also asks him not to tell Archana as she wants to get the job in an honest way. Later that day, Jacket goes to the hospital to visit Minister Shanmugasundaram (Vittal), who is on his deathbed. Before dying, Shanmugasundaram tells him about the 5 billion that he acquired illegally, but he wants him to use it for good purposes. Jacket's brother-in- law Bhootham (Ravi Mariya) also wants the money, but for his own benefits. He chases Jacket on his way home to find out the location where the money is kept, but Jacket meets with an accident during the chase and develops amnesia, while also behaving like a 10-year old. Archana eventually gets the job, but on merit and not through recommendation. Thinking that Murugan had cheated her father, she immediately orders him to give back the money, failing which he would be imprisoned. Murugan and Sakkarai find out about Jacket's condition but manage to get him discharged from the hospital. They train him to tell Archana that he has received the money from Murugan and to tell Pushpa to sign the divorce notice so that both their problems would be solved. Unfortunately, their plan backfires completely as Jacket tells Pushpa what he was supposed to tell Archana, making Pushpa realize that Jacket has lost his memory and refuses to sign the divorce notice. Jacket also inadvertently gets caught in the middle of a protest against Marudhamuthu and is eventually kidnapped by Bhootham and his men. Murugan is caught at the scene of the kidnapping and is arrested by Archana. At Bhootham's hideout, Jacket irritates him and his men with his childish behavior. In a fit of rage, Bhootham kicks Jacket, making him unconscious, but Jacket regains his memory after gaining consciousness, much to Bhootham's happiness. Bhootham then asks him where the money is hidden. Jacket, however, starts telling all the events of the day he met Shanmugasundaram and keeps repeating the story from the beginning whenever he is interrupted, much to Bhootham's irritation. At this juncture, Murugan and Archana, who have both found out that Bhootham has kidnapped Jacket, arrive. Murugan manages to stop Jacket's repetition, getting him to tell in front of Archana that he did receive the money, but since DGP Sathasivam (Venkat), whom he was supposed to pay the bribe, refused to accept it, he gave the money to a contractor. Jacket also tells that he has managed to convince Pushpa to sign the divorce notice. He then reveals the location of the money to Bhootham, which is stored in an abandoned mansion called Noor Mahal. Murugan, Archana, Sakkarai, Jacket, Bhootham, and even Marudhamuthu, who has also found out about the money, go to the mansion. A fight ensues between them over the money, which ends with Murugan and Jacket successfully getting it. In the end, with all problems solved, Murugan and Archana enter into a romantic relationship, while Sakkarai is to marry Hamsavali during another mass- marriage function organised by Jacket, but before Sakkarai can tie the thali around Hamasavali's neck, the priest asks him if he is Pushpa's husband, to which he accidentally says yes, causing Hamsavali to stop the wedding.

Life  Little is known of his life before 1585. As explained by himself, he entered the army when he only was 18 years old.Gonz√°lez de Le√≥n, page 135. In 1585, he was sergeant in Francisco of Bobadilla's army in to Flanders; in 1590 he was imprisoned for some time for participation in a mutiny.Mart√≠nez La√≠nez & S√°nchez de Toca, pages 227 and 228. From 1593, as an artillery officer in the Spanish army, he took part in the wars of Spain against Henry IV of France and against the Flemish rebels. He took part in the sieges of La Chapelle (1594), Doullens, Cambray (1595), Calais (1596) and in the defense of Amiens, occupied by the Spanish army in 1597.Giannini, p. 486. In this period he met his main sponsor: Pedro Enr√≠quez of Acevedo, count of Fuentes, who had been appointed governor of Milan in 1600.Mart√≠nez La√≠nez, p. 183.Giannini, p. 487. From 1600, as inspector of fortificacions of the Duchy of Milan, he carried out numerous secret missions for the Spain; He also took part in the foundation of the Academy of Artillery of Milan, for what Fuentes had obtained the approval of the king, Philip III of SpainMart√≠nez La√≠nez, p. 184.Mart√≠nez La√≠nez, p. 185. From Milan, he recommended that Spain create a similar academy in Madrid.Gonz√°lez de Le√≥n, p. 139. The death of the count of Fuentes in 1610 left Lechuga without any political support.Giannini, p√†gina 488. Yet, in 1613 he was transferred to the Royal Navy based in Cadiz and he was appointed lieutenant general.. In 1614 he took part in the expedition against La Mamora, now Mehdya (Morocco), and was appointed governor once the place was conquered, and commissioned to build strong fortifications there.Giannini, p. 489. In 1620 he was faced with aggression from the Moroccans of the area; their siege was broken by reinforcements from Cadiz in 1621.Giannini, p. 490-491. In September 1622 Diego of Escobedo was appointed governor of La Mamora as his replacement; it is not known if the appointment was due to the death or the resignation of Cristobal Lechuga. Grave of Crist√≥bal Lechuga in Baeza Cathedral However, in the years 1618-1619, perhaps during a leave in his natal village, Baeza, he erected a family chapel in the Romanesque church of Santa Cruz, where he wanted to be buried. This chapel-sepulchre was moved to Baeza's Cathedral, when the church was \\"desamortitzada\\" in 1835 and we can see it, still today, in this place.  Works  Lechuga Is known to have written two works of military technics: * Discurso en el que trata del cargo de Maestro de Campo General (Milan, 1603), probably written while he was in Flandes, but published some years after.Giannini, p√†gina 499. The work is written to show that tradition and antiquity can not be the criteria for evaluating the merit of military officers, but rather their professional preparation and technical capacity.Giannini, p√†gina 501. * Discurso en el que trata de la Artilleria con un tratado de Fortificaci√≥n (Milan, 1611). The book continues his emphasis on the professionalism of the military. He considers that the Artillery is the most important arm of a modern army, he discusses it more deeply, recommending normalization of calibration, building and location of the pieces, etc. The discussion is based on a scientific and technical point of view.

The locomotives were part of an electrification project undertaken by the New Haven between Grand Central Terminal in New York City and Stamford, Connecticut. Baldwin-Westinghouse delivered 41 locomotives between 1905‚Äì1908, and the New Haven retired the last in 1947.  Design  The EP-1 had to support two electric systems and three collection methods. The New York Central Railroad's 660 V third rail DC extended from Grand Central to Woodlawn, where New Haven territory began. Westinghouse installed 11 kV overhead line AC from Woodlawn to Stamford. Finally, the New York Central employed overhead lines over railroad switches in place of third rail electrification. To support these myriad methods, Westinghouse installed two sets of pantographs, one for AC and one for DC collection, and a contact shoe for third rail operation. Control devices within the locomotive prevented drawing power from multiple sources and enabled transition between them without stopping. The boxcab body was long and weighed . Beneath it, initially, were four axles in a pair of trucks (B-B arrangement). After oscillation problems the New Haven added an unpowered axle to each end (1-B-B-1), which resolved the issue. The EP-1 was capable of multiple working, and was the first electric locomotive to do so regularly.  History  Westinghouse delivered the first prototype in 1905, followed by 34 production units in 1907‚Äì1908. One was loaned to the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1907 for testing on the West Jersey and Seashore Railroad; the locomotive tested well but the Pennsylvania adopted DC electrification for its New York Tunnel Extension. The New Haven ordered six more in 1908. The EP-1 designation, applied later, stood for \\"Electric Passenger.\\" The EP-1s handled passenger trains between New York and Stamford, and later New Haven, Connecticut, when the New Haven extended electrification there. Retirements began in 1936 as equipment wore out and newer locomotives became available, but the last left service in 1947. The New Haven supplemented the EP-1 fleet with 27 EP-2 boxcabs, built between 1919‚Äì1927 and 10 EP-3 boxcabs in 1931.

Early life By the time of Richard's birth, his grandfather Charles P Scott had already been editor of The Manchester Guardian for 43 years. Charles handed over the editorship to his son, Richard's father, Ted in 1929. Just three years later, and only months after inheriting half of the newspaper on Charles' death, tragedy struck when Ted drowned while boating with Richard on Windermere. Richard had been schooled at Gresham's School, Norfolk, and, with the financial support of Ted's brother John Russell Scott, he matriculated to Christ's College, Cambridge later that same year, 1932. Ted's shares in the newspaper had gone to John who, in 1936 orchestrated their conversion into a trust to avoid inheritance taxes. Hence, Richard was never more than momentarily an owner of the paper. Journalism Richard commenced his work as a journalist at the League of Nations Union, where he wrote brochures, pamphlets and memoranda for members, then a year at The Spectator, then the British Council before joining the Foreign Office during the Second World War. In 1947, he joined the newspaper as diplomatic correspondent. Saving The Guardian While writing critically of the Eden government in the context of the Suez crisis in 1956, Richard was appointed Chairman of the Scott Trust. He managed to carry on without attending a single meeting of its board for ten years, though, concentrating on his reporting work for The Guardian, including moving to Georgetown, Washington DC, in 1963 to work under Alistair Cooke. Richard famously for the first time used his position as Chairman of the trust to oppose his cousin Laurence Scott's plan to merge The Guardian, of which he, Laurence, was then Chairman, with the Times in 1966, for which resistance Richard was considered the saviour of its independence. Later years and death Scott continued on in Washington until 1971 when he moved to Paris for a three-year assignment. He retired from journalism in 1974, taking up residence at his vineyard in Limoux. After divorce from his second wife, Anna Walmsley, he moved into a small cottage in the nearby town of Lagrasse, Corbi√®res, where he passed his remaining years with third wife Christiane.

The launch and principal photography of the film took place in February 2016; filming took place in Hyderabad and Kashmir.

The film released worldwide on 9 December 2016, after multiple postponements; it receivied positive reviews praising the performances of Ram Charan and Arvind Swamy respectively.  Plot  A low-level party cadre Chengalrayudu (Posani Krishna Murali) is tying a flag to a street-lamp post. Suddenly his pregnant wife goes into labour, but he completely ignores it, as he is more dedicated to his leader and party. At the same time, the party's deputy leader (Nassar) visits the locality; as soon as he comes to know about this incident, the leader lends his car and orders his driver to immediately take the pregnant lady to the hospital; she delivers a baby boy named Venkanna before they get to the hospital. At the age of fifteen, Venkanna secures first rank in his 10th standard state exam and visits the party deputy-leader, now the chairman of the party and a member of the ruling coalition for his blessings with his father. While they are waiting in the party office for the leader to come in, they witness a murder of a rebel party candidate by their own revered leader due to caste-related comments by the rebel on him. When the leader asks Chengalrayudu to take the blame by saying that he killed the man due to rage about the rebel's comments, Venkanna volunteers to take the blame and is willing to go to jail, citing the leniency of juvenile laws in exchange for an MLA seat for his father in the upcoming by-election. The deal is agreed and carried out. 15 years later, Dhruva (Ram Charan) and his friends Gowtham (Navdeep), Karan (Randhir Gattla), Ranveer (Ali Reza), and others are a small group of trainee IPS officers who discreetly assist the police, one activity being catching a gang which kidnapped four girls. One day Dhruva receives a cryptic text message on his phone from an anonymous number stating that he/she is aware of their discreet activities. In the evening, they go out to meet that person who is revealed to be Ishika (Rakul Preet Singh), who loves Dhruva. Later that same night they happen to witness the murder of a man who is a social activist with the pretense of snatch theft. Dhruva and his friends catch the gang and their leader (Shekar) and hand them over to the police; however, four days later the leader of the gang comes to the IPS headquarters with the home minister. This political and organised crime comes as a shock to Dhruva and his friends. Dhruva takes them to his house and shows his research on connecting all small unrelated incidents into the global view of a hidden network of politicians, industrialists and criminals who bend the law for their own financial benefits. He singles out three prominent business oligarchs, including pharmaceutical mogul Dheeraj Chandra (Sayaji Shinde), don Irfan Ali (Madhusudhan Rao) and a minister. When Dhruva tries following Dheeraj Chandra, he realises that all three of them work as a group and they all work for an affluent scientist Siddharth Abhimanyu (Aravind Swamy). After the completion of his training, Dhruva is awarded medals for specializing in dealing with organized crime during training and also for being the best probationer of the batch, and is posted as the ASP of the Organized Crime Unit. Dhruva discovers that Siddharth is Chengalrayudu's son Venkanna. After his release from juvenile detention center, Venkanna had his name changed and left India to complete his education abroad. After his graduation he returned to India and is now a well established scientist. Siddarth uses the medical field for the wrong reasons and his own profit. Chengalrayudu is now the incumbent health and welfare minister in the minority government headed by the party leader. At that time Angelina, a Swiss pharmaceutical company owner and activist tries to make generic medicines for life-threatening diseases available in India at low cost affordable by poor people. Siddharth's assassin kills Angelina before she can sign the agreement document with the government and shoots Dhruva at the same time. While he is recovering from the gunshot wound in the hospital with the help of Ishika and Gowtham, an electronic bug (GPS + audio transmitter) is implanted during surgery. Through the bug, Siddharth listens all of Dhruva's plans and continuously monitors his whereabouts and whatever he talks via audio transmission. Then comes evidence against Siddharth in the form of Akshara (Abhinaya). She was a scientist at Siddharth's research lab, where a seaweed that can cure diabetes is found abundantly in the oceans. Siddharth tries to sell the technology and rights to extract medicine from the seaweed to multinational pharmaceutical companies but is opposed by Akshara. So Siddharth arranges goons and the goons rape and kill her. But before being killed, she records a video and stores it in an SD card so that someone will find it. But before Dhruva can find the card, Siddharth finds out and assigns Abbas to recover the card, but Dhruva tells Gowtham to get the card. Gowtham goes to the house where the SD card is at. He successfully gets the card after a fight with Abbas, but through the bug Siddharth knows this and abducts Gowtham. Gowtham fights Abbas and Siddharth but he gets drugged and before Dhruva can save him, Siddharth and Abbas kill Gowtham. Dhruva comes back to his special house where he finds a pin has been changed in a picture which turns out to be the picture of Naina Miss world of 2011 and a close aquintance of Siddharth whose girlfriend Preethi was also part of that event. Dhruva doubts whether Siddharth himself would have come to his house. Ishika checks the finger prints on the pin keeping the gun case Dhruva received from Siddharth in his posting ceremony and the finger prints match. A flashback reveals that Siddharth killed Preethi's father so that she doesn't participate in the competition and as she won't have a ticket to go to her father's funeral he requests to take her in his chartered flight and wins her over. Dhruva frantically searches for the bug which he eventually finds out in a series of thrilling events. The most hilarious part in the film is when this police officer avoids using a bug detector to find the bug implanted in his body and discovers it with his intuition or sixth sense. Dhruva captures Abbas and records all the information from him. He drugs Abbas and manipulates Siddharth into killing him. At the same time, Siddharth's father reads the changed medical report, which contains very good medical contracts for public welfare and multiple accusations against the CM. When Siddharth learns about this, he ask Chengalrayudu to pretend to have chest pains and move outside to hospital. The ruling party forces Chengalrayudu either to resign within 24 hours or he will be dismissed. Dhruva appeals to the CM that he has evidence and wants to arrest Siddharth, and he is granted permission to do so. Hence Siddarth kills his father using his goons in an accident and forces the CM to stop actions against him or he will lie that the CM killed his father for personal vengeance. But the next day at his father's state funeral, Dhruva arrests him on the CM's orders. When Siddharth is arrested, Dhruva tells him that the medicine was patented in Akshara's name (despite Siddarth being the inventor) and will be made as generic medicine instead of a patent-protected one. It is also revealed that Chengalrayudu is alive, saved by Dhruva and the public funeral held was for Gowtham. Dhruva makes a deal that he would save Siddharth's life for information and evidence on all of his criminal associates and activities and gives him a bulletproof vest to fake his death during his transport to court. They also plan to take down the set up planned by various VIPs to kill Siddharth when one of them gets close to Siddharth. Dhruva takes him down and pushes Siddharth back. To Dhruva's surprise, Siddharth does not wear the vest, and is fatally shot by his girlfriend Preethi as an act of vengeance for killing her father. Before dying, he tells Dhruva that he hid all the evidence in an SD card in the bulletproof vest, adding that he had not done it for the nation but because Dhruva had asked for it.

In an interview with, The Times of India, Surender revealed that, it took him three months to complete the script, with two months for adapting the script in Telugu, and another month for the final draft being prepared. Following the poor performance of Charan's Bruce Lee: The Fighter, Danayya stepped out of producing the venture, and subsequently Allu Aravind, bankrolled the project under the home studio Geetha Arts, collaborating with charan for the second time after Magadheera (2009).

Navdeep is apparently cast as one of Charan's cop friends which is an important role in the story. Posani Krishna Murali, was apparently cast which is considered to be an important role in the film. The makers roped in Hiphop Tamizha, who composed for the original film, as the music composer, thus making his debut in Telugu. Aseem Mishra, who worked in Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015), was initially chosen as the film's cinematographer, but due to his non-availability, he was replaced by P. S. Vinod. Navin Nooli, Rajeevan and Nagendra were chosen as the editor, production designer and art director respectively. The stunt sequences are choreographed by Ravi Varma. Bosco- Caesar were roped in to choreograph the song sequences, who previously worked for Charan in Orange (2010). =Filming= The film was scheduled to be launched on 16 January 2016, however, the launch was tentatively delayed to 10 February 2016. The film was launched at the office of the production house Geetha Arts on 18 February 2016, and it was announced that the regular shooting of the film would commence on 22 February 2016. However, the principal photography was commenced without Ram Charan, and it was announced that he would join the shooting from 1 March 2016.

On 11 May 2016, the makers planned for a shooting schedule in Kashmir, to film an important sequence and a song, and it also reported that Ram Charan may join the schedule. Later Ram Charan and Rakul Preet moved to Kashmir, for its second schedule, which was completed on 29 June, Following the second schedule, the team moved to Hyderabad, in July 2016 to shoot important sequences, and later planned to shoot the songs in August. An exclusive making video of the film was released, in which Ram Charan was performing risky stunts, all by himself, without using any body doubles. In August 2016, the makers revealed that, the talkie portion of the film has been completed, and later planned to shoot two songs, along with the completion of post-production works. A special set for the introduction song of the film was erected on a huge scale. For the song shoot, Ram Charan reportedly got training himself under Sultan and Dangal fame bodybuilder Rakesh Udiyar. The song shoot was completed on late October. Later, Aravind Swamy completed his portions for Dhruva. The song \\"Pareshanura\\" was shot at the Krabi Islands in Thailand, which featured Ram Charan and Rakul Preet Singh. The song \\"Neethoney Dance\\" was filmed at a huge set erected at Annapurna Studios, which was choreographed by Bosco-Caesar duo. Following the song shoot, the principal photography was wrapped up on 14 November 2016.  Music  The soundtrack album and background score was composed by Hiphop Tamizha marking their debut in Telugu. The album features five tracks written by Chandrabose and Varikkuppala Yadagiri. Bollywood singer Amit Mishra, recorded the title track of the film \\"Dhruva Dhruva\\" in his Telugu debut, which the composer stated it as a challenging one. The song was inspired from the number \\"Travelling Soldier\\" from the Pawan Kalyan-starrer Thammudu (1999), which was stated by Ram Charan, in his US tour for the promotion of the film. The makers revealed a 10-second song promo along with the track list on 1 November 2016. Initially, the makers planned for a grand audio launch event at Hyderabad on 9 November 2016, with Pawan Kalyan as the chief guest. However, due to the announcement of the demonetisation, the said audio launch was cancelled, and the album was directly released to stores and online by Aditya Music, which acquired the audio rights, on the said before date. While the songs are newly composed, the song \\"Theemai Dhan Vellum\\" from the original film, was reused in Telugu, titled \\"Manushi Musugulo Mrugam Neney Ra\\" which was used for promotional purposes. The song was released as a bonus track on 7 December 2016. The soundtrack album received positive reviews from critics. Behindwoods rated the album 2.75 out of 5 stating \\"Dhruva is an impressive album from Hip- Hop Thamizha with enjoyable and experimental compositions!\\" Indaglitz gave 2.75 out of 5 and stated \\"An album that doesn't boast of formulaic songs, this one has two actress-driven songs out of the four. While the party-time song is a rip-off, the title track stands out for its meaningful lyrics and rendition.\\" 123Telugu commented \\"Usually, star hero films bring a festive atmosphere to the fans, from the first look release to the movie audience. Needless to say, audio plays a key role in the success of the film. Predictions are too high. The mega power star Ram Charan's hero Dhruva has also had unmatched expectations on audio. Released amidst those expectations, the album differs from regular Telugu cinema style audio. Only four songs in this audio are 'Pareshnura', 'Neethoane Dancing' and 'Dhruva'. 'Chusa Chusa' is not remarkable. Finally, in a sense .. 'Dhruva' album is more classy, slightly different from the routine, and is an album of situations. All these songs are more impressive than the audio.\\" Milliblog commented \\"Hiphop Tamizha‚Äôs Telugu debut is largely the same of what they are usually known for in Tamil.\\" Bollywoodlife gave 2.5 out of 5 stars and commented \\"This album will catch everyone's interest as it marks Hip Hop Tamizha's debut in Telugu industry but it won't hold their attention for long. What didn't work was the almost-repetitive composition for each of the songs. But if you are a party person and you are looking for a new party number, then Neethoney Dance is a your song! For this cool, catchy song, you could give the Dhruva album a try.\\" Release Ram Charan planned to release the film on 7 October 2016, coinciding with the Dusshera festival, but the makers postponed its release to avoid clash with Naga Chaitanya-starrer Premam (2016); later pushed its release to 25 November 2016, which clashes with the Telugu version of Sivakarthikeyan-starrer Remo (2016), however, the release was postponed. The producers claimed that the 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation, has postponed the film's release. The makers finally announced that the film will be released worldwide on 9 December 2016.

It is Weir's most popular short story, and has been translated into over 30 languages by readers. Summary The story is about the main character, who is \\"you\\" (in the second person), and God, who is \\"me\\" (in the first person). You, a 48-year-old man who dies in a car crash, meet the narrator, who says that you have been reincarnated many times before, and that you are next to be reincarnated as a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD. God then explains that you are, in fact, constantly reincarnated across time, and that all human beings who have ever lived and will ever live are incarnations of you. You remark about being Abraham Lincoln, Adolf Hitler and Jesus, and God adds that you were also once John Wilkes Booth, every Holocaust victim and every person who followed Jesus. God explains that in fact there are other Godlike beings elsewhere, and that you too will one day become a God. The entire universe was created as an egg for the main character (all of humanity), and once you have lived every human life ever, you will be born as a God. The reason God created the universe was for the main character, you, to understand this point: \\"Every time you victimized someone...you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you‚Äôve done, you‚Äôve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.\\"  In popular culture  The rapper Logic used The Egg as inspiration for his album Everybody released in 2017, re-imagined in the interlude track \\"Waiting Room\\" and featuring Neil DeGrasse Tyson as God. In honor of the story's ten-year anniversary, the popular YouTube channel Kurzgesagt made an animation based on the story with Weir's permission, released on September 1, 2019.

It defines an extensible architecture based on the C#, exposing a declarative syntax to describe the dependencies between build-able modules. The core assembly exposes a generic dependency system, while packages of C# scripts extend support into multi-threaded command line builds, Microsoft Visual Studio project and solution generation, Apple Xcode project and workspace generation, and Makefile generation. Features BuildAMation supports building code for C/C++, and Objective C derivatives. It writes build output to a folder named the build root. This out-of-place build ensures that source trees are not modified by a build, and performing a clean build is as simple as deleting one directory. BuildAMation is extensible by means of defining packages. Packages are any directory containing a special bam folder, which contains files that BuildAMation uses. The files required are an XML file, called the package definition file, which resides directly in the bam folder, which describes the package dependencies. Also, in a Scripts subdirectory of bam, there are C# files that exposes what the current package does. Packages can be logically grouped into repositories. Example BuildAMation packages provided offer support for various compiler toolchains, and build modes. Such toolchains are Microsoft Visual Studio, Clang for Apple, GCC for Linux, and multiple versions of each. Build modes define how BuildAMation generates its output. Native build mode runs a (multi threaded) command line build, whereas the VSSolution build mode generates a Microsoft Visual Studio solution and projects. Packages define modules. Modules are either concrete buildable entities or provide an abstract base class for being able to build a class of entity. Each module may refer to a tool, which is what is used to perform the build on that module. A tool is another module, allowing tools to either be prebuilt (e.g. a compiler), or can be built as part of the current build. Tools define settings through a collection of interfaces, which expose named properties for each option to the tool. Settings have default values, but each module can individually override these settings through the use of patches. Patches can either be private (only applied to the current module) or public (applied to the current module and those modules that depend on it). Public patches allow such states as header include paths to be exposed, for example, from a module representing a static library. Paths in BuildAMation scripts use macros in order to maintain some level of abstraction and reuse. Macros are enclosed in $(macroname) markup. Predefined string functions can also be used in paths, and are enclosed in @funcname(...) markup. The combination of macros and functions allow modules to reuse and recombine parts of source paths to generate output paths. Invocation BuildAMation provides a command line utility called bam. This executable should be invoked in any package directory to build that package. Example script Below is an example BuildAMation script from the suite of test packages provided with the release. It generates two dynamic libraries written in C, an executable that uses both libraries, and then collates the three binaries into a directory so that they are runnable. using Bam.Core; namespace Test13 { public sealed class DynamicLibraryA : C.DynamicLibrary { protected override void Init( Bam.Core.Module parent) { base.Init(parent); this.CreateHeaderContainer(\\"$(packagedir)/include/dynamicLibraryA.h\\"); this.CreateCSourceContainer(\\"$(packagedir)/source/dynamicLibraryA.c\\"); this.PublicPatch((settings, appliedTo) => { var compiler = settings as C.ICommonCompilerSettings; if (null != compiler) { compiler.IncludePaths.AddUnique(this.CreateTokenizedString(\\"$(packagedir)/include\\")); } }); if (this.BuildEnvironment.Platform.Includes(Bam.Core.EPlatform.Windows) && this.Linker is VisualCCommon.LinkerBase) { this.LinkAgainst(); } } } public sealed class DynamicLibraryB : C.DynamicLibrary { protected override void Init( Bam.Core.Module parent) { base.Init(parent); this.CreateHeaderContainer(\\"$(packagedir)/include/dynamicLibraryB.h\\"); this.CreateCSourceContainer(\\"$(packagedir)/source/dynamicLibraryB.c\\"); this.PublicPatch((settings, appliedTo) => { var compiler = settings as C.ICommonCompilerSettings; if (null != compiler) { compiler.IncludePaths.AddUnique(this.CreateTokenizedString(\\"$(packagedir)/include\\")); } }); this.LinkAgainst(); if (this.BuildEnvironment.Platform.Includes(Bam.Core.EPlatform.Windows) && this.Linker is VisualCCommon.LinkerBase) { this.LinkAgainst(); } } } public sealed class Application : C.ConsoleApplication { protected override void Init( Bam.Core.Module parent) { base.Init(parent); var source = this.CreateCSourceContainer(\\"$(packagedir)/source/main.c\\"); this.PrivatePatch(settings => { var gccLinker = settings as GccCommon.ICommonLinkerSettings; if (null != gccLinker) { gccLinker.CanUseOrigin = true; gccLinker.RPath.AddUnique(\\"$ORIGIN\\"); } }); this.CompileAndLinkAgainst(source); this.CompileAndLinkAgainst(source); if (this.BuildEnvironment.Platform.Includes(Bam.Core.EPlatform.Windows) && this.Linker is VisualCCommon.LinkerBase) { this.LinkAgainst(); } } } public sealed class RuntimePackage : Publisher.Collation { protected override void Init( Bam.Core.Module parent) { base.Init(parent); var app = this.Include(C.ConsoleApplication.Key, EPublishingType.ConsoleApplication); this.Include(C.DynamicLibrary.Key, \\".\\", app); this.Include(C.DynamicLibrary.Key, \\".\\", app); } } } History What would become BuildAMation begun development in 2010, but was then called Opus, and stored in Google Code. The name was changed in 2014 to BuildAMation to avoid confusion with the existing Opus Make, and moved to a GitHub project. A number of very early pre-releases were made. The incentive for BuildAMation was to overcome several obstacles observed by Mark Final in his software engineering career; to write a single definition of how to build software but make use of a variety of build methods; to use a real programming language so that debugging and profiling the build system can leverage existing technologies, developer knowledge, and tools; to expose common compiler/linker features by name, rather than having to recall each toolchain syntax. Early in 2015, the declarative syntax underwent a complete redesign after noticing the original syntax had some limitations. A cleaner, more extensible syntax is now in use, and has helped simplify and enhance existing package scripts.

Under coach John Burns, the Pioneers finished the 1997 season as conference runners-up before missing the playoffs again in 1998. They finished as conference runners-up again in 2000. Burns led the Pioneers for 5¬Ω seasons before taking up a teaching job in Indonesia just over halfway through the 2002 season; he was subsequently replaced by his assistant Sonya Knight. =2003 Championship glory= With Sonya Knight at the helm in 2003, the Pioneers took out the SEABL South Conference Championship before going all the way and winning through to the ABA National Final, where they defeated the Ballarat Miners 127‚Äì113 to claim their first ever National Championship. The 2003 Pioneers squad included Jason Sedlock (co-captain), Damien Anderson (co-captain), Damien Smith, Jamie Holmes, Kurt Russell, Allen Cram, Ben Jones, Brad Wilson, Sam Fotu, Jason Joynes and Kingsley Clarke. Russell was named Under 23 South Conference Player-of-the-Year in 2003 as well as the MVP of the National Final; Holmes won the South Conference's Most Valuable Player award; and Holmes and Anderson were both named in the SEABL All-Star starting five. =Era of dominance= After eight straight seasons of missing the playoffs between 2005 and 2012, the Pioneers won four straight SEABL South Conference titles between 2013 and 2016, all under coach Richard Hill. They also won back-to-back SEABL National Championships in 2014 and 2015. In 2017, the Pioneers won their fifth straight SEABL conference title, this time winning the East Conference. They went on to clinch the SEABL National Championship, thus winning their third national title in four years. =Demise of SEABL, new era in Premier League= Following the 2018 season, Basketball Australia disbanded the SEABL, leaving the Pioneers in limbo for 2019. In December 2018, after much deliberation, the Pioneers were accepted into the South Australian Premier League. With the SEABL being Australia's elite semi-professional competition, the Pioneers were forced to accept many concessions in order to enter the Premier League, including diluting its SEABL-quality men's team, fielding a women's team, and paying $4,000 per visiting club toward costs of the trip to Mount Gambier. The Pioneers men reached the Premier League Grand Final in 2019, where they lost 107‚Äì90 to the Forestville Eagles. In June 2019, the Pioneers lodged a bid for their men's team to enter the New Zealand NBL in 2020. However, despite being granted entry by the New Zealand NBL Board, Basketball Australia declined to allow the Pioneers permission. =NBL1= In October 2019, the Pioneers were granted entry into NBL1 for the 2020 season.

Once known as the Kupietz Block, it was constructed in stages from 1860 to the 1880s. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 (under the misspelled name Kirch/Latch Building) for having local significance in the themes of architecture and commerce. It was nominated for its transitional Gothic Revival/Italianate architecture and its former occupation by the largest of several produce wholesalers that based themselves in Winona to take advantage of the city's river and rail connections. History The Latsch Building's history is not entirely known. Its official National Register documentation gives a construction date of circa 1868, but more recent sources give a start date of 1860 and note that it was altered and expanded over the next few decades. During an extensive renovation in 2015, the owner posited that the visible structure had been constructed around an older building in 1890. Whatever the timeframe, the brick building's fa√ßade was designed in the Italianate style that was then coming into vogue, but retained overtones of the older Gothic Revival design, particularly in regard to the windows. Cast-iron Corinthian columns were added to the front fa√ßade in the 1880s. Historical documents confirm that the building was occupied by J.B. Kirch & Company, a farm implement dealer, from the early 1870s to the late 1880s. By the mid 1890s it was being converted to a store and warehouse for major local grocery retailer and wholesaler Latsch & Son. The elder Latsch was a Swiss immigrant who farmed near Dodge, Wisconsin, until he was crippled in an accident. He and his family moved to Winona, where he began a grocery business. Several grocery wholesalers based themselves in Winona in the late 19th century due to its status as a river and rail transportation hub, and Latsch & Son became the biggest of them. Between 1866 and the 1930s the company was the leading business and primary tenant of Winona's East Second Street commercial district. The son, John A. Latsch, had been born in 1861 and took over the thriving company in 1909 upon his father's death. The younger Latsch was a prominent figure in Winona, a hardworking but eccentric loner who donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to local charities and of land for public parks. In 1933 the Latsch Building was occupied by the Grams Feed and Seed Store. Other small businesses were located in the building at various times as well, including a saloon, a clothing store, a cigar manufacturer, a doctor's office, and a real estate office. It was home to a food co-op from 1972 to 2000. Restoration The building in 2009, before restoration In 2014 new developers purchased the building and embarked on a nearly $3 million restoration. According to news reports, project partners Peter Shortridge and Mike Gostomski were motivated to restore the building \\"as close to its original condition as possible\\". They renamed the property the Latsch & Son Building since it was the only remaining structure in Winona that once housed the Latsches' grocery empire. A quarter of the floorspace is leased to a credit union, with space for other commercial tenants on the ground floor and for offices on the second floor. The developers and civic officials billed the project as a major first step in revitalizing the former industrial zone that isolates Winona from its downtown riverfront.

On average, major cities in Baden-W√ºrttemberg have 22.66 m2 green space/citizen. However, there is an area of 2600 ha (26 km2) of forest in the close proximity of Freiburg as well as additional recreational area like the Rieselfeld district (a former sewage farm). The majority of the green spaces came into existence from the 1960s on.  Parks  = Dietenbachpark = Slackline facility in the Dietenbachpark In 1974, the construction of the Dietenbachpark, which is located on the outskirts of the Weingarten district, was started. However, the park was not finished until 1986. Extending over an area of 34.88 ha (about 348,800 m2), Dietenbachpark is Freiburg's largest park. Inside the park, lake Dietenbachsee is located, which was the direct result from gravel extraction for the construction of the street Westrandstra√üe. Using the earth that covered the gravel and hence had to be removed, an embankment was raised on the northern side of the lake. One of its purposes is to protect the small stream Dietenbach, that had been re-natured during the course of the construction, from being completely absorbed by the lake in the case of a flooding. During the summertime the lake can be used for swimming (with nude swimming being permitted). There are several plants growing in the park, including fruit trees, dog roses, margarites, medick and knautia. These plants attract several butterflies, for example the many-plumed moth, the painted lady and Lycaenidae. There is a cross of 4 m height, which can be seen from distance, on the southern side of the lake. The word ‚Äúpeace‚Äù is engraved in the base of the cross in twelve different languages. The placement of the cross was arranged by an ecumenical initiative. Among other things, it represents the many different cultures living in Freiburg-Weingarten. Public sports grounds as well as sports clubs such as Sportgruppe Weingarten and Freiburger FC can be found in the park as well as playgrounds and a barbecue area. In the summer of 2012 a 72-year-old Freiburg citizen started growing a vegetable patch of approximately 15 m2. By now, this urban gardening has been accepted by the city of Freiburg. = Eschholzpark = Red garden hose Due to the construction of the Technisches Rathaus (technical town hall) and the construction of the school complex in the district St√ºhlinger, 370 community gardens were removed. Therefore, in 1979, the creation of the Eschholzpark was resolved and in 1982, the park was inaugurated. The Eschholzpark covers an area of 375,000 m2 and is built in a block structure, which is a characteristic feature of the St√ºhlinger. The most eye-catching element of the park is a huge sculpture which represents a water tap with a red garden hose. It was created by the winner of a competition, Claes Oldenburg, and is intended to remind of the removed community gardens. South of the meadow where the sculpture is located, there is a circular flower bed with a perennial garden, a pergola with wisteria and hedges. Both, the meadow and the circular flower bed, are surrounded by a chestnut-lined avenue. There is another meadow at the southern end of the park, which is spatially divided from the rest by a foot and cycle path. There, you can find a children's playground and a lawn for sunbathing and for other activities like slacklining. The park was also used for events from the outset although there have been public protests against it. Therefore, in 1984, the Zelt-Musik-Festival was a one-off event in the Eschholzpark. In the late 1990s, the park served as an alternative venue of the Theater Freiburg during the reconstruction phase of its primary location near Bertoldstra√üe. During the FIFA World Cups in 2006 and 2010, the park served as a public viewing area for up to 10,000 visitors. An analogue event during the UEFA European Championship in 2012 was cancelled by the organizer. Since 2005, the vocational school Friedrich-Weinbrenner- Gewerbeschule has used the Eschholzpark as the location for the European Stone Festival, which takes place every three years. = Joseph-Brandel-Anlage = Urban gardening in the Josef-Brandel-Anlage The Joseph-Brandel-Anlage is located in the Freiburg district of Haslach (close to the Guildfordallee) and is not very well known beyond Haslach's borders. Freiburg's lord mayor Joseph Brandel initiated the construction of the 43,500 m2 big Joseph-Brandel-Anlage which was completed in the late 1960s. A memorial stone in the shape of a glacial mill, found by a business man in the Rhine close to Bad S√§ckingen, was set up to remember the former lord mayor. The estate features some valuable exotic tree species and a garden of perennials with seating facilities as well as two playgrounds, including one water playground. Many different footpaths and cycle paths lead through the Park and connect it via bridge with St. Georgen (another Freiburg district). Diverse artworks made out of stone and metal can be found in the northern part of the estate. In 2006, they were created by students of the Vigeliusschool in cooperation with the sculpture workshop Kunstflug. = Konrad-Guenther-Park = Konrad-Guenther-Park with oak trees In 1934, the part of the M√∂slepark, which is situated north of the railway, was enlarged by an additional grove. This grove was later restructured into a natural reserve and, in 1954, named after the Freiburg zoologist Konrad Guenther. In 1996 countless old trees were cut down to make way for the construction of a new highway (‚ÄúB31 Ost‚Äù) against fierce resistance from Freiburg's population. Since accidentally too many trees were cut down, the regional council was forced to pay the city of Freiburg a fee of ‚Ç¨130,000. The money was used to finance the works in the M√∂slepark. Due to the construction of the highway the groundwater flows were disturbed, which resulted in the death of numerous trees. Even these dead trees are worth being preserved as they became a habitat for bats. Today the Konrad-Guenther-Park covers an area of 650,000 m2. At the verge of the park the private school Kapriole is located. = M√∂slepark with Waldsee = Waldsee with pavillon The M√∂slepark, created as a landscape park between 1879 and 1885 under the plans of urban gardener Maximilian Wilhelm Schm√∂ger, is one of the oldest parks in Freiburg. Initially, in 1877, two artificial ponds had been created south of the train tracks for the collection of ice by the brewery Neumeyer. (A former public house of the brewery can still be seen at the corner of Schwabentorring and Kart√§userstra√üe today.) The Society for Urban Beautification (Verein zur Versch√∂nerung der Stadt), founded in 1873, suggested the creation of the park shortly afterwards. The park owes its name to its abundance of water. The oldest well houses of the city spring can be found here. In 1881, a third pond was created, which merged with the first two, and created the lake Waldsee as we know it today. The Waldseerestaurant, which is situated on the western bank of the Waldsee, was founded in 1883 and features a terrace next to the lake. It is still a very popular vacation restaurant, as well as a place for local events. After the First World War, the extremely unkempt park, which covers an area of 11,000 m2 (i.e. eleven hectares), was thinned out and slightly remodeled. In 2015, the western part of the park was pruned, and in 2016 the eastern part will be as well, in order to restore the former variation of thick and light areas. In the summer the Waldsee is used for boating, and in the winter it is used for skating. Since 1960, a so-called Jugendverkehrsschule, an institution for children and young adults to learn about traffic, has been located south of the Waldseestra√üe. Since 1956, the Waldseestra√üe has been closed to traffic due to toad migration. Starting in the mid-1970s, protective fences for the toads have been regularly built. Furthermore, from 1973 to 1990, a yearly flea market took place in M√∂slepark. However, in order to preserve the nature it does not do so anymore. In the M√∂slepark up to 200 year old oak trees, hornbeams and big rhododendrons can be found. Moreover, it is an important habitat for bats, such as the noctule. The park is part of the nature preserve Lorettoberg-G√ºnterstal-Littenweiler. = Moosweiher Park = Moosweiher The eleven meter deep pond Moosweiher emerged from the removal of gravel that was necessary to build the A5 between 1960 and 1962. At the time, the district Landwasser, in which the Moosweiher is located today, had not arisen yet. In 1966, the local county named the quarry pond Moosweiher, and in 1968, it was recultivated by the municipal parks department, by applying paths with benches, sunbathing lawns and a playground. A restaurant, a minigolf facility, public toilets and sports facilities with a club house were added later. Today, the 153,000 m2 big park surrounding the Moosweiher is a close-to-nature landscape park with alder trees, oaks, ash trees, poplars and willows. Besides released red-eared and yellow-bellied sliders, the coypu is also a native resident. It is possible to bathe in the pond, and a half-pipe for skateboarders is located on the northern bank. Between 1987 and 2010, the Landwasser Triathlon used to take place there. = St√ºhlinger Church Square = The St√ºhlinger Church Square and the Herz-Jesu- Kirche The 180,000 m2 St√ºhlinger church square, which is located between Freiburg main station and the church Herz-Jesu-Kirche, was redesigned in 1985, after some parts of the area were repurposed in 1983 due to the building of the city train bridge (today called St√ºhlinger Br√ºcke). This space, however, was compensated by adding a different area to the church square. The geometrically designed park with a central lawn, in which Ralf Witthaus, an artist from Cologne, has tilled a pattern using a strimmer in 2011, is framed by a pergola in the east. The concrete sculpture ‚ÄúZwei Riesen. Einer spuckt. Einer schluckt.‚Äù (Two giants. One spits. One swallows.), created by Franz Gutmann, is located under the St√ºhlinger Br√ºcke. Between the two giants, the St√ºhlinger farmers‚Äô market is taking place every Wednesday and Saturday morning. Between 1894 and 1929, the church square was also the location of the trade fair of Freiburg. Since 1995, a nostalgic fair with old fairground rides takes place there once a year. In 2012, the final concert of the Freiburg parade of Basel Tattoo was held there, too. As this place, which is close to the city center, is also frequented by homeless or addicted people, an outreach program has been set up. Since 2008, two municipal social workers in their specially marked vehicles take care of these people two to three times per week. = Other parks = The following parks are described in further detail through the links. Therefore, only a brief description is provided here. * Since 1872, the Alte Friedhof (Old Graveyard), found in the district Neuburg, is used as a park. Its character as a graveyard does not retract from its natural and cultural uniqueness. *After several relocations, the Freiburg Botanic Garden is now located in the district Herdern near the botanical institute of the University of Freiburg. *The Colombipark is the central park of Freiburg. Both Colombipark and Colombischl√∂ssle were created on the area of a former bastion in 1860. *The Mundenhof with its municipal garden center and animal enclosures is in the western part of the city. The Mundenhof is Freiburg's smallest district and is located near the motorway. *The Schlossberg is a tree-covered hill located east of the historical city center. It offers various lookouts including a tower called Schlossbergturm and there are two restaurants. The top of the hill can be reached by foot or by the Schlossbergbahn which runs from the Stadtgarten (municipal garden) to the Burghaldering. There are still some vines on the southern slope of the Schlossberg. *The park Seepark, which is located in the western part of Freiburg, was built in 1986 in context of the Landesgartenschau (federal state gardening exhibition). Its construction was based on the extension of an already existing quarry pond. Offering several recreational facilities as well as a community center with restaurant and an observation tower, it is Freiburg's most visited park. *In 1888 the park Stadtgarten, in the north of Freiburg's historical city center, was completely finished and can today be accessed via the footbridge named Karlssteg. Although heavily damaged in 1944, the Stadtgarten features not only old trees and lawn areas but also beds of perennial and ever-changing array of flowers, a rose garden, two water basins, a music pavilion, a playground and a kiosk. An incline elevator and the footbridge named Mozartsteg connect the park with the Schlossberg. *Nearby Arlesheimer See, an artificial lake, and the forest surrounding it, are a designated nature reserve.

While on the run from the law, Christiansen married Rose Morgan. For a while he operated a cattle ranch in Washington's Big Bend Country. Later he operated a ranch on Diamond Mountain in Uintah County, Utah using the registered brand of Quarter Circle Bar Quarter Circle, commonly called the Horse Bit brand. Early life Christiansen was the ninth child of Christen Christiansen and Christina Bruhn (Bruun), Danish converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who came to Utah in 1853. Born in Ephraim, Sanpete County, Utah, he was raised in Levan, Juab County, Utah where his father was a local church leader. When he was fourteen years old, he got into a fight with another young man named Hendrickson at a town dance, fighting over a girl. During the fight, he clubbed Hendrickson unconscious with a fence picket. Thinking that he had killed the young man, Christiansen ran away from home. He joined a crew of cowboys trailing a herd of horses into the Uintah Basin of northeastern Utah. There he soon joined up with cattle rustlers working out of Brown's Hole, earning the name of the \\"Mormon Kid.\\" GunfightsIn 1896, Christiansen killed a Mexican man on Diamond Mountain Utah near the Green River. He was sentenced to five years in Utah State Prison. *In 1892, Christiansen, Bill McCarthy and Tom McCarthy robbed a bank in Roslyn, Washington. When some bystanders attempted to stop them, two men were shot and wounded. *Later in 1892 Christiansen was jailed in Ellensburg, Washington for the bank robbery in Roslyn. He and his cellmate George McCarthy broke out two days before his trial. He shot and wounded one person. Christiansen was later exonerated of all charges. *In 1897, in the Uinta Mountains of Northern Utah, Christiansen was involved in a gunfight where two men were killed. He was later convicted of manslaughter for this incident. Later life Soon after Christiansen's release from prison, his wife died. He remarried and settled in Carbon County, Utah. He ran for public office under his real name, Willard Erastus Christiansen, and lost. He then officially changed his name to Matt Warner, the name most people knew him by. Christiansen was elected justice of the peace and then served as a deputy sheriff. In later years, Christiansen worked as a night guard and detective in Price, Utah.

Originally it operated from premises in Seafield Road, it later moved to Elliott Road. History The original site selected at 19 Seafield Road had previously been operated by the Misses Niven as a school in the late 19th century. The hospital was opened in May 1897 at premises in 19 Seafield Road and was also known as Dundee Private Hospital for Women. It had grown out of an earlier dispensary for women and children, which had been formed earlier in the decade to offer women treatment by female doctors. The hospital aimed to provide surgical care at a low cost. Its founders included the Dundee social reformer Mary Lily Walker and the city's first two female doctors Alice Moorhead (the sister of the artist and suffragette Ethel Moorhead) and Emily Thomson. In 1900, its management committee of included Miss Walker and Professor D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, while Drs Moorhead and Thomson were its medical officers. In 1915, due to the financial generosity of the Sharp family of Hill of Tarvit, it moved to premises in Elliot Road designed by James Findlay, initially with fourteen beds. It became part of the National Health Service in 1948, despite an attempt to stay private, latterly serving as an annex to Dundee Royal Infirmary. It closed around 1975. Legacy The remaining archives of the hospital are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee. The site in Elliot Road was later converted into apartments.

Because it is not a fighting arm (non-combatant), under the Geneva Conventions, members of the corps may only use their weapons for self-defence. Insignia The corps has its own insignia, designed by George Sigerson and TJ McKinney around various symbols of medicine and healing from Irish mythology. Its badge displays the words \\"√ìglaigh na h√âireann\\" (the name of the Defence Forces in Irish) on a scroll at the top. At the bottom is another scroll with the corps' motto, \\"Comraind Legis\\". This Middle Irish phrase is a quotation from the T√°in B√≥ Cuailgne, and is equivalent to modern Irish \\"comhroinn leighis\\"; it translates as \\"equal division of healing\\", referring to the impartial treatment of the wounded that the main characters of the T√°in gave to each other in nocturnal truces between battles. In the centre is a silver hand, referring to Nuada Airgetl√°m, the mythological chieftain of the Tuatha D√© Danann who lost his hand in battle and had an artificial silver hand made to replace it, designed by Dian Cecht, the god of healing. The scrolls are joined on each side by a staff about which a serpent is entwined. These do not represent the rod of Aesculapius (the Graeco-Roman mythological symbol of medicine), but rather the staff of Moses. They refer to the legend that the ancestor of the Gaels, Go√≠del Glas, and his people encountered the Israelites in the desert while the Israelites were suffering a plague of vipers. Go√≠del Glas was bitten by a viper, and Moses used his staff to cure him.

Founding and concept The founder and central figure of The Sanctuary community was Vera Pragnell (1897-1968), the daughter of a textile manufacturer. Using her inheritance, she purchased 50 acres of land at Heath Common and proceeded to give away plots of land free of charge to anyone who was willing to settle there. She lived in a house she named Sanctuary Cottage, part of which was kept open for any passing stranger who needed shelter or refreshment... Vera Pragnell was inspired both by Christianity (in particular William E. Orchard and the Fellowship of Reconciliation) as well as the principles of pioneering socialist Edward Carpenter. She imposed no conditions or rules on prospective settlers and insisted that The Sanctuary was open to everyone. Initially, all who came to live there were given a half-acre plot on which they would park a caravan or build a simple house. Eventually communal facilities were created such as a shop, a school and a building used for theatre and dancing. Lacking a single political or spiritual focus, The Sanctuary attracted a wide range of individuals as residents or visitors, often with unorthodox and radical views. These included pagans such as the occultist, poet and publisher Victor Neuburg and Dion Byngham, ex-leading light of the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry. Other residents included anarchist W. C. Owen as well as Communist Party members. Artists were also attracted to the community, such as the landscape artist William Heaton Cooper and the Shakespearean actor Wilfred Walter. A number of the residents and visitors were friends and associates of Edward Carpenter, who was a supporter and inspiration to the community. In 1928, Vera Pragnell published her book \\"The Story of the Sanctuary\\" and dedicated it to the \\"splendid pioneer\\" Edward Carpenter with a poem by Victor Neuburg praising Carpenter as \\"our Youth's doyen\\". Vera had a personal connection with Carpenter, as in 1927 she had married the painter Dennis Earle, who had previously been known as Ted Earle when he was Carpenter's lover Decline The unconventional lifestyles of some members of the community began to generate scandal in the popular press, with stories featuring nudism and 'free love' and allegations that they encouraged a girl to run away from home and live at the Sanctuary By the early 1930s, Vera Pragnell's original inspiration had been lost amid disputes and disillusionment. Sanctuary residents began to register formal ownership of their own properties and from 1934 onwards the area was developed by Earle as a residential estate known as Longbury Hill. During World War II, the Kenyan independence leader Jomo Kenyatta lived in the area whilst working on a local farm. Communist Party youth camps continued to be held there until the 1960s. Legacy Today, the history of the area is remembered in the street names Vera's Walk and Sanctuary Lane and the houses known as Sanctuary Cottages. A memorial shelter remains, erected and decorated by Dennis Earle, containing boards telling the story of The Sanctuary. The area known as The Sanctuary was located in the parish of Washington, West Sussex (not Storrington). Vera Pragnell and Dennis Earle are buried in the graveyard at Washington Parish Church. A play entitled Sanctuary, featuring Vera Pragnell and Victor Neuburg, written by Chris Green, was presented at the 2012 Brighton Fringe Festival.

Working at various times on the WQAM programming schedule, Goldberg is perhaps best known for hosting a show from 2pm to 6pm weekdays, having long-time Miami radio host Neil Rogers as a lead-in. Goldberg would also serve as the morning-drive host (6am to 10am) for a short time after Howard Stern left terrestrial radio and was therefore no longer on WQAM.

He was bishop of Turin from 1011 until his death in 1037. Life According to Peter Damian, Landulf was an imperial chaplain, before Henry II appointed him bishop of Turin.Peter Damian, Vita sancti Odilonis, in J-P. Migne, ed., Patrologiae Cursus Completus. Series Latina, vol. 144, col. 934. One of Landulf's first acts as bishop of Turin was to confirm, and increase, the donations of his predecessor, Bishop Gezo of Turin, to the episcopal monastery of San Solutore in Turin.F. Cognasso, ed., Cartario della abazia di San Solutore di Torino (Pinerolo, 1908), no. 3 (1011), pp. 7-10. In January 1015, Landulf was in Rome, where he witnessed Pope Benedict VIII‚Äôs confirmation of the Abbey of Fruttuaria‚Äôs ‚Äòapostolic liberty‚Äô.H. Zimmerman, ed., Papsturkunden 896-1046, 2 vols. (Vienna, 1984-1985), II, no. 495 (1015), pp. 936-938. In 1017 Landulf made a donation to the episcopal convent of San Pietro in Turin.G. Colombo and A. Leone, eds., Documenti di Scarnafigi (Pinerolo, 1906)., no. 2 (1017), pp. 236-237. In 1022, Landulf was present at the synod of Pavia, presided over by Benedict VIII and Henry II.MGH, Constitutiones et acta publica imperatorum et regum (Hannover, 1893), I, no. 34 (1 August 1022), pp. 70-78, accessible online at: http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000800.html?pageNo=70&sortIndex;=020%3A050%3A0001%3A010%3A00%3A00 Around 1028 Landulf worked with Ulric Manfred II of Turin, Bishop Alric of Asti, and Archbishop Aribert of Milan to combat heresy at Monforte.Landulf Senior of Milan, Mediolanensis historiae libri quatuor, MGH SS 8, II.27, 65f.; Rudolf Glaber, Historiarum, Rudolf Glaber, Historiarum libri quinque, IV.2, in H. France, ed., Rodulfus Glaber, Opera (Oxford, 1989), p. 67. Because the diocese of Turin had been devastated \\"not only by pagans, but also by perfidious Christians\\" (non solum a paganis verum etiam a perfidis christianis), Landulf pursued a policy of reconstruction during his episcopate. He restored the cathedral church of Turin, and built new churches and fortifications in Chieri, Testona, Rivalba, Piobesi, Piasco, Mathi, Mocoriadum and Tizanum.G.

He is currently hosting the morning show on WOR-AM along with Michael Riedel.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/91674/todd-schnitt-len-berman- take-mornings-at-wor/ Todd Schnitt Len Berman Take Mornings at WOR Berman is widely known for his television career with NBC, specifically his work for the network's flagship station WNBC-TV. Berman spent 27 years as the lead sports anchor for WNBC and also worked for NBC Sports covering Major League Baseball and the National Football League. He was employed by WNBC until 2009, and prior to that he worked for WCBS-TV in New York City from April 1979 through August 1982 and WBZ-TV in Boston, where he announced Boston Celtics games on TV with Celtics legend Bob Cousy. He also worked at HBO Sports covering boxing, college basketball and a weekly baseball show \\"Race for the Pennant\\" from 1978-1981. Early life Despite having a very neutral viewpoint when reporting the sports in New York, he grew up an avid New York Yankees fan. He is also partial to Big East basketball, having graduated from Syracuse University and serving as an adviser to that school and to St. John's University. Berman's Big East connections also include several years of calling the conference's basketball games for ESPN and in syndication for the Big East Network. Career At the end of WNBC's 11 p.m. newscast on Wednesday April 22, 2009, following taped messages of good-bye and good luck from Matt Lauer, Al Roker, and Brian Williams, Berman announced that it was his last sportscast. He was given a cake with best wishes from his colleagues, including Chuck Scarborough and Sue Simmons. On March 1, 2012, Berman hosted a segment on the 10 o'clock news evening sports report on WNYW‚ÄîFox 5‚Äîin New York City. He presented his top-5 most interesting sports stories of the week prior. Starting in March 2015, Berman has co-hosted a morning radio program from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00am on WOR-AM, the flagship news-talk station for iHeart Radio. Originally, it was \\"Len and Todd in the Morning\\"; on October 20, 2017, Berman announced that his broadcast partner on the show, Todd Schnitt, was no longer working at the station, due to not coming to terms on a contract. The show is now called \\"Len Berman and Michael Riedel in the Morning.\\" =Spanning the World= One popular monthly feature Berman is responsible for is Spanning the World, which aired on WNBC-TV's newscasts and The Today Show. Spanning is a reel of odd and interesting sports highlights from the past month, with a recorded introduction and closing by Don Pardo. When the segment begins, the world is torn in two and the sound of a rooster crowing is played. When the segment ends, the world goes back to its \\"pre-torn\\" state, with the same rooster sound, and announcer Don Pardo says \\"Tune in next time for Spanning the World, if there is a next time.

In the game, up to four players control the titular Ninja Turtles, fighting through various levels to defeat the turtles' enemies, including the Shredder, Krang and the Foot Clan. Released during a high point in popularity for the Ninja Turtles franchise, the arcade game was well received and versions for various home systems soon followed, including the Nintendo Entertainment System. A sequel, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time, was released in 1991. Gameplay The player chooses from one of the four Ninja Turtles: Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael. Depending on the version of the game, the characters are either chosen via an in-game select screen or based on which coin slot the player placed their credit into. After Shredder kidnaps the Turtles' friend April O'Neil and their mentor Splinter, they must give chase, save their comrades, and defeat the evil Shredder. Up to four players (two in some versions) can take control of any of the Turtles. Donatello has slower attacks but a longer range, Michelangelo and Raphael have faster attacks but a shorter range, and Leonardo is a well-rounded Turtle with average range and speed. The eight-way joystick controls the movements of the Turtle, the jump button makes them jump and the attack button makes them hit in front of them using their weapon. The Turtles can also perform special moves, including throwing Foot soldiers overhead and performing a special attack by pressing the jump and attack buttons; Raphael rolls along the ground and finishes with a kick, while the other Turtles do a sweeping jump attack with their weapons. The Turtles can also spring off the wall in certain areas. Enemies can be defeated more quickly by slamming them into walls or solid objects. Many objects such as traffic cones, parking meters, fire hydrants and exploding oil drums can be hit or damaged with attacks in order to help defeat nearby enemies. In the attract mode, the game shows the first part of the cartoon opening, along with a portion of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme song. Most of the enemies the Turtles face are the Foot Soldiers, all color-coded to indicate their attack patterns and weapon of choices. Some enemies, such as the standard purple-clad Foot Soldiers and Roadkill Rodney robots, have the ability to restrain the Turtles' mobility and drain their health, leaving the player open to attack for other enemies. The bosses in the game include Rocksteady and Bebop (individually at first in that order, and later the two of them together), Baxter Stockman, Granitor, General Traag, Krang, and Shredder himself. Release A printed circuit board of the game. The arcade game was distributed as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in North America and Oceania, Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles in Europe and in Japan. The game was released primarily as a dedicated four-player cabinet in all regions except Japan, where it was sold as a 2-player conversion kit. 2-player conversion kits of the game were released in other regions, serving as less expensive alternatives to 4-player cabinets. Home versions =Ports to home systems= Cover artwork of the NES version, which was retitled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game. The game was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990. This conversion was titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Arcade Game in order to avoid confusion with the previous NES game based on the franchise. The Japanese Famicom version was titled Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, without a number nor a subtitle, due to the fact that first NES game was localized in Japan under a different title. The NES version features two additional levels and bosses, one of which is a snowy Central Park where players fight an alien bounty hunter named \\"Tora\\" This version includes two new levels (the first part of Scene 3 and all of Scene 6), which feature new enemy characters, including two new bosses created specifically for the NES port: Tora (a dog-like \\"blizzard beast\\") and Shogun (a robotic samurai). Most of the original stages from the arcade version were extended as well and the second half of Scene 3, the parking garage stage, replaces the arcade version's end battle with Bebop and Rocksteady with a battle against the mutated fly form of Baxter Stockman. The NES port appeared in Nintendo's PlayChoice-10 arcade system. This version of the game was once slated for release on the Wii Virtual Console, but was canceled. The NES version featured notable product placement advertising: Pizza Hut logos. The rear cover of the instruction manual provided a coupon for the restaurant, with an expiration date of December 31, 1991. Computer ports of the arcade game were released by Image Works and ported by Probe Software in 1991 for the ZX Spectrum, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, PC and Commodore 64. The title was changed to Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: The Coin Op in the European versions, reflecting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)#International of the 1987 TV series in certain regions at the time. =Emulated releases= An emulated version of the arcade game is included as a hidden bonus game in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, but with altered music and most of the voice clips edited out. The game is unlocked by finding an antique in Stage 9-1; the antique turns out to be the original arcade machine. An Xbox Live Arcade version of the game was released under the name TMNT 1989 Classic Arcade on March 14, 2007, published by Ubisoft and ported by Digital Eclipse. The game was priced at 400 Microsoft Points. Like other classic arcade games on the Xbox 360 platform, portions of the original arcade game were emulated with network code and other new features added. Players could earn achievements as well as play 2-4 player co-op (both online and offline). Unlike the unlockable in Battle Nexus, this rerelease retains the music and voices of the 1989 arcade game. This version was delisted in June 2011 and is no longer available for purchase. In 2019, the game was rereleased as a replica arcade cabinet for home use by manufacturer Arcade1up.https://ign.com/articles/2019/12/16/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle- arcade1up-cabinet-review The reissue is nearly identical to the original, however there are a few changes; the opening is performed by a different artist, players do not need to insert quarters to play, and Konami's name on the arcade marquee is replaced by Nickelodeon's. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on their September 1, 1990 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the Famicom (NES) version of the game a 26 out of 40 score. British gaming magazine The One reviewed the home computer versions (Amiga, Atari ST, DOS) of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles under the British title, Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles, calling it \\"a pretty poor interpretation of a pretty poor yet popular subject. Every one of the levels is too easy to guarantee more than a week's interest, particularly because the opponents' intelligence is so predictable and your own moves so limited.\\" The One criticises Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles scrolling, stating that the \\"Music and sound effects are jolly enough, but the cartoon-style graphics are let down by slow and jerky scrolling.\\" The One concludes by stating that the game \\"lacks depth and imagination\\". Zzap! reported on the game after it appeared at Amusement Trades Exhibition International, calling it a \\"great coin-op which is best in four player mode.\\"\\"ATEI Show Report.\\" ZZAP! March 1990. p.39. Time's Jared Newman named to his list of \\"14 Important Arcade Games Not Available for iPhone or iPad\\", citing the game's pioneering 4-player simultaneous play. GamesRadar ranked it the 25th best NES game made. The staff attributed the Ninja Turtles' continued success to the game and praised its visuals, audio, and combat system.

Graham also designed the original costumes. The piece premiered on February 2, 1931 at the Craig Theatre in New York City. From the first performance, critics hailed the ballet as a masterpiece and acknowledged Graham's rising role as a major force in American dance.Martha Graham Company Repertory, Martha Graham Dance Company http://marthagraham.org/press- presenters2/repertory/  Theme and structure  The stark, minimalistic piece is staged for a female soloist, garbed in white, and an ensemble of sixteen female dancers, dressed in blue. The title and theme reference religious rituals as performed by Native Americans of the Southwest U.S. Graham began work on the ballet shortly after she and Horst returned from a trip to New Mexico, her imagination sparked by ceremonial dances of the native peoples.Deborah Jowitt, Time and the Dancing Image, University of California Press, 1989, p. 182 The dance is divided into three sections: Hymn to the Virgin, Crucifixus and Hosannah. In the original staging, Graham danced the role of The Virgin with the other cast members as celebrants.Walter Terry, The Dance, The New York Herald Tribune, March 7, 1947 http://memory.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200153684/enlarge.html?page=1&section;=&size;=1024&from;=pageturner *Hymn to the Virgin - In this scene, the soloist blesses the group of women surrounding her.

At one point, the ensemble places outstretched hands around the lead dancer's head in rays suggesting a halo. *Crucifixus - This section takes its visual cues from the image of the crucified Christ. The soloist expresses her suffering by repeatedly cupping her hands to her face. The ensemble reflects the motion as they cup hands at hip level. *Hosannah - In this scene, all of the dancers move in joyful celebration. One chorus member breaks from the group to form a succession of tableaus with the soloist. The pair's postures evoke imagery from Christianity, as well as other religions. In each section, the Virgin enters and leaves the stage with the women in blue. Each section ends with the chorus encircling the Mary figure.

We have a project composed of several \\"jobs\\" (tasks). There are several workers. Each worker can do any job, but for each worker it takes a different amount of time to complete each job. Our goal is to allocate jobs to workers such that the total makespan of the project is minimized. In the standard job shop scheduling problem, the timings of all workers are known, so we have a standard optimization problem. In contrast, in the truthful job scheduling problem, the timings of the workers are not known. We ask each worker how much time he needs to do each job, but, the workers might lie to us. Therefore, we have to give the workers an incentive to tell us their true timings by paying them a certain amount of money. The challenge is to design a payment mechanism which is incentive compatible. The truthful job scheduling problem was introduced by Nisan and Ronen in their 1999 paper on algorithmic mechanism design.  Definitions  There are n jobs and m workers (\\"m\\" stands for \\"machine\\", since the problem comes from scheduling jobs to computers). Worker i can do job j in time T_{i,j}. If worker i is assigned a set of jobs J_i, then he can execute them in time: :T_i(J_i) = \\\\sum_{j\\\\in J_i} t_{i,j} Given an allocation J_1,\\\\dots,J_m of jobs to workers, The makespan of a project is: :MakeSpan(J_1,\\\\dots,J_n) = \\\\max_{i} {T_i(J_i)} An optimal allocation is an allocation of jobs to workers in which the makespan is minimized. The minimum makespan is denoted by MinMakeSpan. A mechanism is a function that takes as input the matrix T (the time each worker needs to do each job) and returns as output: * An allocation of jobs to workers, J_1,\\\\dots,J_n; * A payment to each worker, p_1,\\\\dots,p_n. The utility of worker i, under such mechanism, is: :u_i = p_i - T_i(J_i) I.e, the agent gains the payment, but loses the time that it spends in executing the tasks. Note that payment and time are measured in the same units (e.g., we can assume that the payments are in dollars and that each time-unit costs the worker one dollar). A mechanism is called truthful (or incentive compatible) if every worker can attain a maximum utility by reporting his true timing vector (i.e., no worker has an incentive to lie about his timings). The approximation factor of a mechanism is the largest ratio between Makespan and MinMakespan (smaller is better; an approximation factor of 1 means that the mechanism is optimal). The research on truthful job scheduling aims to find upper (positive) and lower (negative) bounds on approximation factors of truthful mechanisms.  Positive bound ‚Äì m ‚Äì VCG mechanism  The first solution that comes to mind is VCG mechanism, which is a generic truthful mechanism. A VCG mechanism can be used to minimize the sum of costs. Here, we can use VCG to find an allocation which minimizes the \\"make-total\\", defined as: :MakeTotal(J_1,\\\\dots,J_n) = \\\\sum_{i} {T_i(J_i)} Here, minimizing the sum can be done by simply allocating each job to the worker who needs the shortest time for that job. To keep the mechanism truthful, each worker that accepts a job is paid the second-shortest time for that job (like in a Vickrey auction). Let OPT be an allocation which minimizes the makespan. Then: :MakeSpan[VCG] \\\\leq MakeTotal[VCG] \\\\leq MakeTotal[OPT] \\\\leq m\\\\cdot MakeSpan[OPT] (where the last inequality follows from the pigeonhole principle). Hence, the approximation factor of the VCG solution is at most m ‚Äì the number of workers. The following example shows that the approximation factor of the VCG solution can indeed be exactly m. Suppose there are n=m jobs and the timings of the workers are as follows: * Worker 1 can do every job in time 1. * The other workers can do every job in time 1+\\\\epsilon, where \\\\epsilon>0 is a small constant. Then, the VCG mechanism allocates all tasks to worker 1. Both the \\"make-total\\" and the makespan are n=m. But, when each job is assigned to a different worker, the makespan is 1+\\\\epsilon. An approximation factor of m is not very good, and many researchers have tried to improve it over the following years. On the other hand, there are some impossibility results that prove that the approximation factor cannot be too small.  Negative bound ‚Äì 2  The approximation factor of every truthful deterministic mechanism is at least 2. The proof is typical of lower bounds in mechanism design. We check specific scenarios (in our case, specific timings of the workers). By truthfulness, when a single worker changes his declaration, he must not be able to gain from it. This induces some constraints on the allocations returned by the mechanism in the different scenarios. In the following proof sketch, for simplicity we assume that there are 2 workers and that the number of jobs is even, n = 2k. We consider the following scenarios: # The timings of both workers to all jobs are 1. Since the mechanism is deterministic, it must return a unique allocation J_1,J_2. Suppose, without loss of generality, that J_1 \\\\leq J_2 (worker 1 is assigned at most as many jobs as worker 2). # The timings of worker 1 to the jobs in J_1 are \\\\epsilon (a very small positive constant); the timings of worker 1 to the jobs in J_2 are 1+\\\\epsilon; and the timings of worker 2 to all jobs is still 1. Worker 1 knows that, if he lies and says that his timings to all jobs are 1, the (deterministic) mechanism will allocate him the jobs in J_1 and his cost will be very near 0. In order to remain truthful, the mechanism must do the same here, so that worker 1 does not gain from lying. However, the makespan can be made half as large by dividing the jobs in J_2 equally between the agents. Hence, the approximation factor of the mechanism must be at least 2.

As a two-year-old in 2009, when trained by Clive Brittain, she was beaten in her first three races before winning the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse. In the following year she entered the Godolphin stable and recorded further major victories in the Ribblesdale Stakes in England and the Yellow Ribbon Stakes in California. As a four-year-old she was based in the United States and won the Sheepshead Bay Stakes at Belmont Park. Background Hibaayeb is a dark bay mare with a small white star bred in the United Kingdom by Rabbah Bloodstock Limited. She was sired by Singspiel, an international campaigner whose wins included the Canadian International Stakes, Japan Cup, Dubai World Cup, Coronation Cup, and International Stakes. The best of his other progeny include Moon Ballad, Solow and Dar Re Mi. Hibaayeb's dam Lady Zonda showed moderate ability as a racehorse, winning two minor races from twelve starts as a three-year-old in 2002. She was a great- granddaughter of Oh So Fair, an influential broodmare whose other descendants have included Oh So Sharp, Shantou, Collier Hill, Roussalka and Ameerat. The filly was owned in the early part of her racing career by Mohammed Al Nabouda and was initially sent into training with Clive Brittain at Carlburg Stables in Newmarket. Racing career =2009: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut, Hibaayeb started a 16/1 outsider for a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 8 August and finished third behind Eolith and Pollenator. Two weeks later she started second favourite for a similar event at Folkestone Racecourse and was ridden as on her debut by Philip Robinson. She took the lead inside the final furlong but was caught in the final strides and beaten a neck by the Henry Cecil-trained Creese. Despite being beaten in her first two races the filly was stepped up in class and distance for the Group Two May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse on 11 September and started the 40/1 outsider of the seven runners. Ridden for the first time by Neil Callan she stayed on strongly in the closing stages and finished second, half a length behind Pollenator and a length in front of the odds-on favourite Seta. Callan was again in the saddle fifteen days later when the filly was moved up in class again for the Group One Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse. The Sweet Solera Stakes winner Long Lashes started favourite ahead of the Aidan O'Brien-trained You'll Be Mine and the Star Stakes winner Mudaaraah with Hibaayeb next in the betting on 8/1 alongside the Prestige Stakes winner Sent From Heaven. The other four runners were Lady Darshaan (third in the Cherry Hinton Stakes), Chantilly Creme, winner of the Listed Criterium du Bequet in France and the maiden winners Blue Angel and Dyna Waltz. Callan tracked the leaders before squeezing the filly through a gap on the inside rail to take the lead inside the final furlong. In a rough finish, Hibaayeb hung to the left in the closing stages before prevailing by three quarters of a length from Lady Darshaan with You'll Be Mine a length and a half away in third place. After a stewards' inquiry, the result was allowed to stand, despite the fact that Callan had accidentally struck the runner-up across the face with his whip. Callan commented \\"I was always pretty confident. I got a lovely run, she stretched away and quickened away like she was going to win by a couple of lengths, but she's pricked her ears. She's just come off a line a little bit but I've done everything I could\\". Brittain said \\"Not many people try to win a group I with a maiden, but in my eyes she had already run two races that she could have won... She is progressing, which is the most important thing, but I don't want to gallop her into the ground. She has got a future and could go to America. I will have to talk to the owners, but it will depend on the filly; it is easier listening to animals as they tell you more than people\\". At the end of the year, Hibaayeb was taken into the ownership of Godolphin and transferred to the stable of Saeed bin Suroor. =2010: three-year-old season= In 2010, Hibaayeb was ridden in seven of her eight races by Frankie Dettori. On her first appearance of the season the filly contested the 197th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 2 May and started at odds of 12/1. After racing down the centre of the wide course she weakened and was eased down by Dettori to finish sixteenth of the seventeen runners. She was then sent to France and moved up in distance for the Group One Prix Saint-Alary over 2000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 23 May. She led for most of the way but was overtaken in the straight and finished third behind Sarafina and Deluxe. On 17 June the filly was again moved up in distance for the Group Two Ribblesdale Stakes over one and a half miles at Royal Ascot and started 4/1 joint-favourite alongside Principal Role, a filly who had won the Fillies' Trial Stakes in May. Her connections had opted to bypass The Oaks, feeling that the filly would benefit from a longer break between races. The best fancied of the other nine runners were Gertrude Bell (Cheshire Oaks) and Middle Club (Prix d'Aumale). Dettori settled the filly in the middle of the field as the outsider Acquainted set the pace, before switching to the outside approaching the final turn. Hibaayeb took the lead in the last quarter mile drew clear of her opponents and won by three and three quarter lengths from the Michael Stoute-trained Eldalil with the outsider Gallic Star three quarter lengths away in third. Dettori said that the filly \\"relished the extra trip and everything was perfect\\". A month after her win at Ascot, Hibaayeb was sent to Ireland to contest the Irish Oaks at the Curragh. She was reported as being \\"in the form of her life\\" in the build-up to the race and started the 100/30 favourite but made no impact and finished last of the fifteen runners behind Snow Fairy. Her next two races saw little improvement as she finished fourth when favourite for the Preis der Diana in Germany and seventh of eight behind Midday in the Yorkshire Oaks on 19 August. The filly was then sent to the United States to contest the Grade I Yellow Ribbon Stakes over one and a quarter miles at Hollywood Park Racetrack on 2 October in which she was ridden by Rafael Bejarano. Her opponents included the South African mare Gypsy's Warning, the Beverly Hills Handicap winner Turning Top and the Osunitas Stakes winner Lilly Fa Pootz. Hibaayed recovered from a slow start to move up into third place behind Gypsy's Warning but was forced to the wide outside approaching the final turn. She finished strongly to take the lead 150 yards from the finish and won by a length from Turning Top. Bejarano commented \\"At the three-eighths I knew I had a lot of horse and I just let her go. It was a perfect trip and I had a lot of confidence\\". On her final appearance of the year, Hibaayeb started a 25/1 outsider for the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Churchill Downs and finished eighth of the eleven runners behind Shared Account. =2011: four-year-old season= Hibaayeb remained in the United States for the 2011 season and was ridden in all three of her races by John R. Velazquez. After finishing third in an allowance race at Gulfstream Park in April she was moved up in class for the Grade II Sheepshead Bay Stakes over eleven furlongs at Belmont Park on 28 May. Starting the 1.95/1 favourite against five opponents she won by a length and a neck from Giant's Play and Cheetah. Her assistant trainer Rick Mettee said \\"It's one of the races where she pulled the ultimate perfect trip\\", assistant trainer said. \\"Once she got up the inside, as slow as they were going, it was going to be hard to outfinish her off those fractions... It was a pretty straightforward race\\". Four weeks later the filly started favourite for the New York Stakes over ten furlongs at the same track but finished third of the six runners behind Giant's Play and Zagora. Breeding record Hibaayeb was retired from racing to become a broodmare. To date she has produced one named foal: *Lacey's Lane, a bay filly, foaled in 2013, sired by Street Cry *Wuheida, chestnut filly, 2014, by Dubawi. Won Prix Marcel Boussac, Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf. PedigreeHibaayeb was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

Delivered in November 2015,Cox, Martin. Benjamin Franklin gets Hollywood Welcome,Maritime Matters, December 27, 2015 she is named after Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. She is one of the largest container cargo vessels, capable of carrying 18,000 TEU. Routes The December 26, 2015 arrival at the Port of Los Angeles marked the first time a ship of this size had been used in North America - previous routes for a ship this large were only from Asia to Northern Europe. Benjamin Franklin is about a third larger than the biggest container ships that typically visit the deep water ports of southern California.CBC News Benjamin Franklin's L.A. arrival makes her the biggest ship to come to North America, December 28, 2015 After departing Long Beach, she traveled north along the West Coast of the United States, arriving at the Port of Oakland near San Francisco on December 31, and at the Port of Seattle on February 29, 2016. The U.S. tour was short- lived, however, as CMA CGM postponed deployment of megaships to the West Coast in May 2016, citing a lack of demand. In regard to U.S. port infrastructure, Marc Bourdon, president of CMA CGM American operations, states that while some ports are ready, most ports would have difficulty with such a large ship, and that ports would need to be modified before permanent large-scale implementation could commence. One such necessary modification is for the terminal cranes to be able to reach containers stacked to the full capacity of 10 high.  Engine  The Benjamin Franklin is propelled by a MAN B&W; 11S90ME-C9.2, a low speed, two-stroke diesel engine. The MAN B&W; 11S90ME-C9.2 was designed in house by MAN B&W; with the goals of the lowest possible operational costs and fuel consumption at any load and any prevailing condition. MAN B&W; ME engines have design and performance characteristics in order to comply with International Maritime Organization Tier II emission regulations. =Concept of engine control system= This engine has electronic hydraulic activation in order to increase flexibility with regard to fuel injection and exhaust valve activation. These two factors are adjusted in order to match operating conditions that a ship may be under. This electronic control of the start to finish of the combustion process is known as the Engine Control System. Fuel injection controls the speed in which the engine will be operating at, while the exhaust valves control the exit of combustion gases from the cylinder. The actuators for fuel injection and the exhaust valves are electronically controlled by the Engine Control System. For fuel injection, a plunger powered by a hydraulic piston is started with oil pressure. Oil pressure is regulated by a valve that is electronically controlled through the Engine Control System. Exhaust valves are opened by a two-stage exhaust valve actuator which is activated by oil delivered from an electronically controlled valve. By controlling these valves electronically, the combustion process is fully controlled by the Engine Control System. =Intake and exhaust air= Cylinder The frame of the cylinder is cast and fitted with access covers for the routine cleaning of the scavenge ports on the cylinder liner, a unique characteristic of two-stroke engines. The cylinder liner is produced with alloyed cast iron and contains scavenge ports as well as drilled holes for lubrication. Scavenge air system Air intake takes directly from the engine room to the turbocharger fitted to the engines. From the turbocharger, air is sent to be cooled through a sea water cooler then stored in a scavenge air receiver. This air is then sent to the scavenge ports on the cylinder liners. Exhaust gas system Exhaust from the exhaust valves are sent to a receiver to equalize the different pressures produced from each cylinder. The exhaust gases are then sent through turbochargers. Environmental initiatives The CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin was designed to meet CMA CGM's goals of a sustainable policy that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of biodiversity. CMA CGM was able to improve its Carbon dioxide emissions by 50% since 2005. =Limited greenhouse gas emissions=Through the electronically controlled fuel injection with the MAN B&W;'s Engine Control System, the consumption of fuel has been reduced by 3% and oil by 25% on average. *At low loads, the main engine utilizes an exhaust by-pass system that improves energy efficiency through slow-steaming. When used at slow speeds, fuel consumption is reduced by an average of 1.5% *Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs hydrodynamics, or water flow, is improved with the addition of a bulbous shape on the rudder. This variation of the rudder, known as a twisting leading edge rudder, optimizes energy performance by 4%. =Biodiversity preservation=Ballast water onboard the CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin is treated directly when pumped on board and again during ballast operations. The ballast water is filtered and passed under UV lamps in order to detect any living organisms. These living organisms are then killed in order to prevent these species from invading natural habitats. There are no chemical products ejected back into the sea with the Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs ballast system. *For additional treatment of bilge, grey water, and engine water, the Benjamin Franklin is fitted with an additional decanting tank. This decanting tank is able to separate water from undesirable liquids, by letting all of the liquids settle. The waste products in the liquids are then removed and the remaining liquid is sent for further filtering. *The Benjamin Franklin is fitted with CMA CGM's Fast Oil Recovery System, which is used to manage pollution on board the vessel. Issues of vessel size =Vessel size transformation= The initial deployment of large container ships was seen in the Asia-Europe trade. In the second half of 2010, the vessels in service with Maersk Line's Asia-Europe trade were 8,500 TEU. By 2013, the vessels in service for the Maersk Line's Asia-Europe trade increased to 18,000 TEU vessels. Until the CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin berthed in the Port of Los Angeles in late 2015, nearly all of the world's largest container ship (18,000+ TEU) were deployed in the Asia-Europe trade. However, 10,000+ TEU vessels represent only 10% of the total global fleet. In comparison, Maersk's Asia-Pacific trade vessels increased from 8,600 TEU to 9,400 TEU in August 2013. =U.S. ports= The average vessel size for U.S. port calls as of 2015 is less than 6000 TEU. However recently in 2016, container ships sizing from 12,000-14,000 TEU have been calling to U.S. ports in California. Notably, the CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin is the largest vessel to ever call to a U.S port. The Federal Maritime Commission has recognized the trend in increasing vessels size and U.S. ports have begun preparation in anticipation of the increased arrival of larger vessels. Major ports in the United States have begun dredging for 50 ft berth/channel depths and heightening their crane fleets in order to accommodate the arrival of larger vessels References External links Benjamin Franklin is one massive container ship that will start carrying cargo from May 2016 Benjamin Franklin Benjamin Franklin Category:2015 ships ","title":"CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin"},{"id":"48933863","text":"Ian Robert Baggett FRGS (born 1972) is a British businessman and property entrepreneur.

He was a friend of Jean de Vauzelles, abbot of Montrottier, who translated into French the religious works of Pietro Aretino; Panciatichi himself sent the first translated copies to the Italian author in Venice in 1539. In 1539 he moved to Florence, where, on 20 January 1541, he became a member of the Accademia degli Umidi. In 1545 duke Cosimo I de' Medici appointed him as consul to France. Here Panciatichi became attracted to the Protestant movement, and later brought to Florence several books which had been forbidden by the Catholic church. He was one of the 35 people arrested as heretics in Florence in December 1551-January 1552; Panciatichi was later freed in exchange of a ransom. After promising he would no more deal with religious matters, he subsequently restarted his political career under the Medici aegis: in 1567 he became senator, in 1568 he was commissar in Pisa and, in 1578, in Pistoia.

According to witnesses Cypora took a poison pill and died before the massacre, but her husband Jakub, was murdered in the process. =Polish Righteous among the Nations= The Zawadzki household of Polish Righteous included Sabina Zawadzka, her daughter Irena age 27 in 1942, and her grown-up son Kazimierz with his wife Krystyna.Zuzanna Schnepf (October 2007), Rodzina Zawadzkich.

The family changed Rachela's name to a Catholic-sounding name ‚Äì Maria J√≥zefa ‚Äì so she could live with them openly. After two months Irena Zawadzka attempted to get a \\"legitimate\\" birth certificate for Rachela and arranged for the local Catholic convent to take her in. However, the little girl soon fell sick and was taken back home. Rachela remained with the Zawadzkis until 1943, even though the house was in close proximity to the Gestapo office in Siedlce. In the summer 1943, while the murderous Aktion Reinhard was coming to a close elsewhere, Zofia Glazer came to Zawadzkis, and took Rachela with her. They travelled to the town of Zakrz√≥wek near Lublin. Zofia placed the child with her own sister, Irena (Olszakowska) Egerszdorff. She went to a Catholic priest and obtained a new birth certificate for Rachela in the name of Marianna Tymi≈Ñska.Zofia Glazer z d. Olszakowska, Opieka nad RachelƒÖ. Audioteka. Museum of the History of Polish Jews. They remained in Zakrz√≥wek for six months. In the early winter of 1944 Zofia took Rachela to Sobieszyn, near Pu≈Çawy. The Soviet army liberated the area in July 1944. Zofia and Rachela stayed there until June 1945. They returned to Siedlce after the war ended. Rachela went back to live with the Zawadzkis for a time; meanwhile, Zofia Glazer wrote a letter to Szymon Jab≈Ço≈Ñ (Jablon) in Palestine with the intention of adopting her. Szymon Jablon was Cypora's older brother and Rachela's maternal uncle who survived the Holocaust. He requested that the 4-year-old Rachela be separated from the rescuers and transferred to a Jewish orphanage in Warsaw for the purpose of her reunification with him as soon as possible, but circumstances had changed. In the fall of 1945 Zofia Glazer took Rachela to Warsaw in tears and entrusted her to a Jewish organization in charge of transferring Jewish children to Mandate Palestine. Rachela was taken to France and put on a ship to Palestine with a group of Jewish orphans but the ship was turned back by the British. The children were returned to an orphanage in France. Irena Zawadzka went to visit Rachela (now Rachel) there in 1947 and found her disoriented and very sad, which made Zofia regret this for the rest of her life. Little Rachel reached Palestine after two years in late 1947, and lived with her uncle for just one year. She was placed in a boarding school and since 1953 lived in Kibbutz Ma'abarot. Rachel Zonszajn married in 1960. She stayed in close contact with Zofia Glazer and Irena Zawadzka in Poland. (pl), 2007 Zofia Glazer first settled in Lublin in late 1945 and obtained a position with the state-run \\"Spo≈Çem\\" organization (pl). From there, she was transferred to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and taught cooperative movement at the Higher School of Economics for two years. She got married and relocated to Warsaw. Zofia and Irena Zawadzka were invited by Szymon Jablon to come to Israel for a visit in 1966 when Rachel was 25; however, Rachel did not remember much from her own childhood. Rachel visited Poland for the first time in the 1980s. On 25 May 1988 Zofia Glazer along with Irena Zawadzka and her mother Mrs. Sabina Zawadzka were awarded titles of the Righteous. Rachel died of brain cancer in 2002, leaving two sons behind. Zofia died on 20 November 2007 in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, interviewed for the last time by Zuzanna Schnepf from the Shalom Foundation just before her death. She was outlived by her daughter. Irena Zawadzka died on 12 March 2012.

The angle of incidence is fixed in the design of the aircraft, and with rare exceptions, cannot be varied in flight. The term can also be applied to horizontal surfaces in general (such as canards or horizontal stabilizers) for the angle they make relative the longitudinal axis of the fuselage. The figure to the right shows a side view of an airplane. The extended chord line of the wing root (red line) makes an angle with the longitudinal axis (roll axis) of the aircraft (blue line). Wings are typically mounted at a small positive angle of incidence, to allow the fuselage to have a low angle with the airflow in cruising flight. Angles of incidence of about 6¬∞ are common on most general aviation designs. Other terms for angle of incidence in this context are rigging angle and rigger's angle of incidence. It should not be confused with the angle of attack, which is the angle the wing chord presents to the airflow in flight. Note that some ambiguity in this terminology exists, as some engineering texts that focus solely on the study of airfoils and their medium may use either term when referring to angle of attack.Kermode, A.C. (1972), Mechanics of Flight, Chapter 3, 8th edition, Pitman Publishing, London. On rotary‚Äìwing aircraft, the AoA (Angle of Attack) is the angle between the airfoil chord line and resultant relative wind. AoA is an aerodynamic angle. It can change with no change in the AoI (Angle of Incidence). Several factors may change the rotor blade AoA. Pilots control some of those factors; others occur automatically due to the rotor system design. Pilots adjust AoA through normal control manipulation; however, even with no pilot input AoA will change as an integral part of travel of the rotor blade through the rotor-disc. This continuous process of change accommodates rotary-wing flight. Pilots have little control over blade flapping and flexing, gusty wind, and/or turbulent air conditions. AoA is one of the primary factors determining amount of lift and drag produced by an airfoil.

The ray can be formed by any wave: optical, acoustic, microwave, X-ray and so on. In the figure below, the line representing a ray makes an angle Œ∏ with the normal (dotted line). The angle of incidence at which light is first totally internally reflected is known as the critical angle. The angle of reflection and angle of refraction are other angles related to beams. Determining the angle of reflection with respect to a planar surface is trivial, but the computation for almost any other surface is significantly more difficult. The exact solution for a sphere (which has important applications in astronomy and computer graphics) is treated in Alhazen's problem. Refraction of light at the interface between two media. Glancing angle Focusing X-rays with glancing reflection When dealing with a beam that is nearly parallel to a surface, it is sometimes more useful to refer to the angle between the beam and the surface, rather than that between the beam and the surface normal, in other words 90¬∞ minus the angle of incidence. This small angle is called a glancing angle or grazing angle. Incidence at grazing angles is called \\"grazing incidence\\". Glancing angle is the angle formed by the incident ray or the reflected ray and the plane(surface). Grazing incidence diffraction is used in X-ray spectroscopy and atom optics, where significant reflection can be achieved only at small values of the grazing angle. Ridged mirrors are designed for reflection of atoms coming at small grazing angle. This angle is usually measured in milliradians. In optics, there is Lloyd's mirror.

Financial support was provided by the older Social Democratic Party of Germany. A publishing company was established under the name De Arbeiderspers. Its first Editor-in Chief was the head of the SDAP, Pieter Jelles Troelstra. In 1903, after some disagreements arose, he was replaced by the journalist, Pieter Lodewijk Tak. In 1902, a contest was held to find an artist for the front-page cartoon in the weekly Sunday supplement. The winner was Albert Hahn, who was later signed to a permanent contract. Among the others who contributed regularly were (also a cartoonist), (a sportswriter) and the playwright Inte Onsman (under the pseudonym \\"Leckie Down\\"). In 1931, the paper moved into a new building, designed by Jan Buijs, which came to be known as the \\"Red Castle\\". A sister edition called Vooruit (Forward), was published in The Hague under the direction of Simon Carmiggelt.

She was said to possess an ability to build surface harmony through the use of flat, shadowless forms of generalized color and to use distortion and silhouetted patterning so as to give observers a sense of animation and often amusement. Art training During the second decade of the twentieth century Lawson studied at the Art Students League of New York under Kenneth Hayes Miller. Along with other students of Miller she later studied under Hamilton Easter Field at his Ogunquit School of Painting and Sculpture in Ogunquit, Maine. Artistic career Lawson's first public exhibition was in New York at the MacDowell Club in November 1916. A year later her name first appeared in issues of the American Art Directory and in 1918 her work appeared in three group shows: in March she showed at the Art Alliance of America, of which she was a member, and in December she appeared for a second time at the MacDowell Club and, once again, at the Art Alliance. A year later she was referred to as a \\"prominent painter\\" during a group exhibition that included her work. A critic pronounced the landscapes she contributed to that show as imaginative and decorative. During the 1920s she exhibited frequently, appearing in group shows at the Touchstone and Powell Galleries (1921), the gallery of Louise Upton Brumback (1923), the Twelfth Street Gallery (1923), G.R.D. Studio (1929), Art Students' League (1929), and Brooklyn Society of Modern Artists (1929). In 1922 Lawson contributed a painting to a group exhibition held at a high school art studio in Washington, D.C. Because the show had been organized by African Americans, was located in a segregated school, and consisted largely of African American participants, Lawson's name has appeared in lists of African American artists. Lawson was not African American but supported the rights of African Americans and participated in the New Negro movement of her time. In 1923 her work appeared for the first time at the Whitney Studio Club in a show that also included paintings by John Dos Passos and sculptures by Reuben Nakian. Dos Passos, who was a close friend of Lawson's, had taken classes with her at the Art Students' League and Field's Thurnscoe School of Modern Art in Ogunquit, Maine. A critic noted that one of the landscapes she showed was fanciful and another quite sombre. In 1924 and 1925 Lawson showed twice more with Dos Passos at the Whitney Studio Club. Regarding the 1925 show, a critic called Lawson's paintings strange and unpleasantly eccentric. In the early 1920s Lawson participated in shows of the Society of Independent Artists and when Hamilton Easter Field broke away from that organization to found the Salons of America she not only joined it but became one of its directors. In 1926 she became a founding member of the New York Society of Women Artists and afterwards regularly participated in its exhibitions. In 1925 Lawson was given her first solo as the inaugural exhibition of Gallery 134 on West 4th Street. In his review of the show the critic for the New York Sun commented on the nonchalance of her work, showing a \\"sort of indifference to the things one usually finds in paintings\\" and said she painted \\"decidedly, with a fine detachment.\\" The New York Evening Post's critic, Margaret Breuning, noted an unevenness in technical ability, but praised the \\"power of design and concentration that gives vitality to all the canvases\\" and called attention to Lawson's sense of humor which \\"gives back amusement to the beholder.\\" A critic for the New York Sun wrote that her work stood out distinctly in a group show at G.R.D. Studio in 1929 and said \\"She has a peculiarly loose way of painting that certainly approaches jazz. At first it seems lazy and shiftless, but it grows on acquaintance, and finally it is possible to suspect that there is something natively American in the style. During the 1930s and succeeding decades Lawson's work appeared less frequently than it had in the 1920s. She and her husband and their two children left Manhattan to settle in a small community on Long Island's north shore and, while she continued to paint, she participated only occasionally in public exhibitions. When Lawson was 93 a critic summarized her life's work by describing the particular \\"vivacity, energy and dynamism\\" of her modernist style which set her apart from other artists and showed her uniquely American outlook. The critic described Lawson's method as \\"abstracting rhythms, simplifying descriptions, flattening, generalizing color, eliminating shadow and building an emphatic surface harmony between forms.\\" Noting Lawson's exuberance and spontaneity, she wrote: \\"Occasionally viewers will associate the weightlessness of form with fantasy, innocence or na√Øvet√©. The intention, however, is to emphasize the power of direct landscape sensation.\\" Four years later Lawson's obituary added to this overview that she and her husband had \\"spearheaded the modernist movement in the early years of this century.\\" Exhibitions Lawson's work appeared frequently in group shows held by the Whitney Studio Club, Society of Independent Artists, Salons of America, and New York Society of Women Artists. She was also shown by the Touchstone Gallery, Powell Art Gallery, the Twelfth Street Gallery, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, J. Wanamaker Gallery of Modern Decorative Art, and the Downtown and Midtown Galleries in New York. She appeared in special exhibitions at the G.R.D. Studio, Art Students' League, Brooklyn Society of Modern Artists, Louise Upton Brumback's gallery, by the Tanner Art League, and in Madrid, Spain. She is a standout at a 1929 G.R.D. Studio group exhibition alongside Mildred Crooks, Doris Rosenthal, and Agnes Weinrich. She was given solo exhibitions in 1925 at Gallery 134 in New York and the Lakewood Gallery, Glen Cove, Long Island. Memberships Lawson belonged to the Society of Independent Artists, Salons of America (as director), New York Society of Women Artists, Art Alliance of America, Hempstead Harbor Artists Association, and The Dialis. Personal information Lawson's birth name is given as Adelaide Jaffery Lawson. She was born in New York on June 9, 1889. Her father was S. Levy Lawson. Born Simeon Levy, he had obtained a legal change of name to Simeon Levy Lawson shortly after Lawson's birth and it is thus likely that her name at birth and for the next few months was Adelaide Jaffery Levy. Simeon Levy's choice of name was influenced by his profession. A journalist who traveled frequently, he changed his name to overcome discrimination that he encountered on the assumption that he was a Jew. The new name he chose bore close similarity to the name of a well-known newspaperman, Edward Levy-Lawson, owner of the (London) The Daily Telegraph. Lawson's mother was Belle Hart Lawson. Although Lawson's grandparents on her father's side were Russian- Polish Jews and those on her mother's were German Jews, her parents were Christian Scientists and, on that account, did not seek medical treatment when Belle contracted breast cancer. She died of the disease in November 1901 when Lawson was twelve years old. Lawson had two brothers, Wendell Holmes and John Howard. They were named after men whom their mother especially respected: the jurist, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and the prison reformer, John Howard. Lawson herself was named after a socially-active friend of her mother. Wendell Lawson, who became a chemist and chemical importer, committed suicide at the age of 33 in 1922. John Howard Lawson (1894-1977) was a playwright, screenwriter, and theatrical producer who joined the Communist Party during the 1930s and in 1950 was jailed for contempt of Congress after refusing to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Lawson's parents were affluent, her father through his success as a newspaperman and her mother as daughter of a prosperous German industrialist and, while both parents believed in social reform, her mother was particularly devoted to progressive causes, including women's rights and liberalized early childhood education. Lawson received part of her early education in at an experimental school, the Children's Playhouse, during a period in which her family was living in the New York suburb of New Rochelle,. After her mother's death in 1901, Lawson's father, who traveled frequently and who, when present, was not a warm and loving parent, employed a governess and other servants to look after her and her brothers. That year he enrolled her and John Howard as boarding students at the Halstead School in Yonkers and, in the summer of 1906, when she was 17, he sent her with John Howard, on an extensive tour of England, Germany, and the Netherlands. Reflecting the family's relatively high social position Lawson's name appeared in the society pages of New York newspapers during her teenage years. While young, Lawson lived in and around New York City. Lawson's father bought and sold real estate as an investment and the family moved frequently among properties that he owned. During the early stages of her career as a professional artist she lived in New York first with her father, then, after her brother John's marriage, with him and his wife, and then on her own in an apartment on 14th Street near Union Square. Lawson traveled in Germany, France, England, and Switzerland during 1908, in 1920 she visited France and Spain, and in 1921 she traveled in France, the British Isles, Switzerland, and Italy. During the 1920s Lawson's contemporaries saw her as lovably gypsy-like and one maintained that she \\"had never been taught to wash her ears and neck.\\" Some critics of the time saw her paintings as similarly exotic, eccentric, nonchalant, and \\"curiously untidy.\\" Lawson married fellow artist Wood Gaylor on August 7, 1926. They had known each other for some years as students and participants in New York arts organizations. They remained married until Gaylor's death in 1957. During the early years of their marriage they lived in Greenwich Village. Lawson and Gaylor had two sons, Wynn Lawson Gaylor, born circa 1927, and Randall, born circa 1930. Gaylor had a daughter by a previous marriage who lived with her mother. In 1930 their home comprised the three of them and a live-in servant. After spending summer vacations in Glenwood Landing for two years, they moved permanently to that Long Island village in 1934 and Lawson remained there following Gaylor's death in 1957. While continuing to pursue her artistic career she participated in community activities from time to time. When she died at Huntington Hospital, Long Island, on October 28, 1986, the obituary writer for the New York Times gave her married name as \\"Gaylord.\\" Other names Lawson sometimes used her middle initial, but not her middle name. Sources give this middle name as Jaffery, Jeffrey, Geoffery, or Jaffrey. Although she used Lawson as her professional name, her married name occurs in press reports as Adelaide Lawson Gaylord, Adelaide L. Gaylord, or simply Adelaide Gaylord.

Life and work =Early life= He was born Hasan Sul√´ Shermeti Moglica, in Moglic√´ village of Okshtun highland, part of lower Diber County, today's Albania, back then part of the Sanjak of Dibra of the Ottoman Empire. His family had migrated in the area from Debar, the administrative center of that time. His father was a construction master and would take Hasan with him at a young age. Beside helping his father, he registered in the local schools. First, he attended the meytep (elementary religious school) in Peqin, and considering his results and the will of learning his father registered him in the Madrasa of Elbasan. There he learned the Turkish, old Ottoman, and Persian language. After finishing the madrasa, he went to Istanbul where he studied theology and engineering. Upon his return home after the studies, he started working an imam of the local mosque. He was also involved in local engineering works, as drainage systems, watermills, etc. =Nationalist activity= Inspired by the National Awakening movement, Moglica was deeply involved in the attempts of spreading the Albanian education. He was a delegate of Gollobord√´ region in the League of Prizren of June 1878. Moglica was one of the organizers and main participants of several meetings which the Dibra branch of the League held during the autumn of 1878, 14 October, 1 November, and most important the one of 20 October, known as Meeting of Dibra, , in the Albanian historiography. Here the local leaders would decide the specifics of implementing the League's decision. The meeting protested once again against the decision of the Congress of Berlin, and demanded the unification of all Albanian sanjaks into a single vilayet. Even after the suppression of the League, he continued his activities in the areas around Debar, Elbasan, and Gollobord√´. He had his own cheta of guerrillas. He would be appointed as m√ºderris in Gollobord√´. =An educator= Moglica was involved with spreading of the Albanian language and education in the early 1900s. He contributed in the delivery and distribution of around 5,000 Albanian primers, printed by the Albanian colonies of Bucharest, Sofia, and Istanbul. He participated in the Congress of Dibra as a representative of Gollobord√´ (together with Dan Ag√´ Cami and Hazis Hoxh√´ Efendi Lila), and in the Congress of Elbasan of 1909, known as the Congress of the Albanian Schools (). The Normal School of Elbasan which was established by the Congress had many students from Moglica's zone of influence. Due to his work and sponsorship, there were 9 students from Gollobord√´ out of 29 in total during the first academic year. On his personal initiative, a local meeting was organized in Fush√´-Klenj√´ of Gollobord√´ (). There he propagandized and explained to the local population the importance of education, the Albanian alphabet and schools, and urged them to send their children in the newly established schools. Moglica opened a school in his area in 1904, and had transformed his 28-room house into a huge library, which was burnt down by the Turkish soldiers of Turgut Pasha in 1908. =Arrest and execution= With the First Balkan War, the Dibra region was invaded by the Serbian army. This would be followed by the turmoils of World War I where several military and paramilitary fractions would raid the area. In 1914, Moglica would be arrested by the supporters of Essad Pasha Toptani, influential in the area and closely related to Serbia. They sent him to Elbasan, and in order to humiliate him threw a saddle on him and made him walk in the streets of Elbasan despite his age. He would stay imprisoned for 3 months, and could escape only after the vacuum created when the Serbian army marched toward Elbasan against the Pro- Ottoman rebels of Haxhi Qamili. He returned to his village in early 1915, but remained in the \\"wanted\\" list by the Serbian army, who burnt his home as well. His family was displaced further south in √áermenik√´ region.

Location The archway is located near Rue d'Argens on the way from Msida to Sliema.

MEPA. It is few metres away from the Empire Stadium, the former national Maltese football stadium. History The archway was built by the aristocratic Testaferrata family in 1796 when Fra Nicolaus Butius saw the need for the development of a main road in the area to facilitate movement from Msida to Sliema, with this event commemorated with the structure itself. The gate originally stood in the locality of Birkirkara but with the passage of time the area where it stands became a separate locality as Gzira. Another similar archway with similar architecture was built in Ta' Xbiex, the Ta' Xbiex Gate by the same Testaferrata family.Mous√π, S. (2019, March 17). Musing on Ta' Xbiex's origin and past....

The Fawwara Gate was a source of inspiration to 19th-century painters.Said, Edward (2011), \\"Historic Fawwara Gate in G≈ºira ‚Äì some clarifications\\", Times of Malta. A fortified tower was located in the whereabouts of the building, with the gate possibly serving as a gateway to the tower. The street where the gate is found is named for the tower as Triq it-Torri. Back side of Fawwara Gate The archway has been left in a dilapidated state for quite some years, having had unprofessional restoration in 1908 with the use of cement causing it more harm. Since 1933 the archway was given to the responsibility of a business as part of the contractual lease of a site in the vicinity.Times of Malta However no maintenance has ever been recorded to have taken place until it came to a wider public criticism of its neglect.Said, Edward (2011), \\"Historic Fawwara Gate in G≈ºira ‚Äì some clarifications\\", Times of Malta. At one point, the actual owners being the Sant Fournier family at the time sold the business due to financial constrains caused by WWII. On the turn of the 21st century the gate was caught by the attention of the Sliema Historic Society (SHS), bringing the attention of the local media, leading and exposing outrage of its state. In 2011-2012 the arch was in danger to collapseTimes of Malta and for this reason it was listed under the Emergency Conservation Order with the use of the Environment and Development Planning Act 2010 with the use of article 82.MEPA (15 June 2012).

Synopsis The book was intended as an expos√© of the situation in the so-called Congo Free State (labelled a \\"rubber regime\\" by Conan Doyle), an area occupied and designated as the personal property of Leopold II of Belgium and where the serious human rights abuses were occurring. Indigenous people in the region were being brutally exploited and tortured, particularly in the lucrative rubber trade. In the introduction to The Crime of the Congo Conan Doyle wrote: \\"I am convinced that the reason why public opinion has not been more sensitive upon the question of the Congo Free State is that the terrible story has not been brought thoroughly home to the people\\", a situation he intended to rectify. Conan Doyle was \\"strongly of the opinion\\" that the crimes committed on the Congo were \\"the greatest to be ever known\\", and he lauded the work of the Congo Reform Association. Conan Doyle was dismissive of the annexation of the state by Belgium, a situation intended to end the personal rule of the King. Conan Doyle noted that slavery and ivory poaching continued to occur after annexation and that \\"The Congo State was founded by the Belgian King, and exploited by Belgian capital, Belgian soldiers and Belgian concessionnaires. It was defended and upheld by successive Belgian Governments, who did all they could to discourage the Reformers\\". Reception In the Daily Express the book was praised as \\"the most powerful indictment yet launched against the Belgian rulers of this bloodstained colony\\". The Express also noted that \\"After reviewing the early history of the Congo Free State Sir Arthur quotes the testimony of many unimpeachable witnesses regarding the brutalities of the 'rubber system' and the coldblooded mutilation and massacre of natives during the past fifteen years\\". Aftermath Many academics who have analysed Conan Doyle's life have noted his activism, including his authorship of The Crime of the Congo. In 2009, Cambridge Scholars Publishing released a reprint of the work, in Collected Works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

He is the author of numerous papers and articles in the field of space radiation. Early life and education The younger son of Helene Costi von Paschalides and Yiorgos Stasinopoulos, Stassinopoulos was born in Bonn, Germany in 1921 and spent his childhood in Berlin where his grandfather Johann had been knighted by Kaiser Wilhelm II for supplying the German Army with cigarettes in World War I. Stassinopoulos and his older brother John were sent to Athens in 1935 to avoid the rise of Nazism. In Greece, Stassinopoulos studied law and worked as a member of the Greek resistance (the EKKA resistance movement and the 2nd Bureau for Intelligence and Counterintelligence) after the Axis occupation of Greece in 1941. After serving in the 1st Infantry Division of the Greek Army during the Greek Civil War from 1946-1949, and fighting in the battles of Grammos-Vitsi, Malimathi, Konitsa, and on the Albanian border, Stassinopoulos emigrated to the United States in 1954. Career Stassinopoulos joined NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, MD, in 1961, after graduate studies in Mathematics and Physics at The American University and The Catholic University in Washington, DC. As the Head of Goddard's Radiation Physics Office, he worked on application-oriented research in magnetospheric physics, geomagnetism, solar-terrestrial relationships, natural and man-made radiation exposure, radiation effects on biological and electronic systems and components, and radiation environment modeling. His major research activities included orbital flux integration studies; radiation environment assessment for flight projects and evaluation of impact on flight missions; 3-D radiation transport and shielding studies; modeling of physical processes in the Earth's magnetosphere; large-scale flight and ground data analysis and correlation; planning, design, and development of modern, automated irradiation test facilities; dosimetry research and evaluation; design and development of radiation monitoring equipment and instruments; miniaturization of radiation spectrometers; and global mapping of atmospheric cosmic rays and their progeny. Stassinopoulos was the principal investigator in 23 original research projects for NASA and he is the author or co-author of 146 papers and articles in peer-reviewed scientific, technical, and engineering journals and books; 31 special official NASA publications; and 154 NASA Technical Study, Research, and Analysis Publications in the field of space radiation. He was a co-founder of the Radiation Effects on Components and Systems (RADECS) organization in 1989 at the University of Montpellier 2, France. He served as the Chair of a NASA Headquarters-established \\"Charged Particle Radiation Panel\\" for the development of a NASA Engineering Standards for STS missions and as Chair of the US Government Consortium (NASA-NSA-NRL- USASDC) for the design and implementation of a fully automated \\"Irradiation Test and Research Facility\\" at the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory. Stassinopoulos micro-miniaturized two prototype space-qualified and pedigreed radiation monitors/dosimeters/spectrometers into a single pill- box sized hybrid instrument, a Pulse Height Analyzer (PHA) called the Miniature High-LET Radiation Spectrometer, weighing less than 90 grams, and was awarded a US Patent (No. 7465926 B2) on December 16, 2008 for his \\"Device system and method for a miniaturized radiation spectrometer.\\" The instrument has been used for flight measurements on commercial jets, the Concorde, and the STS-95 Host Mission. Stassinopoulos' PHA instrument is on the NASA DSCOVR satellite which was launched on February 11, 2015. After 45 years of service to NASA, Stassinopoulos retired to Emeritus status and continues to study and analyze space radiation data from the PHA. At 95 years of age, he authored a NASA Technical Publication (STI#25740 TN28435-Stass-2015) with fellow NASA scientists MA Xapsos and CA Stauffer, \\"Forty-Year 'Drift' and Change of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA)\\", making him one of the oldest publishing research scientists and authors in NASA's history. Awards and honors Faculte des Sciences Medal from the Academie de Montpellier, France During his career, Stassinopoulos has received numerous awards, including the IEEE Radiation Effects Award (2000); the APOLLO-XI Achievement Award; a Faculte des Sciences medal from the Academie de Montpellier, France; the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1992, and the GSFC \\"Award of Merit\\" in 1999.

In 822 he was appointed as chief of security (shurtah) of Baghdad, and over the next three decades he oversaw many of the major developments in that city, including the implementation of the mihnah or inquisition, the removal of the Abbasid central government to Samarra, and the suppression of the attempted rebellion of Ahmad ibn Nasr al-Khuza'i.

Early career  Baghdad in the 9th century Little is known of Ishaq's early life, other than that he was possibly born in 793. He first appears in ca. 822 when he was appointed over the shurtah and revenue districts of Baghdad on behalf of his first cousin 'Abdallah ibn Tahir,The relationship between Ishaq and 'Abdallah is based on Ishaq's genealogy as \\"Ishaq ibn Ibrahim [ibn al-Husayn] ibn Mus'ab;\\" ; . . following the latter's departure to the Jazirah to combat the rebel Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli, and this event marked the beginning of his long career in Baghdad.; ; . Over the next several years Ishaq appears sporadically in the sources. In 825 he housed Nasr ibn Shabath for a short time after the latter had surrendered and was sent to Baghdad, and in 828 he was part of a delegation dispatched by the caliph al- Ma'mun (r. 813‚Äì833) to offer 'Abdallah the governorship of Khurasan.; . According to Ibn al-'Adim, he was briefly made governor of Aleppo, Qinnasrin, the 'awasim and thughur in place of al-Ma'mun's son al-'Abbas in ca. 829, but he was then dismissed and al-'Abbas was restored to those positions. In 830, following al-Ma'mun's decision to go on campaign against the Byzantines, the caliph designated Ishaq as his deputy over Baghdad, and also gave him control over the Sawad, Hulwan, and the Tigris districts. During the last years of al- Ma'mun's reign, Ishaq enforced the caliph's directives in Baghdad while the latter remained away from the city; in 832, for example, he carried out al- Ma'mun's instructions that the garrison troops should begin reciting the takbir when performing the prayers. In the following year, in order to ensure compliance with the Mu'tazilite doctrine that the Qur'an had been created, al- Ma'mun inaugurated the mihnah or inquisition and ordered Ishaq to implement it in Baghdad. Ishaq accordingly dispatched several individuals to the caliph for questioning and interviewed a number of religious scholars himself, whereupon he received further instructions to punish those who had given unsatisfactory answers. Eventually the majority of the interrogees agreed to state that the Qur'an had been created, but Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Muhammad ibn Nuh al-'Ijli remained steadfast in their opposition and were consequently sent by Ishaq to the caliph in irons.; ; .  Under al-Mu'tasim  Samarra in the 9th century During the reign of al-Ma'mun's successor al-Mu'tasim (r. 833‚Äì842), Ishaq served as one of the closest advisors and confidants of the caliph.. An anecdotal example of the close relationship between al-Mu'tasim and Ishaq is provided in Following al-Mu'tasim's transfer of his residence, together with the government bureaucracy and army, to his new capital of Samarra in 836, Ishaq was appointed to head the Samarran security (ma'unah) alongside the Turkish officer Itakh, but he also retained his position as chief of the Baghdad shurtah and remained a resident of that city. For the rest of Ishaq's life, Samarra served as the seat of al-Mu'tasim and his successors, while Ishaq himself continued to act as their representative in Baghdad. Shortly after al-Mu'tasim's accession in August 833, Ishaq was appointed as governor of the Jibal and was ordered to deal with the Khurramites of that region, who had assembled in the district of Hamadhan and defeated a previous army sent against them. Ishaq accordingly selected his brother Tahir to govern the shurtah in his stead and set out for the province. Upon his arrival he was able to achieve a major victory against the Khurramites, reportedly killing tens of thousands of rebels and forcing many others to flee to the Byzantines. After sending a victory dispatch in December 833, he returned to Iraq in May 834, bringing with him a large number of captives and individuals who had received guarantees of safe conduct.; . In 838 Ishaq supervised the execution of 'Abdallah, the brother of the defeated Khurramite rebel Babak al-Khurrami, and gibbeted his corpse in Baghdad.; . In 840 he took into custody Mazyar, the captured rebel prince of Tabaristan, after the latter had arrived in Iraq; upon receiving him, Ishaq ordered him to be transported on an elephant and escorted him to the caliph in Samarra. That same year he formed part of the tribunal that prosecuted the disgraced general al-Afshin, which ended with al- Afshin being found guilty of apostasy and thrown into prison.  Under al- Wathiq  Following the death of al-Mu'tasim in January 842, Ishaq administered the oath of allegiance in Baghdad for his son al-Wathiq (r. 842‚Äì847). Under the new caliph, he was called to preside over the cases of several mazalim officials during a general crackdown against the government bureaucracy in 843-4, and in 845 he oversaw the events of the festive season (mawsim) during the annual pilgrimage.; . That same year he was, according to al-Suli and al-Shabushti, assigned the governorship of Khurasan following the death of 'Abdallah ibn Tahir, but al-Wathiq subsequently changed his mind and canceled the appointment, giving Khurasan to 'Abdallah's son Tahir instead. Like his two predecessors, al-Wathiq maintained the stance that the Qur'an had been created, and the mihnah continued during his reign. Resistance to these policies in Baghdad eventually culminated in 846, when supporters of orthodoxy led by Ahmad ibn Nasr al-Khuza'i formed plans to launch a popular rebellion against the central government. The conspiracy was discovered, however, prior to the scheduled date of the revolt, and Ahmad was arrested by an agent of Ishaq's brother Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Mus'abi (Ishaq himself having been absent from the city at the time of the incident). Ishaq then took part in al- Wathiq's interrogation of the rebel leader in Samarra, and on his orders a number of Ahmad's supporters were rounded up and imprisoned.; ; .  Last years and legacy  The accession of al-Mutawakkil (r. 847‚Äì861) represented a significant break in the policies and personnel of the central government; not only did the new caliph bring an end to the mihnah and abandon Mu'tazilism, but he also set about removing the senior military and civil officials that had dominated the administrations of his two predecessors. As part of his campaign to weaken the old regime and strengthen his own hold on power, al- Mutawakkil relied on Ishaq to act against those officials who were too strong to be attacked in Samarra itself.; . In accordance with his new policy, in 849 the caliph ordered Ishaq to eliminate the powerful chamberlain Itakh, who had left Samarra to go on the pilgrimage that year. On his return journey, Itakh was intercepted by Ishaq and convinced to make a detour to Baghdad; upon his arrival, he was separated from his retinue and detained. He was allowed to die of thirst while held in Ishaq's residence, and his sons remained in prison for the remainder of al-Mutawakkil's reign.; . In 850 Ishaq became sick, and he died on July 7 or 8, 850, having designated his son Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Ibrahim as his successor. During his final illness he had been visited by al- Mutawakkil's son al-Mu'tazz, the Turkish officer Bugha al-Sharabi, and a contingent of other commanders and soldiers.; . In assessing Ishaq's legacy, modern historians generally consider him as being a highly useful and trustworthy servant of the caliphs. His administration of Baghdad is credited as having secured the continued loyalty of the city's residents to the central government, especially after the seat of the caliphs had been moved to Samarra, and he acted as a counterweight to the rising power of the Turkish generals in the capital, a role that his successors would continue to follow after his death. At the same time, he helped to strengthen and maintain the interests of the Tahirids in Iraq, and acted as their agent in exercising influence over the caliphal court. Following his death, the shurtah of Baghdad would remain in the hands of his sons until Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah ibn Tahir took over the position in 851, and the governorship of the city would remain in Tahirid hands until the last decade of the ninth century.; ; .

For the preceding dozen years its members had been meeting in various places in Kennett Square, including the Unicorn Tavern that stood on the northwest corner of State and Union Streets.

A History of Church of the Advent, Kennett Square, PA. Publisher: Church of the Advent Kennett Square.  Founding of the Church  At the time of Advent's founding, there was limited transportation. This made it important to have a church within easy distance. Two near-by churches were established before Advent. One was St. James, near the intersection of Newark Road and Street Road in West Marlborough Township. The year it was founded isn't known but it was destroyed in a storm in 1877, five years before Advent's founding. [In 2014 the site was revisited; the foundation ruins remain, hidden among a thicket of vines and trees.] St. John's of Kelton was established in 1741 and closed in 1946. As of this date, its buildings are being used by another church faith. Following St. John's closing, for many years the historical marker on the site of the Original St. John's Church and Ancient Burial Ground, on State Road in New London Township, read, Information concerning new burials can be obtained through the Episcopal Church of the Advent, Kennett Square, PA.Steltzer, B.

But many of the residents of Kennett Square felt they needed their own church. So, working with the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania, parishioners put together a petition to get an official Charter. The names of the signers of this petition are on file.Petition to create a charter to form a church in Kennett Square, PAEpiscopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. 1882. One was Theodore Hadley whose son, Charles Hadley, was to be the owner and publisher of the local newspaper.

Charles and Irene created the fund to provide money for programs that better \\" the civic betterment, social welfare, and education\\" of our local communities.The Hadley Fund Endowment Charter and Terms of Use. 1890. The Hadley Fund continues to be used today by Church of the Advent to provide and promote outreach activities for the surrounding communities. The first job of the new church was to erect a church building. A committee of three members pledged themselves to gather the money necessary to build a church building for the newly chartered parish. These three were: Theodore D. Hadley, S. Ashton Hand, and Henry C. White. They were very successful with raising money and, in 1885, they placed the cornerstone for the new building. The Church site was on the west side of South Broad Street in the Borough of Kennett Square, just below Union. The new church was completed in 1886.

The \\"lace curtain Irish\\" were those who were well off, while the \\"shanty Irish\\" were the poor, who were presumed to live in shanties, or roughly-built cabins. Neither term was complimentary. Aside from financial status, the term \\"lace curtain Irish\\" connoted pretentiousness and social climbing, while the \\"shanty Irish\\" were stereotyped as feckless and ignorant. As lace curtains became commonplace in Irish-American working-class homes, \\"lace curtain\\" was still used in a metaphorical, and often pejorative, sense. In the early 20th century, James Michael Curley, a famously populist Boston politician who was called \\"mayor of the poor\\", used the term \\"cut glass Irish\\" to mock the Irish-American middle class, but the term did not catch on. Irish Americans who prospered or married well could go from \\"shanty Irish\\" to \\"lace curtain Irish\\", and wealthy socialites could have shanty Irish roots. John F. Kennedy, for example, is considered \\"lace curtain\\" even though his great-grandparents were working-class Irish immigrants.  Origin  The term \\"shanty\\" is suggested as deriving from the Irish noun seanteach (lit. \\"old house\\" - pronounced shan-tchawk). though it is closer to the plural noun \\"old houses\\", Seantithe, pronounced shan-titha. However the direct back translation of shan-ty would arrive at sean t√≠, the latter word an adjective meaning 'of the house' much in the vein of Bean an t√≠, bawn-on-ty, means the matriarch of the house. Many poor Irish tenant farmers lived in one-room cabins. \\"The Irishman's Shanty\\", a 19th-century comic song, describes a stereotypical Irishman's quarters: :He has three rooms in one, kitchen, bedroom, and hall, :And his chist is three wooden pegs in the wall: :Two suits of owld clothes make his wardrobe complete, :One to wear in the shanty, that same for the street.  In popular culture  The occasional malapropisms and left-footed social blunders of the upwardly mobile \\"lace curtain\\" Irish were gleefully lampooned in vaudeville, popular song, and comic strips such as Bringing Up Father, starring Maggie and Jiggs, which ran in daily newspapers for 87 years (1913 to 2000).William H.

History In 1822, Michael Robison moved his family from Pike County, Ohio, to southern Scioto Township where he bought 250 acres and raised 15 children. He died in 1851 and five of his children, Sarah Hall, Matilda Hott, Almira Hott, Ann Hoover, and Issac Robison continued living in what they named Robtown. The Hott Family moved into the main farm house located on Route 316.

The title refers to the hard problem of consciousness, which Stoppard defines as having \\"subjective First Person experiences\\"; he notes the strangeness in the illusion of consciousness in which, clearly, you have to be conscious to experience. Plot Hilary, a college student, and Spike, her TA, argue over the paradoxes encountered when trying to explain human consciousness, moral sense, altruism, and parental sacrifice. Do humans act predictably, like computers, calculating risks and benefits, or do they act unpredictably, according to each person's innate sense of what is \\"good\\"? In either case, is their behavior a product of Darwinian struggle, sometimes disguised as compassion or altruism, or can it spring from the soul in a relation with God? Hilary is somewhat defiantly in the latter camp ‚Äî Spike is astonished to learn that she prays each night before going to sleep. Hilary's faith in God and her obsession with \\"goodness\\" stem from the fact that she got pregnant as a teenager and gave the baby (a girl whom she named Catherine) up for adoption. Her prayers always have to do with ensuring that her daughter is safe and happy. Hilary feels that if she leads a morally correct life, she can make up for her previous mistakes and ensure her daughter's happiness. Hilary applies for a job at the Krohl Institute for Brain Science. At the interview, she meets another job candidate, Amal, who seems to share Spike's view of human beings as innately self-interested. Both Hilary and Amal get hired to work at Krohl. Five years later, Amal uses a statistical model of market fluctuations to correctly predict the stock market crash of 2009. But his timing is off, which causes the Krohl companies significant losses, which, in turn, earns Amal a firestorm of invective and a major demotion from analyst to computer drudge. Jerry Krohl, the founder of the company, has an adopted daughter named Cathy, who is about the same age that Hilary's daughter Catherine would be. This brings the \\"hard problem\\" into focus: are Catherine and Cathy the same girl, and if so, what can explain this statistically improbably coincidence? Is it purely luck, or a miracle brought about by supernatural aid (e.g. Hilary's prayers)? Whether compassion is disguised self-interest deployed instinctively as an evolutionary strategy, or whether it can exist as unalloyed self-sacrifice, becomes a major part of the \\"hard problem\\". Hilary and her assistant Bo, a math genius, design an experiment to test this. Cathy and 95 other children at her school are tested for how much compassion each child displays toward a woman they witness supposedly being subjected to electric shocks. Bo analyzes the data and concludes that younger children show more native compassion than older children, who presumably have been taught to be comfortable with cruelty. Bo's hard work seems to show an unselfish desire to please Hilary ‚Äî or is Hilary right in suspecting that Bo is sexually attracted to her, and therefore has a more selfish motive for working so hard? Hilary goes on a business trip to Venice and is randomly assigned to room at the hotel with Spike, whom she has not seen for eight years. Again, this raises the question of whether their lives are being guided by pure chance, or some kind of providence. Spike and Hilary argue again, this time over whether inert matter can create consciousness. In bed, Hilary asks Spike to join her in praying for her daughter. But in spite of the temptation to please her, Spike remains true to his principles and refuses. He hears Hilary crying in the shower. After returning from Venice, Hilary hosts a party to celebrate the printing of the paper she and Bo co-wrote. It's a disastrous party. Spike behaves rudely, Hilary burns the food, and Amal, now Bo's boyfriend, belittles the paper. Worse, Bo reveals to Hilary that she fudged the data to make it come out the way she knew Hilary wanted ‚Äî because she (Bo) is in love with Hilary. Hilary's joy at having science \\"prove\\" that humans are natively nice is shattered. The problem of whether \\"goodness\\" is what it seems, or whether it can always be analyzed as a self-enhancing tactic, remains \\"hard\\". Because Krohl's daughter Cathy was one of the subjects in the experiment, Hilary is able to verify that Cathy was adopted and that her birthdate as well as her name correspond to those of her daughter. Jerry has known this for some time, and in the last scene he displays his personal compassion by inviting Hilary to visit them at any time to see her daughter. Hilary is grateful but thinks such visits should be deferred until Cathy/Catherine is older. The play ends with Jerry and Cathy leaving Hilary's apartment. Hilary looks happy, and Jerry comes back to give Hilary Cathy's ID pass with her picture on it. She looks at it for a moment, then quickly stuffs her few belongings into a bag and exits.

It is less than long and flows through West Mahanoy Township and possibly Shenandoah. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The stream is located within the Western Middle Anthracite Field. A number of dams have been constructed across it. The stream is classified as a Coldwater Fishery and has macroinvertebrates, but no fish. Course Kehly Run begins in Fetter Pond in West Mahanoy Township. It flows west for several hundred feet, passing through another pond and entering Number Six Reservoir. From the southern end of this reservoir, the stream turns south-southeast for several tenths of a mile, passing near Number Five Reservoir, crossing Pennsylvania Route 924, and entering a valley. In this valley, the creek flows in a generally southerly direction for several tenths of a mile, passing through Kehly Run Reservoir Number Three and Number Two Reservoir. Towards the lower reaches of this valley, in West Mahanoy Township, or possibly at or shortly after its end, in Shenandoah, the stream reaches its confluence with or becomes Shenandoah Creek. Kehly Run joins Shenandoah Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology Kehly Run is designated as an impaired waterbody. The stream is impacted by abandoned mine drainage. However, it has been described as having \\"very good\\" water quality at site S11, in its upper reaches. In the late 1800s, the stream was described as having once been a stream of \\"good, soft, pure mountain water\\". In March 2001, the discharge of Kehly Run was measured to be , while in August 2001, it was . The dissolved oxygen concentration was in March and August 2001, respectively. In March 2001, the pH was 4.7 and the net alkalinity concentration was , while in August 2001, the pH was 4.8 and the net alkalinity concentration was . The concentration of dissolved aluminum in Kehly Run was in March 2001 and in August 2001. The dissolved manganese and iron concentrations in the stream were in March and in August. In March 2001, the concentration of dissolved nitrate in Kehly Run was less than , while the concentration in August 2001 was . The concentration of dissolved phosphorus was less than in both March and August 2001. The sulfate concentration was in March and August 2001, respectively. Geography and geology The elevation of the source of Kehly Run is above sea level. The stream is situated entirely within the Western Middle Anthracite Field. There is some abandoned mine land in the vicinity of the stream's upper reaches. The dried sediment of Kehly Run was light olive brown in the Munsell color system. A dam known as the Kehly Run Dam No. 3 is , about high, and is made of earth and rockfill. In 1980, the dam was judged to be in fair condition. There are three reservoirs further upstream and one pool further downstream. Watershed The watershed of Kehly Run has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Shenandoah. The watershed of Kehly Run occupies a total of approximately 1 percent of the Mahanoy Creek drainage basin. The watershed is located near the northeastern corner of the Shenandoah Creek watershed and in the upper part of the Mahanoy Creek watershed. History Kehly Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1178301. The stream is also known as Kahly Run. This variant name appears in a 1975 highway map of Schuylkill County, published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. In 2007, environmental assessments were proposed or made for the breaching of five dams in the watershed of Kehly Run. Biology In 2001, no fish were observed in Kehly Run near Shenandoah, but macroinvertebrates were observed. A total of ten macroinvertebrate taxa were observed. Hydropsychidae was classified as \\"abundant\\", with 25 to 100 individuals being observed. Leuctridae and Simuliidae were classified as \\"common\\", with 10 to 24 individuals being observed. The taxa Cordulegastridae and Crydalidae were classified as \\"present\\", with three to nine individuals being observed. Another several taxaAeshnidae, Calopterygidae, Tipulidae, Cambaridae were \\"rare\\", with only one or two individuals of each being observed. A small number of miscellaneous individuals from Diptera were observed. Second-growth forest occurs in the vicinity of some reaches of Kehly Run. The family-level Hilsenhoff Biotic Index value of the stream was 4.14. Historically, Kehly Run was used as a trout-fishing stream. The stream is classified as a Coldwater Fishery.

Delphi itself remained almost uninhabited for centuries. It seems that one of the first buildings of the early modern era was the monastery of the Dormition of Mary or of Panagia (the Mother of God) built above the ancient gymnasium. It must have been towards the end of the 15th or in the 16th century that a settlement started forming there, which eventually ended up forming the village of Kastri. Cyriacus of Ancona and his description The first Westerner to have described the archaeological remains in Delphi and offered a rare view of the area for a period relatively unknown was Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli otherwise known as Cyriacus of Ancona. He was a remarkable personality, a genuine representative of Renaissance. He was originally a merchant, yet when he came across antiquities during his travels he became so impressed that he decided to learn ancient Greek and Latin at the age of 30, and then went on to a series of travels aiming at archaeological investigation and documentation, while undertaking various diplomatic missions, particularly to the Ottoman court. Cyriacus visited Delphi in March 1436 and remained there for six days. He recorded all the visible archaeological remains based on Pausanias for identification. He described the stadium and the theatre at that date as well as some free standing pieces of sculpture. He also recorded several inscriptions, most of which are now lost. His identifications however were not always correct: for example he described a round building he saw as the temple of Apollo while this was simply the base of the Argives' ex-voto. Information for the following two centuries of Ottoman rule is relatively sparse and confused. Delphi was renamed Kastri and was subjected to the kaza (district) of Salona (Amphissa). We also know that the destructive earthquake of 1580 caused severe damage to the antiquities. The European travelers Over the centuries the travelers from European countries increased and thus information on Delphi became more abundant. One of the roads which connected eastern and western Central Greece continued to pass from Delphi and thus many travelers coming from the West disembarked at Itea or Naupaktos and then took the long up the mountains passing from Delphi, usually on horseback. From the mid-17th century onwards such visits became more frequent, as the fashion of traveling and collecting antiquities became so popular in Europe. Two renowned visitors of Delphi in those days were Sir George Wheler and Jacob Spon, who passed by in January 1676. The first building which attracted their attention was the monastery of Panagia built in ‚ÄúMarmaria‚Äù. It was an annex of the Monastery of Jerusalem situated in Davleia in Boeotia and stood there until its demolition during the Great Excavation at Delphi. In this monastery sojourned many of the travelers, who usually mention the good wine offered to them by the monks. In 1766 came to Delphi a group of three men, namely the Oxford epigraphist Richard Chandler, the architect Nicholas Revett, and the painter William Pars, in the course of an expedition funded by the Society of Dilettanti, which promoted the study and collection of Greco-Roman antiquities. Their studies were published in 1769 under the title ‚ÄúIonian Antiquities‚Äù Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Ionian Antiquities, London 1769 followed by a collection of inscriptions Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Inscriptiones antiquae, pleraeque nondum editae, in Asia Minore et Graecia, praesertim Athensis, collectae, Oxford, 1774 as well as by two travelogues, one about Asia Minor (1775) Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Travels in Asia Minor, Oxford, 1775. and one about Greece (1776).Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Travels in Greece, Oxford, 1776. Apart from the antiquities, they also related some vivid descriptions of daily life in Kastri, such as the crude behaviour of the Turco-Albanians who guarded the mountain passes. In 1805 Edward Dodwell visited Delphi, accompanied by the painter Simone Pomardi.A classical and topographical tour through Greece, London 1819 His descriptions and are the fine engravings by Pomardi, which decorated their book, published in 1819, constitute a valuable source on daily life in Kastri and Amphissa. For example, he describes a dinner at Chrisso or the hospitality offered to him and his companion by the priest of Kastri in a single-roomed house without ventilation for the escape of the smoke coming out of the hearth. The family used to live all together, without any sense of privacy. A travelling destination such as Delphi naturally attracted the great Philhellene Lord Byron, who visited in 1809, accompanied by his friend John Cam Hobhouse. The poet was inspired by this visit to write -among other things- the following verses: Yet there I've wandered by the vaulted rill; Yes! Sighed o'er Delphi's long deserted shrine, where, save that feeble fountain, all is still. At the same time he noticed the signatures of other visitors on the ancient columns, in second use at the monastery of Panagia; among these was the signature of Lord Aberdeen (later Prime Minister), whom Byron accused, as he did with Lord Elgin, for the mutilation and steeling of antiquities. His disgust, however, did not prevent him from leaving his own signature on the marble of the same column, nowadays standing in the Gymnasium at Delphi. The first decades of the Greek state After the foundation of the modern Greek state following the Greek War of Independence, the care for antiquities was a primary concern in the country. Several sculptures found in situ in Delphi were transported to the first museum founded by governor Capodistria in Aegina. However, there was a demand for creating a museum in Delphi itself. Plans for the excavation of the entire area existed since the 1860s, but the poverty of the Greek state made this impossible. Meanwhile, the foreign travelers continued to visit Delphi, among them the French poet and author Gustave Flaubert, who visited the site in 1851. The increasing numbers and influence of visitors possibly contributed to the final achievement of a deal between the French and Greek state, which ended up in the expropriation of the village Kastri, the relocation of the inhabitants and the implementation of the Great Excavation in Delphi.

He has received many fellowships including those from the Marshall Scholarship Foundation, Guggenheim Foundation, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. He was a policy adviser in the Office of the Secretary of Defense between 2010-11. Keefe has written investigative reports on a broad array of topics and issues during his career. Topics included a conflict over ownership of iron reserves in Guinea, policy complications faced by states legalizing recreatational marijuana, and the capture of Mexican drug lord Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n Loera. Keefe's 2013 story in the New Yorker, titled \\"A Loaded Gun\\", on the personal history of mass shooter Amy Bishop received the National Magazine Award for Feature Writing. In addition to winning the National Magazine Award in 2014, he was also nominated for \\"The Hunt for El Chapo\\" in 2015 and for \\"Where the Bodies are Buried\\" in 2016 about a woman that was disappeared in Northern Ireland. Keefe is the host of the 2020 podcast \\"Wind of Change\\", which explores a rumor that the song Wind of Change by the Scorpions was secretly written by the CIA, rather than by the band's lead singer, Klaus Meine.  Books  Keefe's The Snakehead reported on Cheng Chui Ping and her Snakehead gang in New York City that operated between 1984 and 2000. Keefe described how Ping illegally smuggled immigrants from China into the United States on a massive scale through cargo ships. The book included interviews with several of those immigrants where they describe their lives in the United States. In 2000, Ping was arrested by the United States government and sentenced to 35 years in prison for her part in leading these operations. Janet Maslin of the New York Times described The Snakehead as a \\"formidably well-researched book that is as much a paean to its author‚Äôs industriousness as it is a chronicle of crime.\\" In Chatter: Dispatches From the Secret World Of Global Eavesdropping, Keefe described how American security agencies, including the National Security Agency, eavesdrop on communications between individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism to determine the likelihood of terrorist attacks occurring in the near future. Keefe describes the electronic intelligence gathering apparatus for detecting this communication, often referred to as \\"chatter\\", which he examines in the context of the September 11 attacks. In a review of the book for The New York Times, William Grimes states that \\"Mr. Keefe writes, crisply and entertainingly, as an interested private citizen rather than an expert.\\" He won the 2019 National Book Critics Circle Award (nonfiction) for Say Nothing.

History =The Crucified= Chaffin started his musical career in the Christian hardcore band, The Crucified. Chaffin founded the band along Guitarist Greg Minier, Bassist Kirk Palmer, and Vocalist Wayne Stonecipher in Fresno, California. The band formed in 1984 as K.G.B. Before the band changed their name to the Crucified, Lead Vocalist Wayne Stonecipher left the band and was replaced by Mark Salomon. The name, The Crucified, came from Chaffin thinking of random names that would fit a Christian band. The Crucified added the Bible verse to the name whenever they wrote it. \\"For I have been crucified with Christ, therefore I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.\\" Soon after, Bassist Kirk Palmer quit the band in 1986, and was replaced by his brother Trevor. The band's first demo, Take Up Your Cross was recorded in 1986. Trevor Palmer quit the band in 1988 and was replaced by Mark Johnson, formerly of Martyr. The band recorded their debut self-titled album in 1988 and was released in 1989, before Johnson was fired from the band. Soon after firing Johnson the band recruited Bassist Jeff Bellew. The band recorded their second album, The Pillars of Humanity in 1991. The band disbanded in 1993, and played a reunion/final show on the Cornerstone Festival 1995 bill. In 2009, the band reunited and released a Compilation on Tooth and Nail Records. =Fasedown= Fasedown formed back in 1998 when Chaffin and lead guitarist Mike Phillips (Deliverance, prior endorsements with Jackson guitars, The Sacrificed) got together with some ideas to bring a heavy style of music to the scene with a Christ-centered message. In 1999 front man Devin Shaeffer (Once Dead) was asked to officially join the band. Fast forward to 2005, after a short break, the band self-released their second album Blitz of Anguish. Fans were delighted with the expansion upon the earlier ideas of the band and many more shows were played. In 2007, the band decided to call it quits while Jim and Devin going to Once Dead, writing the album Visions of Hell. In 2009, the band reconvened to discuss the idea of a Fasedown reunion to see how things would go and gauge fan interest. The band is currently working on new material for a third and it was targeted to be released in late 2010. =Once Dead= In 2006, after their release of the DVD, Return With A Vengeance, Chaffin joined the band, Once Dead to take over the drum position Glen Mancaruso had left vacant. In 2007, Once Dead started recording their album Visions of Hell with Chaffin on drums. The album didn't get released until 2008, due to the band's Lead Guitarist, Larry Farkas, leaving in the final process of recording. After the release of the album, the band has been inactive. =Deliverance= Chaffin joined the Christian Thrash Metal band Deliverance in 1990 when original drummer Chris Hyde left the band. Chaffin was only in the band for a brief time, but later rejoined in 2014 as a new lineup. The lineup included founder and Brainchild vocalist and guitarist Jimmy P. Brown II, guitarist George Ochoa, and bassist Victor M√°ci√°s. The band began writing and recording their new album, The Subversive Kind, which Chaffin, Brown and Macias wrote primarily. Ochoa departed from the band, being replaced by Glenn Rogers. However, Minier, Chaffin'a former bandmate, recorded some of the solos on the album. =Other projects= Chaffin played drums on Left Out's Pride Kills album, Mortal's Live album, and Lifesavers Underground's PTSD album. He has played on four albums for the Christian punk band The Blamed. As of 2014 he was playing with The Satire. Personal life Chaffin is married to Stacey Chaffin and has three children. He currently resides in Fresno, California.

The Peabody Museum sponsored DeHarport to work at Canyon de Chelly National Monument during his PhD candidacy. He spent the summers of 1948-1951 and 1957-1959 surveying the Monument. DeHarport would later go on to write a four volume dissertation entitled, \\"An Archeological Survey of Canyon de Chelly,\\" based on data gathered 367 sites in Canyon de Chelly. It included 2,600 photographs of petroglyphs that DeHarport started taking in 1959 with a Leica 35mm camera.Johnson, Richard J. (1993, October 19). Denverites Pair up to Capture Fading Canyon Rock Art. The Denver Post, pp. 1E. DeHarport held numerous jobs that would inform his later work. In 1953, he photographed low-relief sculpture at Chichen Itza, in the Yucat√°n Peninsula, in Mexico with the Carnegie Institute. In 1955, DeHaport again put his doctoral studies at Harvard on hold to spend several months photographing sites in India‚Äôs Ajanta Caves on behalf of UNESCO. After completing his PhD, DeHarport took a position with the Navajo Claims Commission in Winslow, Arizona. In 1962, DeHarport began work as a research associate at the Museum of Northern Arizona, during which time he returned to Canyon de Chelly to document archaeological sites. In 1963, DeHarport dedicated himself full-time to art photography, chiefly shooting the landscapes of the Southwest. In the early 1980s, he began working with fellow photographer, Bill O'Connor, to document all of Canyon de Chelly's rock art in both black-and-white and color. This project continued into the early 1990s, and the two photographers mounted exhibitions of their work at the Denver Art Museum and Denver's Native American Trading Company. During the late 1980s, DeHarport's interest also turned toward eastern Colorado, a subject close to the photographer‚Äôs heart.

It is a stone arch bridge that formerly carried Mill Street (or Hi-Lo Biddy Road) across Sacketts Brook, about east of United States Route 5. It was built in 1906 by James Otis Follett, an area stonemason, and is one of a few surviving examples of his work. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Sacketts Brook Stone Arch Bridge spans Sacketts Brook in a wooded ravine a short way east of the center of Putney village. The road it formerly carried (now truncated at each end) is designated Mill Street on the west side and Hi-Lo Biddy Road on the east side of the brook. The bridge has a single span, supported by a segmented arch long. It rises about above the stream, and has a roadway width of , sufficient for a single lane of modern traffic. The arch is formed out of mortared granite blocks, with a slightly projecting keystone at the top of the arch. The stones are laid in a mostly regular pattern, and the bridge spandrels are filled in with more irregularly-laid stone. Three layers of stone are laid on top of the arch, above which is the gravel roadbed. The bridge abutments and adjoining wing walls are of irregularly coursed rubblestone laid without mortar. The bridge was built in 1906 by James Otis Follett, a mason from nearby Townshend. Follett is documented to have built more than 40 bridges and culverts, all at a time when stone bridges were falling out of fashion, supplanted by ironwork bridges. Of these works, this bridge was one of eleven documented to survive at the time of its listing on the National Register in 1976. The bridge was closed to vehicular traffic in 1996, and its abutments and wing walls were described as threatened by erosion in a 2000 report.

It was wound up in 2018. The Durand Educational Trust is a related private company, that is still extant. Assets of Durand Academy Trust, including the land and the school buildings were passed over to the Durant Educational Trust before Durand Academy Trust was liquidated. London Horizons, is a wholly owned the company that has built and manages a leisure centre on Durand Educational Trust land. Description Durant Primary School was a Victorian ‚Äòtriple-decker‚Äô constructed following the 1870 Elementary Education Act (sometimes referred to as The Forster Act) which provided primary education for all children aged five to 13. It was one of 62 primary schools extant in the London Borough of Lambeth built in the residential district of Stockwell, between Liberty Street and Hackford Road. Vincent van Gogh lived on Hackford Street in 1873-4 and has given his name to a local street and the successor school. Blue plaque History The land and buildings of the Durand primary school site in Stockwell were owned by Lambeth Council until it forcibly academised in 2010 and became the single school in the Durand Academy Trust. Immediately, the buildings were transferred to the ownership of a related private company, the Durand Educational Trust. The headteacher, Sir Greg Martin used the new financial freedom to build a leisure centre. This sort of evangelic entrepreneurship was applauded by the more dogmatic Conservative Cabinet ministers, and in particular found favour with Michael Gove. The trust awarded Martin with a salary which drew criticism across the educational press. This was discussed at UK Parliament Public Accounts Committee in January 2015. =Sussex Boarding School= Durand Academy Trust opened a satellite boarding school in Sussex in September 2014. The trust repeatedly failed to obtain the planning permission needed to develop the site, and ran at a loss. Initially this was funded by profits from the leisure centre business but had relied on the promise of funding of ¬£17 million from the DfE to help support the boarding school project, which would have been the first of its kind in England. Schools Week reported in February 2016 that this satellite boarding school was in a deficit of ¬£476,000 after one year. After three years it was sold and the Trust wrote off 1.6 million pounds that it had spent on lease adjustments and furniture and fittings. =Ofsted= Ofsted had described this as a good school in its inspection of 2013, but was called in again, due to concerns, in 2015 when the school had expanded and had the boarding school extension, which technically is not considered a separate school. It had gone from being a 3-13 school on two sites to being a 3‚Äì16 on three sites. A full inspection confirmed the fears and reported that its previous recommendations had been ignored and the school was now inadequate and the management was weak and did not have the capacity to make the necessary changes. Its strength were in KeyStage 2, student behaviour and nutrition. The school took Ofsted to court and won, Ofsted have appealed to a higher court. On the strength of this judgement the Secretary of State ordered that the school should be closed, and rebrokered, the assumed new sponsor was the Harris Federation. =Rescue= It was assumed that the school would be rebrokered going from the Durand Academy Trust to the Harris Federation. The Education and Skills Funding Agency ruled that the buildings should be passed back to Lambeth Council at zero cost. Harris pulled out on discovering the complexity of the land ownership and leasing, and the risky legal agreements with Durand Educational Trust. :‚ÄúDespite frequent requests since being asked by the DfE to bring Durand into the Harris Federation, governors of the school only provided us with the financial, legal and capital information we needed for our due diligence last month,‚Äù(May 2018) a Harris spokesperson said. :‚ÄúOur finance board, which has experience of delivering 44 highly successful academies, reviewed this information and judged that we could not proceed.‚Äù Since the school was rebrokered, the Durand Educational Trust no longer owns the school building, but still retains control of the land and the other buildings onsite. Instead the school was accepted by the Dunraven Educational Trust who were assisted by Harris. It has been rebranded as the Van Gogh Academy.

The Walters Art Museum Edward Dalton Marchant (1806-1887), also known as Edward D. Marchant and E. D. Marchant, was an American artist. He was born in Edgartown, Massachusetts in 1806. Largely self-taught, Marchant began his career as a house painter, establishing a portrait studio in Edgartown by the mid-1820s. Marchant is known to have studied briefly with artist Gilbert Stuart in Boston in 1825, familiarizing himself with the artist's style. Marchant began an early, peripatetic career by late 1826 advertising his services in a Charleston, South Carolina newspaper, but returned to Edgartown in 1828-1829. He would soon after relocate to Worcester, Massachusetts, painting some of the city's prominent citizens. Marchant was active in New York City after 1832, completing many portraits of well-to-do merchants and political leaders during the 1830s and 1840s; in addition, he completed commissions in several Ohio cities as well as in Nashville and New Orleans, before settling in Philadelphia in 1854 where he would remain for another thirty years.Johns, Elizabeth; Martinez, Katharine. Philadelphia's Cultural Landscape: The Sartain Family Legacy. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 2000, pp. 63-68.

Accessed December 29, 2015. Although mostly known for his portraits in oil, Marchant also created miniatures. He was elected to a number of arts academies and exhibited regularly during his lifetime. An ardent opponent of slavery who advocated for the return of slaves to Africa, Marchant was commissioned by the Union League of Philadelphia in December 1862 to paint a portrait of Abraham Lincoln to be displayed in Independence Hall. Marchant worked in the White House for several months in early 1863, having daily contact with the President, and ultimately depicted him seated at a table having just signed the Emancipation Proclamation. Marchant said that his painting \\"triumphantly gives lie to those hideous caricatures of Mr. Lincoln\\" which were at the time widely circulated in the hostile press. Authorized reproductions of Marchant's somewhat idealized portrait were widely circulated prior to the 1864 presidential election, and printed at a rate of 1,000 per day. Another 1864 Marchant portrait of Lincoln is featured today in the Lincoln Room of the President's Guest House (known as Blair House) in Washington, D.C., where it may be viewed by visiting dignitaries. Marchant died in Asbury Park, New Jersey on August 15, 1887.

It is an erect shrub with bright green leaves and white, pink or lilac flowers. Description Eremophila christophori is an upright shrub usually growing to high and wide. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and more or less overlap each other. They are elliptic to lance-shaped, mostly long and about wide, mostly glabrous and bright green, sometimes faintly purple. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils and lack a stalk. There are 5 linear, green sepals with the top sepal greatly reduced in size while the other 4 sepals are long and overlap each other. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is white, blue, or a shade of pink to lilac- coloured, covered on the outside with short hairs while the inside is filled with spidery hairs. Flowering occurs for most of the year but mainly in spring to mid-summer and is followed by fruits which are dry, oval to cone-shaped, wrinkled and long. Eremophila christopheri growth habit Taxonomy and naming Eremophila christophori was first formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1875 and the description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (christophori) honours Christopher Giles, the collector of the type specimen. Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs in a band extending east north east from the MacDonnell Ranges west of Alice Springs to the border with Queensland where it grows in sandy soils often over laterite or limestone on low hills. Conservation status Eremophila christophori is listed as \\"of least concern\\" by the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Use in horticulture This eremophila is rarely without flowers in the garden. It is hardy and some specimens have been in cultivation for more than 30 years. It can be propagated from cuttings or grafted onto Myoporum. Although it prefers well drained soil it will grow in heavier soils to produce a more open plant. It is drought hardy, tolerates light frost and is fast growing in well-drained soil in a sunny position.

Their hairstyles can vary by the adoption of hair twists, braids or even dreadlocks. Not everyone who wears their natural hair chooses to forgo all (non-chemical) forms of straightening or styling. Additionally, \\"being natural\\" does not necessarily indicate a strict adherence to any particular type of product or styling regimen; nor should it be tied exclusively with certain social or political beliefs.

However, among black women, 98% have had their hair straightened at least once in their lives, and relaxers have represented no less than 70% of the cosmetic purchases carried out by the population. In the 1980s‚Äì1990s, hair straightening was mainstreamed. During the 1970s‚Äì1980s, the ‚Ä≤Jheri curl‚Ä≤, another technique to loosen tightly curled hair, became fashionable in the African American community, popularized especially by some celebrities such as Michael Jackson, seen in the music video for his song Thriller. During these same years, a new hairstyle appeared too: dreadlocks (naturally matted hair locks), popularized by Bob Marley and more generally by reggae music and the Rastafarian movement. This hairstyle can be a mark of social and spiritual distinctions: \\"The adoption of long or very atypical hair [can reflect] rebellion or a refusal of the dominant values.\\"Juliette Sm√©ralda, Peau noire, cheveu cr√©pu : l'histoire d'une ali√©nation, Jasor, 2004 Ashanti African comb (Ghana).upright=.6thumb In the period between the 1960s‚Äì1970s, the racial segregation between the black and the white reigned in the United States.

In the ancestral traditions, hairdressing was \\"an activity during which the genealogies' history and many other cultural features were taught to children. Every African hairdressing was codified according to the ethnic group and by status.\\" Hair is a very important aspect of African life. The thickness and healthiness of the hair mirrors positive attributes from the culture for both women and men. Normally it is the elders who style the all of the hair in one's family and it is important for the others to learn how to do so. The tradition of braiding and styling hair is so sacred that there are actually a lot of rules and guidelines for it including: when and where to style, differences based on gender, different rituals and customs. The independent documentary film My Nappy Roots: A Journey Through Black Hair-itage was released in 2005. The highly acclaimed film won multiple awards and played on the college circuit. With years of research, the film historically looked at the word \\"nappy.\\" My Nappy Roots chronicled over 400 years (and 200 hours of footage) of Afro hair culture starting in Africa through the middle passage, reconstruction the creation of the Black hair industry to the year 2008. The documentary postulated the word 'nappy' derived from the word 'nap', which was the name of the small cotton balls inside of a cotton plant. The word 'nappy' was born because it resembled the texture of unkempt Afro-textured hair. In an effort to be more acceptable socially, it was more desirable to have straight hair like the dominant culture. The release of Chris Rock's 2009 comedy documentary Good Hair further popularized the concept of nappy hair and the use of chemical relaxants to audiences that were previously unaware of its meaning.

Each woman has her own reason to retrieve her authenticity; some of them want to preserve their hair against aggressive hair styling methods such as weaves being too tight or harmful straightening chemical products. Other women simply prefer their natural hair in spite of the pressure from the dominant aesthetics.Jeune Afrique, Mode : La vague ¬´ Nappy ¬ª d√©ferle en Afrique, 6 November 2014 The natural hair movement has been encouraged by some stars who have abandoned straightening, allowing their natural hair to make a comeback. Prominent examples of notable women in the natural hair movement are Erykah Badu, Lupita Nyong'o, Solange Knowles, Janelle Mon√°e, and Viola Davis. In 2014 The Curly Girl Collective held their first CurlFest, a now annual festival held in Brooklyn, NY that celebrates natural hair. Outside the US, several events have developed in order to accompany the natural hair movement, particularly in France and in Africa: *The salon Boucles d'√©b√®ne: A demonstration, has existed for ten years, dedicated to the black hairdressing and beauty.R√©seau Outre-Mer premi√®re, Aline Tacite, fondatrice du salon Boucles d'√âb√®ne : \\"Nous ch√©rissons nos cheveux cr√©pus, fris√©s, boucl√©s et ondul√©s\\", 30/05/2015Juliette Sm√©ralda, Du Cheveu d√©fris√© au cheveu cr√©pu, Broch√©, December 2012Le Monde, Salon Boucles d‚Äô√©b√®ne (30 May ‚Äì 1st June), 27 May 2015 *The Miss Nappy Paris‚Ä≤ competition: The election of \\"Miss Nappy\\" so as to promote the Afro hair beauty.FashizBlack, Oc√©ane Lebubura √©lue Miss NAPPY Paris 2015, 4 December 2014 *The Massalia Nappy Days: Lectures, projections of documentaries and fashion shows.Mediapart, 1√®res Massalia Nappy Days : Marseille sous le signe de la cr√©ativit√© et de la beaut√© au naturel, 17 September 2014 *The Cr√©pue d'√©b√®ne Festival at Abidjan (Ivory Coast): Dedicated to the natural beauty of the African woman and to the highlighting of the nappy hair.FashizBlack, Abidjan accueille ¬´ Cr√©pu d‚ÄôEb√®ne ¬ª, son 1er festival d√©di√© aux cheveux naturels, 12 August 2014 *The Natural Hair Academy: Event to better understand the nappy hair, days of advice by speakers.Elle Belgique, La Natural Hair Academy : le rendez-vous des nappy girls, 17 March 2014 *The AfricaParis Festival: Dedicated to the \\"Afropean\\" culture. On July 3, 2019, California became the first US state to prohibit discrimination over natural hair. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the CROWN Act into law, banning employers and schools from discriminating against hairstyles such as afros, braids, twists, and dreadlocks. Likewise, later in 2019 Assembly Bill 07797 became law in New York state; it \\"prohibits race discrimination based on natural hair or hairstyles.\\" Erykah Badu 2008.07.14 004.jpgErykah Badu at a concert in July 2008.

An industry that was once worth an estimated $774 million, relaxer sales have gone down 26% over the last five years, 2013 numbers report. Relaxer sales have fallen to 38% between 2012 and 2017. Sales are estimated to decrease to 45% by 2019. Women who wear their hair natural are now spending more money on products that will achieve the best result for their hair, and hair care suppliers and markets are taking note. Black consumers represent a lucrative market for hair care suppliers, so the brands now have to adjust for the new hair movement. Brands have greatly lowered their production of relaxers and instead now produce more natural-friendly products. In choosing what products to consume, black consumers rely heavily on social media to gauge results from others who have gone natural. They have done this by the use of YouTube videos as tutorials on how to use products efficiently and create reviews for potential consumers to watch. Popular brands and products include Shea Moisture, DevaCurl, and Carol's Daughter. Controversy Many women of African descent have faced opposition from wearing their hair in naturally curly styles or other non-straight, protective styles. Many women have found that they are treated unjustly based on having naturally afro-textured hair. Natural hair can be deemed as \\"unprofessional\\", turning it into a fireable offense. For example, a 12-year-old student at a Florida Christian school with natural hair \\"was given one week to decide whether to cut her hair or leave the academy that she has attended since third grade\\" after she complained to school officials about being bullied by other students. In March 2014, the United States Department of Defense issued a set of guidelines that banned all afros, dreadlocks, braids, and twists that were greater than \\" in diameter. Guidelines such as these clearly disproportionately affect and target those of African descent. They later rolled back the guidelines that same year in August by allowing two-strand twists. The Army increased the size of permissible braids and removed the word \\"unkempt\\" from their guidelines. In April 2016, a female Zara employee in Toronto was reprimanded for wearing her hair in a braided hairstyle, which resulted in her filing a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission. Hair appropriation/cultural appropriation has been an issue within the natural hair community. Many non-women of color especially celebrities, often wear African-American hair styles, which some have found offensive. Giuliana Rancic apologized to actress Zendaya Coleman‚Äîwho wore dreadlocks on the 2015 Oscars red carpet‚Äî after commenting that Zendaya's hair must have smelled of \\"patchouli oil or weed\\". It was pointed out that Rancic had praised dreadlocks as \\"edgy\\" when worn by Kylie Jenner, who is white. Kim Kardashian wore Fulani braids (originating from the Fulani tribe of West Africa) on three different occasions without acknowledging the origin of these braids. She referred to them as 'Bo Derek' braids' after Bo Derek, an actress from the 1980s who wore Fulani braids in the 1979 film 10. Kardashian received backlash especially from the black community but did not acknowledge the response. The idea of non-black women wearing natural hair styles remains controversial. Terminology Several words are frequently used in the vocabulary of the natural hair movement:Le Point, Nappy, ce mouvement conqu√©rant de la plan√®te afro, 19 December 2014L'Express, Parlez-vous le nappy?, 3 October 2012Hellocoton, Le lexique Nappy , 21/0 April 2013Audrey Davis-Sivasothy, The Science of Black Hair: A Comprehensive Guide to Textured Hair, SAJA Publishing Company, 11 April 2014Leslie DuBois, Natural Beauty, Little Prince Publishing, 21 September 2014 ;Creamy crack: Chemical relaxers. The term was coined with the thought that the use of relaxers is addictive for those women who strive for a permanently straight hair texture. ;Coily: The texture characteristic of natural Type 4 hair, whereby the configuration of the strand resembles a small-diameter ink pen spring. ;Coils: A hairstyle achieved by taking small sections of wet or very damp hair and smoothing, while rotating the sections, one by one, from root to tip. Tiny styling combs or a finger are typically used. ;Big chop:Cutting one's chemically straightened hair to let it grow in its natural texture. ;Bantu knot: Hairstyle that consists of twisted hair rolled up into small buns. See Jada Pinkett Smith as Niobe in The Matrix series. ;Transition:Period of time when one is transitioning from straightening their hair with heat/and or chemical products to wearing hair in its natural state. ;Protective hairstyle:Hairstyle that protects natural hair from the elements. Includes braids, extensions, wigs, and weaves. See Janet Jackson in Poetic Justice (film). ;TWA (Teeny Weeny Afro): Short Afro haircut. See Viola Davis. ;Twists: Double strands of hair wrapped around each other. ;Twist out: Hairstyle where twists are unraveled. See Corinne Bailey Rae. ;Frohawk: Hairdressing similar to the mohawk hairstyle. ;Shrinkage:Because natural hair is typically has different types of curls and textures, in its natural state it appears shorter than it would straightened. ;Co-wash: Washing one's hair with conditioner instead of shampoo. ;Wash and go:wash one's hair and going on about one's day. This means there is no drying or styling involved and the application of product is minimal (usually a moisturizer or anti-frizz serum). The wash and go is also sometimes referred to as the \\"shake and go\\" which further emphasizes the lack of actual styling involved. The goal of a wash and go is to define natural curls. ;Braids:Hairstyle where hair is braided with extensions or with natural hair. ;Braid out:Braids are unraveled. ;Dreadlocks:Matted or sculpted ropes of hair. ;Senegalese twists :Also known as rope twists where synthetic hair is used and twisted in with the natural hair. ;Afro:A hairstyle created by combing the hair away from the scalp, allowing the hair to extend out from the head in a large, rounded:shape, much like a cloud or ball. ;Kinky Hair:Tightly curled hair, tightly coiled hair or hair without defined curls. ;Box Braids:A form of protective styling done through braiding synthetic hair along with real hair. This promotes hair growth and protects hair from breakage and other damaging factors. ;CornRows:A style of braiding/plaiting hair into narrow strips to form geometric patterns on the scalp. A form of protective styling. ;Protective Style:Any coiffure configuration that keeps hair ends safely tucked away. These hairdos require very little daily upkeep and help strands stay moisturized. Hair Porosity Natural hair can have low, high, or medium porosity. Low porosity hair cuticles are very tightly closed and don't absorb water or product easily. High porosity hair cuticles are very open and absorb water and product easily. Medium porosity is more balance and absorbs water, product, and moisture easily. In order to best treat naturally curly hair, celebrity hairstylist Andre Walker created a hair typing system. This categorizes hair into four categories based on how tight curls are coiled.

He has exhibited his work in Argentina as well as abroad. He mainly focuses on urban exploration, travel, and architectural photography. Biography Sergio Castiglione was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He participated in a large number of activities related to creative art and culture. While at the University of Buenos Aires, he was assistant curator for the exhibition of the 50th anniversary of the National Academy of Fine Arts (MNBA) (1985) and, later on, assistant curator of the Palanza Award (1986), working for architect Alberto Bellucci in both cases. As architecture reporter Mr. Castiglione wrote for El Cronista, La Naci√≥n, Summa magazine, and D&D; (1986‚Äì1990), among others, and was appointed correspondent in Europe and the USA as member of a team led by Carlos L.

This study was shot in the intimacy of his home using everyday utensils such as a fork, a knife and a spoon on a white tablecloth. Sergio Castiglione peruses the existential condition through an intense description of human relationships in today's world. Right up front, this series looks like a black and white photo study; however, these are color photographs of practically single-color objects. Looking up close, color can be discovered in sparkling lights and reflections of the sky on the silverware. Simples Relaciones Complejas was exhibited in several art centers out of which Art Hotel, Buenos Aires (2012), Consigo Art gallery, San Pablo (2013) and Centro Cultural Recoleta, Buenos Aires (2015) are worth mentioning. 453x453px =Espejos Urbanos ‚Äì Otra forma de mirar Buenos Aires= left Probably the most renowned Castiglione series, Espejos Urbanos ‚Äì Otra forma de mirar Buenos Aires (Urban Mirrors, a different way to see Buenos Aires) comprises works which are a singular tour along the architectural landmarks of the fifteen districts of the city of Buenos Aires. The author decided to capture buildings, bridges and monuments through their reflections on water, ponds, fountains or just puddles. These mirror images on the water are spirited metaphors that take us back to our first surreal experiences at young age. Castiglione scouts the changing urban landscape and buildings by discovering a \\"new\\" territory. First exhibited in the Honor Hall at the Legislative Palace of the city of Buenos Aires (2012), the photographs toured the city along places such as the Museum of Architecture and Centro Cultural Recoleta (2013). In 2014 the exhibition visited several museums and art galleries in Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre and Florianopolis in Brazil. In 2015 it was displayed in New York and Atlanta in the USA and 2016 was the turn of Miami, USA and Milan, Italy. In 2015 a book named after the exhibition was published with the fifteen works together with short descriptions of the architectural sites selected. The reviews were written by Luis Grossman, Carlos Dibar, Fabiana Barreda and Grace Bayala. Antefixa Ediciones was in charge of publishing this book under the Patronage Law of the Government of the city of Buenos Aires.

Design and manufacture  RML 16 pdr 12 cwt gun barrel diagram, 1877 The gun consisted of an 'A' tube of toughened steel, over which was shrunk a 'B' tube of wrought iron. The gun was rifled using the system developed by William Palliser, in which studs protruding from the side of the shell engaged with three spiral grooves in the barrel. The gun was fitted with a set of side sights on each side of the barrel. This enabled the gun to be sighted for indirect, or direct fire, from either side of the gun. A flat surface was machined on top of the barrel for a clinometer to be used, enabling the gun to be levelled, or to provide an alternate method of indirect sighting. The gun was designed for land service only, with no naval variants. Two marks of field carriage were produced, which only slightly differed in design.  Operation  Fully horsed 16-pounder with crew, 1880 The 16-pounder was normally deployed in batteries of six or four guns. Each gun was pulled by a team of six horses. It had a crew of nine men ‚Äì five crew who could be mounted on seats on the limber and gun, three drivers and a gun commander (number one) mounted separately. In addition to each gun, a limbered ammunition trailer was also horse drawn. Field Artillery was designed to move at the same speed as infantry, with Horse Artillery being used where greater speed was required.  Ammunition  16-pounder RML ammunition diagram The 16-pounder used three types of ammunition ‚Äì Common shell (for use against buildings or fortifications), shrapnel shell (for use any Infantry or Cavalry) and case shot (for close range use against 'soft' targets. Ignition was through a copper lined vent at the breech end of the gun. A copper friction tube would be inserted and a lanyard attached. When the lanyard was pulled the tube would ignite, firing the gun. A number of different fuzes could be used enabling shells to either burst at a pre-determined time (and range), or on impact. Guns were fired using a silk bag containing a black powder propellant. A typical rate of fire was one round per minute.  Service history  16 pdr RML Shropshire & Staffordshire Volunteer Artillery, 1897 The 16-pounder 12 cwt Rifled Muzzle Loader was the field gun selected by the Royal Artillery in 1871 to replace the more sophisticated RBL 12-pounder 8 cwt Armstrong gun, which had acquired a reputation for unreliability. The 16-pounder saw action in the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 and the First Boer War of 1881, as well as the Anglo- Egyptian War of 1882, where four Batteries were deployed.Goodrich, Caspar F (Lt Cdr), Report of the British Naval and Military Operations in Egypt 1882, Navy Department, Washington, 1885, p.231 It remained in front-line service with the Royal Artillery until the late 1880s when replaced by the 15-pounder Breech-Loading gun. Many were re-issued to Volunteer Artillery Batteries of Position from 1889, with 16-pounders among 226 guns issued to the Volunteer Artillery during 1888 and 1889.Report on the Account of Army Expenditure from 1888‚Äì1889, The National archives, WO33/50 The 1893 the War Office Mobilisation Scheme shows the allocation of thirty seven Artillery Volunteer position batteries equipped with 16 Pounder guns which would be concentrated in Surrey and Essex in the event of mobilisation.Mobilization Tables for Home Defence, List of Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Units, HMSO, London, 1893 Most remained in use until 1902.

History On 2 May 1720, Raikes, in partnership with William Dicey, founded the Northampton Mercury. A year later, the partners set up a second press in Northgate Street, Gloucester, from where the Gloucester Journal first appeared on 9 April 1722. In September 1725, Raikes and Dicey divided their partnership, Dicey retaining the Northampton press, and Raikes taking sole ownership of the Gloucester Journal press (now moved to premises in Southgate Street) and associated printing business. Raikes' business thrived, despite a change in newspaper duties in 1725, and a number of brushes with the law over articles published under his authority. In 1743, the Gloucester Journal was moved for a second time into larger premises in the Blackfriars area of Gloucester. In 1757, the paper was taken over by Robert Raikes junior.

He served as a member of the Senate of the Netherlands between 1981 and 1991 for the Christian Democratic Appeal. He spent most of his working life at the Nederlandsche Heidemaatschappij, including ten years as its director. Career Hendriks was born on 18 August 1925 in Valkenburg. His father was the head of a primary school who would later serve in the States of Limburg. Hendriks followed his primary school education in Berg en Terblijt. For his high school education he went to the Henric van Veldeke College in nearby Maastricht, which he finished in May 1943. The next year Hendriks joined the regiment Stoottroepen of Limburg, which he was member of until the end of World War II. After the war Hendriks went to the National Agricultural College in Wageningen to study Dutch agriculture. He obtained his degree in 1950. He continued studying agricultural sciences and obtained a doctorate in 1956. Between 1950 and 1956 Hendriks worked for the Welvaartsfonds Suriname where he worked on a project concerning Lelydorp. Hendriks worked in various positions for the Nederlandsche Heidemaatschappij (NHM) between 1957 and 1983. The first six years he was stationed in Congo and later Belgium. Between 1973 and 1983 he was director of the Nederlandsche Heidemaatschappij association, which had been split off from the commercial part of the NHM. Hendriks subsequently became director of the International Institute for Land Reclamation, which he would stay until September 1990. During the 1970s Hendriks also served as chairman of the Nederlands Instituut van Landbouwkundig Ingenieurs (Netherlands Institute of Agricultural Engineers). On 10 June 1981 Hendriks became member of the Senate for the Christian Democratic Appeal. In the Senate he became the party spokesperson for higher education and agriculture. He served until 11 June 1991. Hendriks was made an officer in the Order of Orange-Nassau on 29 April 1992. He died on 6 January 2015 in Oosterbeek, aged 89.

It is an open problem how large such an automaton must be, in the worst case, as a function of the length of the input strings. Example The two strings 0010 and 1000 may be distinguished from each other by a three-state automaton in which the transitions from the start state go to two different states, both of which are terminal in the sense that subsequent transitions from these two states always return to the same state. The state of this automaton records the first symbol of the input string. If one of the two terminal states is accepting and the other is rejecting, then the automaton will accept only one of the strings 0010 and 1000. However, these two strings cannot be distinguished by any automaton with fewer than three states. Simplifying assumptions For proving bounds on this problem, it may be assumed without loss of generality that the inputs are strings over a two-letter alphabet. For, if two strings over a larger alphabet differ then there exists a string homomorphism that maps them to binary strings of the same length that also differ. Any automaton that distinguishes the binary strings can be translated into an automaton that distinguishes the original strings, without any increase in the number of states.. It may also be assumed that the two strings have equal length. For strings of unequal length, there always exists a prime number whose value is logarithmic in the smaller of the two input lengths, such that the two lengths are different modulo . An automaton that counts the length of its input modulo can be used to distinguish the two strings from each other in this case. Therefore, strings of unequal lengths can always be distinguished from each other by automata with few states. History and bounds The problem of bounding the size of an automaton that distinguishes two given strings was first formulated by , who showed that the automaton size is always sublinear.. Later, proved the best upper bound known, , on the automaton size that may be required.. This was improved by to .. There exist pairs of inputs that are both binary strings of length for which any automaton that distinguishes the inputs must have size . Closing the gap between this lower bound and Robson's upper bound remains an open problem. Jeffrey Shallit has offered a prize of 100 British pounds for any improvement to Robson's upper bound.. Special cases Several special cases of the separating words problem are known to be solvable using few states: *If two binary words have differing numbers of zeros or ones, then they can be distinguished from each other by counting their Hamming weights modulo a prime of logarithmic size, using a logarithmic number of states. More generally, if a pattern of length appears a different number of times in the two words, they can be distinguished from each other using states. *If two binary words differ from each other within their first or last positions, they can be distinguished from each other using states. This implies that almost all pairs of binary words can be distinguished from each other with a logarithmic number of states, because only a polynomially small fraction of pairs have no difference in their initial positions. *If two binary words have Hamming distance , then there exists a prime with and a position at which the two strings differ, such that is not equal modulo to the position of any other difference. By computing the parity of the input symbols at positions congruent to modulo , it is possible to distinguish the words using an automaton with states.

In the early 1970s Elliot was involved with the Daughters of Bilitis and the West Coast Lesbian Conference in California. She became a controversial figure when members of these groups felt she did not qualify as a woman and rejected her inclusion. Daughters of Bilitis Elliott served as vice-president of the San Francisco chapter of the lesbian political group Daughters of Bilitis from 1971 to 1972, during which she served as editor of the chapter's newsletter, Sisters. When she first joined in 1971, her right to join was heatedly debated because of the gender she was assigned at birth. Yet she was accepted and served until late 1972 when accusations of sexual harassment from former friend, lesbian separatist, and anti-trans feminist activist, Bev Jo Von Dohre, led to a decisive vote.; provides context on the accusations The result was 35 to 28 against the inclusion of Elliott, or any trans women, in the San Francisco chapter of the DOB. When Del Martin announced the 35‚Äì28 vote, the editorial staff of Sisters walked out, leaving the group over the decision. West Coast Lesbian Conference Beth Elliott continued her involvement in the women's movement and helped to create the West Coast Lesbian Conference which took place in April 1973. She was on the organization committee and was asked to perform as a singer in the conference's entertainment program. However, on the first night when she took the stage she met considerable opposition. Lesbian separatist group, The Gutter Dykes, had leafleted in protest of Elliott's presence, claiming she was a man, and approached the stage with hostility. Other performers, Jeanne Cordova, Robin Tyler, and Patty Harrison, have stated that they responded by defending Elliott and established the need for a vote on whether Elliott's performance should continue. It took over an hour to count the roughly 1,300 attendees and resulted in a reported two-thirds in favor of Elliott's performance. Some accounts state 3:1 in Elliott‚Äôs favor while others state it as a bare majority. Elliott gave a brief performance and went on to leave the conference. The following day, keynote speaker Robin Morgan gave her address, which she had altered after the events of the previous night. In the speech, titled \\"Lesbianism and Feminism: Synonyms or Contradictions?\\" Morgan referred to Elliott as a \\"gatecrashing...male transvestite\\" and, using male pronouns, charged her as \\"an opportunist, an infiltrator, and a destroyer-with the mentality of a rapist.\\"Robin Morgan, ‚ÄúKeynote Address‚Äù Lesbian Tide. May/Jun73, Vol. 2 Issue 10/11, p30-34 (quote p 32); additional coverage in Pichulina Hampi, Advocate, May 9, 1973, issue 11, p. 4 Post-conference The incident at the West Coast Lesbian Conference, the largest lesbian gathering precedented, left a lasting impression. Not only was Elliott emotionally and socially scarred, but the words defaming her circulated among grassroots lesbian networks and began the 'transsexual rapist' trope.\\" The event was the first time many feminists encountered the question of trans women's inclusion in the movement. Elliott was left ostracized from much of the women's and lesbian community due to the controversial division emerging among feminists. Life and career Beth Elliott has been publishing since the mid 1970s on bisexuality, feminism, the AIDS movement, sex positivity, and transgenderism. Additionally, Elliott is the author of several books published by ENC Press. Her 1996 memoir, Mirrors: Portrait of a Lesbian Transsexual, was described as a ‚Äúclassic in lesbian feminist and transgender/transsexual literary history‚Äù by the Bay Area Reporter. She reprised the book in 2011, adding a new introduction and afterword as well as a chapter recounting of her experience at the West Coast Lesbian Conference. She is also the author of the science fiction novel, Don‚Äôt Call it ‚ÄúVirtual‚Äù published in 2003. She has been involved in political work in support of gay rights and co-founded the Alice B. Toklas LGBT Club. She was elected as a board member for the California Committee for Sexual Law Reform which, in 1975, supported Willie Brown to pass legislation repealing anti-gay sodomy laws in California. She has been a folk musician since the late 1960s and was active in the Haight-Ashbury hippie music scene in the 1970s.

Spacecraft which are specifically designed for this purpose are known as flyby spacecraft, although the term has also been used in regard to asteroid flybys of Earth for example. Important parameters are the time and distance of closest approach. Spacecraft flyby Flyby maneuvers can be conducted with a planet, a natural satellite or a non-planetary object such as a small Solar System body. Planetary flybys have occurred with Mars or Earth for example: *List of Earth flybys *Mars flyby An example of a comet flyby is when International Cometary Explorer (formerly ISEE-3) passed about from the nucleus of Comet Giacobini-Zinner in September 1985. Another application of the flyby is of Earth's Moon, usually called a lunar flyby. The Apollo 13 spacecraft had an exploded oxygen tank, and therefore had to flyby around the Moon. The Artemis 2 and #dearMoon project will include a lunar flyby. =Mars= Illustration of the MarCO 6U cubesat relay flyby probes and technology demonstrators for the Mars InSight lander; the flybys provided bent pipe communication support during the landing in 2018 In regards to Mars flybys, a related concept is a Mars flyby rendezvous, where a spacecraft does not enter orbit but rendezvous before or after a flyby of the planet with another spacecraft. Mars flyby rendezvous was evaluated at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center in the 1960s. At that time NASA developed designs for a combination of a Mars lander, short-stay surface habitat, and ascent vehicle called a Mars Excursion Module (MEM); the ascent stage performed the rendezvous with another spacecraft that did a flyby of Mars without entering orbit or landing. Compared to MOR, a flyby rendezvous means one spacecraft does not have to orbit Mars, so the resources needed on a return journey to Earth are not taken in and out of Mars orbit for example. (See also Mars cycler) Mariner IV flyby of Mars in July 1965 returned more accurate atmospheric data about Mars and much closer views of its surface then previously. Mariner 6 and Mariner 7 flyby of Mars in 1969 caused another breakthrough in knowledge about the planet. The Mariner 6 & 7 infrared radiometer results from he flyby showed that the atmosphere of Mars was composed mostly of carbon dioxide (CO2), and they were also able to detect trace amounts water on the surface of Mars. In 2018, the twin Mars Cube One performed a flyby to relay communication for InSight lander EDL (they were launched towards Mars with the cruise stage carrying the InSight lander). Both MarCOs reached Mars and successfully relayed data during the Entry, Descent, and Landing phase of Insight on November 26, 2018. =Kuiper belt= The New Horizons spacecraft was planning to fly by the Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth on New Year's Day 2019, after its successful flyby of the dwarf planet Pluto in 2015.

New Horizons previously did a flyby of Pluto in July 2015, and that was at about 32.9 AU (astronomical units) from the Sun, while the New Year's Day 2019 flyby of the Kuiper object Arrokoth was at 43.6 AU.

Cassini-Huygens had its first flyby of Titan in October 2004. For further examples of Cassini flybys of Saturn's moons see Timeline of Cassini-Huygens. Cassini conducted many flybys at various distances of the moons of Saturn. It achieved 126 flybys of Titan, and its final close flyby was on April 22, 2017 prior to its retirement.

He was Minister of the Liberated Regions from 1922 to 1924, responsible for efforts to restore the area of northern France that had been devastated by the trench warfare of World War I (1914‚Äì18). He was against appeasement of Germany before the start of World War II (1939‚Äì45) and in favor of stronger defenses and greater armament. However, after the collapse of resistance when Germany invaded France in 1940 he became convinced of the necessity for an armistice to prevent France from again being devastated, and supported the formation of the Vichy government under Marshal Philippe P√©tain. Early years Charles Reibel was born on 29 December 1882 in Vesoul, Haute-Sa√¥ne. His father was an intern in the Strasbourg hospital, grandson of a notary in Rhinau, Bas-Rhin. His mother's family was from Lorraine. He attended the lyc√©e in Nancy for his secondary education, then studied at the faculty of law in Nancy, gaining a doctorate in law. He entered the Paris bar as secretary of the conference. He was an attach√© to Raymond Poincar√© until Poincar√© was elected President of France. He ran unsuccessfully for election to the legislature in 1914. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Reibel was not required to serve but volunteered. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre, the cross of knight of the Legion of Honour and the rank of sous-intendant of the 41st Infantry Division. On 10 July 1915 he was attached to the office of Joseph Thierry, Under Secretary of State for War. National politics On 16 November 1919 Reibel was elected deputy for Seine-et-Oise on the list of the National Democratic Union. On 20 January 1920 he was appointed Under-Secretary of State to the President of the Council, holding office in the cabinets of Alexandre Millerand and Georges Leygues until 16 January 1921. Reibel was reported to be in favor of a proposal by the Mus√©e social supporting \\"the principle of complete equality [of men and women] for all functions, in ministries and central administrations and all departmental and communal administrations, at all levels of the hierarchy.\\" Reibel was appointed Minister of the Liberated Regions in the Poincar√© cabinet from 15 January 1922 to 29 March 1924. He succeeded Louis Loucheur and inherited a mass of outstanding claims and administrative problems that Loucheur had been unable to resolve. The former war zone covered one fourteenth part of France's territory, but before the war had accounted for one fifth of tax revenues. Senator Paul Doumer described it six months after the Armistice as, \\"a desert, a zone of death, assassination and devastation ... There are corpses of horses, corpses of trees covering the corpses of men.\\" The geographer Albert Demangeon called it \\"a zone of death, 500 km long and 10‚Äì25 km broad, following the battle front in which good land has been transformed into a desert, a wild steppe, where the very fields have erupted ... farm buildings need to be restored, agricultural equipment renewed and the fertility of the soil made anew wherever the 'cyclone' has passed.\\" By the time Reibel took office the emergency phase was over, but he confirmed that he was committed to \\"restoring normal life in the towns and villages that fell victim to the invasion.\\" He stated, however, that he would \\"count firmly upon private initiative\\", and would restrain direct employment by the state. He said the government would encourage \\"in every way in its power the individual and collective efforts of the brave people of northern France, notably in the form of reconstruction cooperatives.\\" In the spring on 1922 Reibel toured the \\"desert-like region\\" around Soupir to inspect efforts to restore land of the former \\"red zone\\" to cultivation, and based on what he saw pledged to support measures to continue to shrink the red zone and return its land to cultivation. At the beginning of 1924 Reibel stated that of farmland had been so badly disturbed that it would be many years before it could be brought back under cultivation. He said the state would expropriate this land, compensate the owners, and where possible plant it with trees. He said cultivation would probably be \\"forbidden for tens of years and perhaps even for centuries.\\" Poincar√© toyed with the idea of encouraging Rhineland independence during his ministry, but abandoned the idea. Millerand wanted a bilateral treaty between France and Germany that would cover the Ruhr coal, Lorraine iron ore and security for France on the Rhine. Marshal Foch agreed, and told Reibel, \\"This is a decisive day. It depends on M. Poincar√© whether war becomes impossible between France and Germany. Mark my words. The whole of France's victory is in M. Poincar√©'s hands. If we do not talk with Germany immediately it is an irretrievably lost opportunity.\\" However, Poincar√© refused, thinking that France was still in a strong position, and saying the English would object to discussions with Germany. Reibel was reelected on 11 May 1924, 29 April 1928 and 8 May 1932, but was not asked to join any of the governments in this period. He developed some resentment against Poincar√© for this reason. In 1935 French intelligence considered that the Germans would have offensive capabilities by the next year. During a debate in the chamber Reibel said it would by \\"wise policy\\" to advance \\"the necessary sums to Belgium\\" so she could complete her defenses. He said that in their present incomplete state the Belgian fortifications were \\"really non-fortifications\\" and called on the Minister of War, Louis Maurin, to support financial aid to Belgium. Maurin declined to answer. Reibel ran for election to the Senate in 1935, and was elected in the second round on 23 October 1935 on the National Union list. After the Munich Agreement was signed in September 1938 Pierre-√âtienne Flandin sent a telegram of congratulations to Adolf Hitler. Within an hour Paul Reynaud resigned from the Alliance D√©mocratique. Reibel resigned from the vice-presidency of the party, and violently attacked Flandin at the party congress. World War II During World War II (1939‚Äì45) Reibel was appointed to the Senate army commission. During the Riom Trial Reibel stated that Jacomet, secretary-general of the defense ministry, had prevented the Senate army commission from sending a mission to the front until December 1939. The army commanders at the time were complaining about parliamentary commissioners disrupting the work of the commands and staffs. In February 1940 the deputy Fernand Robbe claimed in a secret session that France had only 800 modern planes with which to oppose 5,000 German planes. He blamed the situation on red tape, bureaucracy and lack of foresight by the government. That month Reibel wrote to √âdouard Daladier to express his \\"anguish\\" about the state of munitions production. By June 1940 Reibel was among a group that had become convinced that an armistice was essential, others being Jean Montigny, Michel Brille, Adrien Marquet and Georges Scapini. He said, \\"I was waiting [in Bordeaux] for government ministers when they came out of sessions and I tried to convince them one by one of the necessity of the armistice. With French resistance collapsing, General Charles de Gaulle went to London on 15 June 1940 to discuss transport for the French government to North Africa or Britain. On 16 June 1940 Winston Churchill agreed to support a declaration of union between France and Britain. Paul Reynaud's council did not accept the proposal. Reibel said that if France continued in the war because of this meaningless union with Britain, which would soon be invaded, the whole of France would be laid waste by the Germans. On 10 July 1940 Reibel voted in favor of granting Marshal Philippe P√©tain full powers. In his 1940 apology Pourquoi et comment fut d√©cid√©e la demande d'armistice (Why and how it was decided to ask for an armistice) Reibel said that General Weygand did not think the Anglo-Americans would be superior to the Germans in air power for several years, especially given that the Germans would be able to draw on French production. He wrote, In March 1942 P√©tain secretly submitted a ministerial list to the German security officials in Paris. Reibel was to be Minister of the Interior. After negotiations in which the Americans were involved the government of Pierre Laval was formed on 26 April 1942, but without Reibel. P√©tain remained head of state, but was no longer prime minister. Last years After the Liberation of France the jury of honor confirmed Reibel's ineligibility for public office due to his vote on 10 July 1940. He died in Paris on 26 June 1966 at the age of 83.

Its ensemble cast includes Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Jack Lowden, Harry Styles, Aneurin Barnard, James D'Arcy, Barry Keoghan, Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy. The film was distributed by Warner Bros. Dunkirk portrays the evacuation from three perspectives: land, sea, and air. It has little dialogue, as Nolan sought instead to create suspense from cinematography and music. Filming began in May 2016 in Dunkirk and ended that September in Los Angeles, when post-production began. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot the film on IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film stock. Dunkirk has extensive practical effects, and employed thousands of extras as well as historic boats from the evacuation, and period aeroplanes. The film premiered on 13 July 2017 at Odeon Leicester Square in London, and was released in the United Kingdom and United States on 21 July in IMAX, 70 mm, and 35 mm film formats. It is the highest-grossing World War II film, making $526 million worldwide. Dunkirk received praise for its screenplay, direction, musical score, sound effects, and cinematography; some critics called it Nolan's best work, and one of the greatest war films. The film received eight nominations at the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards, winning for Best Editing, eight at the 71st BAFTAs, winning for Best Sound, and three at the 75th Golden Globe Awards. At the 90th Academy Awards, it received eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director (Nolan's first Oscar nomination for directing); it went on to win for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Film Editing. Plot In May 1940, during the Battle of France, Allied soldiers have retreated to Dunkirk. Tommy, a young British private, is the sole survivor of a German ambush. At the beach, he finds thousands of troops awaiting evacuation and meets Gibson, who is burying a body. After a Luftwaffe dive-bomber attack, they attempt to get aboard a hospital ship, but are ordered off. The ship is sunk by dive bombers; Tommy saves another soldier, Alex. They get aboard a destroyer, only to have it torpedoed and sunk before it can depart. With a single, vulnerable mole available for embarking on deep- draft ships, the Royal Navy requisitions civilian vessels in Great Britain that can get to the beach. In Weymouth, a civilian sailor Dawson, with his son Peter, sets out on his boat Moonstone, rather than let the Navy commandeer her. Their teenage hand George impulsively joins them. At sea, they rescue a shivering shell-shocked soldier from a wrecked ship. When he realises that Dawson is sailing for Dunkirk, the soldier demands that they turn back and tries to wrest control of the boat; in the scuffle, George suffers a head injury that renders him blind. Elsewhere, three Spitfires, tasked with defending the evacuation, cross the English Channel. After their leader is shot down in a dogfight, one of the pilots, Farrier, assumes command, but the other Spitfire is hit and ditches. Its pilot, Collins, is rescued by Moonstone. Tommy, Alex and Gibson join some soldiers of a Highlanders regiment and hide inside a beached trawler in the intertidal zone outside the Allied perimeter, waiting for the rising tide to refloat it. German troops shoot at the boat, and water enters through the bullet holes. Alex, hoping to lighten the boat, accuses Gibson, who has stayed silent, of being a German spy. Gibson reveals he is French; he stole the identity of the dead British soldier he buried, hoping to be evacuated with the British. The group abandons the boat when it begins to sink, but Gibson is entangled in a chain and drowns. When a nearby minesweeper is sunk by a bomber, Moonstone manoeuvres to take on those in the water, including Tommy and Alex. Peter discovers that George is dead. Asked by the shell-shocked soldier, he lies and says that George is fine. Farrier reaches Dunkirk just as his fuel runs out. Gliding over the beach, he shoots down a dive-bomber, saving ships and troops, and lands beyond the perimeter. He sets fire to his plane before being taken prisoner by the Germans. In all, over 300,000 men are evacuated. Royal Navy Commander Bolton stays to oversee the evacuation of the French. Arriving back in Weymouth, the shell-shocked soldier sees George's body being carried away. Tommy and Alex board a train, and receive a hero's welcome when the train arrives in Woking.

Nolan considered improvising the entire film instead of writing a script, but Thomas convinced him otherwise. In 2015, Nolan wrote a 76-page screenplay, which was about half the length of his usual scripts and his shortest to date. Its precise structure necessitated fictional characters, rather than ones based on eyewitnesses. The story is told from three perspectives‚Äîland (one week of action), sea (one day of action), and air (one hour of action). Nolan structured the film from the point of view of the characters, intending to use visuals rather than dialogue and backstory. He wanted to incorporate the so- called \\"snowball effect\\" that he had previously used only in the third acts of his other films. Nolan said that he approached research as though it were for a documentary, and was attracted to the project because of its inversion of the \\"Hollywood formula\\": the Battle of Dunkirk was not a victory and did not involve American armed forces, but nevertheless demanded a large-scale production. Nolan postponed Dunkirk until he had acquired sufficient experience directing large-scale action films. To convey the perspective of soldiers on the beach, for whom contact with the enemy was \\"extremely limited and intermittent\\", he did not show Germans on screen. He omitted scenes with Winston Churchill and the generals in war rooms, as he did not want to get \\"bogged down in the politics of the situation\\". Nolan showed key members of the crew eleven films that had inspired him: All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), The Wages of Fear (1953), Alien (1979), Speed (1994), Unstoppable (2010), Greed (1924), Sunrise (1927), Ryan's Daughter (1970), The Battle of Algiers (1966), Chariots of Fire (1981), and Foreign Correspondent (1940)‚Äîonly two of which are war films. The historical consultant was author Joshua Levine, who also wrote the book adaptation, Dunkirk: The History Behind the Major Motion Picture. Levine accompanied Nolan while interviewing veterans. During these interviews, Nolan was told a story of soldiers seen walking into the sea in desperation, which he incorporated into the screenplay. The production team and scouting locations were chosen before Nolan and Thomas solicited Warner Bros. Pictures to make the film. Nolan and his production designer Nathan Crowley toured the beach of Dunkirk while location scouting, and decided to film there despite the logistical challenges, discarding Suffolk as an alternative. Crowley set up a makeshift art department in Nolan's old garage, as is tradition, and colourised black-and-white photographs to better understand the visual representation. The design aesthetic was made to look as contemporary as possible. Hoyte van Hoytema, who had previously collaborated with Nolan on Interstellar, was chosen as the director of photography. The Hollywood Reporter stated that Nolan made a deal with Warner Bros. to receive a $20 million salary plus 20% of the box office gross; however, Vanity Fair reported that Nolan agreed to a low upfront salary in exchange for a large backend percentage. Pre-production began in January 2016. For the uniforms, costume designer Jeffrey Kurland aimed to balance historical accuracy with aesthetics that would favour the film stock. As the original heavy wool fabric had not been produced since 1940, it was made from scratch, tailored for the main cast and over a thousand extras. Uniforms were made in a factory in Pakistan and the boots by a shoemaker in Mexico. The costume department then spent three weeks ageing them at Longcross Studios. Each garment was made to look distinct in regiment and personality: Tommy wears a large greatcoat, while Alex dons the Highlander cut. Kurland found references at museums, in contemporary magazines, photo archives, and books. The mole was rebuilt over four months from the original blueprints. Sand was brought from Dunkirk to create make-up consistent with the environment. Oil and tar were specially made and prosthetics were water and fire resistant. =Casting= After first-hand accounts of the evacuation revealed how young and inexperienced the soldiers had been, Nolan decided to cast young and unknown actors for the beach setting. He was also adamant that all of the cast be British. John Papsidera and Toby Whale were the casting directors for Dunkirk. Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, and Mark Rylance were in talks to join the ensemble as supporting characters in late 2015. Fionn Whitehead was cast as the lead in March 2016, while Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, and Harry Styles were added shortly after. Cillian Murphy joined the following month. James D'Arcy, Barry Keoghan, and Tom Glynn-Carney were included later that May. Michael Caine was cast in a spoken cameo role as Fortis Leader, as a nod to his role in the film Battle of Britain (1969). According to D'Arcy and Nolan, Winnant and Bolton act as a Greek chorus to give the audience context. Whitehead went through a secretive auditioning process lasting several months. His character was named after the slang term for the ordinary British soldier. Styles was cast for his \\"old fashioned face\\", as stated by Nolan. He won the role after auditioning against hundreds of candidates, when Nolan was unaware of his renown as a singer. Murphy spoke to Nolan and read about the psychological trauma the soldiers endured, to understand his character's PTSD. Nolan chose Rylance for his work in the theatre and performance in Wolf Hall. As research, Rylance piloted his character's boat every day, listened to audio recordings at the Imperial War Museum, and read accounts of men like Mr Dawson. Between takes, he encouraged rehearsal through improvised scenes. The principal cast members did their own stunts. John Nolan, uncle of Christopher, played Blind Man. =Filming= Moonstone during filming with Nolan, Rylance, Glynn-Carney, and Keoghan on board Principal photography commenced on 23 May 2016 in Dunkirk, planned so as to avoid Bastille Day and coincide with the dates of the real evacuation. Production continued for four weeks in Urk, Netherlands, one week in Swanage and Weymouth in Dorset, United Kingdom, and for two weeks at the Point Vicente Interpretive Center and Lighthouse in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, United States. at the port of Dunkirk during filming Filming in Dunkirk took place at the location of the real evacuation, while the street scenes were shot in nearby Malo-les-Bains because most of the buildings in Dunkirk were destroyed in the war. Shooting times on the beach and mole were determined by tidal patterns. French labour strikes and regulations also affected the schedule. To minimise the need for computer- generated imagery (CGI), cardboard cut-out props of soldiers and military vehicles created the illusion of a large army. Real or scale-model fighter aircraft, and real warships and private boats, provided realism that could not be achieved from CGI. Scale models were created via 3D printing. The mole set was frequently rebuilt after being damaged by bad weather. Because French authorities had prohibited pyrotechnic charges to protect marine life, air cannons were used instead. Six thousand extras were needed in France. Early scenes of the film were shot at Weymouth harbour, and the final scenes at Swanage railway station. Universal Pictures' Falls Lake studio in Los Angeles was used for interior and exterior sets of a sinking ship and plane, with the ship interiors filmed in a water tank using stuntmen. To get acclimatised to cold water scenes, Styles and Whitehead underwent training sessions at Point Dume. MLV Castor was modified to resemble Crowley and marine coordinator Neil Andrea located nearly sixty ships, which Nolan had reconditioned for the shoot. These included the retired French Navy destroyer , which was made to look like a 1940 British warship as there were no wartime British destroyers left with working engines. Three retired Royal Netherlands Navy ships were also used: the minesweeper HNLMS Naaldwijk portrayed , HNLMS Sittard portrayed and , and MLV Castor (a Royal Netherlands Navy armed pilot vessel) portrayed . The motor torpedo boat MTB 102 and the 1930s Norwegian steamer Rogaland were also used. Over fifty other boats included twenty actual Little Ships of Dunkirk, piloted by their owners. A small 1930s motor yacht called Moonstone served for six weeks of filming; its most demanding scenes, with up to sixty people on a boat designed for fewer than ten, were shot on the Dutch lake IJsselmeer to avoid the challenge of the Dunkirk tides. One of the Spitfires repainted for the film Aircraft were equipped with dual cockpits for filming in flight. A Yakovlev Yak-52TW was modified to resemble a Supermarine Spitfire, and two Supermarine Spitfire Mark IAs, a Spitfire Mark VB, and a Hispano Buchon painted to look like a Messerschmitt Bf 109E, were also used for the combat scenes. Large-scale radio controlled model aircraft, including Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 87 bombers, were filmed crashing into the English Channel. The real Spitfires were provided by the Imperial War Museum Duxford, and owner Dan Friedkin piloted the one that was shot landing on the beach in Dunkirk. These takes had to be done within forty-five minutes, before the tide came back in. IMAX cameras were attached to the fighter planes using specially made snorkel and periscope lenses‚Äîin the back and the front‚Äîand large-scale mockups were submerged with cable rigs for a crash scene. Scroggins Aviation and Gateguards UK performed period aviation reconstruction. A Piper Aerostar enabled filming from the air, also with IMAX cameras front and rear. Dogfights over the Channel were shot by an aerial unit based at Lee- on-Solent Airfield. Hardy and Lowden spent the final stages of the shooting schedule on a cliffside in Palos Verdes, inside purpose-built cockpit gimbals, with limited contact with the rest of the cast and crew. Dunkirk wrapped on 2 September 2016, after sixty-eight days. The film was shot in natural lighting using both IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large format film stock in Panavision System 65, with more IMAX footage than in any of Nolan's previous films‚Äîan estimated seventy-five percent. The sparsity of dialogue made it possible for IMAX cameras, which are notoriously noisy, to be used as the primary format. Panavision and IMAX lenses enabled filming at night. For the first time in a feature film, IMAX cameras were used hand-held, which Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard advised as the best way to shoot on vessels. =Post-production= Nolan's regular collaborator Lee Smith returned to edit Dunkirk, beginning in September 2016 after Smith had assembled shots unsupervised while filming was still in progress. Editing took place in Los Angeles with an audio mixing team of eight people. Nolan singled out the editing of the aerial sequences as a particular challenge, likening this to a chess game. Limited computer- generated imagery was applied to improve some scenes, but none consisted entirely of CGI. Weather continuity presented less of a challenge than was expected, with filming both in Europe and California. At least ten to fifteen feature-length versions were cut to further refine the dramatic impact. Once a cut was completed, only then did they apply music. Post-production had fifty- four hours of raw footage to work with. The only usable sounds from production recordings were voices‚Äîeverything else was recreated. Sound designer Richard King sent two sound mixers to audio record the Spitfires at the Imperial War Museum Duxford using twenty-four microphones. Unable to find an actual dive siren of a Stuka dive bomber, King reverse engineered one from old photographs in an attempt to replicate the sound. For scenes in which ships gave out sounds of people in distress, voices were captured using an ADR \\"loop group\\". C-4 and liquid propane were blown up to record sound for the explosions. Also featured were the whistles attributed to German bombs during the Second World War. Bomb noises were made to increase in pitch the closer they got to impact, to stay true to reality. Double Negative undertook the visual effects work. FotoKem, the film laboratory, also handled the release prints. Music Hans Zimmer began working on the score in 2016, continued for eleven months, and eventually created a 100-minute demo. For intensity, the script was written to accommodate the auditory illusion of a Shepard tone, which had previously been explored in Nolan's 2006 film The Prestige. This was coupled with the sound of Nolan's own pocket watch, which he recorded and sent to Zimmer to be synthesised. Additional music was provided by Lorne Balfe, Andrew Kawczynski, Steve Mazzaro, and Benjamin Wallfisch. \\"Nimrod\\" from Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations is part of the theme, which was slowed down to six beats per minute with added bass notes to avoid it sounding sentimental. Instrumentation included a double bass and fourteen cellos played in high register. King relayed to Zimmer the sound of a boat engine, which served as a reference for the tempo. Zimmer visited the Dunkirk set for inspiration, taking back a jar of sand, and chose not to view raw footage whilst composing. The music was recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Hall with mix engineer Geoff Foster. Release The world premiere was on 13 July 2017 at Odeon Leicester Square in London. The film was theatrically released on 21 July, projected on IMAX, 70 mm and 35 mm film. It is the fourth Nolan film to be released in the third week of July, a period in which Warner Bros. Pictures has previously achieved success. It was Nolan's preference that the film opened in July instead of the northern- hemisphere autumn awards season. The film was initially screened in 125 theatres in 70 mm, the widest release in that format in twenty-five years. Dunkirk received a special IMAX screening at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, the first Nolan film to appear at the festival since Following, nineteen years earlier. After its original release of 126 days, the film was re-released in fifty IMAX and 70 mm theatres on 1 December, expanding to 250 additional cities in January 2018. Dunkirk was released digitally on 12 December 2017, and on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and DVD on 18 December in the United Kingdom and 19 December in the United States. =Marketing= The announcement teaser debuted in cinemas ahead of Suicide Squad and was released online on 4 August 2016. According to data analytics firm ListenFirst Media, it generated the most Twitter engagement of any trailer released that week. The first full-length trailer was released on 14 December 2016, alongside a five-minute cinema-exclusive prologue shown before selected IMAX screenings of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Dunkirk was the most discussed film that week according to media measurement firm Comscore. The prologue returned for a week before selected IMAX showings of Kong: Skull Island. Footage from the film was well received at CinemaCon 2017. Warner Bros. aired a TV spot to coincide with the 2017 US national basketball playoffs. The official trailer was released on 5 May 2017, after a countdown on the film's website and four 15-second teasers leading up to it. Dunkirk was again the most discussed film that week according to ComScore. The video game developer Wargaming included in its titles World of Tanks, World of Warships, and World of Warplanes missions and rewards related to the film. On 6 July, Warner Bros. released another trailer, which for the third time was the most discussed film of the week. The prologue was shown at selected Wonder Woman IMAX screenings in July. It also toured three European countries with a mobile cinema. Sue Kroll, president of Warner Bros. Worldwide Marketing and Distribution, said that it was important that Dunkirk be marketed as a summer event movie as opposed to a period war film, to highlight its \\"magnificent scale and originality\\". This strategy was maintained throughout the campaign. To convince audiences that the film was best experienced in theatres, the prologue was never made available online. TV spots were distributed sporadically during sports games and notable television series to establish the film's themes. Social media infographics described the scale and importance of the Dunkirk evacuation. Additionally, a Google 360 Experience interactive adventure, an Amazon Alexa programme, and a 360-degree short film, were created. In partnership with fast food restaurant Carl's Jr., the film was branded on four million cups, as well as pop-ups at nearly 3,000 locations. Research saw the film appeal to twenty percent of infrequent moviegoers. Reception =Box office= Dunkirk grossed $188 million in the United States and Canada, and $337 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $525 million, against a production budget of $100‚Äì150 million. Globally, it is the highest-grossing World War II film (not adjusting for inflation), surpassing Saving Private Ryans $482 million. In the United States and Canada, industry tracking for the opening weekend ranged from Varietys $30‚Äì40 million to Deadline Hollywoods $35 million, while BoxOffice speculated an opening weekend of $55 million, and IndieWire $50 million and $500 million worldwide. Dunkirk made $19.8 million on its first day, including $5.5 million from preview screenings. It went on to finish first at the box office with $50.1 million, marking the third-largest opening for a World War II film (behind Captain America: The First Avengers $62.1 million and Pearl Harbors $59.1 million), as well as the fourth-largest of Nolan's career. In its second weekend, it grossed $26.6 million (a drop of 44.3%), beating newcomer The Emoji Movie to the top spot. The film grossed $17.1 million in its third weekend, second to newcomer The Dark Tower ($19.2 million), and was again second in its fourth week, behind Annabelle: Creation with $10.9 million. The film opened in France on 19 July 2017, and made $2.2 million on its first day. It was released in seven markets the following day, earning an additional $6.3 million, and on 21 July in forty-six more countries, grossing $12.7 million from over ten thousand theatres, including $3.7 million from the United Kingdom. The international debut totalled $55.4 million, including $4.9 million in France, $12.4 million in the UK and $10.3 million in Korea. The film remained number one in the United Kingdom for five weeks. It opened in China on 1 September in the top spot, grossing $30 million from its weekend debut. Its opening weekend in Japan earned $2.9 million from 444 screens. =Critical response= Some critics called Dunkirk Nolan's best film to date and one of the greatest war films ever made. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 453 reviews, with an average of 8.70/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Dunkirk serves up emotionally satisfying spectacle, delivered by a writer-director in full command of his craft and brought to life by a gifted ensemble cast that honors the fact-based story.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 94 out of 100 based on reviews from 53 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". According to MRQE, it has an average rating of 86/100, based on 128 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 88% overall positive score, with 63% saying they would recommend it. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film five out of five and called it Nolan's best to date, saying that he \\"surrounds his audience with chaos and horror from the outset, and amazing images and dazzlingly accomplished set pieces on a huge 70mm screen, particularly the pontoon crammed with soldiers extending into the churning sea, exposed to enemy aircraft\\". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter also lauded the film, calling it \\"an impressionist masterpiece\\" that was \\"deeply moving\\" but without \\"manufactured sentimentality or false heroics\\". He also praised the score, which \\"enormously strengthens the film\\" and \\"incorporates both sound and music to extraordinary effect\\". Peter Debruge of Variety praised the plot (although calling Zimmer's score \\"bombastic\\"), writing: \\"[Nolan has] delivered all the spectacle of a big- screen tentpole, ratcheting up both the tension and heroism through his intricate and occasionally overwhelming sound design\\". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times described the film as a \\"tour de force of cinematic craft and technique\\" and lauded Nolan's elastic approach to narrative. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle called it a \\"triumph\\" and \\"masterpiece\\", commending Nolan's unique approach to directing a war film. The Economist labelled Dunkirk \\"a remarkable film\\" and a new classic. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four and said it was one of the best war movies of the decade, describing it as \\"tight, gripping, deeply involving and unforgettable ... triumph in filmmaking\\". Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an \\"A\\", calling it the best of 2017: \\"By the end of Dunkirk, what stands out the most isn't its inspirational message or everyday heroism. It's the small indelible, unshakeable images that accumulate like the details in the corner of a mural\\". Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film five out of five, lauding it as \\"a work of heart-hammering intensity and grandeur\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone awarded it his first four-star rating of 2017 as \\"maybe the greatest war film ever\\", adding: \\"There's little doubt that [Nolan] has, without sentimentality or sanctimony, raised [the survival film] genre to the level of art...with the resonant force of an enduring screen classic\\". He also called it the first major Oscar contender of the year. Michael Medved awarded it four out of four and called Hardy's performance \\"outstanding\\", and the action \\"seamless\\", declaring: \\"This is not only the best WWII movie since Saving Private Ryan, it is very simply one of the greatest war movies ever made\\". Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave it a score of three and a half out of four, despite not liking the film, stating that he \\"loathed parts of it and found other parts repetitious or half-baked. But, maybe paradoxically, I admired it throughout, and have been thinking about it constantly\\". Jacques Mandelbaum of Le Monde praised the film's realism, but was disappointed that it ignores the part played by French troops. Kevin Maher in The Times gave it two out of five, saying: \\"[Dunkirk] is 106 clamorous minutes of big-screen bombast that's so concerned with its own spectacle and scale that it neglects to deliver the most crucial element‚Äîdrama.\\" He also suggested that Dunkirk felt like a Call of Duty video game. David Cox of The Guardian felt the film had historical inaccuracies, a paucity of female characters, small scale, a thinly characterised cast, and lack of suspense. In the London Review of Books, Michael Wood compared it to the films of Luis Bu√±uel and commended Zimmer's soundtrack as an effective match to the film. In 2018, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers, and critics for Time Out magazine saw it ranked among the \\"100 Best British Films\\" of all time. The same year, The Washington Post named Dunkirk as one of the \\"23 best films of the 2000s\\". Rolling Stone, Total Film, and Quentin Tarantino classified it as one of the best films of the 2010s. =Accolades= The film received the Best Editing award at the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards, and seven further nominations: for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Acting Ensemble, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Score, and Best Production Design. It also won the Best Sound award at the 71st British Academy Film Awards as well as seven nominations: for Best Film, Best Direction, Best Original Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, and Best Special Visual Effects. At the 75th Golden Globe Awards, it received three nominations, for Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama, Best Director, and Best Original Score. At the 90th Academy Awards, it was awarded Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Film Editing, with five further nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design. Historical accuracy The film was noted for its generally realistic representation of the historical evacuation. It accurately depicts a few Royal Air Force planes dogfighting the Luftwaffe over the sea, limited to one hour of operation by their fuel capacity. In 1940, destroyers and fighter planes were indeed held back from battle, as the Royal Navy and Air Force would have been the sole defenders against invasion. Also noted were the accurate depictions of how a small boat attempted to evade aerial attack, and of how soldiers returning to England saw a civilian population largely unaware of or unaffected by the war. British officers did initially refuse to evacuate French soldiers, although Churchill later insisted that the French be evacuated alongside the British. The realism of the film was acknowledged by Dunkirk veterans, although Branagh said that some thought it was \\"louder than the battle\\". Hispano Buchon masquerading as a Bf 109E, wearing a temporary paint scheme for the film Although some events are based on true history, the characters and the storyline are fictional; Branagh's role is a composite character. When the beach scenes were shot, the weather was worse than during the real evacuation; Nolan explained that this helped to understand the danger faced by the pleasure boats. In one scene, an officer gives a salute without wearing his military beret, which a veteran pointed out as inaccurate protocol. To differentiate the German planes, their noses were painted yellow; this was not actually done until a month after Dunkirk. The involvement of French, African and Indian soldiers was either limited or left out. Contemporary shots were used for aerial views of the town, whereas Dunkirk was in ruins by the time of the evacuation. The design of the airborne leaflet propaganda was similar to those used in 1940, although the originals were not in colour.

It started trial operations on 20 October 2015. The tramline consists of 9 stations with three of those allowing interchanges with the Medell√≠n Metro and the Metrocable systems. The Ayacucho Tram is operated by Medell√≠n Metro and is the only (rubber-tyred or otherwise) tram in Colombia. Medell√≠n once had a standard steel-wheeled tramway network. It first was opened as a horse tramway and was later converted to electric trams. Routes were built in stages, and the network reached its maximum size in 1945, served by a fleet of 61 tramcars. However, like most cities around the world during the 1950s and 1960s, the tram service was completely abandoned in 1951. In the late 2000, plans to return trams to Medell√≠n began to come together. The first contracts for the project, to be known as the Tranv√≠a de Ayacucho (Ayacucho Tram), were signed in 2011. It was decided that the new Medell√≠n tramway would uses Translohr vehicles, imported from France, as rubber-tyred trams would be able to handle the line's steep hills better than a conventional steel-wheeled tramway. Construction of the line began in 2012, and delivery of the Translohr vehicles began in 2014. On 13 July 2015, the first test runs took place. Free, limited passenger service began on 15 October 2015, and on 31 March 2016 regular passenger operations officially started.  History  After the closure of the tram network in the 1950s, the people of Medell√≠n thought the only unfashionable obstacle of smooth city traveling had been removed, and the city could move faster than before, but it proved false some years later. The uncontrolled increase in motor vehicles like buses, taxicabs, and private cars started choking the streets of Medell√≠n. Like most South American countries, Colombia was suffering under many problems typically seen in developing countries, including pollution, traffic jam, illegal migration, low literacy and a booming population. The population growth of Medell√≠n led to increasing amount of private cars finding their way to the streets, jamming traffic in the city. The city even became slower than before the ending of tram operations. Beginning in the 1980s, these problems grew severe, and by the mid-1990s, the inhabitants of Medell√≠n realized that the unbridled use of private cars and the closure of the old tram had been a mistake. A metro system was opened in 1995, using a small part of former tram network, and gradually two metro routes were constructed. But for many low density areas, this was not an ideal solution, so the metro was not extended throughout all neighborhoods of Medell√≠n. Many cities around the world like Tunis, Algiers, Sydney, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Dublin, Edinburgh, Athens, etc. all faced similar problems at the time, and had opted to reintroduce a tram network. Inspired by these examples, the city of Medell√≠n also decided to return the tram. Trying to fix the error of closing the former tram network, the government started to initiate measures to decrease pollution as soon as possible. Downtown Medell√≠n was already served by the metro, but the public transportation in eastern Medell√≠n was not sufficient. To resolve this challenge, the transport authority decided in 2015 to construct the first tramway in the Miraflores area, which lies on the eastern side of the main city. A tram turning from Carrera 29 onto Calle 49 (Av. Ayacucho), a steep section, in May 2016 On 13 May 2011 the city signed a contract with Lohr Industrie of France (acquired by Alstom in 2012) to build a Translohr line between the San Antonio metro junction and the east side of the town ‚Äì a sort of eastward continuation of metro route B. A Translohr vehicle resembles a tram and draws power from overhead wires, but runs on rubber tyres and is guided by a center rail. It was decided to use a rubber-tyred system due to the elevations in this area. A Translohr vehicle should be ideal for climbing the 12% grade on Calle 49 ‚Äì also known as Avenida Ayacucho ‚Äì which was the path of the Buenos Aires tram line until 1951 (see Trams in Medellin). From two points on the line aerial cableways (telef√©ricos, Seilbahnen), each with two sections, the line carries passengers even higher into the hills. Construction of the new \\"tramway\\" began in 2012. The first of the 12 Translohr vehicles arrived from France in July 2014. Metro de Medell√≠n carried out the first test runs on Monday, 13 July 2015. The line is operated by Metro de Medell√≠n, although it is not a metro. =Timeline summary=1951 - The last conventional tram ran. *2011 - The decision was taken to construct a rubber- tyred tram line. *2012 - Construction officially started. *2016 - Commercial service started on 31 March. Features The modern tram routes completely run on unreserved tracks and in the middle of the road. Due to rubber-tyres, it is not possible to lay tracks on grass, as they can only be built on concrete road. The tram runs through many numerical avenues via Buenos Aires, Miraflores, Alejandro Echevarria and connects the city center to the eastern part of the city. All stops have side platforms except for both termini, which have island platforms. =Fleet= Rolling stock was manufactured by Translohr. All trams are low-floor and fully air-conditioned. Each tramcar has five sections. =Depot and termini= The only tram depot is at Miraflores. Termini are San Antonio, and Oriente. =Alignment and interchanges= The modern tram route runs completely on concrete roadway. It has an interchange with Medell√≠n Metro Lines 1 and 2 at San Antonio station. =Practical information= Total length ‚Äì 4.3 km. * Opened - 31/3/2016. * Number of Stops -9, * Number of route ‚Äì 1. * Number of Tramcars - 12  Stations  San Antonio metro station, with one Translohr car arriving and another (at left) departing The modern tram runs from the San Antonio Square to the Oriente neighbourhood of Medell√≠n. *San Antonio Station 15px15px *San Jos√© Station 15px *EPM Water Pavilion Station *Bicentenario Station *Buenos Aires Station *Miraflores Station 15px *Loyola Station *Alejandro Echavarr√≠a Station *Oriente Station 15px Fare system A payment before entering the tram is made with either the Civic Card, which is a rechargeable electronic transport title, using an RFID system (acronym for Radio Frequency Identification) or with a contactless smart card, which is detected by the readers from a distance of about 8 cm. It is one of the means of payment to use the Integrated Transport System of the Aburr√° Valley (SITVA), which allows a greater speed in the entries by tourniquet and in the time of loading and reloading of the card. The process can be carried out by Colombians presenting their citizenship card and by foreigners presenting their alien registration card or passport, in customer service points. Proposed expansion It is planned to construct a tram line running from the Aguacatala metro station to the Caribe metro station, providing connections in-between to Metropl√∫s as well as halting at the Floresta metro station. The number 80 would be used to designate this line. Mayor Federico Guti√©rrez in his campaign also proposed as a mobility proposal to build another corridor using the same tram technology connecting the Aguacatala station with Palos Verdes, crossing Avenue 34 until Palmas, and the continuing further down the avenue, crossing the Ayacucho tram before arriving at its terminal. The tram route would also provide a connection with Metropl√∫s.

The pair of three- battalion Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored Royalist irregular columns aimed at a communist garrison at Moung Phine, and the vital transshipment point of Tchepone. The Muang Phine thrust was fruitless. The Tchepone column stalled on Route 9 only 13 kilometers from the logistics center on 31 October. Between 1 and 10 November, the PAVN fiercely attacked while reinforced with nine antiaircraft guns and six mortars. The Royalist guerrillas retreated to base under cover of tactical air strikes by the Royal Lao Air Force and U.S. Air Force that inflicted heavy casualties on the PAVN, including close air support delivered within 20 meters of the Royalists. Analysis of the results of the Tchepone Operation convinced the CIA that regimental operations should replace multi-battalion ones. Overview Beginning in 1946, France began fighting the communist Viet Minh in French Indochina. The 1954 Geneva Agreements that ended that First Indochina War resulted in a neutral independent Kingdom of Laos. The Agreement specified all foreign military forces had to withdraw from Laos; the only exception was a residual French training mission. However, a North Vietnamese-backed insurrection had settled into northeastern Laos near their home border during the opium harvest season of 1953. After it failed to withdraw, the United States evaded the 1954 Agreement by filling the Programs Evaluation Office with purportedly civilian paramilitary instructors to support the Royal Lao Armed Forces.Castle, pp. 7‚Äì12, 15‚Äì18.Dommen, pp. 30-34. The Annamese Cordillera in southern Laos became the haven for a communist logistics network, the Ho Chi Minh trail. The communist war effort in South Vietnam depended on that supply route.Castle, pp. 107 -110. In 1961, as the Battle of Vientiane upended the Royal Lao Government (RLG), Central Intelligence Agency espionage agent James William Lair designed a paramilitary program to train a guerrilla army of hill tribesmen to defend it.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 61-66. Background In Military Region 3 (MR 3) of Laos, the Royalist stronghold at Savannakhet could threaten the Trail. In turn, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces guarding the Trail were strong enough to launch serious attacks against the Savannakhet Plains and the Mekong Valley if they wished. However, so long as the RLG maintained a minimal garrison in the Region, they were generally undisturbed.Conboy, Morrison, p. 268. This tacit nonaggression pact between Royalists and Communists lasted with minor exceptions until the Royalist offensive of Operation Duck in March 1969 led to Operation Junction City Jr., followed by Operation Maeng Da. The neighboring CIA Pakse Unit in Military Region 4 also had two active offensive operations attacking the Trail, Operation Honorable Dragon and Operation Diamond Arrow. Deeming these offensives against the Trail promising, the CIA's Savannakhet Unit planned to follow up with another attack called simply the Tchepone Operation. Given that they hired, fired, fed, supplied, and paid their guerrillas personally, they felt them reliable enough for further offensive operations.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 217-218, 268-271. Campaign The Ho Chi Minh trail, 1970. Tchepone, the operation's objective, is in the upper third of the map just right of center. The U.S. Khe Sanh Combat Base opposed Tchepone from across the Vietnamese border. A preliminary sweep of the Se Kong valley rousted its Pathet Lao occupiers and cut supply lines to PAVN troops at Pakse Site 26 on the Bolovens Plateau.Ahern, pp. 365, 367. The Tchepone Operation that followed was a six battalion foray by CIA trained guerrillas. It began as two columns of three battalions each, departing from a Royalist base at Moung Phalane on 19 October 1970. Green, Brown, and Red Bravo battalions moved southeast under the senior battalion commander's control; their objective was the communist-held village of Moung Phine. The second column aimed Orange, Red, and Black battalions to the east at Tchepone.Conboy, Morrison, p. 271. Soon after departure, the two columns lost contact with one another. The first column headed toward Moung Phine and lingered on its outskirts, just barely contacting the communist garrison. One CIA case officer claimed the senior battalion commander was distracted by longing for his 17 year old bride. At any rate, Muong Phine remained communist.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 271-272. The second column did much better. In less than a week, it had penetrated over 50 kilometers toward Tchepone. They crossed Route 23 and bumbled into a hidden communist truck park, complete with repair shops and a headquarters. A surprised small communist garrison slipped away, as the guerrillas torched the complex. Pressing onwards, by 31 October the head of the second column had reached Route 914; Tchepone now lay only 13 kilometers down Route 9. However, on 1 November, a People's Army of Vietnam battalion reinforced by six antiaircraft guns and nine mortars ambushed the rear of the column. Fighting continued throughout the next day; two Raven Forward Air Controllers directed 11 flights of tactical air strikes in close air support, but failed to quell the burgeoning communist forces. By 3 November, additional antiaircraft artillery had moved in, and the situation had become too dangerous for the Royal Lao Air Force's (RLAF) T-28 Trojans. The communist ground fire was so heavy that 39 wounded Royalist troopers could not be medevaced by helicopter.Conboy, Morrison, p. 272. That night, the Royalist guerrillas managed to disengage somewhat from their attackers. On 4 November, U.S. Air Force (USAF) fighter- bombers flew overhead cover; they also strafed with protective 20mm cannon fire within 20 meters of the Royalists upon occasion. A Forward Air Guide with the partisans reported heavy PAVN casualties, estimated in the hundreds. Two more unsuccessful medevac attempts occurred. By dawn on 5 November, the battle had become a standoff, but incoming mortar fire aborted a fourth medevac attempt. USAF F-4 Phantom IIs then ringed the landing zone with bombs. Finally, the Air America helicopters landed as RLAF T-28s and USAF A-1 Skyraiders simultaneously hit the PAVN force. Freed of their wounded, the Royalists withdrew. While a rearguard of reconnaissance teams mined Route 9 to within five kilometers of Tchepone, the main body of the Royalist force withdrew into triple canopy jungle. After a famished five days without resupply drops, the Royalists dug and occupied a defensive position atop a bare knoll near Route 23. The PAVN pursuers launched a heedless assault; RLAF and USAF strikes inflicted heavy casualties on them. The position held and the PAVN receded. With the pursuit quashed, in mid-November the Royalist second column resumed its withdrawal from whence it came, Moung Phalane. The first column was ordered northward to aid them; instead it beat the second column back to Moung Phalane. The Tchepone Operation ended on 13 November. Aftermath During 16 days of combat, the Royalist forces aimed at Moung Phine had suffered 22 dead but claimed killing 123 communists. The other Royalist column had lost 44 dead and 52 wounded of 322 troops engaged before being withdrawn.Ahern, p. 370. With one battalion written off as ineffective, and two others having fled battle, somehow the Royalists clung to PS 22. In mid-December, they reinforced the site with a RLA battalion that arrived just as the communists launched a three-battalion attack. Despite being subjected to a vicious crossfire, the communists managed to overrun one outpost before withdrawing under heavy tactical air and artillery bombardment. Their casualties were estimated at 200 killed. Royalist casualties were 25 dead, 126 wounded or missing in action.Ahern, p. 371. For lessons learned, the CIA's Savannakhet Unit fired the insubordinate battalion commander. It also decided to try forming a regimental structure to manage multi-battalion operations.

Unlike U.S. service members captured in World War II and the Korean War, who were mostly enlisted troops, the overwhelming majority of Vietnam-era POWs were officers, most of them Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps airmen; a relatively small number of Army enlisted personnel were also captured, as well as one enlisted Navy seaman who fell overboard from a naval vessel. Most U.S. prisoners were captured and held in North Vietnam by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN); a much smaller number were captured in the south and held by the Vi·ªát C·ªông (VC). A handful of U.S. civilians were also held captive during the war. Thirteen prisons and prison camps were used to house U.S. prisoners in North Vietnam, the most widely known of which was H·ªèa L√≤ Prison (nicknamed the \\"Hanoi Hilton\\"). The treatment and ultimate fate of U.S. prisoners of war in Vietnam became a subject of widespread concern in the United States, and hundreds of thousands of Americans wore POW bracelets with the name and capture date of imprisoned U.S. service members.Michael J. Allen, Until the Last Man Comes Home, (University of North Carolina Press, 2009), pg. 57. American POWs in North Vietnam were released in early 1973 as part of Operation Homecoming, the result of diplomatic negotiations concluding U.S. military involvement in Vietnam. On February 12, 1973, the first of 591 U.S. prisoners began to be repatriated, and return flights continued until late March. After Operation Homecoming, the U.S. still listed roughly 1,350 Americans as prisoners of war or missing in action and sought the return of roughly 1,200 Americans reported killed in action, but whose bodies were not recovered. \\"Vietnam War Accounting History\\". Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office. These missing personnel would become the subject of the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. The US practice of handing over PAVN and Viet Cong prisoners captured by Americans to the South Vietnamese military, where the abuse of such prisoners was commonly known, may have contributed to abuse of American POWs held by the PAVN and VC as a means of retaliation. Phases of captures On March 26, 1964, the first U.S. service member imprisoned during the Vietnam War was captured near Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, South Vietnam when an L-19/O-1 Bird Dog observation plane flown by Captain Richard L. Whitesides and Captain Floyd James Thompson was brought down by small arms fire. Whitesides was killed, and Thompson was taken prisoner; he would ultimately spend just short of nine years in captivity, making him the longest-held POW in American history. The first fighter pilot captured in North Vietnam was Navy Lieutenant (junior grade) Everett Alvarez, Jr., who was shot down on August 5, 1964, in the aftermath of the Gulf of Tonkin incident.Alvin Townley, Defiant: The POWs Who Endured Vietnam's Most Infamous Prison, the Women Who Fought for Them, and the One Who Never Returned (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2014) American pilots continued to be captured over the north between 1965‚Äì1968 as part of Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained aerial bombing campaign against North Vietnam. After President Lyndon Johnson initiated a bombing pause in 1968, the number of new captures dropped significantly, only to pick up again after his successor, President Richard Nixon, resumed bombing in 1969. Significant numbers of Americans were also captured during Operation Linebacker between May and October 1972 and Operation Linebacker II in December 1972, also known as the \\"Christmas Bombings\\". They would have the shortest stays in captivity. Severe treatment years The \\"Little Vegas\\" area of H·ªèa L√≤ Prison, built for American POWs in 1967. Shown in a final inspection in 1973 shortly before the Americans' release. Beginning in late 1965 the application of torture against U.S. prisoners became severe. During the first six years in which U.S. prisoners were held in North Vietnam, many experienced long periods of solitary confinement, with senior leaders and particularly recalcitrant POWs being isolated to prevent communication. Robinson Risner and James Stockdale, two senior officers who were the de facto leaders of the POWs, were held in solitary for three and four years, respectively. The Alcatraz Gang was a group of eleven POWs who were held separately because of their particular resistance to their captors. The POWs made extensive use of a tap code to communicate, which was introduced in June 1965 by four POWs held in the H·ªèa L√≤: Captain Carlyle \\"Smitty\\" Harris, Lieutenant Phillip Butler, Lieutenant Robert Peel and Lieutenant Commander Robert Shumaker. Harris had remembered the code from prior training and taught it to his fellow prisoners. The code was simple and easy to learn and could be taught without verbal instructions. In addition to allowing communication between walls, the prisoners used the code when sitting next to each other but forbidden from speaking by tapping on one another's bodies.Brace, A Code to Keep, pp. 171‚Äì172, 187‚Äì188. Throughout the war the tap code was instrumental in maintaining prisoner morale, as well as preserving a cohesive military structure despite North Vietnamese attempts to disrupt the POW's chain of command.McCain and Salter, Faith of My Fathers, pp. 211‚Äì212. During periods of protracted isolation the tap code facilitated elaborate mental projects to keep the prisoners' sanity. U.S. prisoners of war in North Vietnam were subjected to extreme torture and malnutrition during their captivity. Although North Vietnam was a signatory of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, p. 655. which demanded \\"decent and humane treatment\\" of prisoners of war, severe torture methods were employed, such as waterboarding, strappado (known as \\"the ropes\\" to POWs), irons, beatings, and prolonged solitary confinement. The aim of the torture was usually not acquiring military information. Rather, it was to break the will of the prisoners, both individually and as a group.Hubbell, P.O.W., pp. 288‚Äì306. The goal of the North Vietnamese was to get written or recorded statements from the prisoners that criticized U.S. conduct of the war and praised how the North Vietnamese treated them. Such POW statements would be viewed as a propaganda victory in the battle to sway world and U.S. domestic opinion against the U.S. war effort. During one such event in 1966, then-Commander Jeremiah Denton, a captured Navy pilot, was forced to appear at a televised press conference, where he famously blinked the word \\"T-O-R-T-U-R-E\\" with his eyes in Morse code, confirming to U.S. intelligence that U.S. prisoners were being harshly treated. Two months later, in what became known as the Hanoi March, 52 American prisoners of war were paraded through the streets of Hanoi before thousands of North Vietnamese civilians. The march soon deteriorated into near riot conditions, with North Vietnamese civilians beating the POWs along the route and their guards largely unable to restrain the attacks.\\"People & Events: The Hanoi March\\", PBS American Experience In the end, North Vietnamese torture was sufficiently brutal and prolonged that nearly every American POW so subjected made a statement of some kind at some time.Hubbell, P.O.W., p. 548. As one later wrote of finally being forced to make an anti-American statement: \\"I had learned what we all learned over there: Every man has his breaking point. I had reached mine.\\" Only a small number of exceptionally resilient prisoners, such as John A. Dramesi, survived captivity without ever cooperating with the enemy; others who refused to cooperate under any circumstances, such as Edwin Atterbury, were tortured to death. James Stockdale, fearing that he might reveal details of the Gulf of Tonkin incident if tortured, attempted suicide, but survived; he never revealed this information to the enemy. Under these extreme conditions, many prisoners' aim became merely to absorb as much torture as they could before giving in. One later described the internal code the POWs developed, and instructed new arrivals on, as: \\"Take physical torture until you are right at the edge of losing your ability to be rational. At that point, lie, do, or say whatever you must do to survive. But you first must take physical torture.\\" After making statements, the POWs would admit to each other what had happened, lest shame or guilt consume them or make them more vulnerable to additional North Vietnamese pressure. Nevertheless, the POWs obsessed over what they had done, and would years after their release still be haunted by the \\"confessions\\" or other statements they had made. As another POW later said, \\"To this day I get angry with myself. But we did the best we could. [We realize], over time, that we all fall short of what we aspire to be. And that is where forgiveness comes in.\\" The North Vietnamese occasionally released prisoners for propaganda or other purposes. The POWs had a \\"first in, first out\\" interpretation of the Code of the U.S. Fighting Force, meaning they could only accept release in the order they had been captured, but making an exception for those seriously sick or badly injured. When a few captured servicemen began to be released from North Vietnamese prisons during the Johnson administration, their testimonies revealed widespread and systematic abuse of prisoners of war. Initially, this information was downplayed by American authorities for fear that conditions might worsen for those remaining in North Vietnamese custody.

Reprinted in Policy changed under the Nixon administration, when mistreatment of the prisoners was publicized by U.S. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird and others. Later years The Hanoi Hilton in a 1970 aerial surveillance photo. Beginning in October 1969, the torture regime suddenly abated to a great extent, and life for the prisoners became less severe and generally more tolerable.Jon A. Reynolds, \\"Question of Honor\\", Air University Review, March‚ÄìApril 1977.Rochester and Kiley, Honor Bound, pp. 489‚Äì491. North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh had died the previous month, possibly causing a change in policy towards POWs.Hubbell, P.O.W., p. 519. Many POWs speculated that Ho had been personally responsible for their mistreatment. Also, a badly beaten and weakened POW who had been released that summer disclosed to the world press the conditions to which they were being subjected, and the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia heightened awareness of the POWs' plight.McCain, Faith of My Fathers, pp. 290‚Äì291. Despite several escape attempts, no U.S. POW successfully escaped from a North Vietnamese prison. On November 21, 1970, U.S. Special Forces launched Operation Ivory Coast in an attempt to rescue 61 POWs believed to be held at the S∆°n T√¢y prison camp west of Hanoi. Fifty-six commandos landed by helicopter and assaulted the prison, but the prisoners had been moved some months earlier and none were rescued. While the raid failed to free any POWs and was considered a significant intelligence failure, it had several positive implications for American prisoners. The most immediate effect was to affirm to the POWs that their government was actively attempting to repatriate them, which significantly boosted their morale. Additionally, soon after the raid all acknowledged American prisoners in North Vietnam were moved to H·ªèa L√≤ so that the North Vietnamese had fewer camps to protect and to prevent their rescue by U.S. forces.Rochester and Kiley, Honor Bound. The post-raid consolidation brought many prisoners who had spent years in isolation into large cells holding roughly 70 men each. This created the \\"Camp Unity\\" communal living area at H·ªèa L√≤. The increased human contact further improved morale and facilitated greater military cohesion among the POWs. At this time, the prisoners formally organized themselves under the 4th Allied POW Wing, whose name acknowledged earlier periods of overseas captivity among American military personnel in World War I, World War II and the Korean War. This military structure was ultimately recognized by the North Vietnamese and endured until the prisoners' release in 1973.Hubbell, P.O.W. Nevertheless, by 1971, some 30‚Äì50 percent of the POWs had become disillusioned about the war, both because of the apparent lack of military progress and what they heard of the growing anti-war movement in the U.S. and some of them were less reluctant to make propaganda statements for the North Vietnamese.Hubbell, P.O.W., pp. 548‚Äì549. Others were not among them; there were defiant church servicesTimberg, An American Odyssey, p. 104. and an effort to write letters home that only portrayed the camp in a negative light.Rochester and Kiley, Honor Bound, p. 537. Such prisoners were sometimes sent to a camp reserved for \\"bad attitude\\" cases. At the \\"Hanoi Hilton\\", POWs cheered the resumed bombing of North Vietnam starting in April 1972, whose targets included the Hanoi area.Timberg, An American Odyssey, pp. 106‚Äì107. The old-time POWs cheered even more during the intense \\"Christmas Bombing\\" campaign of December 1972, when Hanoi was subjected for the first time to repeated B-52 Stratofortress raids. Although its explosions lit the night sky and shook the walls of the camp, scaring some of the newer POWs, most saw it as a forceful measure to compel North Vietnam to finally come to terms.  North Vietnamese prisons Shortly after the war, ex-POW Mike McGrath annotated this detailed map of Hanoi to show the location of prisons. He did it so he would not forget where the camps were. A U.S. Marine Corps map showing POW camp locations, using Vietnamese names rather than the American prisoners' names for them. Of the 13 prisons used to incarcerate POWs, five were located in Hanoi, and the remainder were situated outside the city.\\"POW Camps In North Vietnam,\\" Defense Intelligence Agency, Washington, D.C. * Alcatraz. Located in north central Hanoi, Alcatraz was used to detain 11 particularly defiant American prisoners known as the Alcatraz Gang, including Jeremiah Denton, future U.S. Senator from Alabama, Sam Johnson, future U.S. Representative from Texas and James Stockdale, later a Vice Admiral and recipient of the Medal of Honor. * Briarpatch. The Briarpatch camp, located northwest of Hanoi, intermittently held U.S. prisoners between 1965 and 1971. Conditions at the Briarpatch were notoriously grim, even by the standards of North Vietnamese prisons. Multiple POWs contracted beriberi at the camp due to severe malnutrition. * Camp Faith. Located west of Hanoi, Camp Faith became operational in July 1970, when a major consolidation of U.S. prisoners began. At its peak, the population of Camp Faith was approximately 220 POWs. Three days after the S∆°n T√¢y Raid, Camp Faith POWs were moved to H·ªèa L√≤ prison in Hanoi. * Camp Hope, also known as S∆°n T√¢y, was operational between 1968 and 1970, holding 55 POWs. The camp was closed following the S∆°n T√¢y Raid. * Dirty Bird. Beginning in June 1967, several locations in the immediate vicinity of the Hanoi Thermal Power Plant were used to house POWs. Approximately 30 Americans were held at the Dirty Bird Camp, possibly in an attempt to prevent the bombing of the power plant. In October 1967, all prisoners held in Dirty Bird were removed to regular POW camps. * Dogpatch. The Dogpatch camp, located northeast of Hanoi, opened in May 1972, when 220 POWs were transferred there from H·ªèa L√≤ prison. The camp ceased operation in early 1973, when the POWs were transferred to Hanoi for repatriation to the United States. * Farnsworth. Located southwest of Hanoi, Farnsworth became operational in August 1968, when 28 U.S. POWs captured outside North Vietnam were moved to this location. Over the next two years, several groups of POWs captured outside of North Vietnam were brought to the camp. Following the S∆°n T√¢y Raid, Farnsworth's prisoner population was transferred to the Plantation Camp in Hanoi. * H·ªèa L√≤ Prison, also known as the Hanoi Hilton. Located in downtown Hanoi, H·ªèa L√≤ prison was first used by the French colonists to hold political prisoners in what was then French Indochina. The prison became operational during the Vietnam War when it was used to house Everett Alvarez, Jr., the first American pilot captured in North Vietnam. The prison was used without interruption until the repatriation of U.S. POWs in 1973. * Mountain Camp. The Mountain Camp, located northwest of Hanoi, became operational in December 1971, when one prisoner from H·ªèa L√≤ and eight prisoners from Skidrow were moved to this location. This camp was used until January 1973 when its POW population was permanently moved to Hanoi for repatriation. * The Plantation. Located in northeast Hanoi, the Plantation opened in June 1967. It was a Potemkin village-style camp run by the North Vietnamese as a propaganda showplace for foreign visitors to see and as a preparation camp for prisoners about to be released. Physical mistreatment of prisoners was rarer than in other camps, but did occur to some Plantation prisoners.Rochester and Kiley, Honor Bound, pp. 340, 363, 364, 487. The camp operated until July 1970, when a major consolidation of U.S. POWs occurred. * Rockpile. The Rockpile camp, located south of Hanoi, became operational in June 1971 when 14 Americans and foreign POWs captured outside North Vietnam were moved from Skidrow to the Rockpile. The camp was closed in February 1973, when its POWs were moved to Hanoi for repatriation. * Skidrow. The Skidrow camp, located southwest of Hanoi, became operational as a U.S. POW detention facility in July 1968, when U.S. civilian and military prisoners captured outside North Vietnam were moved there. * The Zoo. Located in the suburbs of Hanoi, the Zoo opened in September 1965 and remained operational until December 1970, when all U.S. prisoners were transferred to H·ªèa L√≤ prison.

Post-war accounts American POWs in North Vietnam lining up for release on March 27, 1973 1973 Homecoming : Navy flier Phil Butler greets his family in Tulsa, Oklahoma after 7 years and 10 months as a POW in North Vietnam After the implementation of the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, neither the United States nor its allies ever formally charged North Vietnam with the war crimes revealed to have been committed there. Extradition of North Vietnamese officials who had violated the Geneva Convention, which they had always insisted officially did not bind them because their nation had never signed it, was not a condition of the U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and ultimate abandonment of the South Vietnamese government. In the 2000s, the Vietnamese government has held the position that claims that prisoners were tortured during the war are fabricated, but that Vietnam wants to move past the issue as part of establishing better relations with the U.S. B√πi T√≠n, a North Vietnamese Army colonel-later turned dissident and exile, who believed that the cause behind the war had been just but that the country's political system had lost its way after reunification, maintained in 2000 that no torture had occurred in the POW camps. Tin stated that there were \\"a few physical hits like a slap across the face, or threats, in order to obtain the specific confessions,\\" and that the worst that especially resistant prisoners such as Stockdale and Jeremiah Denton encountered was being confined to small cells. Tran Trong Duyet, a jailer at Hoa Lo beginning in 1968 and its commandant for the last three years of the war, maintained in 2008 that no prisoners were tortured. However, eyewitness accounts by American servicemen present a different account of their captivity. John McCain giving an interview to the press about his time as a POW on April 24, 1973, soon after his return from Vietnam. After the war, Risner wrote the book Passing of the Night detailing his seven years at the Hanoi Hilton. Indeed, a considerable literature emerged from released POWs after repatriation, depicting Hoa Lo and the other prisons as places where such atrocities as murder; beatings; broken bones, teeth and eardrums; dislocated limbs; starvation; serving of food contaminated with human and animal feces; and medical neglect of infections and tropical disease occurred. These details are revealed in accounts by McCain (Faith of My Fathers), Denton, Alvarez, Day, Risner, Stockdale and dozens of others. The Hanoi Hilton was depicted in the 1987 Hollywood movie The Hanoi Hilton. In addition to memoirs, the U.S. POW experience in Vietnam was the subject of two in-depth accounts by authors and historians, John G.

The ceremony relies heavily on Shinto themes of purification, and involves ceremonial sake drinking of three cups three times, the nan-nan-san- ku-do. Shinto weddings are in decline. Fewer Japanese people get married, and those who do often choose Western-style chapel ceremonies. The ceremony A Shinto wedding ceremony. A video depicting a full shinto wedding A Shinto wedding ceremony is typically a small affair, limited to family, while a reception is open to a larger group of friends. Shinzen kekkon, literally \\"wedding before the kami,\\" is a Shinto purification ritual that incorporates the exchange of sake between the couple before they are married. The ceremony typically takes 20 to 30 minutes. Food items, including salt, water, rice, sake, fruit, and vegetables, are left at a ceremonial wedding altar, which also holds the wedding rings. A Shinto priest stands to the right of the altar, while a shrine maiden, Miko, stands to the left. The couple will often stand in the center of the room, while closest family members stand behind tables containing sake and small fruits. The priest will purify the shrine and call the attention of benevolent spirits, or kami. Then, the priest announces the beginning of the san-san-ku-do ceremony, or \\"three-three-nine-times,\\" reflecting three oaths taken three times, represented by three cups, poured three times, and swallowed in three sips. This often includes three pourings from three cups of increasing sizes. The first, smallest cup, is first poured to the groom, who drinks from it before offering it to the bride. The second pouring goes first to the bride, then to the groom. The final pouring goes from the groom first, then the bride (essentially repeating the first pour). The sake aspect of the ceremony is said to be the core of a Shinto wedding. The ritual may have originated at samurai weddings, though the symbolism of the action and numbers has no clear origin. Some see the ritual as representative of sharing joys and sorrows as a married couple, others suggest that san-san is a homonym for \\"birth after birth,\\" suggesting fertility symbolism. Still others suggest it represents man, woman, and child, or heaven, earth and man. The couple approaches the altar, where the groom reads his vows while the bride listens. Reflecting a history of arranged marriage in Japan, a nakodo, or \\"matchmaker,\\" will be thanked in the vows. If no matchmaker exists, a friend or family member will be appointed to fill the role, serving a role similar to the \\"best man\\" or \\"bridesmaid.\\" Then, the families join in with the drinking of sake and a traditional cheer of \\"kampai.\\" In the final portion of the ceremony, the priest offers Japanese evergreen to the altar, said to reflect gratitude to the spirits who blessed the union. The bride and groom follow with their own offering, then a representative from each family (often the fathers of the bride and groom). The rings are then presented. Within wedding prayers, the gods Izanagi and Izanami are often invoked. These married gods were part of the Japanese lore of the \\"first wedding,\\" and are called upon to reflect a harmonious balance within the marriage. Other aspects of the Shinto wedding prayer include calling for the couple to work to maintain a respectful home, and for the couple to have children. = Costume = Shinto brides and grooms typically wear kimono; the bride wears either a (a thick, colourful (mainly red), heavily-brocaded, highly-formal kimono, worn outside the actual kimono and obi, unfastened, as a sort of overcoat), or a (typical colours for these kimono include red and white, colours of Shinto purity and good luck.), oftentimes combined with a wig. The bride may change into a red kimono for the Wedding reception events after the ceremony for good luck. Japanese formal wedding kimono, a shiromuku, still used today. A bride at a Shinto wedding shows her wig and tsuno-kakushi headdress. There is also a headdress; either a , a headdress made from a rectangular piece of cloth, often made of white silk (to match the bride's shiromuku kimono), which covers the bridal high topknot (a Bunkin Takashimada), a kind of chonmage (a traditional topknot); they're traditionally worn to veil the bride's metaphorical 'horns of jealousy, ego and selfishness', and also symbolizes the bride's resolve to become a gentle and obedient wife; or a , an all-white hood or cowl, worn as an alternative to the tsunokakushi, and the Japanese equivalent to the Western marriage ceremony's bridal veil; its purpose is to hide the bride's face from all others, except for the bridegroom, until the end of the wedding ceremony. It was adapted from the katsuki, a hood worn outdoors to keep away dust and prevent from the cold, by married women in samurai families, from the Muromachi to Momoyama periods, before being taken up by younger women from the Edo period onwards. Like the shiromuku its worn in concert with, the wataboshi is a symbol of innocence and purity; its worn only outside in outdoor receptions with the shiromuku-only, not with coloured wedding iro-uchikake kimono, or during indoor receptions. Origins and early history The Shinto wedding is a modern invention. The first mention of a wedding in a Shinto manual was in 1872; weddings are not reported until the 1880s. These weddings were limited to the families of Shinto priests. Earlier Shinto weddings were a family gathering without religious significance, aside from the occasional appearance of female dancers, katsurame, said to protect the bride from demons. Scholars suggest that the adoption of religious wedding ceremonies was driven by the decline of state-sponsored Shinto shrines during the 1880s. A rash of new ceremonies emerged in this period, including visits for newborns and on certain birthdays. =The wedding of Prince Yoshihito= Prince Yoshihito married Kujo Sadako in a Shinto ceremony at the Imperial Palace in 1900, one of the first ceremonies of its kind. The wedding reflected a change in Meiji-era thinking about marriage, which had recently legally allowed for marriage to be a balanced partnership between husband and wife. An illustration of the first contemporary Shinto wedding ceremony, the 1900 marriage of Crown Prince Yoshihito and Princess Kujo Sadako. The next Shinto wedding ceremony was performed at Tokyo's Hibiya Daijingu shrine in 1901. Later, shrines such as Ueno Shimotani and Tokyo's Izumo Grand Shrine hosted wedding ceremonies. These ceremonies, concentrated in Tokyo, were still limited to elites. Soon, wedding ceremonies were performed in more cities, starting in Osaka and Kyoto, and began to attract the donation of larger dowries. Post-war weddings After being stripped of its status as a state religion in 1945, there came a rapid rise in the democratization of Shinto wedding ceremonies, and, in turn, the number of people choosing them. This also reflected a mass movement of families into cities and smaller homes, which made it more difficult to host domestic ceremonies. This period also saw the rise of the commercial wedding industry, which grew out of collaboratives that lent large venues for wedding ceremonies. Contemporary Japanese weddings Japanese Shinto weddings are overseen by priests, but often take place in hotels or in special venues designed to accommodate weddings. As Japan's marriage rate declines, fewer Shinto weddings are being performed; the number has dropped from 90% of ceremonies to 50% since the 1990s. Japanese weddings more often reflect a Christian wedding ceremony, regardless of the personal faith of the married couple. In 1999, two gay men were married in a Shinto ceremony at Kanamara Shrine in Kawasaki, but gay weddings have not been widespread in Shinto shrines, and the position of the Association of Shinto Shrines on gay weddings is vague.

He is the Metropolitan of Pskov and Porkhov and was in 2015‚Äì2018 the head of the of Moscow city. Superior of the Sretensky Monastery in Moscow from 1995 to 2018. Bishop Tikhon is often referred as the personal confessor of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biography In 1982 Georgy Shevkunov graduated from the Screenwriter school of the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography. The same year he accepted Christianity, was baptized and moved to the Pskov-Caves Monastery first as a toiler then as a novice. His confessor was Archimandrite John Krestiankin. In 1986 he was transferred to the Publishing Department of the Moscow Patriarchate, where he worked under Metropolitan . His first appointment was connected with commemoration of the millennium anniversary Baptizing of Rus. In the first Perestroika years he published a few polemic articles including \\"Ne uchastvuyte v delakh t'my\\" (Do not participate in the business of the darkness) originally published in the and republished more than one hundred times by different publishers. The work criticized then emerged practice of occult healing. His article \\"The Church and the State\\" was published by in November 1990. In the article Shevkunov argued that emerging Russian democracy would definitely act against Russian Orthodox Church. On 2 July 1991 in Donskoy Monastery Georgiy Shevkunov took monastic vows assuming the name Tikhon after Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow. At the same time he was ordained into a Hierodeacon and in a month he was ordained into a Hieromonk. In 1993 Tikhon was appointed the head of the newly created Moscow Metochion of the Pskov- Caves Monastery. The building of the Metochion was previously occupied by the collective of Orthodox Christian thinker and missionary . Tikhon later criticized Kochetkov and his followers for their \\"modernism\\". In 1995 the Metochion was reformed into the restored Sretensky Stauropegic Monastery and on 8 September 1995 Patriarch Alexy II ordained Tikhon into a Hegumen. On 8 September 1998 Tikhon was elevated to Archimandrite status. In 1999 he was appointed the Rector of the , He graduated (by correspondence) the same seminary in 2004. On 5 March 2010 he was appointed the Responsible Secretary of the and on 31 March 2010 a member of the Council for Culture at President of Russia.

The next day is announced the Bishop of Yegoryevsk and on 24 October 2015 Patriarch Kirill of Moscow Chirotonized him as the Bishop. On 29 October 2015 he was appointed the head of the Western Vicariat of Moscow city. Church building Tikhon organized construction of a huge Cathedral to New Martyrs and Confessors of Russian Church in the historical centre of Moscow, Lubyanka. The construction is considered controversial as the newly build cathedral (55 meters high) would by much higher than Dormition Cathedral in Moscow Kremlin (45 meters high). Building of churches higher than Dormition Cathedral was traditionally forbidden in Moscow. Books Tikhon is the author of the following books: *\\"Father Serafim\\" (2002) - a children book telling the story of Seraphim of Sarov *\\"Death of an Empire. Byzantium Lesson\\" published by Eksmo in 2008. *Everyday Saints and Other Stories (; literally \\"Unsaintly Saints and Other Stories\\") first published in 2011, translated to English in 2012. The book was published in more than 2 million copies claiming to be the most popular modern book of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Exhibitions Tikhon organized a number of historical exhibitions in Moscow Manege. The last one \\"My History. 20th Century\\" was devoted to the 1930-1940s in Russia and often talked about supposed positive contributions by Joseph Stalin. The critics considered the exhibition as an \\"apology of the Orthodox Christian Stalinism\\". Internet Tikhon is a prolific internet writer. He is the editor-in-chief of the internet-portal Pravoslavie.ru and the author of many publications there. Ideology Tikhon is considered to be an ultra-conservative, but it is claimed that he never published anything 'xenophobic.' However, while leading a commission investigating the execution of Tsar Nicholas II and his family, Tikhon stated in 2017 that \\"many members of the commission believe it was a ritual murder that held special significance for Bolshevik commander Yakov Yurovsky,\\" the commander of the execution squad who was of Jewish birth. This description fits the longstanding formula of blood libels used as pretexts for pogroms and other atrocities against Jews in Europe. Tikhon denied accusations that his accusations were antisemitic or that they referred to Jews at all. Tikhon supports the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and he is a member of Crimean Exxpert-Consultative Council. He is said to be against ecumenism between the Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church, repeating the saying ‚ÄúCatholics are not even a church and as a result not even Christian.‚Äù Relations with Vladimir Putin Tikhon is rumoured to be the personal confessor and spiritual adviser (dukhovnik) of Russian president Vladimir Putin although both men neither confirm nor denied it. Once asked about his relations with Putin, Tikhon answered: ‚ÄúYou can believe those rumours if you want, but they certainly aren‚Äôt spread by me,‚Äù adding ‚ÄúI am no Cardinal Richelieu!\\" Still the men are very close, with Putin often taking Tikhon on his international trips. Their acquaintance goes back to late '90s. According to controversial Russian banker Sergei Pugachev, it was he who introduced Shevkunov to Putin. Awards Tikhon is awarded Order of Friendship (2008) and a number of other church and state awards.

Gov. You've Gotta Love\\" (also called \\"David Dewhurst: Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love\\") was a political advertisement issued by incumbent David Dewhurst's campaign on YouTube during the 2014 primary runoff for Lieutenant Governor of Texas against Dan Patrick. Dewhurst, the three-term Lieutenant Governor, faced primary challenge from Tea Party favorite Dan Patrick. During the primary, Patrick triggered a runoff between Dewhurst and him by only capturing 41% of the vote. The night before the runoff, Dewhurst's campaign released \\"Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love\\", a disco-themed advertisement. The advertisement features a vocals extolling Dewhurst over top of a pulsating disco beat. It ends with a long list of Dewhurst's accomplishments during this three terms as lieutenant governor that appear on the screen to the beat of the music. Political reporters disliked \\"Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love\\". One reporter claimed that the best way to understand the advertisement was to see it as avant-garde artwork. Other reporters reactions ranged from calling the advertisement quirky to writing that it was ridiculous.  Background  David Dewhurst in 2009 Between 2003 and 2015, David Dewhurst served as the 42nd Lieutenant Governor of Texas. During his three terms as lieutenant governor, Dewhurst helped pass the controversial 2003 Texas redistricting plan as well as \\"business friendly\\" legislation. In 2012, Dewhurst ran for the United States Senate and lost in a primary runoff to Ted Cruz. In 2014, Dewhurst, who was seen as an establishment Republican, faced a primary challenge against a Tea Party-backed candidate, Dan Patrick. In the 2014 Republican primary, Patrick triggered a runoff election by only gathering 41% of the vote; Dewhurst gathered 28% of the vote. During the weeks leading up to the runoff election, Dewhurst ran a negative campaign that included a parody of \\"Let It Go\\" from the Disney film Frozen that claimed that Patrick changed his name to hide a past bankruptcy. In the days leading up to the election, Dewhurst was polling far from Patrick. \\"Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love\\" was created by Ben Price, Dewhurst's creative director, as the final advertisement of the election. At 8:00 PM on the night before the runoff, Dewhurst's campaign released \\"Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love\\". Dewhurst failed to win the runoff- primary for a fourth term as lieutenant governor.  Synopsis  \\"Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love\\" is a disco-themed campaign ad. The advertisement starts out with the draw of a slide guitar and establishing shots of a bus in rural Texas traveling on Texas State Highway 121. It quickly switches from the guitar to a pulsing disco beat with vocals over it extolling the conservative virtues of Dewhurst and his campaign promises. In one section, the advertisement claims that Dewhurst is the \\"most pro-life candidate\\" running for lieutenant governor. In another, the singers claim that Dewhurst will keep \\"Obamanation\\" away from Texas. While this is going on, in a split screen, Dewhurst can be seen performing a variety of activities. He starts out walking down a hall to the beat of the music, an homage is Saturday Night Fever. In one shot, dewhurst can be seen roping cattle, and in another, Dewhurst is speaking to a pro-life organization. \\"Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love\\" draws to a close with a list of Dewhurst's accomplishments during his three terms. Each bullet point appears on the screen with the beat of the music. It ends with the URL of Dewhurst's campaign website.  Reactions  \\"Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love\\" was panned by political reporters. They did however draw parallels to the advertisement to such diverse influences as Daft Punk, Kanye West, John Cornyn and Saturday Night Fever. Jonathan Tilove, for Statesman, praised Dewhurst's campaign for \\"pushing the envelope\\", but thought that the advertisement was better understood as avant-garde artwork. Bud Kennedy, for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, wrote that \\"Lt. Gov. You've Gotta Love\\" was an attempt to make Dewhurst look relaxed, something that he pointed out was far from the truth.

Hexestrol and its esters are taken by mouth, held under the tongue, or via injection into muscle. Medical uses Hexestrol has been used in estrogen replacement therapy, for the treatment of breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, and for the treatment of certain gynecological disorders. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Hexestrol has approximately 302% and 234% of the affinity of estradiol for the estrogen receptors (ERs) ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively. The affinity of hexestrol for the ERs is said to be similar to or slightly higher than that of estradiol. Along with diethylstilbestrol, hexestrol has been said to be one of the most potent estrogens known. The total endometrial proliferation dose per cycle of different forms of hexestrol are 70 to 100 mg for oral hexestrol, 45 mg for sublingual hexestrol diacetate, and 25 mg for hexestrol dipropionate by intramuscular injection. These doses are fairly similar to those of estradiol and its esters. =Pharmacokinetics= Distribution of hexestrol radioactivity in blood and tissues after a subcutaneous injection of a physiological dose of tritium- labeled hexestrol in oil solution in five juvenile female goats. Points are one animal each. With the exception of skeletal muscle, tissues with a radioactivity concentration of less than 15% of that of the endometrium are not shown. Hexestrol is concentrated in target tissues such as the uterus and vagina due to binding to estrogen receptors. The pharmacokinetics and distribution of hexestrol have been studied with intravenous injection of aqueous solution in women and with subcutaneous injection of oil solution in female goats and sheep. Chemistry Hexestrol, also known as dihydrodiethylstilbestrol, is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol group related to diethylstilbestrol. Esters of hexestrol include hexestrol diacetate, hexestrol dicaprylate, hexestrol diphosphate, and hexestrol dipropionate. History Hexestrol was first described by Campbell, Dodds, and Lawson in 1938. It was isolated from the demethylation products of anethole. Society and culture =Generic names= Hexestrol is the generic name of the drug and its . =Brand names= Hexestrol has been marketed under a variety of brand names including Synestrol, Synoestrol, Estrifar, and Estronal, among others. =Availability= Hexestrol has mostly been discontinued and remains available in only a handful of countries.https://www.micromedexsolutions.com/https://www.drugs.com/international/hexestrol.html Esters of hexestrol which have been marketed include hexestrol diacetate, hexestrol dicaprylate, hexestrol diphosphate, and hexestrol dipropionate.

Flora An island oak on Santa Rosa Island. A north pacific right whale sighted off Anacapa Island in May 2017. Flora on the Channel Islands include a unique subspecies of pine, oak, and the island tree mallow. Santa Rosa Island holds two groves of the Torrey pine subspecies Pinus torreyana var. insularis, which is endemic to the island. Torrey pines are the United States' rarest pine species. Listed as endangered (EN C2b) The islands also house many rare and endangered species of plants, including the island barberry, the island rushrose, and the Santa Cruz Island lace pod. Giant kelp forests surround the islands and act as a source of nutrition and protection for other animals. Invasive species, such as the Australian blue gum tree, olive tree, sweet fennel and Harding grass threaten native species through competition for light, nutrients, and water. The Australian blue gum, for example, releases toxins in its leaf litter which prevents other species of plants from growing in the soil surrounding it. The blue gum, as well as other species including the Harding grass, are much more flammable and better adapted to wildfires than native species. Kelp forests and many unique species of seaweed, sea urchin, and other marine plants live on the ocean floor. * Catalina cherry (Prunus ilicifolia ssp. lyonii) * Catalina ironwood (Lyonothamnus floribundus) * Green liveforever (Dudleya hassei) * Giant coreopsis (Coreopsis gigantea) * Island oak (Quercus tomentella) * Island tree mallow (Lavatera assurgentiflora) * Island ceanothus (Ceanothus arboreus) * Island bush-poppy (Dendromecon rigida ssp. harfordii) * Island alumroot (Heuchera maxima) * Santa Barbara Island buckwheat (Eriogonum giganteum var. compactum) * Island barberry (Berberis pinnata ssp. insularis) * San Clemente Island bushmallow (Malacothamnus clementinus) * Santa Cruz Island bush mallow (Malacothamnus fasciculatus var. nesioticus) * Santa Cruz Island ironwood (very like the Catalina ironwood, Lyonothamnus) * Santa Cruz Island silver lotus * Torrey pine (Pinus torreyana) [rare subspecies sole occurrence]C.Michael Hogan (2008) Torrey Pine: Pinus torreyana, Globaltwitcher, ed.

It stars Chadwick Boseman as Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Supreme Court Justice, and focuses on one of the first cases of his career, the State of Connecticut v. Joseph Spell. It also stars Josh Gad, Kate Hudson, Dan Stevens, Sterling K. Brown, and James Cromwell. The project was announced in December 2015, along with Boseman's casting, and principal photography began in Los Angeles in mid- December 2015 and moved on to Buffalo and Niagara Falls, New York. The film premiered at Howard University on September 20, 2017, and was released in the United States by Open Road Films on October 13, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed at Boseman's performance and with criticism aimed at the film's lack of depth and characterization. It went on to gross $10 million against a $12 million budget. At the 90th Academy Awards, it received a nomination for Best Original Song for \\"Stand Up for Something\\". Plot In 1940, Thurgood Marshall is an NAACP lawyer traveling the country defending people of color who are wrongly accused of crimes because of racial prejudice. Upon his return to his New York office, he is sent to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to defend Joseph Spell, a chauffeur accused of rape by his white employer, Eleanor Strubing, in a case that has gripped the newspapers. In Bridgeport, insurance lawyer Sam Friedman is assigned by his brother to get Marshall admitted to the local bar, against his will. At the hearing, Judge Foster, a friend of the father of prosecutor Lorin Willis, agrees to admit Marshall, but forbids Marshall from speaking during the trial, forcing Friedman to be Spell's lead counsel. Marshall must guide Friedman through notes, such as when he advises Friedman to allow a woman of Southern white descent into the jury because of her assertive and questioning personality. Spell swears to Marshall that he never had any sexual contact with Strubing and leads the lawyers to a patrolman who stopped Spell that night while he was driving Strubing's car. Marshall and Friedman investigate Strubing's story that Spell tied her up in the back seat of her car after raping her and drove to a bridge to throw her over. They wonder why Spell appeared to throw her over the calm side instead of the side with rapids. Spell is initially interested in a plea bargain offered by Willis, but Marshall talks him out of it. Later on at trial, though, a doctor testifies to finding pieces of skin underneath Strubing's fingernails, as well as bruises. Strubing herself testifies that she was tied in the back seat when the patrolman pulled Spell over. With this information, Marshall and Friedman confront Spell, who admits that he was lying about not having sexual contact with Strubing. At trial, Spell testifies that Strubing's husband inflicted the bruises through repeated acts of spousal abuse. That night, he went to see Strubing for an advance on his salary, finding a distraught Strubing wanting to have sex with him. Spell consents, and the two have several sexual encounters that night. Then Strubing panics about being found out and being pregnant. Spell tries to drive her to a doctor, but Strubing has to hide in the back seat when the patrolman questions him. A hysterical Strubing forces Spell to stop by a bridge where she runs out and tries to kill herself. When Spell tries to stop her, she scratches him and jumps off the bridge. But she survives and flags down a motorist making up a desperate story about rape. When Willis asks why Spell didn't tell the truth to begin with, Spell talks about how black men get tortured and lynched in his native Louisiana for having sex with white women. Over Willis's objections, Judge Foster allows Spell's statement to stand. Before the verdict, Marshall has to leave for a case in Mississippi. A desperate Willis offers Spell a much lighter plea bargain, but Spell feels emboldened enough to turn it down. The night before Marshall leaves, he and Friedman prepare the closing statement that Friedman then delivers on his own. The Southern white woman has now become the jury forewoman, and she ultimately delivers a \\"not guilty\\" verdict. Friedman happily breaks the news over the phone to Marshall, who moves on to his next case. Closing credits note that Friedman went on to work in many civil rights cases, while Marshall himself has an illustrious career as the American Civil Rights Movement's principal legal strategist and the first African American Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States.

The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Marshall takes an illuminating, well-acted look at its real-life subject's early career that also delivers as an entertainingly old-fashioned courtroom drama.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score 66 out of 100, based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Manohla Dargis in a NY Times review praises the film for choosing a specific case as a way of exploring Marshall's life, but is critical of the simplified characterizations and the efforts made throughout to put the audience at ease. Angelica Jade Basti√©n also criticizes the lack of character depth, particularly regarding Marshall. In Vulture Basti√©n mentions the scene in which Marshall drinks from a whites-only water fountain, stating that for her it mainly underlined \\"how little effort the film makes in understanding why Marshall makes such bold decisions on a deeper level, and who he was beyond this arrogant, quick-witted man it presents.\\" One aspect that is 'flattened out' in this film is the colorism of U.S. society, which resulted in light-skinned Thurgood Marshall having much different life experiences that if he had had the skin tone of Chadwick Boseman. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers praised Boseman's performance, giving the film 3 stars out of 4 and saying, \\"Charged by Boseman's dramatic lightning, Marshall gives us an electrifying glimpse of a great man in the making.\\" Peter DeBruge of Variety magazine called the film \\"a compelling courtroom drama\\".https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/marshall-review-chadwick- boseman-1202570825/ =Accolades= \\"Stand Up for Something\\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Song, and the Satellite Award for Best Original Song; it won the latter prize, while losing the first two to \\"Remember Me\\" from Coco.Oscars: 'Shape of Water' Leads With 13 Noms Accuracy Film critic Roger Friedman, great- nephew of Sam Friedman, questioned the authenticity of Friedman's portrayal in the film: \\"Almost not a word of my great uncle's depiction in the movie is accurate.\\" He said that Sam Friedman was not an inexperienced lawyer and was not attacked in the streets.

It operates between the Rego Park and East Elmhurst neighborhoods of Queens, and extends into LaGuardia Airport at the north end of the borough. It is city-operated under the MTA Bus Company brand of MTA Regional Bus Operations. The route was originally a streetcar line known as the North Beach line or Junction Boulevard line running primarily on Junction Avenue, the predecessor to Junction Boulevard, to the resorts of Queens' North Beach on the Bowery Bay coastline. Service began in the late 1890s either as a standalone shuttle service or to facilitate through service between the Flushing‚ÄìRidgewood Line and Grand Street Line. All three lines were replaced by city buses in the 1940s, though the Junction Boulevard route would be privately operated by Triboro Coach from 1961 to 2006 when it was taken over by the MTA Bus Company. Route description and service =Streetcar line= alt= Originally a branch of the Grand Street and Flushing‚ÄìRidgewood lines, the Junction Boulevard line, also known as the North Beach line began at the intersection of Corona Avenue and Junction Avenue (later Junction Boulevard) and traveled north along Junction to its terminus in Jackson Heights and Corona. It then turned east and north along Old Bowery Road (later Jackson Mill Road) through East Elmhurst, crossing Jackson Mill Pond and terminating at a loop at North Beach amusement area, a peninsula on the Bowery Bay coastline. This is the modern location of LaGuardia Airport. The line stopped serving the shoreline in the 1920s following the decline of the North Beach resorts. It was truncated to Ditmars Boulevard by 1939, and was never extended to serve LaGuardia Airport. The combined Grand Street/Grand Avenue and Junction Boulevard service was also known as the Maspeth‚àíNorth Beach Line. Between May 15, 1923 and October 27, 1925, the New York and Queens County Railway used the trackage of the Junction Boulevard line for service from their line on Northern Boulevard. Trolleys ran from the northern Queens neighborhoods of College Point and Flushing as well as the south Queens neighborhood of Jamaica, Queens to the Junction Boulevard station of the IRT Flushing Line at Roosevelt Avenue. The service ended when the Flushing Line was extended to 111th Street. The right-of-way of Jackson Mill Road today consists of 97th Street, the northern end of 94th Street, and several short and separate street sections which retain the name Jackson Mill Road. =Current bus service= The current Q72 service begins at Junction Boulevard and Queens Boulevard in Rego Park, adjacent to the Rego Center shopping complex and at the 63rd Drive station. It extends along the former trolley route on Junction Boulevard, then directly north on 94th Street to East Elmhurst and LaGuardia Airport. Prior to 2006, the Q72 (like the streetcar line it replaced) terminated at Ditmars Boulevard just outside LaGuardia Airport. It only entered the airport on its first and final daily trips, during early morning and late night hours. The Q72 only serves LaGuardia's Central Terminals (B, C, and D), and does not serve the Marine Air Terminal. Service to the American Airlines hangar near Terminal B was eliminated on September 8, 2013. The Q72 operates out of the LaGuardia Depot, the former Triboro Coach depot, in East Elmhurst. History On May 21, 1894, the Grand Street Line, operated by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) and later Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) subsidiary called the Brooklyn and Queens Transit Corporation (B&QT;), began electrified service between Maspeth, Queens and ferries in western Brooklyn. On May 27, the line was extended east along Grand Avenue and Corona Avenue to Junction Avenue. On June 1, the line was extended north along Junction Avenue and Old Bowery Road to North Beach. The Junction Avenue line and other trolley lines to North Beach primarily served the Gala Amusement Park, owned by the Steinway family. On June 20, 1896, service on the Fresh Pond Road Line (predecessor to the Flushing‚ÄìRidgewood Line) was run between Ridgewood Terminal and North Beach. In November 1899, the Fresh Pond line was extended along Corona Avenue to Flushing, and the Junction Avenue line became part of the eastern portion of Grand Street service between the Maspeth Trolley Depot and North Beach. The line ran as a standalone shuttle service and facilitating through service from the Flushing‚ÄìRidgewood Line and Grand Street Line (now the Q58 and Q59 buses respectively) to central Queens and Brooklyn. In the 1920s, due to the prohibition movement in the United States and pollution in Bowery Bay, the resorts at North Beach closed and the Junction line was truncated south of the former amusement area. In 1929, the Junction line was split from Grand Avenue service, becoming a shuttle between Corona Avenue and East Elmhurst. During the 1920s and 1930s, more conventional grid plans were laid down in Jackson Heights, Corona, and East Elmhurst. The winding and circuitous Jackson Mill Road, however, was preserved due to the presence of the streetcar line. In 1935, the Junction Boulevard line was rebuilt. The former dirt roadbed was replaced with concrete, to go along with heavier rails and improved trolley wire. In late 1936, Grand Avenue service was once again extended along Junction Boulevard. In 1938, the City of New York notified the B&QT; to abandon the remaining line north of the planned Grand Central Parkway in the North Beach vicinity, due to the construction of the New York Municipal Airport on the Glenn H. Curtiss/North Beach Airport site which replaced the resort area. Due to conflicts with the city over a potential extension to the new municipal airport, the Junction line was never extended to the facility. The last trolley to North Beach ran on December 9, 1938, after which service was truncated to Ditmars Boulevard at the south end of the 94th Street overpass over the Grand Central Parkway. The airport, later named LaGuardia Airport, opened on October 15, 1939, with special B&QT; bus service between the trolleys and the Airport. A Q72 entering LaGuardia-bound service at Junction and Queens Boulevards Around this time, many streetcar lines in Queens and the rest of the city began to be replaced by buses, particularly after the unification of city's three primary transit companies (including the BMT) under municipal operations in June 1940. Under public operations, Junction Boulevard trolley service became a shuttle once again in February 1946. On August 25, 1949, the trolley line was replaced by buses, and relocated onto 94th Street north of 32nd Avenue. Although initially planned to be extended north to LaGuardia Airport and south to Queens Boulevard, the route continued to run only between Corona Avenue and Ditmars Boulevard/Grand Central Parkway. In spite of running entirely in Queens, the route was numbered \\"B72\\", \\"B\\" standing for Brooklyn; the Flushing‚ÄìRidgewood and Grand Street lines also received Brooklyn designations (B58 and B59). The B59 and B72 originally operated out of the now-closed Crosstown Depot in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. A second route, called the B72A, was proposed as an inra-airport shuttle between the LaGuardia Overseas Terminal Administration Building (now the Marine Air Terminal) at 85th Street and 102nd Street (near the current Terminal C). This route, which was not implemented, would have connected with the B72 at 94th Street and Ditmars Boulevard, and replaced the between Flushing and the Airport. In 1954 and again in July 1960, the Green Bus Lines, Triboro Coach, and Jamaica Buses companies (all owned by the shareholders of Green Lines) proposed to take over many city-operated bus lines in Queens and Brooklyn, including the Junction Boulevard route. At the same time as the 1960 proposal, the New York City Transit Authority applied for an extension of the Junction Boulevard route south from Corona Avenue to Queens Boulevard (its current terminus). That year, the B72 was moved to the Flushing Depot in Queens. On January 22, 1961, the B72 was transferred to Triboro Coach and renumbered Q72. It was extended south to Queens Boulevard to serve burgeoning apartments in Rego Park and Elmhurst, as well as the local Alexander's department store (now the Rego Center). It was also extended north to the LaGuardia Airport Administration building (Marine Air Terminal). The Q72 was the only city route to be taken over by a private operator. The switch to private operations eliminated the longtime free transfer to the B58 Flushing‚ÄìRidgewood service at Corona Avenue. By the 1970s, the Q72 bus was truncated back to Ditmars Boulevard and 94th Street. On February 2, 2006, the operations of Triboro Coach were taken over by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) under the MTA Bus Company brand.

The songs on the album were recorded over a period of three years from 1936 to 1939, then released in 1941 on this compilation album by Columbia Records (C44). Artists featured on the album include Harry James, Count Basie, Big Joe Turner, and the three prominent boogie-woogie pianists of the time, Albert Ammons, Pete Johnson, and Meade Lux Lewis. Background Boogie-woogie music was enjoying a surge in popularity in the 1930s and 40s. Record producer John Hammond invited Johnson and Turner to New York to appear at Carnegie Hall along with Ammons and Lewis in the first \\"From Spirituals to Swing\\" concert held on December 23, 1938. Count Basie, who was leading a quintet and sextet as well as his big band, also performed at the concert. The boogie-woogie pianists were a sensation, igniting a boogie craze that would last for a decade. Earlier that year, Hammond had paved the way for Jazz performances at Carnegie Hall by organizing the appearance of the Benny Goodman orchestra on January 16, 1938, which featured Harry James on trumpet. The day after the \\"From Spirituals to Swing\\" concert, Alan Lomax recorded Ammons, Lewis and Johnson for the Library of Congress. On December 30, 1938, the three pianists cut the two-sided \\"Boogie Woogie Prayer\\" for Vocalion Records; Lewis recorded \\"Bear Cat Crawl\\" on the same date, and Ammons recorded the flip side, \\"Shout for Joy,\\" two days later. The December 30, 1938 session also yielded Turner and Johnson's first record, \\"Roll 'Em Pete,\\" backed with \\"Goin' Away Blues.\\" Ammons and Lewis played \\"Roll 'Em\\" with Benny Goodman's band on the Camel Caravan radio program on January 3 and April 11 of 1939; Johnson did the same on January 31. On February 1, at John Hammond's suggestion, Ammons and Johnson each recorded a couple of sides (\\"Boo-Woo\\" and \\"Woo-Woo\\") for Brunswick Records with trumpeter Harry James, who had just left Goodman's band. Later that year, all three pianists were billed with James's own big band, featuring the then-unknown Frank Sinatra at the Hotel Sherman in Chicago. The earliest of the recordings, \\"Boogie Woogie\\" by Pinetop Smith and recorded by Count Basie, resulted after John Hammond had heard Basie's band over short-wave radio and went to Kansas City to check them out. Hammond invited the band to Chicago in October, 1936 to record four sides which were released on Vocalion under the band name of Jones-Smith Incorporated; the sides were \\"Shoe Shine Boy\\", \\"Evening\\", \\"Boogie Woogie\\", and \\"Oh, Lady Be Good\\". Though Basie had already signed with Decca Records, he did not have his first recording session with them until January 1937. Release In December 1931, Warner Bros., which owned the Vocalian label, licensed the label to American Record Corporation (ARC). ARC, in turn, was purchased by CBS, and Vocalion became a subsidiary of Columbia Records in 1938. Though all four records in this album set were originally available as singles on the Vocalion or Brunswick labels, they each carry the Columbia label in this set. The album cover was designed by Alex Steinweiss. Track listing These songs were featured in a four-disc, 78 rpm album set, Columbia Album No. C44.

The exhibition Implicated and Immune was curated by Louis Johnston (now Louis Le Vaillant) at the Fisher Gallery in Pakuranga (now Te Tuhi). The first exhibition in Auckland to respond to the AIDS crisis, the exhibition featured work by John Barnett, Jack Body, Fear Brampton, Lillian Budd, Malcolm Harrison, Lesley Kaiser, Philip Kelly, Richard Killeen, Lily Laita, Steven Lovett, Richard McWhannell, Fiona Pardington, John Reynolds, Richard Wearns and Jane Zusters. Some works in the exhibition dealt explicitly with the topic of AIDS: Philip Kelly's Aids Timeline, for example, presented a text-base chronology of major events in the history of HIV/AIDs in New Zealand, beginning with an article published in OUT! magazine in 1983. Works by Richard McWhannell, Steven Lovett, Malcolm Harrison and Jane Zusters expressed personal grief or elegised men who had died of AIDs-related illnesses. Other works, such Richard Killeen's Burial Mound and John Reynolds' The Cause of the Movement of the Heart were less directly related to the theme of the exhibition. Writing in the arts journal Art New Zealand, critic and artist Giovanni Intra noted the exhibition stemmed from the desire to improve the understanding of HIV/AIDs in the wider community: > Thus, the exhibition view AIDS as a social as well as biomedical phenomenon, > an epidemic of signification, the effects of which extend far beyond the > risks of contagion. The show called for an artistic practice that would > reach the various communities which have special concerns in this area. Intra concluded that the exhibition 'succeeded in presenting a sophisticated and diverse commentary, a variety of takes on the issue of AIDS in New Zealand, but that it also did seem, however, to under-represent the communities that it referred to, groups which were critical to its development. For instance, in the exhibition there was no real acknowledgement of the New Zealand AIDS Foundation and the Prostitutes' Collective. There was no Safe Sex or testing information available inside the Gallery. Film screenings were a very exciting but unfortunately unrealizable idea.' An accompanying publication included writing on AIDS, art and society by Tim Walker, queer culture and AIDS by Rex Pilgrim, the New Zealand AIDS quilt project by Darren Horn and reproductions of New Zealand AIDS Foundation safe sex posters. 2015 re-staging In January 2015 Auckland dealer gallery Michael Lett showed Implicated and Immune, a reprise of the 1992 exhibition. The exhibition included work by artists included in the original exhibition (including Richard Killeen, John Reynolds and Fiona Pardington) and work by other artists (including Julia Morison, choreographer Douglas Wright, Imogen Taylor, Ava Seymour and Grant Lingard). A major feature of the show were photographer Fiona Clark's four large photo-albums Living with AIDS, made between 1988 and 1989. The albums document the lives of people living with AIDS, through photographs and hand-written notations.

Background Before becoming a part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1919, Chachersk was a part of the Pale of Settlement, the only section of the Russian Empire in which Jews could permanently live. Thus, Eastern Belarus had a large Jewish population, with the January 1939 Soviet census estimating the Jewish population of the region at 375,000 people.SmilovitÔ∏†sÔ∏°kiƒ≠, Leonid. Katastrofa Evreev v Belorussii, 1941-1944 Gg. Tel π-Aviv: Biblioteka MatveiÔ∏†aÔ∏° Chernogo, 2000. Print. The 1939 census further estimated the Jewish population of the Gomel Oblast at 62,146 inhabitants, and the population of the shtetl of Chachersk at around 977 Jews. Operation Barbarossa and evacuation On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, incited by Adolf Hitler's desire to expand the Third Reich by gaining lebensraum for the German people. Nazi ideology dictated that in order for the Aryan race to thrive and multiply in newly captured land, it must first be rid of \\"life unworthy of life\\". Since Chachersk had a predominantly Jewish population, as well as a substantial concentration of Romani people, it would be a prime target for genocide. German troops invaded Eastern Belarus and the Gomel Oblast, but were staved off by fierce resistance from partisans and Red Army units, who briefly halted the German advance. However, they were ultimately unsuccessful in defeating the Nazis, as the last pockets of Soviet and partisan resistance were dispatched in August and September 1941, leaving the Jews of Gomel Oblast defenseless and subject to the whims of the Germans. Hearing word of the imminent advance of the Wehrmacht and of Nazi atrocities, the Jews of Chachersk organized a mass evacuation, which proved successful. The majority of the Jewish inhabitants were evacuated from the shtetl, and around 200 remained when the Germans occupied Chachersk and the surrounding area. Ghettoization and liquidation Chachersk was captured by the Nazis on August 14, 1941, and as with the rest of the Gomel Oblast, was put under the jurisdiction of the rear of Army Group Center, commanded by General der Infanterie Max von Schenckendorff.43136 A ghetto in the shtetl of Chachersk was immediately established for the remaining 200 Jews in September 1941. Like the numerous other ghettos in Nazi-controlled Europe, living conditions in the Chachersk Ghetto were inhumane and many Jews who disobeyed the Germans were locked away in prisons, where they died of starvation. As months went by, the Nazis started to gradually murder the Jewish population of Chachersk; in late November 1941, 80 Jews were rounded up and were executed in an anti-tank ditch. On December 28, 1941, the ghetto of Chechersk was liquidated, on the orders of General Schenckendorff. The Jews of Chechersk and local Romani people were shot and buried together in a mass grave, in an Aktion that killed a total of 432 people. While most of the Jews and Romani were shot, the elderly, the frail and some women and children were strangled to death, as these victims were sickly and could be easily killed without the effort of rounding them up and shooting them. Einsatzgruppen death squads, Wehrmacht soldiers and Belarusian Auxiliary Police worked in conjunction to exterminate the Jews and Romani, and the rank-and-file army units were reported to show full participation in the killings. The Belarusian Auxiliary Police displayed exceptional cruelty, and often searched for hiding Jews after the mass killing had taken place.

It is hosted by the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). As preprints, papers hosted on bioRxiv are not peer-reviewed, but undergo basic screening and checked against plagiarism. Readers may offer comments on the preprint. It was inspired by and intends to complement the arXiv repository, which mostly focuses on mathematics, physics and connected disciplines, launched in 1991 by Paul Ginsparg (who also serves on the bioRxiv advisory board). It received support from both the CSHL and the Lourie Foundation. Additional funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was confirmed in April 2017. Prior to the establishment of bioRxiv, biological scientists were divided on the issue of having a dedicated preprint open-access repository. Many had concerns of having their research scooped by competitors and losing their claim to discovery. However, several geneticists had submitted papers to the \\"quantitative biology\\" section of the arXiv repository (launched in 2003) and no longer had those concerns, as they could point to preprints to support their claims of discovery. As a result of bioRxiv's popularity, several biology journals have updated their policies on preprints, clarifying they do not consider preprints to be a 'prior publication' for purpose of the Ingelfinger rule. Over 20,000 tweets were made about bioRxiv-hosted preprints in 2015. In July 2017, the number of monthly submissions exceeded 1,000. As of December 31, 2019, over 68,000 papers have been accepted in total. A service called Rxivist combines preprints from bioRxiv with data from Twitter to rank pre-prints. MedRxiv, and its sister site, bioRxiv, have been major sources for the dissemination of research COVID-19. Submission rate Jocelyn Kaiser of Science said that in their first year, the repository had \\"attracted a modest but growing stream of papers\\", having hosted 824 preprints. As of February 2016, the submission rate to bioRxiv had steadily increased from ‚âà60 to ‚âà200 per month. In 2017, the number of monthly submissions rose from over 800 in March to more than 1000 in July with a total number of 10,722 papers submitted in 2017. In the year of 2018, a total of 20,000 manuscripts were submitted, which results in a monthly average of 1600 papers.

They subsequently added bassist Inbar Perser and singer Hagit Tawil (later replaced with Sapir Gezber). The band made its debut at the Israeli pub C'naan during Sukkot of 2008, and have performed at various seminaries, girl's schools, pubs, and small halls throughout Israel, as well as Bar-Ilan.

The province bordered Kushanshahr in the west, Abarshahr in the east, Marv in the north, and Sakastan in the south. Name The Middle Iranian name of Harev ( Harƒìw, Harƒìw, Sogdian: Harƒìw) is derived from Old Persian Haraiva.  History  Harev is first mentioned in Shapur I's inscription on the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht. It was also during his reign that the town Pushang was established near the capital of Harev, which had the same name as its province, and is today known as Herat. In ca. 430, a Christian community is mentioned in the capital. The province played a key role in the boundless wars between the Sasanians and the Xionites and Hephthalites, an nomadic people who had settled in Transoxiana and Tokharistan in the late 4th-century. During the reign of Peroz I (r. 459‚Äì484), a group of Armenian nobles were settled in Harev by his foster brother Izad Gushnasp. In 484, Peroz I was defeated and killed by a Hephthalite army under Khushnavaz, who thereafter conquered Harev. The province remained in Hephthalite hands until Kavadh I (r. 488‚Äì496 & 498‚Äì531) reconquered the province during the early part of his second reign. During the reign of his son and successor Khosrow I (r. 531-579), the province became part of the kust of Khorasan. In 588, during the reign of Hormizd IV (r. 579‚Äì590), Nestorian bishops from Harev went to the Sasanian capital Ctesiphon to be present at the synod of Ishoyahb I. In the same year, Harev was briefly occupied by the G√∂kt√ºrk ruler Bagha Qaghan (known as Sava/Saba in medieval Iranian sources). He was, however, defeated and killed by Hormizd IV's military commander Bahram Chobin. After the death of the last Sasanian king Yazdegerd III (r. 632‚Äì651) in 651, the province was annexed by the Hephthalite ruler of Badghis, Nezak Tarkhan. One year later, the province was conquered by the Arabs.  Coin minting  Harev served as a coin minting workshop; several gold and copper coins have been found in its capital, which are clearly from the Sasanian era. Although the Sasanians did not normally mint gold coins, Harev was an exception. The gold coins show a portrait of the ruler on one side, while a fire altar on the other. Some of the names of the governors on the coins has a close resemblance to the names of the Indo-Sasanians, which suggests that the Indo-Sasanian governor also had control over Harev at times.

She is the only woman to have served as vice president of the Zionist Organization of America and the American Jewish Congress. A Russian immigrant, Silverman arrived in the United States before she was a year old. Her family settled in Providence, Rhode Island, where she completed her schooling, married and had four children. While doing relief work during the First World War, she became aware of the depth of social problems and the effects of war on refugees. Joining the Zionist movement in the 1900s, within a decade she became a motivational speaker, advocating for the establishment of a permanent Jewish home in Palestine. Between 1925 and the late 1940s, she logged over 600,000 air-miles traveling throughout the world, speaking and fund raising for the creation of a Jewish state. Even during World War II, she received special permission to travel into war-torn areas to evaluate conditions. At the war's end, Silverman turned her efforts toward building infrastructure in the new nation of Israel, but was also involved in philanthropy in her home state of Rhode Island, raising funds for hospitals and mental health organizations. She received many honors and awards for her philanthropy including Jewish Mother of the Year, the Mizrachi Women's Organization of America's \\"Silver Medal\\" for building Israel, honorary doctorates, and jointly with her husband was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 1971. Biography Ida Marcia Camelhor was born on 31 October 1882 in Kovno, Russia to Mary (n√©e Dember) and Louis Camelhor (also noted as Lieb Kamelhorn). She was the only surviving child of a family of eight. Before her first birthday, her parents immigrated to New York and then when she was around ten years old, they moved to Providence, Rhode Island. She attended public grammar school and high school and, at sixteen years old, went to work as a bookkeeper for Archibald Silverman. Archibald, also an immigrant, had begun his career as a designer of costume jewelry. Together with his brother, Charles, he established the Silverman Brothers jewelry company in Providence in 1897. After two years of working in the jewelry business, Camelhor agreed to marry her boss; they wed in 1900. Archibald continued to work his way up and eventually became president of a bank and a philanthropist for Jewish causes. Though Ida was the spokesperson and \\"presence\\" of the causes in which the couple were involved, Archibald fully supported her participation and gave his time, moral support, and monetary contributions to further their philanthropy. He also understood and accepted that her work for others would always take precedence over her own household duties. Career Ida Silverman and daughter 1925By age 20, Silverman had two children, and would soon have two more. She was involved in the community of Providence and social betterment programs. She founded and served as president of the Ladies Auxiliary of the Jewish Orphanage of Rhode Island. By 1906, she was involved in the American Zionist Movement and rose to the national position of vice president of the Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America. Relief work during World War I awakened her to the broad variety of social needs and she became an advocate of health care, poverty relief, and finding a permanent solution for Jewish refugees. In 1915, Silverman founded the second Hadassah chapter in New England in Providence. She was a \\"skilled propagandist\\", developing a wide following between 1915 and 1919, and was known as a vigorous leader and talented orator. Her first acknowledgement on the national level was her appointment in 1919 to honorary vice president of the American Jewish Congress (AJC). Traditionally, the AJC leadership were more focused on European Jews than worldwide outreach and were of the aristocratic, wealthy, Reform tradition. By 1919 the organization had become more diverse and while not necessarily embracing the more radical aspects of Zionism, leaders allowed Zionist views to be expressed. Silverman, as an honorary official, could use the status to her advantage: while not officially speaking for the organization, she tacitly had AJC endorsement and was able to parlay that into support from the masses for causes and monetary contributions from elites. =1920s= In 1925 Silverman made her first trip to Palestine and was able to use her experiences to gain speaking engagements in a variety of venues. Throughout the remainder of the 1920s, Silverman served as vice president of the Zionist Organization of America and vice chair of the hospital building fund for the Hebrew University. In addition to her national organizational work, Silverman was vice president of the New England Zionist Region, the New England Conference of Hadassah, and an honorary president of the Hadassah Organization in Providence. and She is the only woman to have served as vice president of the Zionist Organization of America and the American Jewish Congress. Ida Silverman National Jewish Fund Silverman was an outspoken proponent for Israeli statehood, traveling throughout the Americas and Europe advocating for a Jewish homeland. She depicted the Jews who had resettled in Palestine as simple farmers, seeking an agrarian life to alleviate the hunger they had experienced elsewhere. Silverman stressed that the settlers' intent was not to industrialize and vie with the international powerhouse nations, but simply to provide for their basic needs. Throughout 1927 and 1928, her itinerary included a speaking engagement in Savannah, Georgia with Sir Wyndham Deedes, prior chief secretary of Palestine; a tour of hospitals, clinics and public health programs in the Holy Land to determine how Hadassah could improve the health of the entire region, \\"without regard to race or creed\\"; and attendance at the World Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland. Silverman resigned from Hadassah in 1928 in a policy dispute over the high salaries being paid to administrators rather than using the funds for charitable works. =1930s= Silverman in 1938 Despite the Great Depression, Silverman's travels expanded in the 1930s, when she began spending 6 months each year outside the U.S. As early as 1932, land purchase programs to buy and settle refugees on permanent homes in Palestine were being pursued by Jewish organizations. Silverman not only supported the plans and raised funds for them, but she planted the first tree in the colony at Wady Havarith. With Hitler's rise to power, Silverman's pleas for a safe haven for Jews became more urgent and her first-hand reports from Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, and Poland contained explicit accounts of conditions. In 1938, Silverman was working with the Youth Aliyah Movement in conjunction with Hadassah in the U.S. to relocate 10,000 refugee children to Palestine. As a fund-raiser, Silverman's goal was to raise a quarter of a million dollars for resettlement and youth training in agricultural and vocational pursuits. In 1939, she ended her Polish tour studying the conditions and desperation, shortly before the Polish invasion, but the effort was successful in relocating some 7,000 young people from Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Romania to Palestine before the end of 1940. =1940s= Because riots had broken out in the late 1930s over British proposals to partition Palestine, and U.S. diplomats including Sumner Welles proposed American alternatives, Silverman embarked on several tours of South America and the Caribbean in the early 1940s to determine if, as an alternative to Palestinian resettlement, European Jews could be established in the Dominican Republic, Peru, or Uruguay. She reported on her findings at the Inter-American Conference in Baltimore, describing the alternatives as unfavorable and the attempt in the Dominican Republic, as a \\"failure\\". She also wrote articles under the byline Mrs. Archibald Silverman, urging the emigration of Jews to Palestine rather than to other places - such as a Jewish colony in Sos√∫a, Dominican Republic, promoted by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee in the early 1940s; a plan to settle Jews in the Kimberley region of Australia; and another proposal for a Jewish colony in Paramaribo, Suriname. Her articles were filled with vitriol against what she perceived as the \\"schemes\\" of Jewish organizers opposed to Zionism; in a 1948 article titled \\"The Surinam Nightmare\\", she \\"described 'diabolical plans' to abandon Jewish 'guinea pigs' to 'terrifying tropical diseases'\\". Eventually the alternative emigration plans were scrapped in the wake of the 1948 declaration of independence by the State of Israel. Joseph Jacobsen After the Inter- American Conference in Baltimore, Silverman continued her travels in South America and then obtained special permission to travel through England, Scotland, and Ireland to raise money. Her collections were a resounding success, which she attributed to the acute understanding of homelessness experienced by British citizens who had been displaced during bombing raids. Anticipating the war's end, Silverman increased efforts to buy land in Palestine, believing that if Jewish organizations owned land, when the Peace Conference occurred, bargaining would be in their favor. As the war was ending in 1945, Silverman was on the road, traveling through all the countries of Central America, in South America, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa on fund-raising missions. Then in 1946, she was in Europe visiting refugee camps in Sweden and Occupied Germany, before returning to Palestine. By the end of the war, she had traveled 600,000 air-miles having visited every state in the United States, each province of Canada, Mexico, all of the countries in Central and South America, the West Indies, almost all of Western Europe, parts of Eastern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Iran, Palestine, Morocco, and South Africa. =1950s and 1960s= Ida Silverman in 1960 After the State of Israel was established, Silverman recognized the diverse needs to build the nation and she and Archibald channeled funds into planting orchards, building the Sharon Hotel, and supplementing the Synagogue Centre Building Fund. The Sharon Hotel, built in Herzliya, on the Sharon Plain, was part of an effort to build infrastructure and develop tourism sites to stimulate further growth. Silverman founded and served the board of the company which created the hotel. In the Jezreel Valley, she chaired a water development company and established a mixed-fruit orchard of around 70 acres of trees. She also was involved in several projects in Rhode Island. In 1955 she founded and served as president of the Friends of Butler Hospital in an attempt to reopen the health center, which had been shut down. They were successful in proving its benefit to the community and the hospital reopened. In 1957, Silverman served as chair of the fundraising for the Rhode Island Association of Mental Health. By the early-1960s, 33 synagogues throughout Israel had been built through the synagogue fund. During the two years she lived in Israel, she helped erect around 80 additional synagogues and by the time of Silverman's death, the number was over 100 synagogues in Israel and elsewhere. =1970s= In 1971, at the age of 89, Silverman immigrated to Israel. She died on 1 November 1973 in Herzliya, Israel and was buried in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery near Jerusalem. Honors and awards In 1951 Silverman was honored as Jewish Mother of the Year by the Jewish National Fund, which established a forest in Israel bearing her name. In 1953, a village in Israel, Nachlat Ida, was named in her honor to recognize her years of financial and moral support, and in 1954, she was honored as Rhode Island Mother of the Year. She received an honorary doctorate from Rhode Island College in 1954 and one from Bryant College in 1960. In 1964, she was awarded the Mizrachi Women's Organization of America's \\"Silver Medal\\" for having done the most to build Israel. Silverman and her husband (who had died in 1966) were jointly inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 1971.

First reported in 2001, DPN was the first selective ERŒ≤ agonist to be discovered, and was followed by prinaberel (ERB-041, WAY-202041), WAY-200070, and 8Œ≤-VE2 in 2004, ERB-196 (WAY-202196) in 2005, and certain phytoestrogens like liquiritigenin and nyasol (cis- hinokiresinol) since 2007. DPN is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, (R)-DPN and (S)-DPN. Relative to (R)-DPN, (S)-DPN has between 3- and 7-fold higher affinity for ERŒ≤ and appears to have higher intrinsic activity in activating ERŒ≤. However, both enantiomers have very high affinity, potency, selectivity for ERŒ≤ and efficaciously activate ERŒ≤. In any case, it has been suggested that (S)-DPN might be the preferred enantiomer to use for scientific research.

It is located on the East Side of the city, bound by Franklin Pl., Prospect Ave., and Ogden Ave. It is split into two sections by Knapp Street. The larger, northern section is landscaped with trees, lawn and walkways, and includes public art. The smaller southern portion holds a statue of Scottish poet Robert Burns.  History  In 1847, developer James H. Rogers donated the land to the city, making it one of Milwaukee's earliest parks. At the time it was named First Ward Park. It was later named Franklin Square. As stately homes were built around the park, four of the neighboring homeowners took on its upkeep. They provided landscaping and built a fountain. Alt URL By the turn of the century, the park was known as Baby Park, since the nursemaids in the affluent neighborhood took their charges to the pleasant park. In 1909 a statue of Robert Burns was donated by Scottish immigrant James Anderson Bryden and erected on the south end of the park. Its dedication was on June 26, 1909. The bronze statue, set on a plinth of Nova Scotia granite, was designed by Scottish sculptor William Grant Stevenson. In 1937, the parks of the city and of the county of Milwaukee were consolidated into the Milwaukee County Parks system. At that time, the park became known as Robert Burns Triangle. This was not official, however, since a deed restriction required the name to be kept Franklin Square. In 1994 the restriction was removed, and the park was officially renamed. As of 2019 the Milwaukee Streetcar M-Line begins and ends on the north-east side of the park at the intersection of East Ogden Avenue and North Prospect Avenue.

It celebrated its 102nd anniversary on 1 April 2015. GSB's Swift code is GSBATHBK.  History  King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) introduced a means to save money to Thailand in 1913. His purpose was to introduce Thai people to banking services and to promote a habit of thrift and saving. King Vajiravudh issued an act, effective 1 April 1913, to formally set up a \\"Savings Office\\" which began its operations under the Royal Treasury. In 1929, in a period of economic depression, King Rama VII permitted the transfer of the bank to the Post and Telegraph Department of the Ministry of Commerce and Transportation to make it more convenient for citizens. The bank established new businesses such as travel savings, capital accumulation savings, and house deposit savings. By the end of 1936, a total of 104 branches of the Government Savings Bank around the country. After World War II, the government, recognizing the benefits of savings as well as the role that the Savings Office played in financial development, transformed it into a juristic person, to be operated independently under the supervision of a board of directors appointed by the finance minister as mandated by the Government Savings Bank Act B.E. 2489 (1946). The office was renamed the Government Savings Bank (GSB), effective 1 April 1947. GSB is now a juristic person and state enterprise operating as a financial institution guaranteed by the government under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance. GSB operates 1,141 branches throughout the country. Performance The bank showed total assets of 2,259,016 million baht as of 31 December 2014, ranked number four in the Thai banking sector. Net profit was 22,231 million baht, increasing 322 million baht or 1.5 percent over the previous year.
