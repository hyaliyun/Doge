The thickness of thermal insulation is dependent on whatever type is required in order to create a partition with a heat transmission factor of U=0.25-0.3 W/m2K. When calculating the actual insulation requirements, consideration must be given to current Building Regulation standards. Consideration must also be given to exposure and durability, and whether the structure might be subjected to vandalism etc. In many older properties, special attention is required for concrete beams or lintels which act as thermal bridges providing poor insulation. Types External wall insulation systems generally comprise firstly an insulation layer (an element which helps to achieve the requisite thermal performance); and secondly,a protected weatherproof finish (usually a render, although brick slips, tiles, and decorative boards can also be used). Insulating render can also be an advantage in certain locations. Choice of types and sizes will depend on the substrate and design exposure requirements. Dry finishes are usually fixed to the substrate by means of timber battens independently fixed to the substrate. Any system selected and installed, should be certified by a notified body. =Traditional finishes= A selection of traditional finishes is currently utilised within the external wall insulation industry. Dry-dash render is a traditional render application commonly used. By this method, dry dashing aggregate is thrown onto the wet render to create a natural aggregate finish. Available in a wide variety of colours, sizes and textures, the practice is relatively cheap. Manufactured aggregates such as ceramics and glass can be used for more specialised projects, but the costs will be greater than for projects using natural aggregates. Scratch plaster render is a coloured cementitious render scratched while the surface is still workable, but after the initial setting has taken place. The surface of the render is removed by the action of the scratching tool, and approximately of render are removed exposing the open matrix of the aggregate mix. The true colour of the render is exposed with a light even texture. Roughcast render consists of a top-coat render and aggregate mix thrown onto a backing coat in a slurry form, the aggregate being totally encapsulated within the cementitious slurry. The aggregate may be any hard stone of an equal graded size to suit the particular application and creates a ‚Äúlumpy texture‚Äù finish. This method is traditionally widely used in Scotland. An innovation is the inclusion of silicone water- proofers in pre-blended and pre-packed proprietary renders. This development increases the specification and capabilities of polymer renders, particularly for exposed or coastal areas. It is applied in the conventional manner and is now readily available in all the usual colours. Tyrolean finishes are sprayed cementitious mixes, pre-coloured and applied by a hand-held machine. This finish is widely used throughout the UK as an economical, easily applied colourful finish for all forms of building type. It has medium-term durability under average conditions. Smooth/painted finishes consist of masonry paint, and are applied to a good rendered surface to give a smooth coloured effect, free of the imperfections that the more natural aggregate finishes can sometimes deliver. A very wide selection of light colours are available. Textured coatings are applied by roller or trowel to an approximate thickness of , and are usually acrylic or silicone-based for waterproofing and long term durability. They produce an even, flat-textured, finish. Acrylic variants are easily applied, and are considered ‚Äúhigh performance‚Äù finishes. Some cheaper variants might result in the loss opacity of surface brightness over a relatively short life span. High quality acrylics can provide a longer term durability, colour stability, and crack resistance compared to polymer cement finishes. Acrylic variants are available in a very wide range of colours. Silicone variants are more resistant to marine environments than acrylics, as they have superior water resistance, but they can be more costly, and come in a smaller range of colours. Brick slips are a thin facing applied over an insulant to provide a traditional ‚Äúbrick‚Äù wall finish. Slips can either be manufactured by extrusion or cut from real bricks. Brick slips cut from real clay bricks boast the advantage of looking exactly like a brick wall when installed. Real brick slips cut from reclaimed bricks, when used with external cladding systems are used significantly in restoration and renovation works where the brick is no longer available to buy new. Brick slips can also be laid in various patterns, these are known in the industry as bond patterns. Brick Slips / Bond Patterns \\"Brick Slips Bond Patterns\\" Specialist waterproof coloured pointing mortars are used to complete the effect. Commercially available brick slip systems have been developed to include support for the brick slip finish, certified by BBA/BRE. The brick slips usually have a size of about 210-240 x 50-71 x 20 mm (length x height x width).Klinkerriemchen / The size from Brick slips \\"Klinkerriemchen / Brick slips\\" Simulated brick renders can also be replicated in coloured polymer to a high standard. Two coloured layers of polymer-modified external cementitious render are applied in layers onto a coloured backing. The ‚Äúbrick‚Äù pattern is cut into the top layer, exposing an under-layer of differing colour representing the cement joints. Simulated stone renders are made from coloured polymer. Two coloured layers of polymer-modified external cementitious render are applied in layers onto a specified backing. The ‚Äústone‚Äù pattern is cut into the top layer exposing an under-layer of differing colour to represent the cement joints. Terracotta tiles are usually of clay burnt material imported from Europe. These proprietary systems are secured by a system of extruded aluminium rail systems fixed securely to the substrate with insulation material inserted within the void. Special pressed metal profiles and cills are added to make them waterproof. Timber boards, aluminium or PVC ‚Äúsidings‚Äù can be installed over insulation to provide additional alternatives to the traditional render and applied finishes. The boards are usually of shiplap profile, and either cedar or treated softwood. Aluminium or PVC systems are also available as alternatives. Traditional tile hanging finishes can be applied onto conventional timber support structures and insulated with the required type and thickness of insulation. Suitable consideration has to be given to ventilation passages to avoid interstitial condensation. Reducing carbon emissions With the UK aiming to reduce its carbon emissions by 80% by the year 2050, the British government has offered up to ¬£6,000 cashback to homeowners who install EWI at their solid wall property. South Wales, where the housing stock is in particular need of being updated to become energy efficient, has seen a surge in applications for this scheme. External wall insulation is a great and confirmed way to reduce energy usage needed to heat up the building. Installing it is a part of and eco home or carbon neutral home idea. Product requirements Particular product requirements need to be met such as the external wall insulation product reaching a particular u-value in order to make the building sufficiently thermally insulated and therefore be used for a green deal project. Dampness The application of External Wall Insulation can help to deal with rain penetration problems through solid walls by blocking wind-driven rain. However, it can also make the problem worse if poor detailing (e.g. around eaves) allows water to pass behind the external wall insulation where it can become trapped. A high standard of design and installation should therefore be insisted upon. The dangers of not adequately designing and specifying these systems is dealt with in a research paper written by Joe Malone and published in the CIOB's Construction, Research and Innovation Journal (Volume 4, Issue 4, Dec 2013 The Risky Business of Covering Up) External Wall Insulation should only be applied to walls that do not suffer from pre-existing dampness problems. The Energy Saving Trust give the following advice. \\"The main damp issue to be avoided with external wall insulation is rising damp. If you already have a problem with this, then it will have to be fixed before the insulation is fitted, otherwise you run the risk of trapping the damp inside the wall structure and so making the problem worse.\\" See also *Exterior insulation finishing system *Building insulation *Building insulation materials *Thermal insulation Further reading *National Building Specification Section M21 Insulation with rendered finish *BSI British Standards and Code of Practice *BRE Report 135: EWI, Fire performance for multi-storey buildings *BRE Report 262: Thermal insulation avoiding the risks *INCA Insulated render and cladding Specifiers/property owners briefing *Technical Drawings: Weber UK EWI Systems *The Complete Guide to External Wall Insulation by C J Pearson *CIOB's Construction, Research & Innovation Journal: \\"The Risky Business of Covering Up\\" by Joe Malone *A Guide to External Wall Insulation (2018).

He resigned his seat in the U.S. Senate upon being elected President of the United States. Obama won the seat in an election against Alan Keyes who replaced Republican Primary election winner Jack Ryan. Prior to his election but after Ryan withdrew from the race, he rose to national prominence by delivering the 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address. Upon his election, he became the fifth African-American Senator in U.S. history, the third to have been popularly elected. As a Senator, he served on a variety of committees and chaired the United States Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs. His bill sponsorship and voting records indicates that he was a loyalist to the Democratic Party. He was considered to be among the most liberal by various analyses. In his first session (109th Congress), he was involved in immigration reform. Legislation bearing his name was passed for armament reduction and federal transparency as well as relief aid. In the first year of the 110th Congress, he worked on lobbying and campaign finance reform, election reform, climate control and troop reduction. In the second year, he legislated for oversight of certain military discharges, Iran divestment and nuclear terrorism reduction, but President George W. Bush vetoed his legislation for State Children's Health Insurance Program-related military family job protections. U.S. Senate campaign In May 2002, Obama began considering a run for the U.S. Senate, enlisting political strategist David Axelrod that Fall and formally announcing his candidacy in January 2003. Before deciding to run, Obama met with Jesse Jackson Jr., who was known to be considering a bid for the seat. \\"He said, 'Jesse, if you‚Äôre running for the U.S. Senate I‚Äôm not going to run,'\\" Jackson said in recounting the conversation to The New York Times in 2008. Jackson told Obama he had already decided not to run.Becker, Jo and Drew, Christopher, \\"Pragmatic Politics, Forged on the South Side\\", The New York Times, May 11, 2008. Retrieved July 28, 2008 Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun not to contest the race launched wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. Obama's candidacy was boosted by Axelrod's advertising campaign featuring images of the late Chicago Mayor Harold Washington and an endorsement by the daughter of the late Paul Simon, former U.S. Senator for Illinois. He received over 52% of the vote in the March 2004 primary, emerging 29% ahead of his nearest Democratic rival. See also: Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004. In August 2004, with less than three months to go before Election Day, Alan Keyes accepted the Illinois Republican Party's nomination to replace Ryan. A long time resident of Maryland, Keyes established legal residency in Illinois with the nomination. Through three televised debates, Obama and Keyes expressed opposing views on stem cell research, abortion, gun control, school vouchers, and tax cuts.For debate transcripts and video, see Alan Keyes Archives: Obama was criticized by Keyes, as he had also been by rival pro- choice candidates in the Democratic primary, for a series of \\"present\\" votes on late-term abortion and parental notification issues. Alt URL See also: The charge that Obama's \\"present\\" votes suggested he was not firmly pro choice was refuted by two lobbyists for pro-choice groups (including Planned Parenthood). In the general election of November 2004, Obama received 70% of the vote to Keyes's 27%, the largest victory margin for a statewide race in Illinois history. =Keynote address= In July 2004, he wrote and delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts.For details about the speech's genesis and delivery, see: See also: After describing his maternal grandfather's experiences as a World War II veteran and a beneficiary of the New Deal's FHA and G.I. Bill programs, Obama spoke about changing the U.S. government's economic and social priorities. He questioned the Bush administration's management of the Iraq War, and highlighted America's obligations to its soldiers. Drawing examples from U.S. history, he criticized heavily partisan views of the electorate and asked Americans to find unity in diversity, saying, \\"There is not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America.\\" Broadcasts of the speech by major news organizations launched Obama's status as a national political figure and boosted his campaign for U.S. Senate. With Obama facing nearly certain victory in his U.S. Senate race against Alan Keyes at the time combined with an overwhelmingly positive reaction to his address, speculation grew about the possibility of a potential Obama candidacy for President of the United States in 2008 or later. Following the speech, Chris Mathews even went as far as predicting that Obama would become the first African-American president. If he decided to run for President, he would join other African-Americans like Alan Keyes and Shirley Chisholm who had previous presidential runs. But as of 2004, no African-American had received a major party's presidential nomination and no African-American had won a presidential primary since Jesse Jackson in 1988. In addition, Hillary Clinton was favored by many to become the Democratic nominee and first ever female presidential nominee in 2008 while in contrast to Clinton, Obama's background and issue positions were still unknown to the majority of the public. For the next two years, Obama would downplay speculation of a future presidential run and focus instead on his duties as a U.S. Senator. Initial work Although a newcomer to Washington, he recruited a team of established, high-level advisers devoted to broad themes that exceeded the usual requirements of an incoming first-term senator. Obama hired Pete Rouse, a 30-year veteran of national politics and former chief of staff to Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, as his chief of staff, and economist Karen Kornbluh, former deputy chief of staff to Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin, as his policy director. His key foreign policy advisers have included former Clinton administration officials Anthony Lake and Susan Rice, as well as Samantha Power, author on human rights and genocide (who resigned March 7, 2008). Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations; Barack Obama's chairmanship of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs, Salon Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; and Veterans' Affairs, and he was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. See also: He was a chairman of the Subcommittee on European Affairs.Tom Baldwin, 'Stay-at-home' Barack Obama comes under fire for a lack of foreign experience, The Times Nonpartisan analyses of bill sponsorship and voting records placed him as a \\"rank-and-file Democrat\\" and \\"Democratic Party loyalist.\\" The U.S. Senate Historical Office lists him as the fifth African-American Senator in U.S. history, the third to have been popularly elected, and the only African-American serving in the Senate until he resigned his seat in November 2008 in preparation for his new job as the 44th President of the United States =Committees= * Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (110th Congress)  Subcommittee on Children and Families  Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety * Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (110th Congress)  Subcommittee on Investigations  Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information and International Security  Ad Hoc Subcommittee on State, Local, and Private Sector Preparedness and Integration * United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs * Committee on Environment and Public Works (109th Congress)  Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear Safety * Committee on Foreign Relations  Subcommittee on European Affairs (Chairman ‚Äì 110th Congress)  Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs  Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs  Subcommittee on African Affairs  Subcommittee on International Development and Foreign Assistance, Economic Affairs, and International Environmental Protection Source: United States Senate 109th Congress Source: United States Senate 110th Congress 109th Congress Senator Obama addresses the First Year Student Convocation at Boston College, September 2005. Obama took an active role in the Senate's drive for improved border security and immigration reform. In May 2005, he cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act introduced by Sen. John McCain (R‚ÄìAZ). He later added three amendments to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, which passed the Senate in May 2006, but failed to gain majority support in the U.S. House of Representatives. See also: In September 2006, Obama voted for a related bill, the Secure Fence Act, authorizing construction of fencing and other security improvements along the United States‚ÄìMexico border. President Bush signed the Secure Fence Act into law in October 2006, calling it \\"an important step toward immigration reform.\\" Senate bill sponsors Tom Coburn (R‚ÄìOK) and Obama discuss the Coburn-Obama Transparency Act. Partnering first with Sen. Richard Lugar (R‚ÄìIN), and then with Sen. Tom Coburn (R‚ÄìOK), Obama successfully introduced two initiatives bearing his name. Lugar-Obama expands the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons, including shoulder-fired missiles and anti-personnel mines. The Lugar-Obama initiative subsequently received $48 million in funding. The Coburn-Obama Transparency Act provides for the web site USAspending.gov, managed by the Office of Management and Budget. The site lists all organizations receiving Federal funds from 2007 onward and provides breakdowns by the agency allocating the funds, the dollar amount given, and the purpose of the grant or contract. Obama and Coburn also collaborated on repeated efforts to end the abuse of no-bid contracting in the aftermath of natural disasters. In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In August 2005, he traveled with Richard Lugar to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan. The trip focused on strategies to control the world's supply of conventional weapons, biological weapons, and weapons of mass destruction as a first defense against potential terrorist attacks. Following meetings with U.S. military in Kuwait and Iraq in January 2006, Obama visited Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian territories. At a meeting with Palestinian students two weeks before Hamas won the legislative election, Obama warned that \\"the U.S. will never recognize winning Hamas candidates unless the group renounces its fundamental mission to eliminate Israel.\\" He left for his third official trip in August 2006, traveling to South Africa, Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Chad. In a nationally televised speech at the University of Nairobi, he spoke forcefully on the influence of ethnic rivalries and corruption in Kenya. The speech touched off a public debate among rival leaders, some formally challenging Obama's remarks as unfair and improper, others defending his positions. 110th Congress In the first month of the newly Democratic controlled 110th Congress, Obama worked with Russ Feingold (D‚ÄìWI) to eliminate gifts of travel on corporate jets by lobbyists to members of Congress and require disclosure of bundled campaign contributions under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007. See also: He joined Chuck Schumer (D‚ÄìNY) in sponsoring S. 453, a bill to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections, including fraudulent flyers and automated phone calls, as witnessed in the 2006 midterm elections. See also: Obama's energy initiatives scored pluses and minuses with environmentalists, who welcomed his sponsorship with John McCain (R‚ÄìAZ) of a climate change bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds by 2050, but were skeptical of his support for a bill promoting liquefied coal production. Obama also introduced the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007, a bill to cap troop levels in Iraq, begin phased redeployment, and remove all combat brigades from Iraq before April 2008. \\"Latest Major Action: 1/30/2007 Referred to Senate committee.\\" Drawer of chamber desk XXIV that was once occupied in the U.S. Senate by Barack Obama.

Later in 2007, Obama sponsored with Kit Bond (R‚ÄìMO) an amendment to the 2008 Defense Authorization Act adding safeguards for personality disorder military discharges, and calling for a review by the Government Accountability Office following reports that the procedure had been used inappropriately to reduce government costs. See also: He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, See also: and joined Chuck Hagel (R‚ÄìNE) in introducing legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. A provision from the Obama-Hagel bill was passed by Congress in December 2007 as an amendment to the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill. Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to provide one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries. After passing both houses of Congress with bipartisan majorities, SCHIP was vetoed by President Bush in early October 2007, a move Obama said \\"shows a callousness of priorities that is offensive to the ideals we hold as Americans.\\" Legislation and voting record One analysis of bill co- sponsorship classified Obama as a \\"rank-and-file Democrat\\". Another, of party- line votes, tagged him a \\"Democratic Party loyalist.\\" See also: The National Journal, in its 27th annual vote ratings, identified Obama as \\"the most liberal senator\\" in 2007, See also: and though this conclusion was rated \\"Barely True\\" by PolitiFact. Asked about the Journal's characterization of his voting record, Obama expressed doubts about the survey's methodology and blamed \\"old politics\\" categorization of political positions as conservative or liberal for creating predispositions that prevent problem-solving. Ratings of Obama's liberalism by the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA), based on 20 ADA-selected votes each year, declined from 100% in 2005 to 95% in 2006, with one vote the ADA counted as not-liberal in 2006, and 75%, with five missed votes, in 2007. A study of the voting records of all one hundred senators, using an average of the ratings of seven liberal interest groups, described Obama as \\"among the least liberal\\", of the Democrats, scoring an 80%. Resignation and replacement in the U.S. Senate After his election to President of the United States, Obama announced on November 13, 2008 his plan to resign his Senate seat, effective on November 16, 2008. On January 12, 2009, the Senate accepted former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris as Obama's replacement after he was controversially appointed by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Recognition and honors While in the U.S. Senate, Obama had a number of awards and honors bestowed on him by various groups. An October 2005 article in the British journal New Statesman listed Obama as one of 10 people who could change the world, the only politician included on the list. In 2005 and again in 2007, Time magazine named him one of the world's most influential people. During his first three years in the U.S. Senate, Obama received Honorary Doctorates of Law from Knox College (2005), University of Massachusetts Boston (2006), Northwestern University (2006), Xavier University of Louisiana (2006), Southern New Hampshire University (2007), Howard University (2007), and Wesleyan University (2008). The audiobook edition of Dreams from My Father earned Obama the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2006. He won the award a second time in 2008 for the spoken word edition of The Audacity of Hope. A school in Obama's father's hometown, which the senator visited on his 2006 Kenya trip, was renamed the Senator Barack Obama Primary School.

History A linseed oil and varnish factory, Zabret & Comp., was established in Britof in 1905. Before the Second World War it had its own electrical generator and processed 300 train cars of linseed per year, mostly imported from Argentina and India. The oil and varnish were sold in Yugoslavia, and the linseed pomace was exported to Austria and Germany.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937.

The series contains five volumes to date; the first four of which have been translated into English. The story is about an ordinary girl named Mara Shin who winds up in a science-fantasy realm called \\"Oz\\". During her journey to return to her world, she meets up with Abee (Scarecrow), Namu (Tin Woodsman), and Tail (Cowardly Lion), and follows a mysterious Yellow Brick Road that may hold the key to the path home. Characters = Mara Shin = Codename: Dorothy. Once an ordinary schoolgirl from Seoul, Korea, Mara is the only person able to see the strange ‚Äúyellow brick road‚Äù, and as such, is often mistaken for the legendary ‚ÄúDorothy‚Äù by the majority of Oz's occupants. Despite the assumption by many that she is, indeed, Dorothy, Mara often reacts loudly and protestingly to being called as such, shouting, ‚ÄúMy name is Mara...Mara Shin!‚Äù By stomping her boots (given to her by Selluriah, the Witch of the East), she can turn into a witch. She is the owner of both the witch's boots (obviously the manhwa's version of the ruby slippers) and Thyrsos, a magical glove that when summoned turns into a staff. Thyrsos was previously owned by the Wizard of Oz. Although she lacks the knowledge and experience to use it correctly, when enraged it has been shown that she is capable of mass destruction. It is worth noting that whenever Mara uses the Yellow Brick Road, it is irrelevant where it is positioned: it might go right through a wall and she can cross it as long as she is walking on it, but any pursuer will be unable to find her. The only evidence are footprints left behind by Mara herself. Mara seems unable to remember Thyrsos‚Äô name, as she frequently refers to it as ‚ÄúTomato Sauce‚Äù, only to be corrected by Selluriah, but later on starts correcting herself. She has a huge crush 120% on Abee, praising his smile and kind, gentle qualities while once being intoxicated, although Abee had no clue what she meant by any of it. She seems to have a tendency to forget Toto and later running back to find him. Funnily enough, being drunk seems to amplify her power in Witch mode, or at least give her better direction. Before drinking the Dwarfs' beer, she was almost incapable of performing magic, but after getting drunk, she wielded both fire and electricity spells with such frightening ability that Tick Tock began to consider her a new and serious threat to the South. Despite her rather impressive temper, Mara seems to dislike fighting, although is initially very eager to learn to use magic. = Toto = Toto is a small creamy-yellow colored dog and Mara's constant companion and pet. He was responsible for Mara's coming to Oz, as he stole her ‚Äúlucky‚Äù glove and ran down the yellow brick road (which was situated in a seemingly normal alleyway in Mara's hometown), causing her to follow him in an attempt to get both him and her glove back. Unfortunately, after doing so, she could not find the way back home, and she and Toto were taken in by Selluriah. Toto has a habit of barking ferociously at any and all who annoy him, up to and including a dangerous ‚Äúpig bear‚Äù, Tail, an assassin, Tick Tock, a flock of bats, and the Seven Dwarfs. = Abee = Codename: Scarecrow (‚ÄúHuhsuabee‚Äù). Abee is one of several clones created to be the Witch of the West's ‚Äúsecret weapon‚Äù. Unlike the others, he is gentle and has a strange habit of mixing up his vocabulary, to be corrected by Mara, who seems to be the only one who can fully translate his mixed-up speech. His special power is telekinesis, which makes him particularly dangerous in a fight when provoked into using it. He met Mara when she came across him tied to a scarecrow (a reference to the original Scarecrow) and let him down after giving him some important grammar lessons. He lost his memory shortly before being tied up, and was beaten for not giving information to the soldiers who tied him up (the only reason he was silent was because his loss of memory also caused him to forget how to speak), eventually telling Mara that she was the ‚Äúonly one who [was] nice to [him]‚Äù. Abee was created by the Witch of the West and, unlike the other clones, he has a codename rather than a number. He is seemingly very powerful, as he is capable of matching a very high ranking clone, Number 3, in split seconds. Abee got his name from Mara, who merely shortened his codename's Korean lettering, ‚ÄúHuhsuabee‚Äù, down to the last four letters. As of the fourth book in the series, he seems to have formed a slight rivalry with Namu. Abee holds Mara in extremely high esteem, right down to losing his temper whenever she is threatened or attacked and promising to protect her from Namu, should said cyborg ever try to do anything to her. = Namu = Codename: Tin Woodsman. Namu is a cyborg (essentially half human, half machine),Dorothy of Oz, volume 4: Dr. Nedbar explains the differences between androids and cyborgs. He explains that androids are machines with mechanical parts, while cyborgs have both mechanical and natural systems. and predictably is calm, quiet, logical, and virtually emotionless. He has the ability to create holograms, as well as cause ax blades to come out of his wrists, making his already super-strong punches even more dangerous. Namu has three distinct modes, Defense Mode, Control Mode, and Combat Mode,Dorothy of Oz, volume 4: After failing to stop Tick Tock on the first 2 modes, Namu executes Combat Mode to defeat her. and is said to be the finest project ever produced by the South Lab. Strangely for a robotic being, he has an aversion to killing, even protecting his own assaulter (Tick Tock) from a bullet. He was originally sent to find Mara, but when she accidentally electrocuted him, he short circuited and lost a great deal of his memory and data. After his fight with Tick Tock, Dr. Nedbar implanted a self-destruct program into him, as Namu feared his own Attack Mode and wanted to ensure he wouldn‚Äôt accidentally attack Mara should he regain his memory and find that his original mission was to eliminate her. Despite the fact that they are enemies, Namu apparently cares for Tick Tock's well-being, going so far as to protect her from a bullet right after she tried to kill him and saved her from falling off a cliff before he even knew who she was. Like Abee, he got his name from Mara, who gave him the Korean name for ‚Äúwood‚Äù or ‚Äútree‚Äù. = Tail = Codename: Cowardly Lion. Despite his codename, Tail is anything but cowardly, and even makes a comment about it when called a ‚ÄúCowardly Lion‚Äù by Pillanin. He is a lion chimera, with the ears, tail, and claws of a lion. Included with the package is super strength rivaling that of Namu. Like the cat he is, he moves very fluidly and gracefully. However, he is rather feminine in appearance, having long red hair and slanted eyes, causing confusion in many readers upon discovering that he is, indeed, a boy. He is also constantly hungry, and tends to get angry and start shouting when contradicted or criticized. He was first seen dashing through the woods near the South, wearing nothing but his black tank top and necklace, and apparently running for his life from some sort of giant rat creature. Tail was created by the Witch of the North. = Lieutenant Pillanin = Pillanin is a lieutenant in the Oz Military, but unfortunately has gone extremely bad. He experimented not only on the people of Brick Village, but also on himself and his second- in-command Wolf (he turned himself into a vampire chimera, and Wolf into a wolf chimera). He was able to cause trouble for Mara and her friends, but was ultimately no match for Shine, who arrived to take him into custody for his illegal experimenting. His power increases by drinking blood. Pillanin's fate is, as yet, unknown, last shown being carried off by Shine's men. = Special Agent Shine = Shine, like Pillanin, is an officer in the Oz Military, albeit a much higher ranking one, with the title of ‚ÄúSpecial Agent‚Äù (‚ÄúSecret Agent‚Äù in the chapter title). Shine is relatively young but vastly experienced‚Äîhe is said to be 1.35 times faster than Namu and was able to defeat Pillanin in his strongest form without even trying. He wields a saber that, when struck, splits into several dart-like pieces that he somehow controls despite not having telekinesis. Shine also seems to have his own agenda, as he blows up Brick Village for the sole purpose of driving Mara into a rage, and even states that ‚Äú[he wants] to drive them crazy...and make them destroy Oz‚Äù. = Wolf = Wolf is Pillanin's second-in-command and heavy muscle. As his name suggests, he is a wolf chimera. Wolf was able to give Namu a fairly decent thrashing, but was himself thrashed by Tail, who knocked him out with one punch. He and Tail were mainly adversaries, although because a wolf is a weaker creature than a lion, was no match for him in the end. His fate is unknown, although it is assumed he was killed in the explosion that destroyed Brick Village, as Shine ordered only Pillanin to be taken away. He was last seen losing all energy and reverting to his human form, as Pillanin used him as an outside energy source to make himself stronger. = Selluriah, the Witch of the East = The Witch of the East, Selluriah was the original owner of the magical boots. She appears young, but takes extreme pleasure in being called a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù by Mara and reacts violently to Indigo calling her old (Indigo later tells Mara that Selluriah's true age is classified information, and that she will kill him if he reveals it). She also no longer considers herself a true witch because after she and the other witches attempted to fight the Wizard of Oz, she realized that the Wizard doesn't need any weapons to use magical powers (unlike her, who needed a medium or a weapon to fight with magical powers, which in her case are the magical boots).Dorothy of Oz, volume 2: \\"Our level of science is a supernatural phenomenon in your world. We used that fear to control them. But our magic was no match for the wizard. I realized that 10 years ago. / Oz the ruler of our land. People called him wizard, but I thought he was a scientist like me. I was foolish to think I could defeat him! Yes... I was foolish. After we heard his precious Thyrsos was stolen... we leaped on the chance to attack! He... destroyed us. He was a real magician. He had real power. He didn't need weapons. So, I dropped the name 'witch'. I'm just a scientist, that's all.\\" - Selluriah She saved Mara and Toto from a pig bear and was the first to recognize Mara as possibly being ‚ÄúDorothy‚Äù, although she often forgets that Mara hates to be called as such. She is the ruler of Sapphire City, and is in constant turmoil with Sepia, the leader of the Devil Tribe, who wants to take over her region. However, Selluriah is not a true witch, as her power comes from her magical boots and she is virtually helpless without them. Minutes after she gives the boots to Mara, she is killed by an assassin sent by the Witch of the West, who plunged a poisoned blade into her chest. Her last words were for Mara to flee Sapphire City and get to safety. Out of all the witches, she seems to be the only one not completely ruthless, and before being killed, tells her assassin this. Unlike Mara, Selluriah seemed to enjoy the stripping part of the witch's boots power. Selluriah is the only Witch who seemed to have not yet conducted any scientific experiments that involve human specimens (for she produces the Witch's boots, whereas Abee, Namu, and Tail, the products of the Witches of the West, South, and North respectively, were of human origin). = Sergeant Indigo = Indigo is Selluriah's bodyguard and second-in-command of Sapphire City's military. He is cheerful and dedicated, but worries constantly about Selluriah. He, like Selluriah, has a ‚Äúsuper suit‚Äù of sorts, and is known as ‚ÄúSuperhuman Indigo‚Äù in that form. He had an unfortunate habit of unintentionally catching Mara exposed in some way (such as walking in just as the magic boots took effect and seeing her fully naked), but is always very polite about it. Upon failing in his duty to protect Selluriah, he causes an explosion that wipes out both himself and the assassins sent to kill him and his master, his last words being an apology to both Selluriah and Mara. He and Selluriah appear to share a good friendship, and while he treats her respectfully and is very devoted to her, he also isn't afraid to tease her at times. Usually, this ends in her stomping on him. = Sepia = The leader of the Devil Tribe of Oz, and constantly in conflict with Selluriah. His goal is to own Sapphire City and kill Selluriah, but she always defeats him with little to no effort. It is unknown if he will attempt to take over Sapphire City again now that Selluriah is gone, but it is likely. He is very excitable and hates being shown up, which, unfortunately, happens a lot. = The Witch of the West = Not much is known of the Witch of the West yet, except that she, like Selluriah, is a scientist of incredible intelligence and caliber. Her secret weapon is stated as being clones of her second-in-command (also unnamed as yet) that form her military. Abee is one of these clones, but it is unknown if she even knows he has joined Mara or, indeed, even cares. She is ruthless and seemingly cruel, and the one to send the assassins that killed Selluriah. Also, like Selluriah, she is apparently much older than she looks, as Number 50 refers to her as ‚Äúthat old granny‚Äù. It is also implied that, like Selluriah, she is rather touchy about her true age. = The West Witch's Assistant = As yet unnamed; however, he is the one from whom all the clones were made. His personality appears to reflect that of most of his clones, and he is apparently completely subservient to the Witch of the West. Beyond that, nothing else is known. = Number 3 = One of several clones created by the Witch of the West. Number 3 at first seems emotionless and cold, but reveals a cruel side when Abee points out that he basically said he had been looking for an excuse to kill Number 50. With a smile, he admits that he slipped up and proclaims that Abee's accusation was indeed true. He is extremely powerful, able to create force fields (known as ‚Äúgravity spheres‚Äù), use telekinesis on two things at once, and manipulate living things with his powers, a feat which only the highest- ranking numbers can accomplish. He is defeated by Abee in a battle of telekinesis, although this is probably due in part to the fact that he was absolutely shocked that Abee was as strong as he is. He also displays the power to see through solid objects, referenced during his capture of Major Gayle. Number 3 appears to be slightly older than the majority of the other clones, being taller and better filled out, with shoulder-length hair, and a colder, more intelligent demeanor. = Number 4 = One of several clones created by the Witch of the West, he is the one who killed Selluriah and is at least partially responsible for the death of Indigo. Despite being an assassin, he has respect for the people he's sent after, as he tells one of the other clones, ‚ÄúShow some respect, he‚Äôs about to die!‚Äù when said other clone was taunting Indigo for being defeated by them. Presumably, he is killed in the explosion Indigo causes as a last-ditch resort to take the clones down. = Number 50 / Mr. Numb = One of several clones created by the Witch of the West. Number 50 is the leader of a team sent out to recover Abee. He wears a ponytail and, unlike the other clones, is quite rebellious, having a personality unique to himself. He despises Abee and most of the other clones for having his face and insists that people do not group him in with the rest. He claims he is a natural-born leader. When he failed his mission and was captured and tortured by Major Gayle, instead of dying like he should have (according to the West's military protocol), he killed the would-be assassin and turned rogue so far as to help Mara and Abee, but only because he needed their help in return. He seems to be on friendly terms with Mara and Abee after they saved him and even adopts Mara's name for him: \\"Mr. Numb\\", proclaiming it proudly to the other clones when they arrive. However, he is killed almost immediately afterwards by Number Three, who managed to survive Abee's attack. He tells O‚ÄôNeal during that battle that he, too, was once a swordsmanship instructor, and despised the job. Number 50 plays an important part in the series, as it is he who teaches Abee to use his powers, telling him to ‚Äúlift ‚Äòem up...and put ‚Äòem down‚Äù. = Major Gayle = Major Gayle is yet another officer in the Oz Military, and is the head of the Rock Base in the East. He is Selluriah's brother, although which is the older and which is the younger is unknown (it is assumed that Selluriah is the older). He has two rings, one of which can shoot lightning and the other fire, given to him by his sister, and is also a master swordsman. He seems prone to violent anger, as he tortures Number 50 for information about his sister's death. Gayle is forced into being the new leader of the East after Selluriah's death by Number 3, who goes on to tell him that ‚Äúthis territory belongs to the West now‚Äù. = Dick and O‚ÄôNeal = Dick and O‚ÄôNeal are Major Gayle's two best men, and the most skilled fighters in the Rock Base. O‚ÄôNeal tells Number 50 during their fight that he used to be a swordsmanship instructor, and that he hated it because the students were always causing trouble, and that he lost two stripes for it. Dick is quiet and extremely strong, knocking Abee out with a single punch during their fight. After they were defeated, Abee took O‚ÄôNeal's vest, although never states why. They were last seen buried under a pile of rocks, courtesy of Abee. = The Wizard of Oz = Unlike the four Witches, the Wizard is a real magician and does not need magical items like they do to use his powers. Ten years before the story begins, he was attacked by the four Witches when they discovered he had lost Thyrsos. However he defeated Selluriah and the other three Witches alone; this incident would later cause Selluriah to denounce her title of ‚ÄúWitch‚Äù. He was the original owner of Thyrsos, the magic staff, but it somehow wound up in the possession of Mara Shin, who has had it since she was a little girl, a byproduct of her first visit to Oz's strange land. = The Witch of the South = Not much is known about her, except that she has short violet-indigo hair in a bob cut and slightly resembles Mara in appearance. She seems to be in constant conflict with Selluriah as well, as in the second book, one of the soldiers asks Mara, ‚ÄúWho sent you? The Witch of the West? The Witch of the South?‚Äù Also, in the third book, Major Gayle shouts at Number 50, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt you and the South just leave us alone?!‚Äù She is the one who created Namu and Tick Tock, and also Oz's first gun. She apparently has somewhat of a temper, though nowhere near as bad as Selluriah. She seems to not be very concerned with the realization that Namu has defected and joined Mara and Abee. = The South Witch's Assistant = Also currently unnamed. Dressed in a maid's outfit, she at first appears to be a regular servant. However, she has shown to be very intelligent, figuring out right away that Tick Tock's memory had been tampered with and even guessing who might have done it. Nothing else is known about her. = The Witch of the North = Nothing is known yet about her or her personality, except that she has short, spiky dark hair, has a sword thrust through her belt, and her Witch form (or what appears to be it) includes long, sharp claws. She created Tail, and may possibly have been on good terms with Selluriah. Despite this, she was shown to have had a small fight with Selluriah in the second book. She also seems to be the only one of the four Witches who doesn‚Äôt wear a pair of glasses. Thus far, she has only been shown in shadow and silhouette. = Dr. Nedbar = Dr. Nedbar is a former researcher from the South Lab, who stole the Witch of the South's latest project, Oz's first gun, and ran off with it, intending to sell it to the East in exchange for a new job and protection. Tick Tock was sent to track him down, but with Mara, Abee, and Namu's help, he managed to escape. He is apparently a mechanical expert (though nowhere near as good as the Witch of the South), as he was able to completely rewire Tick Tock's memory so that she would not remember finding them, and was also able to implant a self-destruct program into Namu. Dr. Nedbar panics very easily, which tends to get him into more trouble than necessary. For example, upon being found by Tick Tock, he resorts to pointing the gun at Mara, who Tick Tock intended to capture alive. However, all this really accomplished was angering Abee, who took the gun and later threatened to throw him off the cliff for what he had done. However, even though he had initially accepted the loss, he followed Abee and Namu into the caves for the sole purpose of reclaiming the gun. Despite all the trouble he ended up causing, he turned out to be a very valuable ally both to Mara's group and to the Dwarfs, who he made several other androids for in exchange for shelter. The gun remains in his possession, though what he plans to do with it now is not known. = Tick Tock = Bearing the serial number SA-24, Tick Tock is the latest model of android to be created by the Witch of the South. Her first mission was to capture and/or eliminate Dr. Nedbar, although thanks to Mara, Abee, and Namu, failed in this. She is very strong and fast, but also a little clueless, failing to get a few analogies and is of the opinion that ‚Äúbeing a human must suck‚Äù. Like Namu, she is susceptible to electricity, which caused her to lose her memory and designate a young dwarf named Dopey as her master, although Dr. Nedbar later rewired her memory so that she would think she had accomplished her mission, killed Namu and Dr. Nedbar, and destroyed the gun, thus going back to the South Lab to report this false information. Tick Tock is very vulnerable to sonic waves, such as those from a bat's screeches, as they cause her to shut down completely. In the fourth book, she and Namu were stated to be a cute couple, although whether or not they will follow up on this is uncertain. = The Seven Star Dwarfs = They are, obviously, seven dwarfs who live in the mountains near the South's territory and who happen to be friends of Dr. Nedbar. They tend to think of women as things; when bringing Mara and Tick Tock into their home, they set Mara the task of cooking and cleaning for them and attempted to take Tick Tock apart for scrap metal. The youngest and nicest of their number is Dopey, who Tick Tock accidentally designated as her new master upon her reboot. They are very protective of their beer and were thus very enraged with Mara when, to anger them, she drank a good portion of it. They also love gold and jewels with a passion, making it their job to mine for them every day. Even stranger, they have no fear whatsoever for the Witch of the South. Their names are Sneezy, Sleepy, Grumpy, Happy, Bashful, Doc, and Dopey, and are obviously (and somewhat oddly) named for the Seven Dwarfs in Snow White, which is a different fairy tale altogether. = Frog = A little boy who apparently has the power to cause it to rain when he cries. Mara comes across him after losing the Yellow Brick Road, right after fleeing from Sapphire City. Upon talking to him, she finds out that the reason he is crying is because his mother is dead and he misses her. Realizing that everyone needs a chance to cry for the people they love and miss, Mara joins him. She forces him to stop, though, once the rain gets out of hand, and is shocked to discover that when his tears stop, so does the rain. It turns out that Frog was actually a ghost, and had cried to wash the dirt away from the road to help Mara find it again. The last that is seen of him is his gravestone, which is right next to his mother's.

The community has established the Union of Greeks in Georgia and there is a Cultural Centre and a newspaper entitled Greek Diaspora.Hellenic Republic MFA: The Greek community in Georgia  History  =Antiquity and Medieval eras= Greek population 6th century BC The Greek presence in Georgia, specifically in its western part (ancient Colchis), is attested to the 7th century BC, as part of the Old Greek Diaspora and has traditionally been concentrated in the Black Sea coast. According to one version, which nowadays doesn't enjoy much currency, the English name of the country (which is called Sakartvelo in Georgian) is Greek in origin and means agriculture.George Prevelakis, \\"Finis Greciae or the Return of the Greeks? State and Diaspora in the Context of Globalisation\\", p.4, UFR de G√©ographie, Universit√© de Paris-Sorbonne (Paris IV). The Greeks are known as Berdzeni (·Éë·Éî·É†·É´·Éî·Éú·Éò) in Georgian, a unique exonym, deriving from the Georgian word for \\"wise,\\" a name commonly attributed to the notion that philosophy was born in Greece. Medieval Georgians customarily applied this name to the Byzantines. Greek artists, artisans, and Greek Orthodox clergymen were frequently seen in medieval Georgia. There was also a high degree of intermarriages between noble families, and several Georgian aristocratic houses, such as the Andronikashvili, claimed Pontic Greek descent.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 64. =Ottomans= Far more significant in increasing the Greek presence in Georgia was the settlement there of Pontic Greeks and Eastern Anatolia Greeks. Large-scale Pontic Greek settlement in Georgia followed the Ottoman conquest of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461, when Greek refugees from the eastern Black Sea coastal districts, the Pontic Alps, and then Eastern Anatolia fled or migrated to neighbouring Georgia and established the early nucleus of those later defined as Caucasus Greeks. These Pontic Greeks and their descendants who settled in Medieval Georgia often intermarried with their fellow-Eastern Orthodox Georgians and with those local Armenians and Ossetians who were mainly Oriental Orthodox, as well as with later waves of Greek refugees and Russian settlers following the annexation of Georgia by the Russian Empire in 1801. However, it is difficult to verify the numbers of all such waves of Pontic Greeks from the Pontic Alps region to Georgia and the South Caucasus in general between circa 1520 and 1800, which according to Anthony Bryer is the most obscure period in the history of Pontus and the Pontic Greeks, owing to the scarcity of contemporary Greek and Ottoman Turkish sources on the subject.Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), XI., p. 199. Modern historians suggest that following the Ottoman conquest of 1461, many, if not most Pontic Greeks retreated up into the highlands, where it was easier to maintain their culture and freedom from the encroachments of the Ottoman authorities. This movement was reinforced in the early 1600s by the growing power along the coastal valleys districts of the derebeys ('valley lords'), which further encouraged Pontic Greeks to retreat away from the coast deeper into the highlands and up onto the eastern Anatolian plateau, before some moved further east into the neighbouring Lesser Caucasus around Kars and southern Georgia.See also Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), V., p. 142. Modern historians also suggest that a major migratory movement of Pontic Greeks onto the eastern Anatolian plateau and the Lesser Caucasus occurred in the reign of Sultan Mehmed IV (1648‚Äì1687), during which a common pattern was initiated in Ottoman history: the Ottomans and their clients the Crimean Tatars suffered a string of severe defeats at the hands of the expansionist Russian Empire and followed this up with a wave of repression against the Greeks of both the southern Balkans and the Pontic Alps region, on the pretext that Greek statesmen and traders had colluded with the Tsar. As a result, many Pontic Greeks felt pressured into following their cousins who had left Pontus as refugees in previous generations, and so they too decided to migrate to southern Russia or neighbouring Georgia and the South Caucasus.See also Anthony Bryer, 'The Empire of Trebizond and the Pontus' (Variourum, 1980), XI, p. 42. However, the pre-19th century presence of Pontic Greeks in Georgia was complicated by the fact that following the Ottoman conquest of Georgia in 1578 during Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign many Greek Muslims (usually Pontic Greeks from northeastern Anatolia who had \\"turned Turk\\") settled in the country as representatives of Ottoman authority.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 53. These islamized and turkicized Pontic Greeks generally either assimilated into Georgia's Turkish-/Azeri-speaking population (such as those later defined as Meskhetian Turks, many of whom were actually of islamized Georgian origin), emigrated as refugees back into Anatolia following the Russian annexation of Georgia in 1801, or reverted to their Greek Orthodoxy following the annexation and reintegrated into the country's other Christian communities, including those in the South Caucasus region later defined as Caucasus Greeks.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 77.

Photograph by Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin- Gorskii However, the largest number of Pontic Greeks who settled in Georgia according to widely attested documentary evidence did so in the early modern period and first half of the 19th century. In 1763, 800 Greek households from the Ottoman Empire‚Äôs G√ºm√º≈ühane Province were transplanted by King Heraclius II of Georgia to develop silver and lead mining at Akhtala and Alaverdi (now in Armenia).Œ†Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÅŒ≠œÑŒøœÇ (ŒíŒ±Œ∂ŒµŒªŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ), \\"ŒüŒπ ŒàŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒµœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒöŒ±œÖŒ∫Œ¨œÉŒøœÖ\\", ŒïŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒπŒ±œÉœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ±ŒªŒÆŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±, œÑ.34, Œ≠œÑŒøœÇ Œõ'-ŒõŒë', Constantinople (2.10.1910), p.250 Their descendants survive in Georgia‚Äôs Marneuli district. The next major movement into Georgia of Pontic Greeks fleeing Ottoman repression occurred following the Greek War of Independence. Many of these were the Christian, but largely Turcophone Greeks known as Urums, who settled in the latter-day Tsalka district on the territory of the depopulated medieval Georgian province of Trialeti, then part of the Russian Empire. But the largest wave that is widely attested and also traditionally cited by many Greeks in Georgia themselves was that of Pontic Greeks from the regions of Gumushane and Erzurum who had fled with their families to avoid likely Turkish reprisals following the withdrawal of the Russian army many of them had welcomed or collaborated with during its occupation of eastern Anatolia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829.A. M. Anderson, 'The Eastern Question', p. 79. These later waves of Pontic Greek refugees generally settled in villages in southern Georgia, where the main centres Armenian settlement were also concentrated, and assimilated into the preexisting Pontic Greek refugee communities that had already established themselves in the country between the late-15th and late-18th centuries.Sam Topalidis, 'A Pontic Greek History' (2006), p. 76. When these later migrants and refugees settled in Georgia they naturally assimilated through intermarriage with the smaller nucleus of Pontic Greeks settled there in the post-Byzantine and Ottoman period, as well as with the other Christian communities in the country, particularly with their fellow Greek Orthodox Georgians and Russians, and to a lesser extent also with those Ossetians and Armenians who were Oriental Orthodox. But because of the prestige and domineering nature of Byzantine and Christian Greek culture, these Pontic Greek communities tenaciously maintained their Greek culture and identity and their use of the Pontic Greek language, generally disregarding the language and culture of any other non-Hellenic but Christian ethnic groups of Georgia and the South Caucasus they had intermarried with, with the exception of Russian, which the Pontic Greeks of Georgia had had to learn for official and everyday purposes in the Russian Empire period.Mikhailidis, Christos & Athanasiadis, Andreas, p. 32. The Pontic Greek refugees also settled in the former Russian Caucasus province of Kars Oblast following the Russian empire's acquisition of a large area of northeastern Anatolia from the Ottoman Empire in 1878, and also along Georgia‚Äôs Black Sea coastline, where they formed a substantial and active community in the maritime towns. Many of these Caucasus Greeks who settled in the now Russian-controlled province of Kars Oblast had actually come from the communities settled in Georgia rather than directly from their ancestral homes in northeastern Anatolia. They were settled in Kars Oblast as a part of a planned Russian policy to Christianise a hitherto largely Muslim province, from which many Muslims had abandoned their lands following the Russian conquest and resettled in Ottoman territory.Gachechiladze, Revaz G. (1995), The New Georgia: Space, Society, Politics, p. 93. Texas A&M; University Press, . By 1989, the largest Greek communities of Georgia were concentrated in Tsalka, Tbilisi, and Abkhazia, comprising 38.6%, 21.6% and 14.6% of all Georgian Greeks, respectively. Although Georgians and Greeks share many cultural traits, the Greek community of Georgia became more integrated with the Russians in the later centuries of the Russian empire and during the Soviet era. Many of them attended Russian schools, and spoke Russian as their secondary or even primary language, and frequently intermarried with partners of Russian origin. The post-Soviet civil strife and economic crisis forced many Greeks to emigrate abroad permanently, or on seasonal works. As a result, their number dropped to 15.166 (3,792 of them living in Tbilisi) as of the 2002 Georgia census (which does not include the data from a large part of breakaway Abkhazia). Sukhumi once had the Greek names Sevastopolis and Dioskurias, however the Greek population of Abkhazia dates mostly from the Ottoman-Russian wars of the 19th century. They consisted mostly of Pontic Greeks from the southeast corner of the Black sea known as the Pontus near the ancient city of Trebizond. The Soviet authorities referred to them as greki, although in their own Greek dialect they called themselves Romaioi, meaning they were descendants of the Roman empire of Byzantium.Thomas de Waal, The Caucasus, an Introduction Oxford University Press, 2010 =Twentieth century= After World War II, ethnic Greeks of the Abkhaz ASSR were deported from 1949-1950 on the order of Joseph Stalin who referred to them as \\"stateless cosmopolitans\\". They were allowed to return in the late 1950s, however their number never reached pre-deportation level. Most of the Greeks fled Abkhazia (mostly to Greek Macedonia and Southern Russia) during and after the 1992‚Äì1993 war so that their number dropped from 14,664 in 1989 to just 1,486 in 2003.2003 Census statistics Greece carried out a humanitarian operation, Operation Golden Fleece, evacuating 1,015 Greeks who had decided to abandon their homes in Abkhazia on August 15, 1993.Kathimerini, The anniversary of Operation Golden Fleece to evacuate diaspora Greeks from war in Abkhazia, Dionyssis Kalamvrezos Until thirty years ago Greeks made up 70% of the 30,000 strong population of the Georgian city of Tsalka and villages in the surrounding plateau. Many of these were actually Turkish- speaking but Eastern Orthodox Greeks referred to as Urums. Today only about 2,000 of the Tsalka Greeks remain, mostly elderly, as most chose to migrate to Greece, and in particular to Greek Macedonia in Northern Greece. Many Greek Georgians returning to the country for Greek Easter find their homes looted or occupied by squatters, mostly immigrants from other regions of the country, who refuse to allow them entry. Consequently, the number of Greeks returning to Georgia has decreased. Some have claimed that the difficulties they face in reclaiming the homes are part of a deliberate attempt by the Georgian government to uproot the community in favour of ethnic Georgians.EurasiaNet: Georgia's Greeks: Trying to come home Instances of violence, related to the above have sometimes resulted in the death of elderly Greeks while more have been injured. The Georgian government had to twice dispatch a Special Forces unit to prevent further outbreaks of inter-communal violence. In 2005 the Council of Greeks in Georgia has appealed to the World Council of Hellenes, SAE, registering their fear caused by the increasing instances of previously rare ethnic violence against them. The matter was also discussed in the parliament of Greece.HRI: The hardships of the Greeks in Tsalka  See also  * Saberdzneti * Georgian-Greek relations * Pontic Greeks * Caucasus Greeks * Greeks in Armenia * Greeks in Azerbaijan * Pontic Greek (language) * Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholics * Greeks in Russia * Greeks in Ukraine * Greek Diaspora * Urums  References   External links  * ·Éû·Éù·Éú·É¢·Éù·Éî·Éö·Éò ·Éë·Éî·É†·É´·Éú·Éî·Éë·Éò ·Éì·Éê ·Éù·É†·Éó·Éê·Éï·Éò·Éê·Éú·Éò ·Éê·É†·É¨·Éò·Éï·Éò (Pontic Greeks and a Double-Headed Eagle). 24 Hours. 2008-03-13 (an article about a photo exhibition in Tbilisi dedicated to the expatriate Greeks' culture in Georgia) Georgia Category:Ethnic groups in Georgia (country) ","title":"Greeks in Georgia"},{"id":"16761549","text":"Sveti Jo≈°t nad Kranjem (; Leksikon obƒçin kraljestev in de≈æel zastopanih v dr≈æavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906.

Church St. Judoc's Church was first mentioned in documents relating to the bequest of land by Emperor Otto II to the Bishops of Freising in 973. The earliest surviving part of the church is the gothic sanctuary in which frescos by Jernej of Loka dated to 1530 are preserved. The remainder of the church dates to the 18th century, when it was rebuilt in the Baroque style. The surrounding buildings were greatly damaged in the Second World War.

He competed in the Motocross World Championships from 1971 to 1982. As a member of the CZ factory racing team, Falta was one of the top motocross racers of the early 1970s in the F.I.M. 250cc Motocross World Championship. __TOC__ Motorcycle racing career Falta very nearly claimed the 1974 250cc world championship, however it was Soviet rider, Guennady Moisseev, who would ultimately secure the crown in a controversy-filled final race of the season. The 1974 250cc world championship was a season-long battle between KTM's Moisseev and CZ's Falta. Moisseev won the first race of the season and took the overall victory at the season opening Spanish Grand Prix. Falta won both races at the Italian Grand Prix followed with a win in the first moto of his home Grand Prix in Czechoslovakia but, then suffered two breakdowns in Poland while Moisseev won both races. Falta won a moto in Yugoslavia and at the halfway point of the season, he trailed the Russian rider by 20 points. Each rider took a second place at the West German Grand Prix but, Falta won a moto at the Dutch Grand Prix to close the points gap to 5 points going into the final race of the season in Switzerland. At the final event of the 1974 season, Falta took the lead in the first moto and appeared to be heading for victory while Moisseev was struggling with rear suspension failure. When Falta came upon the slowing Russian rider and tried to pass him, the KTM rider made an attempt to obstruct him allowing second and third place riders, Harry Everts and H√•kan Andersson to catch up. At one point Falta attempted to pass Moisseev, but the Russian rider collided with him causing him to fall off his bike. Falta was quickly able to remount but, finished the race in third place, losing some more points to Moisseev. Falta now had to win the final moto to have any chance to claim the world championship. As the race began, Falta once again jumped into the lead. Moisseev was forced to retire on the seventh lap with mechanical problems. A win looked certain, but Falta came upon two Russian riders, Victor Popenko and Eugeny Rybaltchenko, and both appeared to attempt to block Falta's passing attempts. Falta continued to pressure the two riders, and during another passing attempt, Rybaltchenko rode into him, knocking the Czech rider down. Falta remounted in third place, and race officials waved the black flag at the two Russian riders, disqualifying them from the race. Falta was able to catch up and pass Everts and Gaston Rahier to recapture the lead and win the race. This apparently clinched the world championship for Falta. However, two hours after the conclusion of the race, the FIM received a protest from the Russian team, alleging Falta had jumped the start. FIM jury officials ultimately sided with the Russian team and instituted a one-minute penalty on Falta. The penalty dropped him to eighth place, handing the world championship to Moisseev and relegating Fanta to second place in the final standings. Although Falta failed to win the world championship, he showed impressive ability when he defeated three-time 500cc world champion Roger De Coster to win the 1974 Super Bowl of Motocross at the Los Angeles Coliseum. Falta is noted for is loyalty to the Czech bikes he raced, and helped illustrate to the world that the CZ marquee were winning machines by scoring four Grand Prix victories against the world's best riders, such as Harry Everts, Joel Robert, Guennady Moiseev, Hakan Andersson and Gaston Rahier. Additionally, in 1974, Falta traveled to the United States, and raced selected Inter-AMA events with his teammate Zdenek Velky, and their trainer Hrebecek. To the surprise of many in attendance, Falta would clinch a victory in Los Angeles Coliseum in front of approximately 65,000 motocross fans. Jaroslav Falta is somewhat of a motocross hero, and proved inspirational to many riders and a model to follow for many of fans. Michel Turk, President of Motor-Union Luxembourg, admitted: ‚ÄúWith his win in Los Angeles, Jaroslav Falta gave me the \\"last kick\\" to decide that I wanted to be an motocross racer in 1975. I want to thank Jaroslav for the wonderful time he has given me. I admire him very much and I want to thank Jaroslav for being my hero for many years as a young boy, and I hope to meet him somewhere in a near future.‚Äù Falta is from a tiny village in the Czech Republic, but he represents a big name for its country due to his accomplishments on his Czech machine. On some occasions, Falta has admitted that his worldwide tour was also seen as a great advertisement campaign for the CZ brand and his country itself. In fact, he has even mentioned that sometimes he feels that foreign fans know him better than the Czech‚Äôs. Several publications in Czech Republic narrate Falta‚Äôs career, including the book ‚ÄúUkraden√Ω titul‚Äù written by Ivo Helikar, sport editor of CMN and the son of one of Falta‚Äôs trainers, Frantisek Helikar. There are also English versions, thanks to the translation of Martina Faltova, Jaroslav‚Äôs daughter. Currently, Falta lives in a small village outside Prague. He continues to be in touch with motocross, restoring old bikes and occasionally visiting motocross races. He has been a visitor at past Grand Prixs held in Loket in the Czech Republic.

Director of the Cairo botanical garden, he wrote the botanical sections of Travel in Lower and Upper Egypt by Dominique Vivant. He made a cast of the Rosetta Stone which allowed the reproduction of its Greek and Demotic inscriptions in his Description de l'√âgypte. =United States= In 1802, Delile was appointed French vice consul at Wilmington, North Carolina, and also asked to form an herbarium of all American plants that could be naturalized in France. He sent to Paris several cases of seeds and grains, and discovered some new graminea and presented them to Palisot de Beauvois, who described them in his Agrostographie. Raffeneau made extensive explorations through the neighboring states, and, resigning in 1805, began the study of medicine in New York. During an epidemic of scarlet fever he was active in visiting the tenements of the poor, and in 1807 he obtained the degree of M.D. =Return to France= He returned to France, and graduated as doctor in medicine from the University of Paris in 1809. In 1819, he was appointed professor of natural history at the University of Montpellier, Originally published as a post he retained until his death. In 1832, he was named director of the botanical garden in Montpellier. He reports planting two Maclura saplings which can still be found there, and he added many species to its herbarium.

While numerous U.S. states have shield laws, the federal government has no such law. The bill is an effort to enact a shield law at the federal level. The bill was introduced to the United States Senate by Sens. Richard Lugar and Chris Dodd in 2007. It was proposed in its current form by Sen. Arlen Specter. In October 2007, the Free Flow of Information Act was passed by the United States House of Representatives. However, it was filibustered (failed cloture) on Jul 30, 2008, and withdrawn. In the 2007-08 Senate version, it would not act as an unqualified immunity for journalists. Instead, federal judges would be allowed to declare certain news stories as having a public interest based on information obtained from confidential sources during the newsgathering process. More than 50 media companies and organizations support the bill. The administration of President George W. Bush opposed it. Speaking to the Associated Press annual meeting in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 2008, Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee for president, said \\"Despite concerns I have about the legislation, I have narrowly decided to support it.\\" There are fears, however, that the act may be adopted in such a way as to exclude people who are not \\"professional\\" journalists, which would in turn serve to effectively shut down investigative reporting by small and independent media sources.A new media shield law would only shield corporate media, Vice, 22 Aug 2013. Retrieved 23 Aug 2013. In July 2013 the White House was pushing for a federal media shield law, the Free Flow of Information Act, authored by U.S. Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham. Under the bill, the scope of protection for reporters would vary according to whether it was a civil case, an ordinary criminal case or a national security case. The greatest protection would be given to civil cases, in which litigants seeking to force reporters to testify or trying to obtain their calling information would be required to show why their need for the information outweighed the public's interest in unfettered news gathering. Ordinary criminal cases would work in a similar fashion, except the burden would be on the reporter seeking to quash the subpoena to show by a \\"clear and convincing\\" standard that the public interest in the free flow of information should prevail over the needs of law enforcement. Cases involving the disclosure of classified information would be more heavily tilted toward the government. Judges could not quash a subpoena through a balancing test if prosecutors presented facts showing that the information sought might help prevent a terrorist attack or other acts likely to harm national security. The legislation would create a presumption that when the government is seeking calling records from a telephone carrier, the news organization would be notified ahead of time, allowing it to fight the subpoena in court. But the bill would also allow the government to seek a 45- to 90-day delay in notification if a court determines that such notice would threaten the integrity of the investigation. The legislation would also include an exception where journalists could be subpoenaed if it means national security is at risk. \\"Now, it's important to remember: virtually the only time the government subpoenas reporters, it involves leak investigations into stories by national security reporters. So it's hard to see how this bill will significantly help improve press freedom,\\" wrote Trevor Timm, an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a board member of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. \\"Worse, there's a strong argument that passing the bill [...] will weaken rights reporters already have and make it easier for the government to get sources from reporters.\\" References External links *Journalists‚Äô Privilege: Overview of the Law and Legislation in Recent Congresses, Congressional Research Service, January 19, 2011 *Legislative History: Free Flow of Information Act of 2009 (with links to key documents) Category:Freedom of information in the United States Category:American journalism Category:Source (journalism) ","title":"Free Flow of Information Act"},{"id":"16761743","text":"Bianco is a Northern Germanic surname meaning \\"white\\". It is of pre 5th century Frankish origins from North Germany. It derives from the word 'blanc', and the original meaning was 'bright or shining', although this seems to have gradually been changed to mean fair or 'white,' in France and Italy. As such it was given as a sarcastic nickname to the fair haired Viking invaders from Scandinavia, who swept down through Germany, and into France in the 8th and 9th centuries, until stopped by the sea, at what is now 'Normandy', or the country of the Northmen. The earliest recordings as a surname were in the English records known as the Hundred Rolls of landowners for the counties of Huntingdonshire, Leicester and Cambridgeshire where the name is recorded as Blanke, Blaunche and Blanche, and sometimes with the prefix 'le'. Early examples of surname recordings include William le Blanc, given as being a count of France in 1334, with the coat of arms of a red field, a chief silver, and overall a gold lion rampant, whilst in Italy the arms of Bianco granted in 1477, have the blazon of a red field charged with three silver fleur de lys, suggesting victory over the French. The first recorded spelling of the family name anywhere in the word is believed to be that of Nigellus le Blanke. This was dated 1196, in the Pipe Rolls of Leicestershire, during the reign of King Richard 1st, known as 'The Lionheart', 1189 - 1199. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was sometimes known as the Poll Tax.

He was elevated to the Bench in 1948. After the separation of Andhra, Rajaji wanted to send Govinda Menon, a senior judge to head the Andhra Pradesh High Court to be established in Guntur in 1954. But Prakasam insisted on having Subbarao as the Special Officer to facilitate the formation of High Court. Automatically he became the Chief Justice. When Sri Venkateswara University was established at Tirupati in 1954, Subbarao became its first Chancellor and remained in the position till the University Act was amended restoring the Chancellorship to the Governor. After tenures as a judge at Madras High Court and a Chief Justice at Andhra Pradesh High Court, he was appointed as a Supreme Court judge on 31 January 1958. He was appointed as Chief Justice of India on 30 June 1966. His most famous judgment was for the landmark Golaknath v. State of Punjab case where he ruled that Fundamental Rights could not be amended. Subba Rao retired on 11 April 1967 to contest in the fourth presidential elections as the consensus candidate of opposition parties.Supreme Court of India: Biography of K. Subba Rao Golaknath Case The Judgment of SUBBA RAO, C.J., SHAH, SIKRI, SHELAT and VAIDIALINGAM, JJ. was delivered by SUBBA RAO, C.I. According to this Judgment-(i) the power to amend the Constitution is not to be found in Art. 368 but in Arts. 245, 246 and 248 read with Entry 97 of List 1; (ii) the amending power can not be used to abridge or take away the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution; (iii) a law amending the Constitution is \\"Law\\" within the meaning of Art. 13(2) and (iv). the First, Fourth and Seventeenth Amendments though they abridged fundamental rights were valid in the past on the basis of earlier decisions of this Court and continue to be valid for the future. On the application of the doctrine of \\"prospective overruling\\", as enunciated in the judgment, the decision will have only prospective operation and Parliament will have no power to abridge or take away Fundamental Rights from the date of the judgment. The Judgment of WANCHOO, BHARGAVA and MITTER, JJ. was delivered by WANCHOO, J. According to this Judgment (i) the power of amending the Constitution resides in Art. 368 and not in Arts. 245, 246 and 248, read with EntrY 97 of List 1; (ii) there, are no restrictions on the power if the procedure in Art. 368 is followed and all the Parts of the Constitution including Part III can be amended, (iii) an amendment of the Constitution is not \\"'law\\" under Art. 13(2); and (iv) the doctrine of \\"prospective overruling\\" cannot be applied in India. HIDAYATULLAH, J. delivered a separate judgment agreeing with SUBBA RAO, CJ. on the following two points: (i) that the power to amend the Constitution cannot be used to abridge or take away fundamental rights; and (ii) that a law amending the Constitution is \\"law\\" under Art. 13 (2). He agrees With WANCHOO, J. that the power to amend does not reside in Arts. 245 and 248 read wish Entry 97 of List 1. Art. 368, according to him, is sui generis and procedural and the procedure when correctly followed, results in an amendment. He does not rely on the doctrine of \\"prospective overruling\\". As regards the First, Fourth and Seventh Amendments, these having long endured and been acquiesced in, he does not treat the question of their validity as being before him. As regards the Seventeenth Amendment he finds sufficient support for it in the Constitution as amended by the First, Fourth and Seventh Amendments and holds that the new definition of \\"estate\\", introduced by the Amendment, though it is \\"law\\" under Art. 13 (2) and is an inroad into fundamental rights, is beyond the reach of the courts because it falls within the word \\"law\\" in Arts. 31 (1), (2), 2A and 31A(1). He, however, declares section 3 of the Seventeenth Amendment Act ultra vires the amending process as an illegitimate exercise of the amending power. [BACHAWAT and RAMASWAMI, JJ. delivered separate judgments concurring with WANCHOO, J.] Political life He has contested for the President of India in 1967 as a candidate of united opposition parties.

Mainly self-educated, he turned to politics in his early thirties. As a member of the Volksraad he developed his skills as a diplomat and mediator, and was involved in many of the important political decisions the Orange Free State had to make in the 1880s and 1890s. In 1896 he was appointed president of the Volksraad. During the South African War (1899‚Äì1902), Wessels was first a member of the war cabinet, and later a member of the Joint Diplomatic Delegation of the Boer Republics sent to Europe and the United States to muster support for the Boer cause. After the war Wessels sided with De Wet and Hertzog and became a cabinet minister in the Free State government. In 1915, the colonial government appointed Wessels as administrator of the Orange Free State. He was awarded a knighthood for his services to the state in 1920. Family Wessels was the youngest son of three boys and two girls born to Johannes Jacobus Wessels and Hester Sophia Antonetta (n√©e) Wessels.Moll, 'Wessels, Sir Cornelius Hermanus', 857-left Wessels married twice. His first wife was Christina Magdalena (n√©e) Wessels (d. 5 November 1905), with whom he had five sons and three daughters. He remarried in 1907 with Eliza Alice Bosman n√©e Keytler (d. 6 March 1941), a widow.Moll, 'Wessels, Sir Cornelius Hermanus', 858-right Life and career Wessels grew up in the Boshof District in the Orange Free State, where his parents moved when he was five years old. Here he received some private tuition, before - still at a young age - becoming a full-time and successful farmer. In 1892, he bought the farm Kwagafontein just outside Bloemfontein. Wessels life was marked by two activities: farming and politics, and in both he was mainly self-educated. In 1885, at age thirty-four, Wessels was elected to the Volksraad (the Free State parliament) for the Modderrivier area of Boshof. He was to represent this constituency for fourteen years, until the outbreak of the South African War in 1899. Wessels was a natural leader, and this was the main reason for his continued election to office. However, being a member of the influential and large Wessels clan helped.Moll, 'Wessels, Sir Cornelius Hermanus', 857-right Wessels' political influence showed itself in him being appointed to several important positions regarding the discussions between the Orange Free State and the South African Republic about closer co- operation between the two Boer states. From 1897, he represented the Orange Free State in the Council of Representatives that monitored the co-operation. In the 1880s, Wessels was also a leading figure in the discussions about the extension of the railway network of the Orange Free State and the direct connections with the Cape Colony and the South African Republic. The same holds true for the efforts to forge a South African customs union in the 1890s. Wessels was a very practical man and was qualified by the British as the 'business brain' in the Orange Free State government. For several years, he was a director of the National Bank of the Orange Free State. Special Diplomatic Delegation of the Boer Republics to Europe and America, 1900, l.t.r. front: A.D.W. Wolmarans, A. Fischer, C.H. Wessels, and back: Dr. W.J. Leyds and Dr. H.P.N. Muller Wessels' political acumen brought him high office, from 1894-96 as representative of the Volksraad in the Executive Council, and eventually as vice-president (1896‚Äì1897) and president (1897‚Äì1899) of the Volksraad. In this position, Wessels' diplomatic skills and strict impartiality acquired him great respect. During the South African War, Wessels was recruited by President Steyn as a member of his war cabinet, the 'Krijgscommissie' (War Commission). When the war progressed and the Boer republics were looking for support from European states and the United States, the governments of the Boer republics appointed a special diplomatic delegation. It consisted of A. Fischer as chairman and for the Orange Free State, A.D.W. Wolmarans and Wessels as members for the South African Republic and the Orange Free State respectively. In Europe, the deputation met up with W.J. Leyds, ambassador for the South African Republic in Brussels and H.P.N. Muller, consul general and special envoy of the Orange Free State in The Netherlands. The encounter with Muller was a renewal of friendly relations between the two men, who first met in Bloemfontein in 1898, and again in May 1899 in The Hague, when Wessels brought a private visit to the Netherlands.Spies, 'n Nederlander in diens van die Oranje Vrystaat, 82, 99, passim. The delegation's mission to Europe failed, and was caught out by history in the United States. After the conclusion of the Treaty of Vereeniging Wessels and the other member of the delegation returned to South Africa. After his return to the Orange River Colony, he refused to take part in the British colonial administration, but he did use his diplomatic skills to promote mutual understanding between the Afrikaner citizens and the British government. With the return of responsible government, Wessels re-entered the political arena. Together with J.B.M Hertzog, C.R. de Wet and A. Fischer he founded a new political party, the Orangia Unie and he became the director of the party newspaper The Friend. The elections of June 1907 brought the Orangia Unie a landslide election victory. Wessels was elected to the Assembly for the Bloemfontein-South constituency, and took up the appointment of Minister for Mines, Lands, and Public Works in the new government, led by A. Fischer.Moll, 'Wessels, Sir Cornelius Hermanus', 858-left Afrikaner politics were complicated in the new colonial province, and Wessels fell out with Hertzog about agricultural affairs, the appointment of English-speaking officials in his department, and because of temperamental differences. After the formation of the Union of South Africa, Wessels aligned himself with the South African Party of Louis Botha. During and after the Rebellion of 1914, Wessels stayed true to his political convictions and reconciliatory attitude towards the British. He did not shift his allegiance to the National Party like most of his Free State colleagues, and this cost him the parliamentary election of 1914. In June 1915, the British government appointed Wessels administrator of the Orange Free State, seeing him as a loyal ally. The job was not an easy one and asked all of Wessels' diplomatic skills. As a British appointee and a member of the South African Party, he initially ran into considerable opposition and enmity from both the Executive Committee and the Provincial Council, of which most of the members supported the National Party. Nevertheless, Wessels succeeded in making his administration a success, and in 1919, the Union government proposed him for a knighthood, which he received in the 1920 New Year Honours.\\"Colonial Office List\\", The Times, 1 January 1920 In November 1923, aged 72, Wessels suffered a stroke, and although he recovered almost fully, a second stroke hit him on 15 February 1924, and he died as a result two weeks later. Legacy Financially Wessels was independent, due to his fortuitous farming activities. In character he was modest, courteous to others, interested in people, and a good story-teller. Altogether these traits accounted for his natural aptitude for diplomacy and his long and successful political career, although it did not make him a visionary statesman.

It is the only non-profit organization concerned globally with the subject of sports facility development and has therefore been awarded the status of Recognized Organization by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IAKS has about 1,000 members in a current 110 countries with seven sections worldwide. These are Germany, Japan, Latin America/Caribbean, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and Spain (status 2016). Activities The IAKS cooperates not only with the IOC, but also with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), SportAccord, the International Council for Sports Science and Physical Education (ICSSPE) and the International Union of Architects (UIA), Sports and Leisure Programme. It also cultivates contacts with international sports federations and National Olympic Committees and has been included by the United Nations in its list of consultative NGOs of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The task of the IAKS is to create a platform for the design, construction, equipping, modernization, funding and management of sports and leisure facilities as well as to participate in the establishment of standards and guidelines in Germany and Europe. The IAKS also publishes the magazine \\"sb\\", organizes conferences and exhibitions, and sponsors an international architecture prize for exemplary sports and leisure facilities, the IOC/IAKS Award, as well as the IPC/IAKS Award. The members and partners of the IAKS are architects, engineers, enterprises and industrial associations, sports organizations, ministries of sport, education and construction, local government, and universities and other educational establishments. One particular purpose of the IAKS is to encourage sport on a broad scale by gathering, evaluating, passing on and, if necessary, coordinating the experience, principles and research findings obtained from the design, construction, equipping and operation of sports and leisure facilities of all kinds. In doing so, it takes account of social factors in the widest sense, e.g. architecture, technology, sports science, economics and ecology. It also supports progress in this field with research and consultations. Congresses The IAKS has been holding the international IAKS Congress for the design, construction, modernization and management of sports and leisure facilities every two years since 1969. This Congress takes place in conjunction with the International Trade Fair for Amenity Areas, Sports and Pool Facilities (FSB) in Cologne, where global infrastructural trends, structural issues and practices are presented and discussed. The IAKS Congress enjoys the patronage of the IOC, IPC, GAISF and Germany's Federal Ministry of the Interior. Today the trade fair is called the International Trade Fair of Amenity Areas, Sports and Pool Facilities (FSB) and the IAKS Congress has developed into a permanent fixture. The 25th IAKS Congress for the Design, Construction, Modernization and Management of Sports and Leisure Facilities is taking place in Cologne/Germany from 7 to 10 November 2016. The IAKS Congress will be concerned with the latest experience, technologies, trends and prospects in sports and leisure infrastructure.

The Award has been conferred upon exemplary well designed and also functionally outstanding sports facilities every two years since 1987. The winning facilities can be newly erected or extended or modernized existing buildings. The sponsors of the competition are the IOC and the IAKS. Together with the IPC, the IAKS also awards the IPC/IAKS Award for sports facilities suitable for the disabled. The IPC/IAKS Award aims to promote the accessibility of sports facilities and all other buildings so that people with disabilities have the chance to practice or follow sport without restriction and without barriers. The IOC, the IPC and the IAKS have also started the Architecture and Design Award for Students and Young Professionals on innovative designs and concepts for sports, leisure and recreational facilities. This Award aims at young architects and designers currently studying architecture, landscape architecture, interior design and general design, and at young professionals in their first 2 years of professional practice. All participants must be under the age of 30 years. Publications The IAKS has been publishing the international magazine \\"sb\\" since 1967. It appears every two months and reports on current industry trends in international sports and leisure facility development. In addition, the IAKS has issued planning principles for the construction of different types of sports and leisure facilities. sb is also concerned with the infrastructure of major sports events like the Olympic Games, world championships and European championships. Along with conventional sport facilities, sb also deals with special themes. Thus it is an important source of information for planners and practitioners from all areas of sports facility construction (municipalities, architects and engineers, universities, trade associations and industrial companies). sb appears in two languages: English and German. The magazine is read mainly in Germany and the rest of Europe as well as in North, Central and South America, Africa and Australia.

It is awarded each year by the Pre≈°eren Fund () to two eminent Slovene artists, with the provision that their work was presented to the public at least two years ago. In general, it may be given to an artist only once, and can also be given to a group of artists. It is given on the eve of the Pre≈°eren Day, the Slovenian cultural holiday celebrated on the anniversary of the death of France Pre≈°eren, the Slovene national poet. On the same occasion, the Pre≈°eren Fund Awards () or Small Pre≈°eren Awards () are given to up to six artists. The awardees also receive a financial award, with the Pre≈°eren Award three times as high as the Pre≈°eren Fund Award. In recent years, the awards have been increasingly given for lifetime work. History The Pre≈°eren Award was for the first time bestowed in 1947, on the basis of a decree from 1946. It was originally given on 8 February, Pre≈°eren Day, the holiday commemorating the anniversary of the death of the Slovene national poet France Pre≈°eren. In 1955, the first act on the Pre≈°eren awards was passed.

Since 1961, the awards were conferred also for the lifetime work. In addition, the Pre≈°eren Fund Award was introduced. Since that year, these awards have been conferred only for exceptional achievements in the field of arts. In 1982, the Pre≈°eren Fund came under the auspice of the Cultural Community of Slovenia. At most three Pre≈°eren Awards and ten Pre≈°eren Fund Awards were given. Since 1991, when the Pre≈°eren Award Act () was passed, the Fund works under the auspice of the Slovenian administrative body in charge of culture.

The board, which was last elected in May 2008, elected Jaroslav Skru≈°ny as its chair in July 2008. The Pre≈°eren Fund now operates under the auspice of the Slovenian Ministry of Culture. In an interview in February 2012, Skru≈°ny described the work by the Board as independent and denied any political pressure in the past few years. Selection and proclamation of the winners On 10 February, the Pre≈°eren Fund announces a public tender, which lasts until 15 September. Any physical or legal person may nominate authors for the award, but have to provide appropriate rationale and references. About 100 proposals are put forward each year, the majority of proposals from the performing arts. The selection is based on artistic value of the works by the proposed artists as well as other criteria, such as the equal representation of gender, regions, generations, and world views, trying to achieve a balanced and plural choice. Both the established artists and debitants have won the award. The nominees are then selected by the four field committees of the Pre≈°eren Fund, each comprising seven members named by the Pre≈°eren Fund Management Board. Each committee proposes two names for the Pre≈°eren Award and six names for the Pre≈°eren Fund Award, altogether eight for the great award and 24 for the little award. The board then makes the final selection with a secret vote in November after a long discussion and proclaims the awardees after they are elected by two thirds of members. If necessary, more voting rounds may take place. Although in the past, the names of the awardees were announced already on 3 December, the date of the anniversary of Pre≈°eren's births, in the last years they have remained secret until the award ceremony. Review of the awardees Since Slovenian declaration of independence in 1991, the majority of the Pre≈°eren Award winners have been literary artists, among them the only woman being Makaroviƒç, who declined the award in 2000 but accepted the money. From the field of performing arts, only two artists won the award. From the field of music, the awardees have been mainly composers and conductors, with the only instrumentalist being the flautist Irena Grafenauer. A general trend of older men active in institutionalised arts is recognisable among the awardees. The group of the Pre≈°eren Fund Award winners is more diverse.

He was a Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society from 1893. Kirkaldy, born in Clapham, in Greater London to W. H. Kirkaldy of Wimbledon was educated in England. Even at school in London he showed an interest in natural history and was appointed curator of the school museum. As a young boy he joined a debating club and spoke on the colouration of insects. He later went to Hawaii in 1903 to work for the United States Department of Agriculture then for the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association Experimental Station. While in Honolulu he had a riding accident which resulted in his fracturing his leg at five places. This injury never healed and his death in 1910 at San Francisco, California followed five days after the last of several surgery attempts to fix it. Kirkaldy was the author of the 1906 Leafhoppers and their Natural Enemies. Pt IX. Leafhoppers - Hemiptera (Bulletin of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association Division of Entomology 1(9): 271-479), and the 1909 Catalogue of the Hemiptera (Heteroptera) with biological and anatomical references, lists of foodplants and parasites (Berlin) and very many taxonomic papers describing new species and genera. Amongst his generic names for insects are Ohchisme, Dolichisme, Elachisme, Florichisme, Isachisme, Marichisme, Nanichisme, Peggichisme, and Polychisme. The Greek suffix \\"-chisme\\" is pronounced \\"kiss-me\\" and Kirkaldy prefaced it with the names of the various women from alleged romantic conquests. In 1912 a letter to the International Entomological Congress from Lord Walsingham sought to make these names invalid on the basis of their being non-classical in their derivation. Kirkaldy himself had been a firm adherent to the principle of priority and was against any form of orthographic emendation to the spelling proposed by the original authors. His collections of Auchenorrhyncha and Heteroptera are in the Natural History Museum, London, the University of Kansas (Snow Collection),Entomology at the University of Kansas at www.nhm.ku.edu the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, Honolulu and the National Museum of Natural History in Washington. References *Anonym 1910: [Kirkaldy, G. W.] Entomologist's Monthly Magazine (2) 46 95-96 *Bueno, J.

It is a useful approach for designing information architecture, workflows, menu structure, or web site navigation paths. Card sorting uses a relatively low-tech approach. The person conducting the test (usability analyst, user experience designer, etc.) first identifies key concepts and writes them on index cards or Post-it notes. Test subjects, individually or sometimes as a group, then arrange the cards to represent how they see the structure and relationships of the information. Groups can be organized as collaborative groups (focus groups) or as repeated individual sorts. The literature discusses appropriate numbers of users needed to produce trustworthy results. A card sort is commonly undertaken when designing a navigation structure for an environment that offers a variety of content and functions, such as a web site. In that context, the items to organize are those significant in the environment. The way the items are organized should make sense to the target audience and cannot be determined from first principles. The field of information architecture is founded on the study of the structure of information. If an accepted and standardized taxonomy exists for a subject, it would be natural to apply that taxonomy to organize both the information in the environment, and any navigation to particular subjects or functions. Card sorting is useful when: * The variety of items to organize is so great that no existing taxonomy is accepted as organizing the items. * Similarities among the items make them difficult to divide clearly into categories. * Members of the audience that uses the environment differ significantly in how they view the similarities among items and the appropriate groupings of items. Basic method To perform a card sort: # A person representative of the audience receives a set of index cards with terms written on them. # This person groups the terms in whatever way they think is logical, and gives each group a category name, either from an existing card or by writing a name on a blank card. # Testers repeat this process across a group of test subjects. # The testers later analyze the results to discover patterns. Variants =Open card sorting= In an open card sort, participants create their own names for the categories. This helps reveal not only how they mentally classify the cards, but also what terms they use for the categories. Open sorting is generative; it is typically used to discover patterns in how participants classify, which in turn helps generate ideas for organizing information. =Closed card sorting= In a closed card sort, participants are provided with a predetermined set of category names. They then assign the index cards to these fixed categories. This helps reveal the degree to which the participants agree on which cards belong under each category. Closed sorting is evaluative; it is typically used to judge whether a given set of category names provides an effective way to organize a given collection of content. =Reverse card sorting= In a reverse card sort (more popularly called tree testing), an existing structure of categories and sub- categories is tested. Users are given tasks and are asked to complete them navigating a collection of cards. Each card contains the names of subcategories related to a category, and the user should find the card most relevant to the given task starting from the main card with the top-level categories. This ensures that the structure is evaluated in isolation, nullifying the effects of navigational aids, visual design, and other factors. Reverse card sorting is evaluative‚Äîit judges whether a predetermined hierarchy provides a good way to find information. =Modified-Delphi card sorting= Created by Celeste Paul, The Modified-Delphi card sort is based on the Delphi method. Rather than each participant creating their own card sort, only the first participant does a full card sort of organizing and arranging items. The next participant iterates on the first participant's model, then the third participant iterates on the second's model, and so on. The idea is that with each iteration the card sort gets more refined with fewer participants and consensus is built sooner. Analysis Various methods can be used to analyze the data. The purpose of the analysis is to extract patterns from the population of test subjects, so that a common set of categories and relationships emerges. This common set is then incorporated into the design of the environment, either for navigation or for other purposes. Card sorting is also evaluated through dendrograms. There is some indication that different evaluation methods for card sorting provide different results. Card sorting is an established technique with an emerging literature. Online (remote) card sorting A number of web-based tools are available to perform card sorting. The perceived advantage of web-based card sorting is that it reaches a larger group of participants at a lower cost. The software can also help analyze the sort results. A perceived disadvantage of a remote card sort is the lack of personal interaction between card sort participants and the card sort administrator, which may produce valuable insights.

At least fifteen Roman marble copies of this sculpture are known. Many of these marble copies have complex artistic and social histories that illustrate the degree to which improvisatory \\"restorations\\" were made to fragments of ancient Roman sculpture during the 16th and 17th centuries, in which contemporary Italian sculptors made original and often arbitrary and destructive additions in an effort to replace lost fragments of the ancient sculptures.The sculpture is one of three versions of the \\"Pasquino\\" discussed by Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500‚Äì1900 (Yale University Press) 1981: 291‚Äì96, cat. no 72. \\"Pasquino\\"; Giovanna Giusti Galardi, The Statues of the Loggia Della Signoria in Florence: Masterpieces Restored 2002:45‚Äì51. One of the most famous versions of the composition, though so dismembered and battered that the relationship is scarcely recognizable at first glance,It was remarked upon as a matter of fact by Flaminio Vacca, Memorie... 1594, quoted in note 4, below; the identification as Menelaus with the dying Patroclus was made by Francesco Cancellieri, Notizie delle due famose statue di un fiume et di Patroclo dette volgarmente di Marforio et di Pasquino (Rome 1789), noted in Haskell and Penny 1981:291 note 2 is the so-called Pasquin, one of the talking statues of Rome. It was set up on a pedestal in 1501 and remains unrestored. A version of the group, probably intended to represent other Homeric figures, is part of the Sperlonga sculptures found in 1957.  Subject  Ancient Roman copies of the original Greek sculptural group were first documented in Rome ca. 1500. During the 16th century, various authors proposed different identifications for the dead figure, including Hercules, Geryon, and Alexander the Great. Bernhard Schweitzer's 1936 Das Original der sogennanten Pasquino-Gruppe identifies the subject of the group as Menelaus carrying the body of Patroclus; however, this identification has been questioned and the subject of Ajax carrying the body of Achilles is now widely accepted for most of the Roman copies. In the case of the very fragmentary group from Sperlonga, most scholars agree it is here intended to show Odysseus carrying the body of the dead Achilles off the battlefield outside Troy (or possibly Ajax doing the carrying), as the other sculptures in the ensemble show scenes from the story of Odysseus.Following Andreae, with Hampe and Herrmann unconvinced, Herrmann, 276. See also Blanckenhagen, 102; Weiss, 117‚Äì124 identifies the pair as Aeneas and Lausus. This is an unusual subject, not in Homer, but one that is mentioned by Ovid (Metamorposes, 13, 282 ff) and fits the rest of the programme.Blanckenhagen, 102 Here Odysseus is shown at his most conventionally virtuous, demonstrating pietas.  The Loggia dei Lanzi group  The Pasquino fragment still shows the warrior's eroded hand on the limp torso Cosimo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany purchased an ancient marble fragment depicting the headless torso of a man in armor supporting a heroically nude dying comrade soon after it was discovered in the vigna of Antonio Velli, half a Roman mile beyond Porta Portese, Rome.\\"97. Mi ricordo che fuori della detta porta Portese mezzo miglio, dov'√® la vigna di Antonio Velli, vi fu trovato un Pasquino sopra un piedistallo di tufa, con un Gladiatore, che gli muore in braccio; il detto Pasquino era mancante fino alla cintura, ma il Gladiatore sano : e quando venne il Duca Cosmo ad incoronarsi in Roma Gran Duca, lo compr√≤, per scudi cinquecento, e lo condusse a Fiorenza accompagnatolo con l'altro, che ebbe da Paolo Soderino, trovato nel Mausoleo di Augusto.\\" Flaminio Vacca, Memorie... 1594; see also Rodolfo Amedeo Lanciani, The Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome: A Companion Book for Students 1897:547, noting Francesco Cancellieri, Notizie sulle statue di... Pasquino (Rome, 1779). With the consent of Pope Pius V, it was taken immediately to Florence, where it appears in the inventory taken at Cosimo's death in 1574.Haskell and Penny 1981:294-95 note 23. The project for completing the truncated torso of the \\"Ajax\\" figure, missing above the waist when it was found according to the Memorie (1594) of the sculptor and antiquarian Flaminio Vacca, was commissioned by Ferdinando II; the \\"restoration\\" was worked out by Pietro Tacca and executed by Lodovico SalvettiLodovico Salvetti, like Tacca a former garzone in the studio of Giambologna, was a minor Florentine sculptor who worked as Tacca's assistant. from Tacca's model, according to Filippo Baldinucci.Baldinucci, Notizie dei professori del disegno... ii:168. It was set up in a niche on the south end of the Ponte Vecchio. Paolo Alessandro Maffei's engraving of 1704Included in Maffei's Raccolta di statue antiche e moderne, plate xlii (Rome, 1704). shows that the \\"Ajax\\" figure then was wearing a helmet much simpler than the elaborate neoclassical one erroneously provided by Ricci seen on the sculpture today. Terracotta reduction by Juan Ad√°n Morl√°n, as Priam supporting the body of Hector (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, Madrid) In 1771, the neoclassic artist Anton Raphael Mengs took moulds of the parts he considered genuinely ancient (and thus original) of this sculpture and the version at the Palazzo Pitti (discussed below) and reassembled them in a plaster model that was intended to be more faithful to the Roman original.Galardi 2002. It was taken away to be further repaired in 1798After the Treaty of Tolentino (February 1797) Napoleonic agents were assessing all the public and noble collections of Italy to see which antiquities should be removed to Paris. Many of the antiquities of Naples were removed by ship to safety in Sicily by the Neapolitan Bourbons in exile. and remained in obscurity, undergoing further adjustments by Stefano Ricci in the 1830s, until it was finally re-erected in 1838, in the Loggia dei Lanzi in the Piazza della Signoria, Florence.Haskell and Penny 1981:295-95; earlier discussions of placing it in the Loggia dei Lanzi had never been acted upon. The feature which still draws most attention is the lifeless hanging left arm of the \\"Achilles\\" figure, seemingly dislocated, which was in fact part of the Tacca-Salvetti restoration.\\"In fatti nel gruppo del Ponte Vecchio il torso della prima figura, ed il braccio sinistro della seconda √® moderno.\\" (Saggio istorico della Real galleria di Firenze (1779) vol. ii note xxxv to p. 20. Other errors in restoration are the lifted left leg of the bearer, the raised right knee of Patroclus, and the mounded ground that serves as a base.Pointed out by Erna Mandowsky, \\"Two Menelaus and Patroclus Replicas in Florence and Joshua Reynolds\\" The Art Bulletin 28.2 (June 1946:115‚Äì118) p. 115. The second Medici group The second version was a gift in 1570 from the Florentine Paolo Antonio Soderini of Rome.According to Flaminio Vacca, Memorie di varie antichit√† trovate in diversi luoghi della Citt√† di Roma, 1594 (Haskell and Penny 1981:295). It was said to have been found at the Mausoleum of Augustus.For Soderini's archaeological activities at the Mausoleum of Augustus, see Anna Maria Riccomini, \\"A Garden of Statues and Marbles: The Soderini Collection in the Mausoleum of Augustus\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 58 (1995, pp. 265‚Äì284) p. 281f. Identified as Ajax, it stands in the Cortile del Ajaco of Palazzo Pitti. Further fragments of other Roman copies of this group have appeared during the 20th century,Bernhard Schweitzer listed all the fragments known as of 1936, in \\"Das Original des sogennanten Pasquino-Gruppe\\", on Abhandlungen der philologisch-historischen Klasse der s√§chsischen Akademie der Wissenshaften 43.4 (Leipzig) 1936:1ff; he reported the particular parts of the two Medici groups that are restorations. but more severe and careful modern criteria for restoration have led historians to avoid trying to restore them as a completed figural group, as past individuals attempted to do with the Pasquino group.  The Hadrian group  Five fragments of a Pasquino group were excavated from Hadrian's Villa by Gavin Hamilton in 1769. This sculpture was a part of the Roman emperor Hadrian's collection of copies of Greek masterpieces. Unlike other copies, the deceased figure in Hadrian's copy is wounded on the back. This has been interpreted as evidence that Hadrian's copy was meant to represent Menelaus and Patroclus, since the Iliad states that he was killed by a blow to the back. These fragments are in the Vatican Museums. The head of Menelaus is on display in the museum's Hall of Busts.

The affected area turns green and spines and other appendages are lost. If the lesion remains shallow and covers less than 30% of the animal's surface area, the animal tends to survive and eventually regenerates any lost tissue.

Korade's long history of violent behaviour resulted in forced retirement in 1997 and culminated in a 2008 shooting spree in which he murdered five people before committing suicide. Early life and military career Ivan Korade was born in 1963 in Velika Veterniƒçka, a village near Zlatar, Hrvatsko Zagorje. Before the start of the Yugoslav Wars, he worked as a central heating installer. His military career began in 1991, when he volunteered for a special operations police unit. After the Croatian National Guard was formed, he joined the 1st Guards Brigade (\\"The Tigers\\") and became a battalion commander in 1992. He was badly injured in Dubrovnik in 1992, losing his left arm, but returned to action after only two weeks of recovery, and became the first commander of the newly formed 7th Guards Brigade (\\"Pumas\\") in 1993. His brigade was the first to enter Knin on 5 August 1995, and Korade raised the Croatian flag at the Knin Fortress. He returned to fight in Bosnia in September 1995. He retired in 1997 after causing brawls during football matches at the club \\"Bojovnik 7\\". After retirement In September 2000, Korade was one of the signers of the Twelve Generals' Letter. In the following years, he was linked to various crimes, including beatings and drunk driving. In 2001, he was convicted of violent behaviour and maltreatment of a man six years earlier, and Korade received a suspended eight-month sentence. Croatian authorities were criticised for allowing these incidents to occur. Murders On 1 April 2008, Korade was charged with the 27 March murders of four people in his native village (Velika Veterniƒçka): a 16-year-old boy, a 62-year-old female relative, and two men, including a former aide, Davor Petri≈°. Croatian media reported that one of the victims was shot in the eyes and another was stabbed with a knife. He went missing after the killings and hundreds of police officers, backed by several helicopters, searched for him in the village and the surrounding area. The manhunt took eight days. In the beginning, he wasn't accused of the murders but arrested and detained by the police as a \\"person who can help in the resolving of the case\\". After a few days, police found Korade's vehicle near the forest and started to investigate the forest. Few nights after, police spotted a person who fit \\"Korade's description\\" with a thermal vision camera, but did not manage to arrest him. =Death= On 3 April 2008, police officers found a bottle of alcohol and saw a broken window on one house. They started walking towards the house to investigate it, but suddenly rifle gunshot started from a house and one police officer was wounded. He died on the way to the hospital. Police then surrounded the house and started throwing tear gas into the house. When police finally broke into the house, Korade was dead. He had been hiding in a house in Velika Veterniƒçka when police surrounded him. Surrounded with bombs and other weapons, Korade apparently committed suicide; although local media claimed he had been killed by police. Aftermath Korade was buried at Petrova Gora, and the funeral was attended by many of his comrades. The locals of Veterniƒçka publicly expressed a desire for him to be buried elsewhere. Mario Kusaniƒá, the policeman fatally shot by Korade, was posthumously decorated with the Order of Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan. By committing suicide, Korade escaped being tried for war crimes during Operation Mistral 2 in Glamoƒç, Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995), where he commanded over the \\"Pumas\\". By decree of President Stjepan Mesiƒá, all Korade's decorations - except for the Order of the Croatian Cross, a wound medal - were posthumously revoked.https://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/clanak/12-zigosanih- kojima-su-oduzeta-drzavna-odlikovanja-20150317 References External links  Svi Koradeovi ekscesi * Miljavac: Korade je bio re≈æiser vara≈ædinskog vojnog puƒça iz 1997.

It was launched by an Orbital Sciences Corporation Pegasus-XL rocket at 17:01 GMT on 16 April 2008. It decayed on 28 November 2015. The satellite, which was operated by the USAF STP, allowed the US military to predict the effects of ionospheric activity on signals from communication and navigation satellites, outages of which could potentially cause problems in battlefield situations. C/NOFS had a three-axis stabilisation system, and was equipped with seven sensors. It was placed into a low Earth orbit with orbital inclination of 13¬∞, a perigee of 400 km and an apogee of 850 km. It carried the CINDI experiment for NASA. Launch was originally scheduled for 2003, but was delayed due to a number of issues. Scientific instruments on board The spacecraft payload consists of the following instruments: *Ion Velocity Meter (IVM): IVM consists of a pair of sensors designed to measure the in situ ion velocity vector, ion temperature, and ion composition. The IVM is provided by the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas. IVM is a component of the CINDI package funded by NASA. PI: Rod Heelis *Planar Langmuir Probe (PLP): A two sensor package consisting an ion trap designed to measure ion density fluctuations and a Langmuir probe. PLP is provided by the Air Force Research Laboratory. PI: Patrick Roddy. Formerly, Donald Hunton. *Neutral Wind Meter (NWM): A two sensor package designed to measure the neutral wind velocity. NWM is provided by the William B. Hanson Center for Space Sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas. Like IVM, NWM is a component of the CINDI package funded by NASA. PI: Greg Earle Ram Wind Sensor (RWS): RWS measures the ram component of the neutral wind by ionizing a fraction of the incoming neutral gas then performing retarding potential analysis on those ions. Cross Track Sensor (CTS): The cross track sensor is a hollow hemispherical dome divided into four independent chambers with a miniaturized Bayard-Alpert hot filament ionization gauge in each chamber. Four small holes in the dome allow the neutral gas to stream into the chambers. The pressure in any chamber will depend on the arrival angle of the neutral wind. *CORISS: The C/NOFS Occultation Receiver for Ionospheric Sensing and Specification (CORISS) instrument is a GPS dual-frequency receiver designed to measure line-of-sight TEC. CORISS is provided by the Aerospace corporation. PI: Paul Straus *CERTO: the Coherent Electromagnetic Radio Tomography (CERTO) experiment is a radio beacon that will provide plasma density profiles and information on phase and amplitude scintillation of radio signals. CERTO is provided by the Naval Research Laboratory. PI: Paul Bernhardt *Vector Electric Field Instrument (VEFI): VEFI is a collection of instruments including 6 electric field booms, a 3-axis magnetometer, a spherical Langmuir probe, and a lightning detector. VEFI is provided by NASA Goddard with funding from the Air Force Research Laboratory. PI: Rob Pfaff Scientific Data C/NOFS science data is now available online for general use. VEFI and PLP data are available through NASA Goddard's Coordinated Data Analysis Web (CDAWeb). CINDI data are available through the William B.

Members of the genus grow to in length and inhabit the lower intertidal zone. Morphology Megabalanus is an acorn barnacle, a sessile crustacean that secretes a calcium carbonate shell consisting of five plates. It reaches up to in height . Ecology Like other barnacles, they are suspension feeders, grabbing particulate matter from the water column overhead. M. tintinnabulum has a worldwide distribution and is commonly found on wave-beaten shores, in the lower intertidal zone. They tend to grow in clusters of around 12 individuals. Other species are more select, such as M. californicus of tidal habitats in California and the greater North American Pacific Coast. While many barnacles deal with competition for space by organisms such as limpets and mussels by growing many organisms close together in colonies, Megabalanus responds by rapidly growing to a very large size. Their large size also helps reduce predation, although it makes them large enough to be harvested for human consumption. Geological utility Fossilised M. tintinnabulum(?), which grew on a boulderous debris fan (preserved as dark breccia, bottom), and were smothered by deposition of sands (orange upper layer), hence preserved in situ. Fossilised specimens of Megabalanus have been found dating back to the Miocene. Fossils bearing a close resemblance to M. tintinnabulum are preserved in large numbers in the Tabernas Basin of Spain. A case study of this area showed that the state of preservation of the organisms makes possible estimating the distance they were transported post mortem . Since the species today lives in the intertidal zone, this allows an estimate to be made of the distance from the shoreline, and by implication, the water depth. These observations are backed up by the appearance of the deep-water trace fossil Zoophycum in the predicted deepest waters, suggesting that barnacles can be a good proxy for water depth.

Troops of the 39th Division, XI Corps in the First Army of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), advanced to capture the Boar's Head, a salient held by the German 6th Army. Two battalions of the 116th Brigade, with one battalion forming carrying parties, attacked the German front position before dawn on 30 June. The British took and held the German front line trench and the second trench for several hours, before retiring to their lines having lost The operation was conducted when the British armies on the Western Front north of the Somme, supported the Fourth Army during the Battle of the Somme (1 July to 18 November). The British Third, First and Second armies conducted against the Germans up to November 1916, harassing the Germans opposite to give novice divisions experience of fighting on the Western Front, to inflict casualties and to prevent German troops from being transferred to the Somme. From 19 to 20 July, XI Corps conducted the much bigger Battle of Fromelles, where British and Australian troops suffered an even greater number of casualties. Background On 1 June 1916, General Charles Monro, commander of the First Army, about north of the Somme, held a conference with the corps commanders for operations to be undertaken when the Fourth Army and the French Sixth Army began the offensive on the Somme. The First Army was to mislead the Germans, exhaust the forces opposite and reduce their efficiency during the preliminary bombardment on the Somme. On 7 June, the XI Corps commander, Lieutenant- General Richard Haking submitted the corps plan to fulfil the diversion policy, writing that saps had been dug towards the German lines and assembly trenches from 1915 had been refurbished. The divisions of XI Corps had plans for eight raids, to involve gas, smoke and wire-cutting bombardments each day, from 26 June until 10 July. A model of the German defences was built near each divisional headquarters (HQ) to be used in the planning of raids. Prelude During March 1916, the month that the 39th Division (Major-General Gerald Cuthbert) arrived in France, Haking ordered divisional commanders to make lists of soldiers, NCOs and officers worthy of promotion, since quick advancement on merit encouraged efficiency and boosted morale. Haking was also ready to remove officers and in April wanted the three brigadier-generals of the infantry brigades sacked and replaced with younger men. The German troops opposite XI Corps were not passive and on 26 May, the 39th Division was raided. From 23 June to 14 July, XI Corps conducted with mixed results. On the night of a party of of A Company, 2/5th Gloucestershire Regiment crossed no man's land to identify units opposite. The British wire was found to be insufficiently cut, the troops were caught by German machine-gun fire in the bottlenecks and were forced back with many casualties. On 13 June, troops from the 2/4th Royal Berkshire Regiment (2/4th Berkshire) rehearsed a raid on the Ferme du Bois area in the afternoon and after a bombardment, attacked at The raiders found that most of the German wire was uncut and only a small group got into the German front trench. The raiders returned to the British lines having suffered more than a third of the party. On 29 May, German raiders got into the 39th Division lines, killed two soldiers and induced several others to cast away their rifles. An attack was planned by the 39th Division for the 12th and 13th (Southdowns) battalions of the Royal Sussex Regiment, part of the 116th Southdowns Brigade to occupy the Boar's Head, a salient in the German front line. Attack The preliminary bombardment and wire cutting by the British guns commenced on the afternoon of 29 June and was reported to have been successful. The final bombardment commenced shortly before including smoke shells and the 12th and 13th battalions attacked shortly afterwards at about the 11th Battalion providing carrying parties. The British guns lifted their fire off the German front trench to the support line as the infantry crossed no man's land and German machine-gunners inflicted many casualties. The 13th Battalion survivors got into the German front line trench and then advanced to the second trench, encountering more massed machine-gun fire but captured the trench. Several German counter-attacks were repulsed and after about half an hour, the raiders withdrew because of a shortage of ammunition and increasing casualties. The 12th Battalion was obstructed by uncut wire but returned to the German front line and held it for a short time before withdrawing. German defensive tactics included shelling their own trenches where the British had gained a foothold. On 6 July, the 2nd/1st Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (OBLI) near Ferme du Bois found that men of the Royal Sussex were still straggling back over no man's land. Aftermath =Analysis= After the fiasco of 30 June, Haking wrote that the 39th Division had been in France since March but lacked offensive spirit. The attack on the Boar's Head had led to a great improvement in the fighting value of the division. Haking reported that the attack would have persuaded the Germans to keep reserves in the area, fulfilling the diversion policy. Captain Christie-Miller of the 2nd/1st OBLI called the raid a \\"disastrous enterprise\\" which demoralised the British and cheered the Germans opposite. =Casualties= In 1938, the British official Historian Wilfrid Miles wrote that the 116th Brigade suffered and in 2012, Michael Senior gave figures of In less than five hours, the three Southdowns battalions of the Royal Sussex Regiment lost and killed, including of brothers, three from one family. Another were wounded or taken prisoner. In the regimental history, the battle is known as \\"The Day Sussex Died\\". CSM Nelson Victor Carter was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his actions in the battle. Commemoration The Le Touret Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery and memorial is sited at Richebourg.

History The 40 class were the first mainline diesel electric locomotives to be built for the New South Wales Government Railways. Built by the Montreal Locomotive Works in 1951/52, they were based on the ALCO RSC-3 design.40 class Vicsig There were subtle deviations from the standard RSC-3 built by the American Locomotive Company. These included cab sides that angled inwards from just below the cab window-sill level upwards to reduce the width of the locomotive at the eaves of the cab roof, and placement of the handrails on the car body rather than the standard walkway arrangement. They were originally used on heavy freight services from Sydney to Broadmeadow and later on North Coast services to Brisbane and Main South line services to Albury.40 Class Railpage All were delivered in grey undercoat and painted in verdant green at Eveleigh Carriage Workshops. For the 1954 Royal Tour of Queen Elizabeth II 4001 and 4002 were repainted blue. In the 1960s all were repainted Indian red. With major electrical work required and their lack of power compared to other diesels, the 40 class were withdrawn from May 1968 with the last being taken out of service in December 1971. Some had parts recycled in to the new build 442 class locomotives. Preservation The NSW Rail Museum preserved 4001. It was returned to traffic in October 2010 painted in the blue livery it received in 1954 to haul the Royal Train.(A Leaver, September 2010 Roundhouse) Robe River Iron Associates purchased 4002 and 4006 for use on construction trains and later as shunters in the Pilbara region of Western Australia where they were renumbered 9405 and 9401.

The Portland‚ÄìSouth Portland‚ÄìBiddeford MSA is indicated in red. Androscoggin County, shown in yellow, forms the Lewiston‚ÄìAuburn MSA and is included in the larger Portland‚ÄìLewiston‚ÄìSouth Portland CSA. The city of Portland, Maine, is the hub city of a metropolitan area in southern Maine, United States. The region is commonly known as Greater Portland or the Portland metropolitan area. For statistical purposes, the U.S. federal government defines three different representations of the Portland metropolitan area. The Portland‚ÄìSouth Portland‚ÄìBiddeford, Maine, metropolitan statistical area is a region consisting of three counties in Maine, anchored by the city of Portland and the smaller cities of South Portland and Biddeford. As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 514,098. A larger combined statistical area (CSA), the Portland‚ÄìLewiston‚ÄìSouth Portland combined statistical area, is defined as the combination of this metropolitan statistical area (MSA) with the adjacent Lewiston‚ÄìAuburn MSA. The CSA comprises four counties in southern Maine. The Portland‚ÄìSouth Portland metropolitan New England city and town area is defined on the basis of cities and towns rather than entire counties. It consists of most of Cumberland and York counties plus the town of Durham in Androscoggin County. Metropolitan statistical area =Components= The Portland‚ÄìSouth Portland‚ÄìBiddeford MSA is defined as consisting of Cumberland, Sagadahoc, and York counties. Portland, South Portland, and Biddeford are the three largest cities in this area and are defined as principal cities of the MSA. Other cities in the MSA are: *Bath *Saco *Sanford *Westbrook Towns in the three-county MSA are: *Acton *Alfred *Arrowsic *Arundel *Baldwin *Berwick *Bowdoin *Bowdoinham *Bridgton *Brunswick *Buxton *Cape Elizabeth *Casco *Chebeague Island *Cornish *Cumberland *Dayton *Eliot *Falmouth *Freeport *Frye Island *Georgetown *Gorham *Gray *Harpswell *Harrison *Hollis *Kennebunk *Kennebunkport *Kittery *Lebanon *Limerick *Limington *Long Island *Lyman *Naples *New Gloucester *Newfield *North Berwick *North Yarmouth *Ogunquit *Old Orchard Beach *Parsonsfield *Phippsburg *Pownal *Raymond *Richmond *Sanford *Scarborough *Sebago *Shapleigh *South Berwick *Standish *Topsham *Waterboro *Wells *West Bath *Windham *Woolwich *Yarmouth *York Census-designated places in the MSA are: *Berwick *Bridgton *Brunswick *Brunswick Station *Cape Neddick *Cumberland Center *Falmouth Foreside *Freeport *Gorham *Kennebunk *Kennebunkport *Kittery *Kittery Point *Lake Arrowhead *Little Falls *North Berwick *North Windham *Old Orchard Beach *Richmond *Sanford *Scarborough *South Eliot *South Sanford *South Windham *Springvale *Topsham *West Kennebunk *Yarmouth *York Harbor The MSA includes one unorganized territory, the town of Perkins. =Demographics= As of the 2010 census, the MSA had a population of 514,098. Ten years earlier, as of the census of 2000, there were 487,568 people, 196,669 households, and 128,201 families residing within the MSA. The racial makeup of the MSA was 96.49% White, 0.80% African American, 0.27% Native American, 1.09% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.28% from other races, and 1.03% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.87% of the population. As of the 2000 census, the median income for a household in the MSA was $43,195, and the median income for a family was $51,873. Males had a median income of $35,402 versus $26,213 for females. The per capita income for the MSA was $21,851. Combined statistical area The Portland-Lewiston-South Portland Combined Statistical Area is made up of four counties in Maine. The statistical area includes two metropolitan statistical areas. As of the 2000 Census, the CSA had a population of 591,361 (a July 1, 2009 estimate placed the population at 623,365). =Components= Metropolitan statistical areas: *Portland-South Portland-Biddeford (Cumberland, Sagadahoc, and York counties) *Lewiston-Auburn (Androscoggin County) New England city and town areas An alternative federal government delineation of Portland's metropolitan area is the Portland‚ÄìSouth Portland, ME Metropolitan New England City and Town Area. A New England City and Town Area (NECTA) is typically a finer-grained definition of a metropolitan area because it is based on cities and towns rather than entire counties. The Portland‚ÄìSouth Portland NECTA consists of 24 cities and towns in Cumberland County, 14 cities and towns in York County, and the town of Durham in Androscoggin County. Other parts of the Southern Maine region are identified as components of other NECTAs. The towns of Sanford and Shapleigh in York County form the Sanford, Maine, Micropolitan NECTA. The Brunswick, Maine, Micropolitan NECTA consists of two towns in Cumberland County, one city and eight towns in Sagadahoc County, and three towns in Lincoln County. Two metropolitan NECTAs centered in New Hampshire, the Dover-Durham, NH-ME Metropolitan NECTA (anchored by the principal cities of Dover and Durham, New Hampshire) and the Portsmouth, NH-ME Metropolitan NECTA (anchored by Portsmouth, New Hampshire) each include three York County towns. The Lewiston-Auburn Metropolitan NECTA is defined as including 11 Androscoggin County cities and towns, as well as four towns in Oxford County and one in Kennebec County. Similar to a CSA, the Portland‚ÄìLewiston‚ÄìSouth Portland Combined NECTA is defined to consist of the Portland‚ÄìSouth Portland and Lewiston‚ÄìAuburn Metropolitan NECTAs and the Brunswick and Sanford Micropolitan NECTAs. The three York County towns that are included in the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Metropolitan NECTA are, however, considered to be part of the Boston‚ÄìWorcester‚ÄìProvidence, MA‚ÄìRI‚ÄìNH‚ÄìCT‚ÄìME Combined NECTA. The state of Maine uses NECTAs as one basis for defining labor market areas for purposes of compiling and reporting statistics on employment and unemployment. Labor market area definitions used for the Portland area include the Portland‚ÄìSouth Portland‚ÄìBiddeford Metropolitan Area, the Sanford Micropolitan Area, and the combination of these two areas, known as Portland‚ÄìSouth Portland‚ÄìSanford combined statistical area.

Educated at Eton, he began his career as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps and then served in the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1921, Sempill led an official military mission to Japan that showcased the latest British aircraft. In subsequent years he continued to aid the Imperial Japanese Navy in developing its Navy Air Service. In the 1920s, Sempill began giving military secrets to the Japanese. Although his activities were uncovered by British Intelligence, Sempill was not prosecuted for spying and allowed to continue in public life. He was eventually forced to retire from the Royal Navy in 1941 after being discovered passing on secret material to Tokyo shortly before Japan declared war in the Pacific. Sempill was known as \\"Master of Sempill\\" before succeeding his father to the titles of Lord Sempill and Baronet of Craigevar in 1934. Early life Born at the family seat of Craigievar Castle in Aberdeenshire, Sempill was educated at Eton, and then apprenticed to Rolls-Royce in 1910. Military and civil aviation At the outbreak of World War I, Sempill joined Royal Flying Corps, being granted a probationary commission as a second lieutenant on 15 August 1914, which was confirmed less than four months later. In the meantime Sempill was appointed to flying duties. The following year, in February, Sempill took up a position as an \\"experimental officer\\" at the Central Flying School and he received a promotion to lieutenant in April. Less than four months later he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. In August 1915, he was appointed to instructional duties. Sempill's time at the Central Flying School was not to last as he relinquished his Army commission at the end of the year on being accepted for temporary service in the Royal Naval Air Service. Sempill's rapid rise through the ranks continued in the Navy and at the close of 1916 he was promoted to squadron commander. On 1 April 1918, with the amalgamation of both flying services into the Royal Air Force, Sempill was transferred and appointed one of several deputy directors in the RAF's personnel department with the temporary rank of colonel. He was awarded the Air Force Cross in the 1918 Birthday Honours. Sempill stayed at the Air Ministry until 8 October 1918 when he was seconded to the Ministry of Munitions. On the cessation of hostilities, he became a test pilotPeter C Smith, Fist from the Sky and he retired from military service in 1919. On 4 September 1930, he set a new record by flying a de Havilland DH.80 Puss Moth seaplane (G-AAVB) 1,040 miles non-stop from Brent Reservoir in London to Stockholm, Sweden in 12 hours.Lewis (1970) On 26 March 1936 he made a record- breaking flight in a BAC Drone ultra-light aircraft (G-ADPJ) 570 miles from Croydon Airport direct to Berlin Tempelhof Airport in 11 hours. He flew back a day or so later in 9 hours though he interrupted the flight with a stop at Canterbury, Kent. Japanese spy =Beginnings= In 1920 he led a civilian British deputation of former naval airmen to Japan ‚Äì the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office saw the prospect for lucrative arms contracts with Japan ‚Äì to help develop aircraft carriers, and to assist the Japanese navy in setting up its new air base,Cheesman, Frank Prelude to Pearl Harbour article in Aircraft Annual 1964 UK Ian Allan 1963 pp24-29 after the Japanese had bought three Supermarine Channel flying boats. Sempill was well respected within Japanese circles, and received a personal letter from Prime Minister Tomosaburo Kato (1922‚Äì1923), thanking him for his work with the Imperial Japanese Navy, which he described as \\"almost epoch-making.\\" With the termination of the Anglo- Japanese Alliance in 1921, Sempill should have ended close military contact and discussions regarding naval aviation technology and tactics. But on his return to the United Kingdom in 1923, Sempill kept in contact with the Japanese Foreign Ministry through the Japanese Embassy in London. =Suspicion and questioning= Blackburn Iris seaplane. In 1925 Sempill accompanied a mission of foreign air officials to the Blackburn Aircraft factory at Brough, East Yorkshire. The Japanese had previously asked questions about aircraft being developed. Sempill later asked the same questions, in his official position, about the then secret Blackburn Iris. The Directorate of Military Intelligence had kept Sempill's communications with the Japanese intelligence officer/Naval attach√© in London, Captain Teijir≈ç Toyoda, under surveillance from 1922. This led to the knowledge that Sempill was passing classified information to the Japanese, which Toyoda's communications indicated had been paid for. MI5 tapped Sempill's phone, and noted that his servant was a Japanese naval rating. In March 1926, Sempill was proposed by the Aviation Ministry for an appointment as Greece's aeronautical adviser. At this point the Directorate of Military Intelligence advised the Foreign Office and the British Embassy in Athens that Britain could not be seen to endorse Sempill's appointment because of his past activities. Sempill was called into the Foreign Office for an interview. The questions directed to him were intended to assess his loyalty to the British Government, his attachments to the Japanese, and the amount of information that he had passed to the Japanese. During the meeting, the investigating officer could not reveal that the British had broken Japanese codes and were monitoring the Japanese communications systems. On a trip to Brough, Sempill had openly talked about the Iris with the foreign air officials on the train trip from London. This was witnessed by a British Air Ministry civil servant, who reported the incident. Confronted with this information, Sempill admitted that he had broken the Official Secrets Act. A subsequent meeting, chaired by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Austen Chamberlain, decided it was not in the interests of the British government to prosecute Sempill. Firstly Sempill's father was then aide-de-camp to King George V; any public trial would be a grave embarrassment to both the Crown and the British establishment. Secondly a prosecution would have revealed to the Japanese that British Intelligence had cracked the cypher codes of its diplomatic service. =Reprieve and inter-war activities= Six years after admitting he had breached the UK's Official Secrets Act, Sempill became a technical and business consultant to the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries; from 1932 to 1936 he represented the Japanese company in Europe. He also became chairman and then president of the Royal Aeronautical Society. In this capacity he advised overseas governments, such as Australia, on the creation of their naval air services. In October 1933 Sempill was seriously injured in an accident while riding as a passenger in the Dymaxion three-wheel car in the United States. Sempill had been invited, in his capacity as an aviation expert, to review the aerodynamic experimental vehicle at Chicago World's Fair. But when he was being rushed to an airport to catch a plane to Akron, Ohio to meet the Graf Zeppelin for its return trip from New York to Europe, the Dymaxion was struck by another vehicle and overturned, killing the driver. In 1934 he succeeded his father, John Forbes-Sempill, 18th Lord Sempill to the titles of Lord Sempill and Baronet of Craigevar. His wife, who had accompanied him on many of his air tours, died in July 1935. Sempill had \\"an affinity with militarist right-wing regimes\\". During the 1930s he developed extreme right-wing political opinions and was active in several anti-Semitic organizations such as the Anglo-German Fellowship, the pro-Nazi Link organisation and The Right Club led by Archibald Ramsay. =Espionage 1939-41= On the outbreak of war in 1939, Sempill was given a position in the Department of Air Materiel at the Admiralty. This gave him access to both sensitive and secret information about the latest British aircraft. By June 1941, MI5 had intercepted messages between London and Mitsubishi and Field Marshal Yamagata's Tokyo headquarters indicating payments were being made to Sempill: \\"In light of the use made of Lord Sempill by our military and naval attaches in London, these payments should continue\\". On further investigation, MI5 suspected that Sempill was passing on top secret information about Fleet Air Arm aircraft. The matter was passed to the Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions. But again the Attorney General advised against prosecution. On 5 September 1941, Sempill attended a meeting with the Fifth Sea Lord and was given \\"a strict private warning\\". On Friday 2 August 1940, Special Branch arrested Japanese businessman Makihara Satoru, head of Mitsubishi Shoji Company's London office, and several others on suspicion of espionage, and took them to Brixton prison. On discovering that Makihara was in custody, Sempill telephoned and then called at Paddington police station to assure the police of Makihara's innocence and character. He was released a few days later, on Monday 5 August, due to \\"insufficient evidence\\". Sempill was also probably passing on detailed information about the British government. In August 1941, Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt held a meeting in Newfoundland aboard HMS Prince of Wales to discuss the military threat posed by the Japanese. Soon after, communications between the Japanese embassy in London and Tokyo were deciphered by the Bletchley Park code breakers. The decrypted messages were transcripts of the conference notes. When passed to an alarmed Churchill, he called them \\"pretty accurate stuff\\". Three months later, more notes from Churchill's personal agenda and inner circle were intercepted as they were being sent by the Japanese Embassy in London to the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo. Privately Churchill concluded with Anthony Eden that only two men could be the source of such leaks: Commander McGrath or Lord Sempill. On 9 October 1941, a signed note from Churchill read: \\"Clear him out while time remains.\\" The following week the Admiralty told Sempill he must either resign or be sacked. After Sempill made an official protest, Churchill backtracked. The Prime Minister told the Admiralty: \\"I had not contemplated Lord Sempill being required to resign his commission, but only to be employed elsewhere in the Admiralty.\\" A subsequent note from Churchill's aide Desmond Morton, dated 17 October 1941, outlined the new position: \\"The First Sea Lord ... proposes to offer him a post in the North of Scotland. I have suggested to Lord Swinton that MI5 should be informed in due course so they may take any precautions necessary.\\" On 13 December 1941, six days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Sempill's office was raided. A search revealed various secret documents that he should have handed back to the Admiralty over three weeks earlier. Two days later Sempill was discovered making phone calls to the Japanese Embassy. Despite the evidence of treason in wartime (see Treachery Act 1940), no arrest or prosecution was ordered; Sempill agreed to retire from public office. Personal life Eileen Lavery in 1913 In 1919 Sempill married Eileen Marion Lavery, daughter of the Irish painter Sir John Lavery. Their first daughter, Ann Moira, was born in 1920. Their second daughter, June Mary, was born in c.1923, and was killed aged 18 as a result of enemy action on 11 May 1941 ‚Äì the last day of the Blitz ‚Äì at 15 Basil Street, London. She had been serving with the WVS Mobile Canteen Service. Later years and death In 1944, Sempill called on the Premier of Nova Scotia, Alexander Stirling MacMillan, in Halifax and offered to buy a part of the province. In 1956 the Swedish government awarded him the Order of the Polar Star. At various times he was president of the British Gliding Association and of the Institute of Advanced Motorists. In 1963 he gave Craigievar Castle to the National Trust for Scotland. He died in Edinburgh on 30 December 1965. His daughter, Ann, inherited the Sempill peerage, as it was one that could go to a female heir. However, the baronetcy, which could only be inherited in the male line, controversially passed to his younger sibling, Ewan Forbes, who had been brought up as a woman but was found by the courts to be \\"of indeterminate sex\\". Legacy It was not until the release of intelligence records by the Public Record Office in 1998 and 2002 that Sempill's activities as a spy during the war and in the 1920s respectively became common knowledge. Sempill's motives remain unclear. The National Archives states that \\"on the evidence of these [1920s] files\\", Sempill's activities on behalf of the militaristic Japanese and Fascist contacts were less from any desire to help the enemy but more motivated by his own impetuous character, obstinacy, and flawed judgement. In various correspondence of the early 1940s, between Churchill's office, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, it is noted that Sempill had debts and an overdraft in excess of ¬£13,000 (equivalent to ¬£750,000 in 2012).

There are several kinds, the original belonging only to traditional medicine, alternative medicine, or quackery, and some newer kinds under investigation. The original, unscientific form is \\"the immediate intramuscular or subcutaneous reinjection of freshly drawn autologous blood\\". It was used in the early 20th century, when some physicians believed that it had efficacy and logical mechanism of action; it was abandoned later as advancing science made clear that it lacked those.A Systematic Review of Autohemotherapy as a Treatment for Urticaria and Eczema / Devon D. Brewer, Cureus 6(12): e233. doi:10.7759/cureus.233 The other forms involve some change to the blood before it is reinjected, typically oxygenation, ozonation (ozonated autohemotherapy), ultraviolet light exposure, or centrifugation. Forms include platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and autologous conditioned serum (ACS). It is not impossible that ozonated or UV autohemotherapy may have real efficacy and effectiveness in autoimmune diseases if they are immunomodulatory in some way (such as by interfering with the deranged autoantibodies), but this mechanism of action, if it exists, is not yet well understood, and it is also logical that whatever molecular changes the ozone and UV bring about are unlikely to act specifically on just the desired target molecules‚Äîmeaning that risks are involved. History Autohemotherapy use in dermatology was popular in the early 1900s but was abandoned by conventional dermatologists due to a lack of supporting evidence of efficacy. A resurgence of interest in the 2000s has led to several investigations evaluating the use of autohemotherapy as a treatment for specific dermatological conditions such as hives (urticaria) and eczema. A review of these studies concludes that, though safe, autohemotherapy is only somewhat more effective than injection of saline solution. Society and culture One fringe dermatologic application of autohemotherapy, colloquially called a \\"vampire facial\\", came to public attention in 2013 when an Instagram posting by celebrity Kim Kardashian West portrayed her \\"blood-soaked face\\" during the administration of the procedure. Kardashian West later stated the she regretted undergoing the painful procedure. A vampire facial procedure involves a combination of microneedling followed by topical application of platelet-rich plasma derived from the centrifugation of the subject's own blood into various autologous blood products. Proponents claim that autologous platelet-rich plasma delivered subcutaneously to the skin of the face can improve its health by stimulating skin cell growth and collagen though the treatment is considered to lie outside of mainstream medicine because claimed benefits are unsupported by scientific evidence from clinical studies. Side effects of the treatment may include redness, swelling, bruising, tenderness, tingling, numbness, lumpiness, and/or a feeling of pressure or fullness at the injection sites which, providers claim, people recover from within two days with outlying reports from patients whose recovery took a week or more with scabbing and other problems. More serious safety concerns have been cited for these treatments when performed in non-medical settings by people untrained in infection control. The New Mexico Department of Health issued a statement that at least one such business offering vampire facials \\"could potentially spread blood-borne infections such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C to clients.‚Äù In contrast, so-called \\"vampire filler\\" is autologous platelets used as dermal filler in the platelet-rich fibrin matrix method of cosmetic surgery; it is generally not described as autohemotherapy and the FDA-approved machines for it are only approved for use by licensed surgeons.

It is best known for the \\"Bear River City Riot\\" that occurred on November 19, 1868. History The town can trace its origins back to the early 1860s. A businessman from Salt Lake City named Joseph F. Nounnan was contracted to construct the Union Pacific railroad grade in the area where it crossed the Bear River in southwestern Wyoming, then the Utah Territory. He constructed a supply depot and lodging for his men on a site along the route of the Overland Stage as well as the path of the California and Mormon emigrant trails. Due to its excellent location, the city grew rapidly. At its peak, the town had its own newspaper office, and a red light district. The town served as a passover for miners, railroad workers, and hunters heading farther into the west. Bear River City Riot of November 19, 1868 The \\"Bear River City Riot\\" of November 19, 1868 began following the vigilante lynching of a murder suspect who worked for the railroad. This resulted in friends to the lynched man revolting against the vigilantes, which caused the town to erupt in violence. Town Marshal Thomas J. Smith, only recently appointed, immediately took a stand against both factions. There were numerous shootouts during the riot, and almost the entire town was torched, including most town government buildings. Smith stood his ground, but was unable to stop the onslaught of several hundred rioters, with the end result being sixteen people killed. Town citizens repelled an assault on the town jail, resulting in the deaths of numerous rioters, and one Bear River City citizen, Steve Stokes. A US Cavalry troop was dispatched from Fort Bridger, and martial law was imposed. The riot essentially ended any future the small town might have had, and it soon became deserted. Marshal Smith moved on to eventually become the Marshal of Abilene, Kansas. His stand during the riot resulted in his nickname, \\"Bear River\\" Smith.  References  External links *Tom J.

As a junior, Wormull played for Tottenham Hotspur in the final of the 1995 FA Youth Cup and in the Intertoto Cup. Although he made a few appearances in the lower divisions of the Football League for Brentford and Rushden & Diamonds, the majority of his playing career was spent in non-league football in the south-east of England. He was capped seven times for the National Game XI, the team that represents England at semi-professional level. After retirement as a player, Wormull joined the coaching staff of Isthmian League club Lewes, where he was first- team manager from January 2012 to the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season. He spent a few months as manager of Crawley Down Gatwick before returning to Three Bridges first as academy head, then as first-team coach. Playing career =Early career= Wormull was born in Crawley, West Sussex, and played for the under-15 team at local club Three Bridges before beginning his football career as a schoolboy with Brighton & Hove Albion. He joined Tottenham Hotspur while still a junior, and at the age of 15 became one of the youngest players ever to appear for their reserve team. In 1995, he played in the final of the FA Youth Cup against Manchester United youth team, scoring the opening goal in the first leg, which Tottenham won 2‚Äì1. By the time the second leg went to a losing penalty shootout, Wormull had been substituted by Stephen Clemence. The closest he came to first-team football in six years at the club was in the Intertoto Cup, a competition in which Tottenham fielded extremely weak sides, including that which lost 8‚Äì0 to FC Cologne. Released by Tottenham at the end of the 1996‚Äì97 season, Wormull joined Second Division club Brentford on a free transfer, marking his debut in the Football League by missing the best chance of the match. He fell out of favour, and following a trial in Brighton & Hove Albion's reserves, was given a month's contract by manager Brian Horton, who described the player as someone who \\"uses the ball well, ... gets forward and is quite aggressive\\". Injury prevented him playing for the first team during that period, or during another month at the start of the 1998‚Äì99 season; much to Horton's displeasure, Wormull rejected the offer of a further month, preferring to drop down to the Conference with Dover Athletic. =Dover Athletic= He scored twice in 30 Conference games in his first season with Dover, and his performance earned him international selection, chosen for England's National Game XI for the first time in March 1999. He maintained the standard the following season; Dover's best player against rivals Rushden & Diamonds, he was eventually stretchered off with a damaged Achilles tendon after three opponents were booked for fouling him. Sidelined for a month due to injuries sustained in that match, Wormull returned to play 20 minutes as a substitute before joining Rushden for a fee of ¬£50,000 later that same week. BBC Sport's 2000‚Äì01 Football Conference preview said that Dover would miss him, a view later echoed by then assistant manager Clive Walker, who described the 1999‚Äì2000 season as \\"a year when we had players like Simon Wormull, Joe Dunne and Dave Clarke in the team. In all honesty, we weren't far away from having a side good enough to win the division. We needed perhaps two more players to compete at the top ‚Äì but sadly we ended up selling Dunne and Wormull halfway through the season.\\" =Rushden & Diamonds= He helped Rushden to runners-up spot in the Conference in 2000, and retained his place in England's semi-professional side. In the 2000‚Äì01 season, his appearances were infrequent, and in December 2000, Dover made an unsuccessful attempt to buy him back. He played his part in Rushden's Conference title, and consequent promotion to the Football League. After five games for the club in Division Three, manager Brian Talbot sold Wormull together with striker Jean-Michel Sigere to Conference club Stevenage Borough for \\"a five-figure sum\\". =Stevenage Borough= Wormull helped Stevenage to reach the final of the FA Trophy in 2002, which they lost 2‚Äì0 to full-time professional club Yeovil Town. While with the club he won his seventh international cap, and maintained his reputation as a good crosser of the ball who was willing to shoot; in his first two seasons with the club he contributed more shots than any of his teammates, and in his second and third seasons he made most assists. Stevenage began to move towards full-time status before the 2002‚Äì03 season. At the end of that season, Wormull submitted a transfer request, because he was struggling to balance work and football commitments. Manager Graham Westley rejected the request, but in April 2004 his contract was cancelled by mutual consent, citing the player's injury record and his difficulties adjusting to the demands of full-time football. =Hornchurch and Crawley Town= Home-town club Crawley Town's manager Francis Vines hoped to sign Wormull, describing him as a good all-round player who \\"can play in the middle or wide right and passes the ball well, as well as being useful with set-pieces. He is also good in the tackle\\", capable of strengthening an already strong midfield. They were unable to match the offer ‚Äì believed to be ¬£800 a week ‚Äì from Conference South club Hornchurch, dubbed the \\"Chelsea of the Conference\\" because they had a well-paid full-time professional squad despite playing only in the sixth tier of English football. A back injury restricted his Hornchurch appearances, and he had not played for several weeks when, in November 2004, the owner's business collapsed, the players' pay cheques were stopped, and most of the squad left. Wormull returned home to join Crawley, on much reduced wages, but he failed his medical examination; the club initially offered him a short-term deal while he proved his fitness. At the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season he agreed a two-year contract. He turned down offers of full-time football, preferring to stay near home and combine his playing role with running the club's new youth coaching scheme in local schools. A succession of managerial changes following the club's takeover resulted in Wormull acting as caretaker manager for four matches in November 2005, a role in which he made a positive start. During this period he agreed a new contract, but the offer was later withdrawn, and he was given permission to speak to other clubs. Unwilling to leave the Sussex area, he decided to stay with Crawley, but when the club halved the players' wages, thereby breaching their contracts and allowing them to leave on free transfers, Wormull chose to join Conference South club Lewes. =Lewes= In his first full season with Lewes, Wormull was used in a number of different positions, but in 2007‚Äì08, he usually played in central midfield, and felt that the continuity helped his performance. He scored the winning goal against Sutton United in the third qualifying round of the FA Cup, and made an assist for one goal and was involved in the second in the fourth qualifying round, to take the club through to the first round proper for the second year running. Wormull contributed five goals from midfield towards his club winning the Conference South title, though an injured ankle meant he missed the last few weeks of the season. Following the departure of manager Steve King, the vast majority of the title- winning side left the club. Despite new Lewes manager Kevin Keehan's view that \\"if I could have had only one player I could keep from last season, it would be Simon\\" being reflected in the club offering him better terms than did Eastbourne Borough, Wormull, together with teammate Jean-Michel Sigere, joined their local rivals in June 2008. =Eastbourne Borough= Wormull and Sigere made their debuts in the opening-day defeat to former club Rushden & Diamonds, making Eastbourne the fifth club ‚Äì following Rushden, Stevenage, Hornchurch and Lewes ‚Äì where they played alongside each other. After just one season with the club, in which he scored six goals from 37 appearances in all competitions, Wormull's contract was cancelled by mutual consent. He did leave with a winners' medal, earned as an unused substitute in the Sussex Senior Cup final in May 2009, in which Eastbourne beat a Brighton & Hove Albion reserve team 1‚Äì0. =Farnborough and after= Wormull promptly signed a two-year deal with Farnborough, where he linked up with Steve King, his former manager at Lewes, and, for the sixth time in his career, with Jean-Michel Sigere, though only briefly, as Sigere was released a few days later. Wormull helped Farnborough win the 2009‚Äì10 Southern League title, playing 39 games in all competitions (20 in the league), before cancelling his contract by mutual consent at the end of that first season. He rejoined Lewes a few days later, staying with them until December, when he joined Sussex County League side Three Bridges, preferring for family reasons to play for a club nearer his home. According to Three Bridges' manager, the club were \\"absolutely chuffed to pieces to have such a magnificent player playing for us\\". Wormull tore knee ligaments in April 2011, and retired from competitive football at the end of the season. Coaching career Wormull then returned to Lewes, to join Steve King's management team in the role of under-18 team manager with support coaching involvement with the first team. When King was suspended by the club in January 2012, Wormull was \\"asked to assist with First Team Management duties\\". and the following week, after King's departure, he was appointed caretaker manager until the end of the season. He registered as a player, and made his third debut for Lewes from the substitutes' bench as his team lost 2‚Äì1 at home to Canvey Island in the Isthmian League Premier Division. In April, with Lewes on the verge of the play-offs, Wormull's appointment was made permanent. The club's directors said he had \\"impressed everybody with his combination of professionalism, diligence and approachability\\", and that \\"his new regime of training and insightful, value for money signings has transformed the team\\". First quotation verifiable at In his second season, Lewes narrowly avoided relegation. The board's view was that \\"being involved in a relegation battle was extremely disappointing\\", and an experience that was \\"particularly difficult\\" in context of the club's hard work towards \\"creat[ing] a platform from which to start building again\\", and Wormull was dismissed at the end of the season. He was \\"devastated\\" by the decision, believing he had \\"buil[t] a good foundation\\" for the future, despite being \\"decimated with injuries\\" and working to what he described as \\"a huge reduction in the budget\\". Wormull took over as manager of Isthmian League Division One South club Crawley Down Gatwick in June 2013. Wormull led the team to the top of the table with five wins and a draw from their first six matches, a performance that earned him the Isthmian South Manager of the Month award for August. They had fallen to sixth by early November, when he resigned his post for what were described as \\"personal and family reasons\\". In February 2014, Wormull returned to football as head of the youth academy at one of his former employers, fellow Isthmian South club Three Bridges. At the end of the season, he was appointed head first-team coach, to work with manager Paul Faili.

It lies mostly in Warren County in the state of Mississippi but is also partly in Madison Parish, in the state of Louisiana. It is located about 20 miles southwest of Vicksburg, Mississippi, USA. The island is approximately in size depending on the level of the Mississippi River. It was formerly a peninsula known as Davis Bend, with an eleven-thousand acre area of rich bottomlands, bounded on three sides by the Mississippi River.Brian Hamilton, \\"Davis Island: A Confederate Shrine, Submerged\\", Edge Effects, 9 October 2014, University of Wisconsin-Madison, accessed 14 June 2015 Before the American Civil War, Joseph Davis developed his 5,000-acre Hurricane Plantation for cotton production on the peninsula. He worked to develop a model slave community, providing more autonomy to his slaves, for instance allowing them to keep a certain portion of monies they earned. He bought the land in 1818. In the 1830s he allowed his much younger brother (by 23 years), Jefferson Davis, the use of an adjoining 1,000 acres, where the younger Davis developed Brierfield Plantation. Joseph never gave the younger Davis title to that land, which caused legal problems after his death in 1870. Jefferson Davis was elected as the President of the Confederate States of America. The peninsula was separated from the mainland by a shift in the river in March 1867, after which it was an island accessible only by water. After the war, Davis provided a mortgage to Ben Montgomery, his former slave who had managed his plantation, and other freedmen, to acquire both plantations. They operated them for several years, but declining cotton prices, economic hard times in the financial panic, and the repeated flooding caused failure. Davis heirs foreclosed on the note, forcing Montgomery descendants and others to leave the island. After several years of litigation, in 1878 Jefferson Davis gained legal possession of Brierfield plantation from his brother's heirs. He never lived at the plantation again; both he and other Davis family members leased the properties to tenant farmers. Their only access was by water. Following the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which inundated nearly 30,000 square miles, the US Army Corps of Engineers raised the height of the levees to try to prevent such damage in the future. This had the unintended consequence of increasing the severity of flooding of Davis Island. It has been under water more than once. The Davis family finally sold the properties in 1953, and the private Brierfield Hunting Club has controlled most of the island since then. Access is only by water.

It carries the traffic of U.S. Route 40 (Main Street and West Main Street), as well as Linden Avenue. History Intersection at the middle of the bridge The flow of Muskingum has been regulated by a series of dams and locks since the mid-19th century. Before the regulation serious floods often occurred, which washed away or weakened the earliest bridges.\\"City of Zanesville History\\" City of Zanesville, Ohio. The first Zanesville Y-Bridge was constructed in 1814. The trestle bridge stood for four years. The second wooden bridge was erected in 1819. New roads were built in the area and traffic increased. A winter flood in 1831‚Äì1832 weakened the second bridge to be unsafe for the increased traffic. A third iteration, a wooden covered bridge was completed in 1832 and stood until 1900. The next bridge opened in early 1902. It had concrete balustrade railings which were lost to the 1913 flood and replaced with pipe railings. The fourth bridge was deemed unsafe in 1979. After demolition it was found that only one of the three segments needed actual replacement, the other spans would have needed only surface repairs. The current concrete and steel bridge is the fifth in the series on the same location. It opened in 1984. While being a relief to traffic and the citizens, it has received criticism for a tunnel-like effect due to its solid railings, providing hardly any view of the scenery. The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was listed in 1973, before the fourth bridge was replaced by the fifth.

It has a terminal guidance system based on an infrared homing seeker, which identifies the target during the final stage of flight. Designed to hit targets out to 120 km, the bomb may have the capability to evade radar. History According to Pakistani press reports, the H-4 glide bomb was created by Pakistan's National Engineering and Scientific Commission (NESCOM), working in collaboration with the Pakistan Missile Organisation and Air Weapons Complex in Pakistan. A lighter version of the H-4 has also been produced, the H-2 SOW, which has a stated range of 60 km. Three successful tests were conducted, the last one in 2003, which led to field deployment on the Dassault Mirage III and Mirage V strike fighters of the Pakistan Air Force. It has also been stated that the H-4 will be integrated with the PAF's new multi-role combat aircraft, the JF-17, which is replacing the ageing fleet of Mirage III and Dassault Mirage 5 aircraft. All Pakistani JF-17 fighters, from the initial JF-17 Block 1 model to the final Block 3 version, will be capable of launching the H-4.

The station was built by Sound Transit to serve its Sounder commuter rail service, as well as Amtrak's intercity Cascades line. It includes 390 parking spaces and a bus platform served by King County Metro's RapidRide F Line and other routes. Tukwila station was approved for construction in 1996 and an interim station opened on March 12, 2001, using temporary platforms and a leased parking lot. Construction of a permanent station was delayed until additional funding was found and further design work was completed. The $46 million project was approved by the federal government in 2011 and began construction in 2013. It was dedicated on February 18, 2015, featuring new platforms, additional parking, bicycle amenities, and public art. Description Tukwila station consists of two side platforms on an embanked, triple-tracked segment of the BNSF Seattle Subdivision. The platforms have several covered shelters and are connected to ground level by stairs and ramps that lead towards a pedestrian underpass along Longacres Way at the north end of the station. The station's ticket vending machines, bike lockers, and bus bays are located in a plaza west of the platforms. The plaza also includes a piece of public art, Sheila Klein's sculpture and garden Imaginary Landscape, located at the station's ancillary building. It consists of planted red-twig dogwood shrubs, painted steel panels, and a steel \\"crown\\" atop the building. A 390-stall park and ride lot is located south of the plaza and includes four electric vehicle charging stations. The lot includes 40 parking spaces for Amtrak passengers, divided between short-term and long-term use, and reserved spaces for carpool vehicles, available for a monthly fee of $5. The station is accessed from the north via Longacres Way, connecting to Interstate 405 and the Southcenter Mall. The City of Tukwila has prepared the area around the station for transit-oriented development and plans to build a multi-use trail between Longacres Way and the Southcenter Mall. Southwest 27th Street travels south and east from the station to Boeing's Longacres Industrial Park, the Federal Reserve Bank, and offices for Kaiser Permanente. An undeveloped area north of the station was proposed in 2015 as the site of an indoor arena for a major- league basketball or hockey team. History =Early stations= The Puget Sound Shore Railroad, a branch of the Northern Pacific Railway, built the first railroad between Seattle and Tacoma in 1884, traveling through modern- day Tukwila on the current BNSF Seattle Subdivision. The railroad was sparsely used during its early years, earning the title \\"Orphan Road\\", but had several daily passenger trains stopping at Black River Junction (near Fort Dent) and Orillia (south of modern-day Tukwila station). An interurban railway, the Puget Sound Electric Railway, was built parallel to the Northern Pacific route in the Green River Valley in 1902. It connected Orillia to Tacoma and Seattle until it ceased operations in 1928. The tracks were removed and replaced in the 1980s by the Interurban Trail, a bicycle and pedestrian trail that runs from Tukwila to Pierce County. The Longacres horse racetrack was built in 1933 to the northeast of Orillia, adjacent to the Northern Pacific tracks and the modern-day Tukwila station. The racetrack site was targeted for redevelopment into offices by the City of Renton in the 1980s and acquired by the Boeing Company in 1990. Horse racing at Longacres ended in 1992 and construction of Boeing's Commercial Airplane Group headquarters began on the site in 1997. In 1991, Metro Transit recommended the Longacres redevelopment site as a station on a potential commuter rail line between Seattle and Tacoma. =Temporary commuter rail station= The interim platforms at Tukwila station, pictured from the tracks in 2008 The 1993 regional transit plan developed by the Regional Transit Authority (RTA; later Sound Transit) recommended Longacres as the transfer station between the north‚Äìsouth commuter rail line and a light rail line serving the Interstate 405 corridor. The RTA's March 1995 ballot measure included a Tukwila station for the Seattle‚ÄìTacoma commuter rail line, but was rejected by voters. A smaller version of the regional transit plan was re-submitted in November 1996 and approved by voters, allocating $13 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) in provisional funding for a commuter rail station at the Longacres site in Tukwila. The station would include two covered platforms, a bus station, bicycle lockers, and 800 to 1,000 parking spaces. The Tukwila station was also selected by Amtrak as a Cascades stop in January 1998, intended to serve all of southern King County as the lone stop between Seattle and Tacoma. Sound Transit selected the Longacres site as its preferred station location for Tukwila on March 12, 1998, and approved the purchase of from Boeing for the station in September. After receiving six design proposals for Tukwila station, Sound Transit selected MBT Architecture to lead the preliminary design team and later the final design team. Final design was suspended in early 1999 at the request of the Tukwila city council, who were seeking transit-oriented development proposals for the Longacres area from private developers. Construction of the full station was postponed in November 2000, and construction of an $587,000 interim station began immediately. The cost of the station was increased to $796,000 as a result of the rushed bidding and design process, which lasted five days and omitted a survey of underground utilities. The interim Tukwila station opened on March 12, 2001, built with wooden platforms, chain-link fencing, and 250 parking spaces in the former Longacres lot on lease from Boeing. Tukwila was the seventh Sounder station to open, and was initially expected to open in September 2001; the opening date was moved up to February to coincide with the opening of stations in Kent and Puyallup, but delayed to complete additional construction. Amtrak began Cascades service to Tukwila on June 1, 2001, after contributing $1 million for the temporary station's construction. Sound Transit signed an agreement in 2002 to delay design work on the permanent station for up to ten years while the City of Tukwila revised its development plans and the City of Renton completed design of the Strander Boulevard crossing to the south of the station. =Permanent station= Alternatives analysis and preliminary engineering work for the permanent station was authorized by the Sound Transit Board in 2005. The remaining funds from the 1996 ballot measure were used to complete design work and real estate acquisition, but construction would need to be funded separately. Construction of a permanent Tukwila station with up to 400 parking spaces was included in the Roads and Transit ballot measure, which was rejected by voters in November 2007. The permanent station was part of the standalone Sound Transit 2 measure, which was approved by voters in November 2008. Sound Transit completed 30 percent design and an environmental assessment of the project in January 2009, proposing a station with platforms south of Longacres Way, and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published a Finding of No Significant Impact in March. The south end of the new platforms would have conflicted with construction of the City of Renton's Strander Boulevard extension and delayed construction until late 2012; in response, Sound Transit moved the permanent station platforms north to the site of the temporary station and extended the final design phase of the project. The FTA and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approved the reevaluated design in 2011 and found no significantly different environmental impacts for the northern platforms. The $46 million project received $14.2 million in federal grants, including $4.6 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and $8 million from the FRA's High- Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program. Construction of the permanent station was pushed back into 2013 to allow for further design development. The $17 million construction contract was awarded to Absher Construction in April 2013, and a ceremonial groundbreaking was held on June 24, 2013. The west platform was demolished in August and replaced with a temporary platform to serve Sounder and Amtrak trains. In June 2014, the RapidRide F Line began serving the station's newly completed bus bays, replacing local service on routes 110 and 140 between Burien and Renton. The City of Renton completed its extension of Strander Boulevard to the station later in the month, connecting to the new park and ride on the west side of the platforms. Following a four- week closure of the east platform, both permanent platforms were re-opened in August 2014. Construction of the permanent station reached substantial completion in December, and the new station was dedicated by local dignitaries on February 18, 2015. The east platform was built with additional width to be removed for a third track, which was installed by BNSF in 2016. =Other proposals= Sound Transit has proposed building an intermodal connection at the station to the Link light rail system through a future extension. The Longacres site was considered in the Southcenter alternative for Central Link in 1999, but rejected in favor of a shorter route along Interstate 5. The agency's 2005 long-range plan studied a potential light rail line connecting Burien to Renton, with stops at Southcenter Mall and the Tukwila Sounder station. The 2014 update to the long-range plan re-studied the corridor as an extension to the proposed West Seattle light rail or bus rapid transit line, and also considered a connection to Sounder at Tukwila station. Tukwila station is also being studied as a potential stop for the state's proposed high-speed rail network. The station is included in plans for a Vancouver, B.C.‚ÄìSeattle‚ÄìPortland line along the Cascades corridor, as well as a Seattle‚ÄìSpokane line connecting to Eastern Washington. Services The station is served by 13 daily round-trips on Sounder, which travel north to King Street Station in Downtown Seattle and south to Tacoma Dome Station or Lakewood station on weekdays. Amtrak operates eight daily trains on the Cascades that stop at Tukwila on its route between Seattle and Portland, Oregon. Tukwila is the closest Amtrak station to Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. King County Metro operates two routes from the station's bus bays: the RapidRide F Line, which travels from Burien to Renton via Southcenter Mall; and Route 154, a peak-only service connecting the station to the Boeing Field industrial district.

Life He was a disciple and friend of Hermannus Contractus. When Hermannus saw death approaching, he entrusted to Berthold all the wax tablets that contained the writings which he had not yet committed to parchment and commissioned Berthold to peruse them and, after careful revision, to copy them on parchment. Berthold was also exhorted by his dying master to continue the chronicle, begun by Hermann, which in chronological order related the history of the world from the birth of Christ to 1054, the year in which Hermann died. Berthold's works comprise this chronicle and a biography of Hermannus. Bernold remarks in his chronicle under the year 1088 that Berthold, an excellent teacher who was very well versed in Holy Scripture, died at an advanced age on the 12th of March. Works The chronicle, as far as it was written by Berthold, is a concise and impartial history of the troublesome times immediately preceding the accession of Pope Gregory VII, and (probably) also of Gregory's early reign. It is reprinted to the year 1080, with an introduction by Pertz, in Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores V, 264-326, and in Patrologia Latina, CXLVII, 314-442. Pertz contends that Berthold did not begin the continuation of Hermann's chronicle until 1076, and that in the execution of it he made use of another chronicle, written by Bernold, who was also a monk at Reichenau; but it has been proved almost beyond doubt by Giesebrecht and Schulzen that Berthold was the first to continue Hermann's chronicle and that Bernold's chronicle is a continuation of Berthold's. It is, however, still undecided as to what year Berthold's chronicle extends. Ussermann and Schulzen hold that it extends only to the year 1066, while Pertz, Giesebrecht, and others believe that Berthold wrote the chronicle at least to the middle of the year 1080, where the manuscript suddenly ceases in the middle of a sentence. The original text of Berthold is no longer in existence and all the existing copies have been compiled from various manuscripts found in the monasteries of St. Gall, St. Blaise, Muri, and Engelberg. The chronicle was continued by Bernold to the year 1100, and by others to the year 1175. From various passages in Berthold's chronicle it appears that, for a short time at least, he considered Cadalus, Bishop of Parma, as the legitimate occupant of the papal throne; but from the year 1070, or even earlier, he acknowledged Pope Alexander II.

It is located in downtown Kent and consists of two train platforms connected via a pedestrian overpass, a parking garage, and several bus bays. The station also has 996 parking stalls and is served by King County Metro and Sound Transit Express buses. Train service to Kent began in 2001 and the station's garage opened the following year. King County Metro began service from the bus bays in 2005, after a third phase of construction. Sound Transit plans to build a second parking garage in 2023 to accommodate additional demand at the station. Description Kent station is located in the northern part of downtown Kent, one block west of Central Avenue at the intersection of Smith Street and Railroad Avenue. It is located adjacent to the Kent Station shopping center, which includes a movie theater and auxiliary campus for Green River College. To the northwest is the city-run ShoWare Center arena and the county's Maleng Regional Justice Center. The area around the station consists primarily of commercial and office spaces, with some multifamily residential buildings. The station consists of two side platforms that run between 1st Avenue to the west and Railroad Avenue to the east. The east platform includes a transit center with several bus bays arranged on a center island. To the southeast is a small plaza that leads to Burlington Green, a park along the railroad tracks between Smith and Meeker streets. Kent station has a total of 996 parking spaces, divided between a parking garage and two small surface lots. The five-story parking garage, located southwest along Smith Street, holds 877 vehicles and includes a pedestrian overpass connecting it to both of the platforms. An auxiliary park and ride lot on James Street holds an additional 713 vehicles. The garage and plaza also house Cornucopia by Lydia Aldredge, a public art installation commissioned by Sound Transit and the city government that consists of several sculptures referencing Kent's agricultural history. These pieces include glass tile mosaics resembling a river, a \\"garden of measurement\\" with weather station tools, several trellises, and a clock shaped like a train whistle. History =Predecessors and planning= The historic Northern Pacific Railway depot, located two blocks south of the modern Kent station Kent's first staffed train station was opened in October 1889 as part of the Puget Sound Shore Railroad, a subsidiary of the Northern Pacific Railway. The town was originally called Titusville but renamed itself after the English county of Kent, reflecting a shared dependence on the hops industry, after receiving the train station. Days after Kent's depot was opened, two would-be robbers were injured by the station agent using an iron poker. The depot was replaced in 1893 by a larger brick building, which was renovated extensively in 1927 and served passenger trains until the 1950s. It was used by the Burlington Northern Railroad (later BNSF Railway) as a maintenance shed and still stands two blocks south of the Sounder platforms. The city government proposed re-using the depot as a railroad museum or a downtown transit center in the 1980s, but neither were pursued. In the late 1980s, officials in King County proposed a modern commuter rail system running between King Street Station in Downtown Seattle and Auburn, including a single stop in Kent. The city government produced a shortlist of three sites for the commuter rail station: at James Street in downtown, near a Boeing facility north of downtown, or the disused Burlington Northern depot. Although the Burlington Northern depot was favored by the mayor, Metro Transit selected the downtown Kent site at James Street for inclusion in the 1993 regional transit plan, intended to serve as a framework for a future ballot measure. The city government began preparing for a major redevelopment of areas around the future station in hopes of revitalizing the downtown area. Ahead of a scheduled ballot measure to fund a regional transit system, including the Seattle‚ÄìTacoma commuter rail line, Kent was selected as a stop for a demonstration commuter rail service in February 1995. The temporary station, located between Meeker and Smith streets in downtown Kent, was served by daily trains to Tacoma and Seattle during peak periods and event trains for baseball and basketball games. The March 1995 ballot measure was rejected by voters, but a modified plan was approved in November 1996, including funds for a commuter rail system managed by Sound Transit. Sound Transit's environmental assessment for the Seattle‚ÄìTacoma commuter rail project identified two potential sites for the station in downtown Kent, approximately apart: a northern site between James and Smith streets, and a southern site between Gowe and Willis streets adjacent to the historic depot. The debate over the station's location took months to settle, with Sound Transit and the mayor favoring the northern site because of its proximity to two major arterial streets serving the city's suburban neighborhood and the Kent city council recommending the southern site to promote downtown commerce and avoid property acquisition. In June 1998, the Sound Transit board selected the northern site with a promise to design the station in a way that would minimize the amount of property to be acquired, replacing a surface parking lot with a parking garage that would be partially funded using $4 million in city-issued bonds. A Sounder train at Kent station The budget for Kent station was originally set at $12 million, but was increased to $25 million in July 1999 to accommodate the proposed 680-stall parking garage. The station and garage site was occupied by a feed mill and hardware store, which were relocated after settling a condemnation lawsuit with Sound Transit for $1.85 million the following month. Gary Merlino Construction was awarded a $3.66 million contract to construct the station, leaving the garage and bus station to be completed in later project phases. Groundbreaking on Kent station was celebrated on October 20, 1999. =Opening and expansion= Kent station was dedicated by Sound Transit and local officials on February 3, 2001, and service began two days later on February 5. 200 people rode trains from Kent on the opening day, which also marked the beginning of service from Puyallup station. The second phase of construction, including the $10 million parking garage, pedestrian bridge, and bus bays, began in 2000 and was completed three months ahead of schedule in March 2002. King County Metro opened a new transit center at Kent station's completed bus bays in June 2005, replacing a park and ride northwest of downtown on James Street. The city government opened the Kent Station shopping center and mixed-use development in late 2005, using $16 million to cleanup of a former resin chemical plant adjacent to the commuter rail station. The parking garage and surface lots at Kent station are used by 51 percent of the station's 1,900 daily riders and reach capacity early in the morning. The Sound Transit 2 plan, approved by voters in 2008, allocated $35 million for a second parking garage at Kent station, but planning was suspended in 2010 due to a decline in sales tax revenue. The project was revived in 2016 and expanded to also include pedestrian and bicycle improvements in the vicinity of the station. A shortlist of four sites for the 450-stall parking garage was drafted by Sound Transit and the city government in March 2017, including a proposal for Kaibara Park that was withdrawn after it was discovered that the property was owned by BNSF Railway and leased to the city. The remaining three sites were located to the north of the station along James Street at its railroad crossing. A site on the south side of James Street and east of Railroad Avenue was chosen by Sound Transit in November 2017 as the preferred site for the garage, following a recommendation from the city government. The parking garage is scheduled to begin construction in 2021 and open in 2023. The project originally had a budget of $35 million, but increased to $65 million after corrections based on similar garage projects at other Sounder stations as well as rising costs for real estate and contractors. The increase in costs, which reached $100,000 per parking stall, was criticized by the local Sierra Club, but defended by officials in Kent as a preventive measure against \\"hide-and-ride\\" parking by commuters in local neighborhoods. The proposed garage's construction would also require the realignment of Railroad Avenue, which the city government claims would jeopardize the planned expansion of bus service to the station. Services Kent station is served by 13 daily round-trips on Sounder, which travel north to King Street Station in Downtown Seattle and south to Tacoma Dome Station or Lakewood station on weekdays. Sounder trains travel from Kent to Seattle in approximately 27 minutes and to Tacoma in 35 minutes. The station is also a major transit hub for King County Metro and Sound Transit Express, with nine bus bays served by several routes. Sound Transit Express routes 566 and 567 travel from the station to Auburn station, Renton, Downtown Bellevue, and Overlake Transit Center during peak periods. King County Metro operates all- day service from the station to eastern Kent, Tukwila, Downtown Seattle, Renton, Auburn, Maple Valley, Federal Way, SeaTac, Burien. The agency also has peak-only service to Downtown Seattle via Interstate 5 and the Boeing Everett Factory. In additional to traditional bus service, Metro provides dial-a-ride service to eastern Kent and areas northwest of downtown Kent.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 27, 2008. After joining 4-H, Bart saves a cow named Lou and gives it to a girl named Mary (guest voice Zooey Deschanel), a farm girl. Her father, Cletus, mistakenly believes it as a token for Mary's hand in marriage, and attempts to get the two married. It was written by Jeff Westbrook and directed by Nancy Kruse. 7.69 million viewers tuned into this episode. Plot Bart and Lisa watch Saturday morning cartoons, starting with \\"Trans-Clown-O-Morphs\\". The show's main character is quickly placed in a life-threatening situation and pleads with the viewers to help him survive by buying the new Trans-Clown-O- Morphs cereal. Annoyed by the alleged commercial messages placed in every TV show the kids watch, Marge decides to get them away from the TV by having Lisa make banana bread and Bart goes to Shelbyville with Homer to have the beanbag chairs \\"rebeaned\\". While Bart and Homer drive to Shelbyville, they see Martin Prince driving a combine harvester. Bart asks why someone like Martin would be driving a tractor, and Martin informs him he has joined 4-H. Lured by the prospect of operating heavy machinery, Bart joins as well and quickly masters driving a tractor. Later, the 4-H volunteer introduces the members to a competition. Taking them to the calf pen, he informs them that they will each pick a calf and raise it over the summer, at the end of which the cattle will be judged at the county fair. Bart is stuck with the runt of the litter, and is unable to trade it away. He soon meets Mary, and she encourages Bart not to give up in the competition. Bart agrees, and they rename the young bull Lou (previously Lulubelle). Throughout the following weeks, Bart takes good care of Lou and helps him become stronger, while also bonding with him and growing to love him. When the day of the competition arrives, Lou has matured into a large bull and is awarded the blue ribbon. Bart is ecstatic until Lisa informs him that the next step is to send Lou to a slaughterhouse. Bart tries to convince Marge and Homer to buy the bull, but knowing by past experience how expensive it is to care for a large animal, they refuse. That night, Bart hears mooing as he lies in bed and believes it to be a hallucination caused by his inability to help Lou. He starts yelling in fear, and Lisa arrives and says it is simply his subconscious telling him to stop eating meat. However, the mooing is suddenly replaced by clucking noises, and Bart discovers that it was only a CD of Tress MacNeille's \\"Anguished Animals III,\\" placed by Lisa, in an attempt to turn him vegetarian. Nevertheless, Bart, Lisa, and Lisa's friends, \\"Compost\\" and \\"Solar Panel\\", go to the slaughterhouse in the middle of the night, determined to save Lou. They discover that Lou, who has been fed growth hormones, is now much bigger, so they use a forklift to pick him up and carry him away (though not without some trial and error). Hurrying from the slaughterhouse, they decide the only safe place they can take him is to Mary's home, which is on a farm. The next morning, they are shocked to discover that Cletus Spuckler is Mary's father. Bart gives the cow to Mary, and Mary agrees to take it. Cletus then yells for Brandine to come to the door. When Brandine learns that Bart offered Mary the cow, she informs them that the giving of a cow constitutes a formal proposal of arranged marriage. Against the wishes of both Bart and Mary, Cletus and Brandine plan the wedding for the next day; Lisa convinces Bart to go along with it long enough to let them figure out a way to save Lou, correctly suspecting that Cletus will not keep the bull if Bart refuses. Upon learning what has happened, Homer and Marge are shocked, and Marge devises a scheme to prevent it, but she also agrees to save Lou, knowing how Bart rarely cares about anyone or anything. The next day, Marge arrives to stop the wedding, prompting Cletus to send Lou to the slaughterhouse. However, the \\"Lou\\" Cletus sent was actually Homer in a cow mascot suit, while the real Lou is being sent to India to be treated like a god. They save Homer from the slaughterhouse after a close shave, after which Homer vows to cut back on his meat eating, and Bart reflects with pride that he can finally say that, \\"I had a cow, man.\\" Cultural references Trans- Clown-O-Morphs The episode's title is a reference to the film Apocalypse Now. \\"Trans-Clown-O-Morphs\\" is a parody of Transformers, complete with a cartoon opening reminiscent of actual 1980s cartoons. On the way to Shelbyville, Bart questions Homer's story about Dean Martin, as it does not match with his Wikipedia entry. Homer replies calmly, \\"Don't worry about Wikipedia, son. When we get back, we'll change it. We'll change a lot of things.\\" The scene in which Bart is driving the combine contains a theme song from The Comancheros. The training of Lou punching meat is similar to a scene in Rocky. Spider Pig makes an appearance in the episode, as a present at Bart and Mary's wedding. Lisa plays a \\"The Anguished Animals III' CD by Tress MacNeille, MacNeille voices several Simpsons characters. When Bart is combining, he goes over manure and creates DVD copies of Pirates of the Caribbean 3. The farming scenes music is from Aaron Copland's \\"The Red Pony (Copland) - Dream March\\". The music playing in the pre nuptial party is a yokel version of \\"Pachelbel's Canon\\", one of the most famous pieces of wedding music. Marge stops the wedding just like she does in \\"Little Big Girl\\". When Bart says goodbye to Lou at the airport, he used the same speech Rick said to Ilsa at the end of Casablanca; moreover, the music theme on this scene is \\"La Marseillaise\\". Mary's middle name is WrestleMania. Reception 7.7 million viewers tuned into this episode, higher than the previous three episodes. Richard Keller of TV Squad thought of the episode as another decent installment in the Simpsons like other Bart and Lisa centric episodes. He thought \\"it was unfortunate that these kinds of episodes couldn't have dispersed more evenly throughout the season\\", and that \\"episodes that center around Bart and Lisa tend to be more interesting...because those characters have more dimensions, and their diverse personalities and passions there is more to explore about them.\\" He also thought of \\"the idea of Bart being put into a nature-related environment was unnatural like putting Dustin Diamond in an Academy Award-nominated film.\\" Robert Canning of IGN also enjoyed the episode. Although he mentioned that the episode's plot had already been done numerous times, he enjoyed the unique way in which it was told and was surprised by some of the plot elements, such as Bart being forced to marry Mary. He gave the episode 7.5 out of 10. In a 2008 interview, Matt Groening named the episode his favorite of the series, citing the part with Homer in the slaughterhouse as the scene he liked best. Jeff Westbrook won a Writers Guild of America Award in the animation category for writing the episode. References  External links   * Apocalypse Cow script at Springfield! Springfield!

It is located southwest of downtown Auburn and consists of two train platforms, a bus station, a parking garage, a public plaza, and a pedestrian bridge. The station has 633 parking spaces and is also served by Sound Transit Express, King County Metro, and Pierce Transit buses. Auburn station opened in 2000 and was built on the site of a former railroad station that was demolished in 1979. The parking garage and pedestrian bridge opened in 2003, and a second parking garage is planned to be built by 2023. Description Auburn station is located at the intersection of Main Street and B Street in the southwestern part of downtown Auburn. The station's two side platforms run north‚Äìsouth along a triple-track segment of the BNSF Railway's Seattle Subdivision and are connected by an at-grade crossing on Main Street. Adjacent to the east platform are several bus bays and a public plaza, which includes seating areas, a clock tower, and public art. The station's canopies and clock tower were designed to match buildings on Auburn's Main Street using brick pillars, painted steel canopies, and glass rooftops. Since 2009, the plaza has also served as the venue for the city's farmers' market, which runs seasonally from June to September. The station has 633 parking spaces, including a parking garage with 520 spaces that is shared with the City of Auburn, and 113 surface stalls on the west side of the station. The six-story parking garage, located east of the platform and bus bays, also includes retail spaces and a pedestrian bridge that connects the two Sounder platforms. The station also has a drop-off area for 37 vehicles, 32 bicycle rack spaces, and 26 bicycle lockers. Sound Transit commissioned three pieces of art for the station through their public art program: Bruce West's sculptures Standing Pear & Friends and Strawberry Duo in the plaza represent the city's agricultural history through halved pears and strawberries; and a series of metal vines by Jean Whitesavage and Nick Lyle hang on the corner of the parking garage and personify \\"luxuriant growth\\". The City of Auburn also commissioned a separate art installation, Paul Sorey's Running Figures, which consist of eleven stainless steel figures between the station and the downtown core. History Auburn station's west platform, prior to the construction of a third track Auburn, initially named Slaughter, received its first staffed train station in October 1889 on the Puget Sound Shore Railroad, part of the Northern Pacific Railway. A large station was built in 1902, near the intersection of C Street and Main Street to the north of the current Sounder platforms. Auburn served as the Northern Pacific's main junction in the Puget Sound region, with trains diverting to either Seattle or Tacoma from Stampede Pass, and a large railyard was built in 1913 for freight operations south of downtown Auburn. The wooden station was nearly destroyed in 1969 by a fire that was started by a passing train's burning soot, creating a hole in the roof. Passenger service at Auburn station continued under Burlington Northern in 1970 and later Amtrak until May 1978, when the depot was vacated. Despite discussions with local business groups to preserve the building by moving it to another site, Burlington Northern demolished the depot in February 1979. Amtrak also stopped transcontinental trains at a separate East Auburn station until the Empire Builder was rerouted away from Stampede Pass in 1981. In the late 1980s, officials in King County proposed a modern commuter rail system running between King Street Station in Downtown Seattle and Auburn, where it would terminate near Ellingson Road south of downtown. Metro Transit, the countywide transit operator, began preliminary studies for the commuter rail system in 1987 and identified a site on West Main Street as a potential alternative to the Ellingson Road terminus. The 1993 regional transit plan published by Metro and other transit agencies proposed an extended version of the commuter rail line to Tacoma, with up to three stations in the city of Auburn. The Downtown Auburn site near Main Street was identified in 1994 as the city's preferred location for a commuter rail station, along with an alternative on the Union Pacific Railroad near the Supermall. The station was included in the rejected 1995 ballot measure and successful 1996 ballot measure that would fund a commuter rail system managed by Sound Transit. The location of Auburn station was approved by the Sound Transit Board in March 1998 and a design contract with Anil Verma Associates was signed in August. On August 12, 1999, Sound Transit broke ground on Auburn station, marking the beginning of Sounder commuter rail construction. Construction of the station was delayed for several months while Sound Transit negotiated a long-term track lease with BNSF Railway, causing Auburn station's cost to exceed its budget by $3.2 million. The station was opened on September 17, 2000, with a ceremonial inaugural ride to Seattle, and regular Sounder service began the following day. The parking garage and pedestrian bridge were opened in March 2003, as part of the second phase of station construction. The $30 million garage was designed with input and funding from the City of Auburn, who signed a 99-year lease on its retail spaces and several parking stalls that were later converted to paid commuter parking. In 2013, the Washington State Department of Transportation studied the feasibility of adding Auburn station to Amtrak Cascades, the region's intercity passenger train, to replace Tukwila station. The study concluded that Auburn would not be a desirable intercity rail stop and recommended against adding it to Cascades service. In 2017, part of the station's west platform was removed for the installation of a third track by BNSF Railway, as part of improvements to the rail corridor. In response to high demand at Auburn station's parking garage, where stalls are filled before late morning trains, a second garage was proposed as part of transit ballot measures in 2007 and 2008. The 2008 measure was passed by voters and allocated $30 million for a new garage, but the project was deferred in 2010 due to a decline in sales tax revenue collected by Sound Transit. Funding for the project was restored in early 2016, along with funding for pedestrian and bicycle improvements in downtown Auburn. In late 2017, Sound Transit and the City of Auburn selected a former lumber store two blocks west of city hall as the preferred location for the parking garage. The 500-stall garage and other improvements are expected to cost $60 million and be constructed between 2021 and 2023. Services Bus bays at Auburn station Auburn station is served by 13 daily round-trips on Sounder, which travel north to King Street Station in Downtown Seattle and south to Tacoma Dome Station or Lakewood station on weekdays. Sounder trains travel from Auburn to Seattle in approximately 35 minutes and to Tacoma in 28 minutes. The station is also a major transit hub for South King County and has six bus bays that are served by Sound Transit Express, King County Metro, and Pierce Transit. Sound Transit Express route 566 begins in Auburn and travels north on State Route 167 to Kent station, Renton, Bellevue Transit Center, and Overlake Transit Center; Auburn is an intermediate stop for route 578, which connects Puyallup station to Downtown Seattle, via Sumner station and Federal Way Transit Center. King County Metro's routes 180, 181, and 186 connect the station to Green River College, Enumclaw, Federal Way, Kent, and Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport. King County Metro also runs several dial-a-ride routes from the station to Algona, Pacific, Enumclaw, northern Auburn, and The Outlet Collection Seattle (formerly the Supermall). Pierce Transit's Route 497 is a shuttle between the station and a park and ride in the Lakeland Hills neighborhood, with timed connections to Sounder trains. During horse racing season at Emerald Downs, Sound Transit also operates the Pony Express shuttle from Auburn station.

Myer Lyon (b. circa 1750, Germany; d. 1797, Kingston, Jamaica), better known by his stage name Michael Leoni, was a hazzan at the Great Synagogue of London who achieved fame as a tenor opera singer in London and Dublin, and as the mentor of the singer John Braham. Origins and early career Myer Lyon was appointed meshorrer (choirboy) to Isaac Polack, hazzan at the Great Synagogue, London, in 1767 'at a salary of ¬£40 per annum, on the understanding that he was to behave as a Yehudi Kasher (i.e. an observant Jew)'.Roth (1950), 144 Lyon's origins remain unclear. According to the memoirs of the actor James de Castro he was born in Frankfurt-on-Main and was invited to London by 'the German Jews', where 'a very rich Jew, Mr. Franks, instantly patronised him'. His voice having been brought to the attention of the aristocracy and the actor David Garrick, he was given permission by the synagogue elders to appear on stage (where he adopted the name Michael Leoni), after which he returned to the synagogue and developed thenceforth a dual career.De Castro (1824), 9‚Äì10 It is difficult, however, to reconcile this narrative with his known dates. The first record of him is in October 1760 where Garrick refers to him as 'ye boy Leoni' ‚Äì he sang a role in Garrick's The Enchanter at Drury Lane Theatre which was 'received with great applause'.Highfield et al. (1970), Leoni, Michael This suggests that Leoni could not yet have been in his teens at this time, and that therefore the story of his being summoned to London cannot be true. In fact it would be surprising if it were true since there is no evidence that the congregation there had any concerns about musical standards.Conway (2011), 75‚Äì6. The fact that the synagogue was only too happy to dock Leoni's pay by ¬£8 a year in 1772, due to its financial problems, also argues against the congregation's supposed dedication to its cantor. It is therefore rather more likely that, wherever he was born, he lived in London from an early age and was talent- spotted, perhaps by Polack, in the synagogue (much as Leoni was later to train his own nephew, John Braham).For a discussion of Leoni's relationship with Braham, see Conway (2007), 38‚Äì39, Conway (2011), 78‚Äì82. Major roles As Don Carlos in The Duenna, circa 1775 Leoni's twin-tracking in the synagogue and the theatre continued for some while. Between 1770 and 1782 he appeared quite frequently on the stage in London, where he scored great successes in Thomas Arne's Artaxerxes (1775) and, in the same year, as Carlos in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The Duenna at the Covent Garden Theatre. The Morning Chronicle commented in its notice of The Duenna that 'it can never be performed on a Friday, on account of Leoni's engagement with the Synagogue',Morning Chronicle, 25 November 1775 an indication of how crucial Leoni was to the piece's success. Leoni's version of Yigdal Myer Lyon's version of the Yigdal hymn Leoni also developed admirers amongst Non-conformist Christians. His reputation encouraged a number of Gentiles, including in 1770 the Methodist Thomas Olivers, to come to the Great Synagogue on Friday nights to hear him. Olivers was so impressed by Leoni's moving rendition of the hymn Yigdal that he determined to write words for a church hymn using the melody. The result was the hymn The God of Abraham Praise, which has had great popularity ever since. In the standard Church of England hymnal, Hymns Ancient and Modern, the tune of The God of Abraham Praise is still titled Leoni, after its source.Conway (2011), 76‚Äì7 Society singer Leoni's fame and talents turned out to be valuable in social terms to his congregation. Its wealthier members had taken to purchasing estates on the outskirts of London where they could live fashionable lives and hold soir√©es to which polite society could be invited. Integral to these was the quality of the entertainments provided, and Leoni was a star of appropriate calibre. In November 1774 he sang at the house in Isleworth of Aaron Franks, who was married to the daughter of another Jewish magnate, Moses Hart. The writer Horace Walpole was in the audience and gave a description which confirms the unusual qualities of Leoni's voice: > I was at a very fine concert at old Franks at Isleworth, and heard Leoni, > who pleased me more than anything I have heard these hundred years. There is > a full melancholy melody in his voice, though a falsetto, that nothing but a > natural voice almost ever compasses. Then he sang songs of Handel in a > genuine simple style, and did not put one in pain like the rope- > dancers.Lewis (1938‚Äì83), vol. 35 p. 350, letter of 11 November 1774 to Lord > Strafford. Opera promoter Eventually in 1783 Leoni's success and his limited remuneration at the synagogue led him to change his career and chance his arm as an opera promoter as well as a performer. A rumour spread that Leoni was eventually dismissed by the synagogue for performing in Handel's Messiah, but the rumour remains unsubstantiated.However Katanka (2013) accepts this as fact. He chose for his venture Dublin, where he had appeared in 1781. Leoni's 1783 season, undertaken jointly with the composer Giordani, proved, however, to be an utter disaster, and some newspaper reviews remarked on the fading of his voice, although he can only have been in his mid-thirties at the most.Hyman (1972), 85; Walsh (1973) 231-7 Decline and emigration Perhaps by this time audiences were beginning to tire of the unusual timbre which had first brought him popularity. From the financial consequences of this season Leoni never fully recovered. He appeared in 1787 in a benefit performance at Covent Garden Theatre (which was also the first stage appearance of John Braham), and had his last London benefit in 1788. After this he sailed to Jamaica to become hazzan to the Jewish community in Kingston, where he died in 1797. He is buried at the old Jewish cemetery in Elletson Road, Kingston. Reputation Clearly, however, his voice left a strong imprint amongst English music lovers. The satirist John Wilkins, in the year of Leoni's death, wrote: 'Neglected, appall‚Äôd, sickly poor and decay‚Äôd See LEONI retiring in life‚Äôs humble shade. ‚ÄòTis but few little years since the charm of his voice Made theatres echo and thousands rejoice'.Williams (1797), cited in Conway (2011), p. 78 Notes References *Conway, David John Braham ‚Äì from meshorrer to tenor, Jewish Historical Studies vol. 41, London 2007, pp. 37‚Äì62 *Conway, David Jewry in Music ‚Äì Entry to the Profession from the Enlightenment to Richard Wagner, Cambridge 2011. *Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians Leoni, Michael. *De Castro, James The Memoirs of J.

It is served by the Sounder South Line, a commuter rail line operated by Sound Transit. The station is located to the southwest of downtown Sumner and includes two platforms, a bus station, and 302 parking spaces. Commuter train service to Sumner began in September 2000 at a temporary station, while the permanent facility opened on March 10, 2001. Parking at the station is expected to expand to over 600 stalls in 2021, after the completion of a new parking garage and pedestrian bridge. Description Sumner station is located southwest of downtown Sumner along Narrow and Traffic streets between Maple and Academy streets. It consists of two side platforms along a dual- track segment of the Seattle Subdivision, owned by BNSF Railway. The two platforms measure in length and are connected by an level crossing along Maple Street on the north side of the station. The platforms have three canopies that resemble hop kilns, reflecting Sumner's agricultural history, and act as waiting rooms for passengers. The east platform also has a clocktower, public restrooms, and several bus bays that serve Sound Transit Express buses. The north end of each platform is home to \\"Shadow Caster\\", a piece of public art by Ellen Sollod that uses a trellis-like structure with inlaid patterns to cast shadows resembling hops vines onto the sidewalk. Sumner station has 302 parking spaces in two lots, two bicycle racks with ten spaces, and seven bicycle lockers with a capacity of 14 bicycles. The main parking lots are located on Narrow Street south of the station and between Main and Maple streets on the west side of the tracks. An overflow lot at a former Red Apple grocery store is located three blocks east of the station on Academy Street, requiring a paid reservation during weekdays. The park-and-ride serves residents of Sumner, Puyallup, Bonney Lake, and other nearby communities. History Sumner mayor George Ryan built the city's first train station in 1883, shortly after the completion of the Puget Sound Shore Railroad, a branch of the Northern Pacific Railway between Tacoma and Seattle. Sumner's train depot, located near the site of the current Sounder station, was replaced several times and demolished in 1976. Proposals for a modern commuter rail system between Seattle and Tacoma date back to the 1980s and included a potential stop in Sumner using either the Burlington Northern (later BNSF) or Union Pacific railroads. The 1993 regional transit plan developed by the Regional Transit Authority (RTA; later Sound Transit) recommended a commuter rail station in Sumner, which carried over into the RTA's failed 1995 ballot measure. During development of the 1995 plan, a joint Puyallup‚ÄìSumner station with a large park-and-ride facility was proposed and later rejected in favor of separate downtown stations. The commuter rail system was approved by voters in 1996 and the project moved into engineering and design under Sound Transit. The passenger waiting shelter at Sumner station, shaped like a hop kiln A block-long section of Narrow Street south of Maple Street, home to the city's maintenance shops, was proposed as the site for the commuter rail station in 1997. The Narrow Street site was formally adopted as the preferred alternative in early 1998 and a contract to design the station was awarded to Tacoma-based architecture firm Merritt Pardini. The station's depot, reflecting the area's historical hops industry, was originally slated to be scaled back due to rising project costs, but protests from Sumner residents prompted Sound Transit to fund its construction separately. Design work on the station was completed in July 1999 and the $3.9 million construction contract was awarded to Lumpkin General Contractor in September. Construction of Sumner station began on October 5, 1999, with a ceremonial groundbreaking attended by local officials and community members. The city's maintenance shops and recycling center were moved to new facilities to make way for the station's park and ride lots. The platforms were graded in July 2000 and a temporary station opened for Sounder service on September 18, 2000. Sumner station officially opened on March 10, 2001, coinciding with the introduction of Sound Transit Express routes to the city. Parking demands at the station spurred the creation of a restricted parking zone on nearby streets, as the park and ride lot filled quickly in the mornings by 2006. In its 2005 long-range plan, Sound Transit considered two proposals to alleviate demand at the station: construction of a parking garage at the current station, or construction of an auxiliary station on city-owned land to the north of downtown Sumner. The parking garage was favored by the Sumner city council, but councilmembers disagreed on whether to site it adjacent to the station or elsewhere in Sumner or Bonney Lake. The garage project and a provisional station in North Sumner (to be funded with an outside party) were included in the Roads and Transit ballot measure in 2007, which combined transit projects with road improvements. The ballot measure was rejected by voters and a revised, transit-only plan known as Sound Transit 2 was passed the following year. Sound Transit 2 dropped the provisional North Sumner station and allocated $40 million to the garage project. The 400-stall parking garage on the south side of the station was approved in 2014 alongside improvements to nearby sidewalks and a pedestrian overpass connecting the two platforms. The garage's four- story height and its effects on Sumner's historic downtown generated concerns from the city council, who also requested 623 parking stalls (a net increase of 505 stalls) before endorsing the project in 2016. The garage and pedestrian overpass are scheduled to begin construction in 2019 and open by 2021, costing $52 million. Services Sumner station is served by 13 daily round-trips on Sounder, which travel north to King Street Station in Downtown Seattle and south to Tacoma Dome Station or Lakewood station on weekdays. Two Sound Transit Express bus routes also stop at the station: Route 578, with all-day connections to Puyallup station, Auburn station, Federal Way Transit Center, and Downtown Seattle; and Route 596, a peak-only shuttle to Bonney Lake's park and ride. The station was served by local Pierce Transit service until Sumner withdrew from the district in 2012, in part due to declining service. Pierce County operates a separate dial-a-ride service between Sumner station, downtown Sumner, and Bonney Lake on weekdays.

Maxwell (1860 ‚Äì August 23, 1909), known as Gunplay Maxwell, was a late 19th-century Old West gunfighter and businessman from Boston, Massachusetts. Early life Born the son of a hotel manager, Maxwell was often involved in fights even in his youth. He received a good education, but in 1875 he was involved in a bar room brawl that resulted in his shooting and killing a friend of his. Maxwell fled to Texas, and later Montana, to avoid being arrested for the murder. While in Montana and working as a cowboy, Maxwell began selling his gunman skills during the cattle-sheep wars. Old West He later became involved in cattle rustling in Wyoming and Utah, resulting in his being arrested and sentenced to three years in the Wyoming State Prison in 1893. While in prison, he became associated with Butch Cassidy, and the two were released within a week of one another. It was later said that he attempted to join Cassidy's gang, but was rejected. As to whether this is true or rumor is not confirmed. In any event, he formed his own gang, but it did not last and by 1898 he was riding alone again. That year Maxwell and another man robbed the Springville, Utah bank, taking $3,000. More than one hundred posse members pursued them, killing Maxwell's partner, and capturing Maxwell after a brief shootout. He was taken to the Provo, Utah jail, but never revealed the identity of his partner, despite the latter being dead. Most of the money was recovered, either in the possession of the two robbers, or hidden near where the posse caught up to them. Maxwell was convicted of robbery, and he was sent to the Utah State Prison. Five years later, after he helped to stop a prison escape, his sentence was commuted. While working as a mine guard, Maxwell discovered ozokerite near Colton, Utah, and filed a claim, then started the mining company \\"Utah Ozokerite Company\\". The mine soon became the largest known ozokerite mine in the world, and Maxwell opened it to the public. Despite the success of his business venture, Maxwell for unknown reasons moved on, although it is believed he retained ownership of the mine. He surfaced in Goldfield, Nevada, where he worked for mining companies by spying on striking miners. Also while there, he killed a man named Joseph Smith during a dispute, but was not prosecuted. In 1907 he was involved in another gunfight in Utah, with a man named L. C. Reigle. Both were wounded, but neither was killed. Maxwell was initially arrested, but again was not prosecuted. Later that year, in San Francisco, California, Maxwell married wealthy widow Bessie Hume, with whom he eventually moved to Ogden, Utah. However, by June 1908, Maxwell was again on the move, and while in the company of William M. Walters he robbed a Wells Fargo in Rawhide, Nevada. Both were captured, and released on bail, and were never brought to trial. On August 23, 1909, Maxwell confronted Deputy Sheriff Edward Black Johnstone in Price, Utah, who had been tasked to stop a possible robbery that Maxwell had been planning. Maxwell also, allegedly, held a grudge against Johnstone due to the deputy having previously identified Maxwell as being a \\"bad man\\" and an ex-convict to the sheriff of Goldfield, Nevada. Maxwell confronted Johnstone in the Price Saloon, and informed him that he intended to kill him. The dispute moved them out into the street, where Maxwell drew his pistol and opened fire, but missed. Johnstone returned fire, hitting Maxwell in the elbow and the chest, knocking Maxwell to the ground. Maxwell attempted to fire yet again, but Johnstone fired a third shot, hitting Maxwell in the lung. Maxwell reportedly then said \\"Don't shoot again Johnstone, you have killed me.\\" Maxwell died shortly thereafter. When his body was prepared for burial, it was discovered that his arms were covered with track marks, and opium was found in his pocket, giving rise to the suspicion that he had become a drug addict. He was, at the time, going under the name William H. Seaman, and was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery, and his grave is today unmarked, making its location not certain.

Life He made his course in the humanities at Aschaffenburg, W√ºrzburg, and Bamberg, and in 1690 entered the University of Salzburg, conducted by the Benedictines, where he specialized in philosophy, also attending lectures on theology and jurisprudence. He entered the Benedictine Order at G√∂ttweig on the Danube, Lower Austria, 15 June 1692. After making his vows (21 June 1693), he completed his theological course at Vienna, was ordained (21 March 1696), and on 23 May was granted the degree of Doctor of Theology, being shortly afterwards appointed Lector in philosophy and theology in the monastery of Seligenstadt on the River Main. In 1699 he was summoned to the electoral court of Mainz by Archbishop Lothar Franz von Schonborn, who immediately sent him to Rome to study the curial practice of the Rota Romana. Having completed a two years' course in law, he obtained the degree of Doctor Juris Utriusque, and on his return to Mainz (1703) he was appointed vicar general and supreme judge of the ecclesiastical court of the archdiocese of Mainz. He was also employed on various diplomatic missions, as, for instance, to the court of Brunswick- Wolfenb√ºttel in connection with the conversion of Duke Anton Ulrich and his granddaughter, the Princess Elisabeth Christine, later the wife of Emperor Charles VI. He made three journeys to Rome to settle differences between the pope and the emperor concerning the limits of the province of Commacchio. On 7 February 1714, he was elected Abbot of G√∂ttweig, and from that time forward was commissioned by the emperor to conduct diplomatic negotiations, in addition to being made imperial theologian and serving twice as honorary rector of the University of Vienna. Abbot Bessel was the second founder of G√∂ttweig, which became, under his rule of thirty-five years, a centre of learning. He added to the rare Hebrew, Greek, and Roman coins and bracteates collections of copper-plate engravings (over 20,000), minerals, shells, and paintings. By the expenditure of princely sums he enriched the library with thousands of volumes, chiefly on historical subjects, as well as incunabula and MSS. Himself a thorough scholar, he encouraged among his religious all undertakings of a scientific or artistic nature. When the abbey was almost totally destroyed by fire, he gathered, by judicious management, means sufficient to rebuild it on a more splendid scale. Personally, Abbot Bessel was a retiring religious, presenting to all a shining example of monastic piety and virtue. Chronicon Gotwicense (1732), title page Works Besides several comparatively unimportant works, such as \\"Mararita pretiosa\\", \\"Curiae Romanae praxis\\", and \\"Austriae ritus\\", he published (Vienna, 1732) two letters of Augustine of Hippo to Optatus, Bishop of Mileve, which had been until then unknown. He is erroneously credited with the authorship of \\"Quinquaginta Romano-catholicam fidem omnibus aliis praeferendi motiva\\" (Mainz, 1708), a controversial work written originally in Latin, but translated into almost every European tongue. The work which brought him lasting renown and a place in the records of the science of history is entitled Chronicon Gottwicense, tomus prodromus (Tegernsee, 1732). Not, as might be thought, a history of the abbey, this single volume is a comprehensive work on German diplomatics, treating of manuscripts found in registers and archives, original documentary evidence, diplomas of German emperors and kings, and inscriptions and seals, illustrated with maps and engravings on copper. The author also discusses medieval geography, as well as the royal palace-domains (Pfalzen) and the various districts of Germany. Great learning and clear critical acumen distinguish this work, which marked an epoch in the history of German diplomatics, and has served as the basis of all later works on the same subject.

After a major illness in 1954, he redirected his energies from Vatican clergy to the concerns of lay people. Pope Pius XII and appointments =Roman Curia= In the last years of his pontificate, while open to all the faithful and visitors to Rome, Pius was viewed as limiting contacts with Vatican clergy and representatives of the Roman Curia. Pope Pius procrastinated personnel decisions, but also found it increasingly difficult to chastise subordinates and appointees. Domenico Tardini provides an insight: Pope Pius received a monsignor whose work performance left much to be desired. Upon leaving the Papal rooms, Tardini asked the monsignor how it went. \\"The Holy Father is so happy with my work.\\" Tardini interrupted him, \\"But the Holy Father told me ‚Ä¶.\\" \\"Yes\\" was the answer, \\"he told me that too, but he is happy with me overall.\\"Tardini 145 He attempted to avoid unnecessary contacts with the clergy, because of their constant demands for recognition and positions. * \\"Today I will receive a group of priests. Who knows, how many requests they will have.‚Äù I told him, \\"Your Holiness, just say no.\\" ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù, said the Pope, ‚ÄùI say no, but then they press and press and press.‚Äù A sign of resignation followed.Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960, p 155 During the last years of the pontificate, vacant Vatican positions were not always filled. ‚ÄùThe Roman Curia experienced certain stagnation.‚ÄùTardini, 73 In his last years, it was difficult for Pius to make decisions regarding the promotion of Curia priests.Schneider 96 Domenico Tardini gave a significant insight, Pius' huge concern about appointments. * The higher the honour was to be, the more difficult and more desired were the positions. It is well known, that for such occasions there is no shortage of candidates, even applicants, including those who claim to have capacities which they are not always in possession of. They measure their value by the extent of their aspirations, calling on ‚Äúrights‚Äù, which simply do not exist. It may even happen that such non-virtuous aspirations find cover and support in lavish red silk coats of some Cardinals. Pius suffered under all this, being subjected to contrary proposals and recommendations. His inclination to fulfill wishes and agree spontaneously and his conscientiousness contradicted within him. Thus, the Pope did not like to make personnel changes and preferred to procrastinate. The seeming inability to talk to appointees about their performance, extended also to his one-time physician, Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi. He was finally dismissed by the Pope in 1956, but gained admittance October 1958 as the Pope lay dying and took photographs of Pius which he sold to Paris Match, forcing him to resign as chief physician of the Vatican (\\"pontifical archiater\\") in the wake of massive public protests. When Pius died, Galeazzi-Lisi assumed the role of Pius' embalmer, using controversial methods.Paul Hoffmann. (2002). The Vatican's Women. St. Martin's Press. . p. 44. The pastoral needs of the Church were not affected by his procrastination on Vatican positions. New bishops were appointed whenever necessary. The Pacelli-Pope favoured naming unconventional, often very young priests, such as Julius D√∂pfner (35 years) and Karol Wojtyla (38 years), one of his last appointees in 1958. =Stories and rumours= Robert Leiber reports that during the life of Pope Pius XII, fabrications were published about his personal life such as his allegedly austere life, sleeping on a bare iron bed and being attended to by four German Capuchin monks at six a.m. every morning with a single cup of black coffee.Leiber, 49 Madre Pascalina Lehnert took care of the Papal household from 1939-1958 together with several Swiss nuns from Obermenzingen Horror stories continued after the death of Pius XII, many originating in Cornwell‚Äôs Hitler‚Äôs Pope published in 1999, such as the allegation that the papal nose was falling off, and collapsing Vatican guards.See Hitler's Pope, p. 358. Cornwell‚Äôs statements have been copied without referencing by several of the below mentioned sources: ‚ÄúPius suffered from gastritis brought on by kidney dysfunctions. Galeazzi-Lisi, with the aid of a Swiss colleague, prescribed injections made from the glands of fetal lambs that gave Pius chronic hiccups and rotting teeth (Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession, ) Papal Preservation . Steven Palmer. YB News. June 2005.When Pius died, Galeazzi-Lisi assumed the role of Pius' embalmer. Rather than slow the process of decay, the doctor-mortician's self-made technique (aromatizzazione), which involved encasing Pius in a cellophane bag with herbs and spices, sped it up, causing the Holy Father's corpse to disintegrate rapidly, turning purple. At one point, the body's nose fell off. It is reported that while transporting the pope's body from Castel Gandolfo to the Vatican, pressure within the coffin due to gases given off by decay blew off the seals. This caused considerable embarrassment to the Vatican and one of the first acts of Pius' successor, Pope John XXIII, was to ban and excommunicate the embalmer from Vatican City for life.(Guide to Age). Alexander Chancellor. The Guardian. April 16, 2005. The Italian Medical Council expelled Galeazzi-Lisi for \\"infamous conduct\\", but the High Court of the Italian Central Health Commission reversed the decision.(The Pope's Doctor . Alan McElwain. Annals Australia. July 1989). =Worker-priests= Controversy caused the Vatican position on French worker-priests. In 1941, worker-priest Dominican Father Jacques Loew began a new priestly mission by working as a priest in the docks at Marseilles, France.Felix Corley Fr. Jacques Loew: Spawned the Worker-Priest Movement, The Times, February 27, 1999 Many followed him. Originally, a dedicated idealistic group, they soon split, some of them joined political parties and unions, others left the priesthood altogether. Conflicts with the Vatican developed after some worker-priests advocated a close association between Marxism and Catholicism, as American sympathizer Dorothy Day freely admitted.Dorothy Day, French Worker Priests and the Little Brothers of de Foucauld\\" The Catholic Worker, March 1954, 2,4 Some like Jacques Loew were able to combine personal piety and spirituality with a full engagement in factory work. The French bishops were divided.Schneider, p. 78 The Vatican was divided too, with Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini, later Pope Paul VI, allegedly in favour. Against considerable opposition of French bishops, Pope Pius decided to stop the experiment. Priests were to work in rectories not in factories. Allowed to work for three hours factory work, they were prohibited from joining unions and had to live in rectories or religious communities. Pope John XXIII continued and even sharpened the decision of his predecessor in 1959 by withdrawing the three-hour work permit completely.Time Magazine, November 6, 1965 To Pius, a clear separation of priestly duties and the role of lay people was essential. This position mirrored his earlier insistence that Catholic priests should not be in politics. Loew bowed to the Vatican, and in 1971 Pope Paul VI invited him to preach the Lenten retreat in the Vatican. Earlier in 1965, he attempted to resurrect the French worker-priest experiment but without much success. =Theologians= Theologians began to create problems from both ends of the philosophical spectrum. On the ultra-conservative end was American Jesuit Leonard Feeney, who taught that Protestants and other non-Catholics are on their way to hell, because extra ecclesiam nulla salus: there is no salvation outside of the Church. This old teaching was undergoing development. Feeney overlooked that aspect and was not only silenced, he was excommunicated under Pope Pius XII for his outdated interpretation of Catholic doctrine. In Europe, Catholic theology tried to go different roads, which did not all lead to Rome. History was rediscovered, including the history of dogma, opening the door to theological relativism. The Cardinal of Paris, Suhard, questioned whether the historically conditioned theological language of Thomas Aquinas is really the only permitted form of expressing one truth.HK137 Pope Pius XII, first in 1950 in Humani generis, warned against adopting of philosophies which today are modern, tomorrow hopelessly old-fashioned. Defending traditional Thomism, Pope Pius asked for its reform and further improvement rather than rejection, which would lead to positivism and relativism in theology. In the following years, the Sacred Congregation began to review critical theologians, issuing condemnations or threats of condemnation, which generated within the Church a sense of narrowness and distrust.Schneider, 84 Mainly French and German theologians were affected. Theologians like Henri de Lubac, Yves Congar and Karl Rahner were reprimanded or temporarily silenced. Pius was not personally involved in this development, and may have tried to change course; in his last speech to honour Pope Benedict XIV, to be delivered to the Roman Curia in October 1958, he was to announce a revision of the review processes of the Church, increasing the rights of individuals and protecting them from secret investigations.Schneider, 84-85 Several years later, this reform was carried out by his successors. Pope Pius XII and lay people =Encouragement of lay people= In his last years, Pope Pius devoted most of his energies to meetings with lay people and addressed their problems in an unprecedented range of topics to large and small organizations, in which he confronted the big questions of the time in light of their specific concerns or orientation. This was based on his theology of the Mystical Body of Christ,explained in the encyclical Mystici corporis Christi \\"Lay people not only belong to the Church, they are the Church.\\"AAS 1946, 141 \\"Therefore they must turn the world from a wilderness to a humanistic and from a humanistic to a divine world, reflecting the Heart of God.\\"Tardini 72 * The roots of today‚Äôs problem are not bad intentions but laxness of spirit, limpness of will, and coldness of heart: the tiredness of all the good people. Following the encyclical,Mystici corporis the call to all Christians is theologically based on their guidance through the Holy Spirit and their participation in the redemptive works of Jesus Christ. The Church can only be effective in a modern society if lay people from their position actively participate at all levels: parish, community, society and international relations World Congress of Lay Apostolate, AAS 1951, 784;Letter to Monsignor Cardijn JOC, AAS 1949, 324;World Congress of Lay Apostolate AAS 1957, 933, Lay Apostolate in Uganda, AAS 1954, 35 Pope Pius XII spoke to members of scientific congresses, explaining Christian teachings in light of most recent scientific results. Sometimes he answered specific moral questions which were addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of Church teachings.

The worldwide monthly prayer requests of Pope Pius XII allowed lay people to participate in the pastoral concerns of the Holy Father through the Apostleship of Prayer. These prayers reflected his real concerns and created a universal prayerful community. They reflected again Mystici corporis that all Catholics are true and full members of the Church.AAS 1952, 830 ff A fervent call to heroic life was promulgated to the Sodalities of Mary, whose vows included such efforts towards the perfect Christian life.AAS 1954, 529 ff Pope Pius XII wanted the life of priests to be a mirror of Christ‚Äôs love.

Instead, the priest must communicate Jesus Christ as living reality and enunciate clear goals of sanctity.AAS 1954 232 He explained his high appreciation of voluntary virginity for the sake of Christ in terms of apostolic zeal and contemplative prayer. =Sources= * Acta Apostolicae Sedis.

It is served by the Sounder South Line, a commuter rail line operated by Sound Transit that runs from Pierce County to Seattle. The station is located northwest of downtown Puyallup and includes two platforms, several bus bays, and 640 parking spaces. Puyallup station opened on February 5, 2001, on the site of the city's original train depot, which was built in 1877 and demolished in 1974. Sound Transit plans to expand the station's park and ride by building a new parking garage in 2021. In addition to train service, the station is also served by Sound Transit Express and Pierce Transit buses that connect Puyallup to nearby cities. Description Puyallup station is located on the north side of Main Avenue in downtown Puyallup, between 5th Street and Meridian Street. It consists of two side platforms on the north and south sides of the two railroad tracks, along with several platform shelters that are shared with four bus bays, primarily on the north side, and a drop-off area. The station has three primary park and ride lots to the north, south, and west of the platforms with a capacity of 364 vehicles. Additional park and ride spaces are available at two lots in downtown Puyallup that are leased by Sound Transit, bringing total parking capacity to 640 stalls. Puyallup station also has five bicycle racks and 20 bicycle lockers located on the platform. The station is connected to downtown Puyallup via two walkways along the tracks that run west to 5th Street and east to Meridian Avenue. Its shelters were designed to resemble Puyallup's historic train depot and incorporate elements of the Craftsman architectural style. Sound Transit commissioned one piece of public art for Puyallup station, Speed the Plow by Gloria Bornstein, which consists of seven decorative arches that reference Puyallup's geologic and agricultural history with depictions of farming tools. History Passengers disembarking from a Sounder train at Puyallup station Puyallup's first train station was built in 1877 for the Northern Pacific Railway, shortly after the town was platted by founder Ezra Meeker. The original depot buildings were replaced in 1930 by a new facility, shortly before the cancellation of passenger service to downtown Puyallup. The Northern Pacific depot was abandoned in the 1960s and finally dismantled in October 1974 after being bought by a railroad worker. Puyallup was chosen a potential commuter rail stop during early studies into a Seattle‚ÄìTacoma line in the late 1980s. The 1993 regional transit plan published by the region's transit agencies proposed Puyallup as a commuter rail stop, deferring to the local government to choose a final site for the station. The city developed a shortlist of seven locations for the station in early 1994, along both the Union Pacific and BNSF railroads, and began a series of public hearings to determine which to endorse. Business leaders voiced their support for a downtown station along the BNSF route, as part of a larger revitalization of the city's downtown, and a mail survey of residents voted in favor of a downtown station at Stewart Avenue and 3rd Street, followed by a station in eastern Puyallup at Shaw Road. In October 1994, the Puyallup city council endorsed the downtown site as its preferred location for a commuter rail station on the BNSF route. The commuter rail system was part of the rejected 1995 ballot measure and successful 1996 transit plan that funded a regional system managed by Sound Transit. The Downtown Puyallup site was chosen by Sound Transit in early 1998 and a $688,000 contract was awarded to Merritt + Pardini Architects to design the station. The station's design, based on the \\"Craftsman\\" style of the old Northern Pacific depot, was scaled back in early 1999 due to a shortfall in the project's $10.6 million budget. A supplemental budget was approved later in the year, restoring the planned design of Puyallup station, and additional property acquisitions were undertaken by Sound Transit to accommodate the change. Lugo Construction won the $3.7 million contract to build Puyallup station in March 2000 and construction began two months later. Construction on the station began months later than other stations, due to changes in the final design process, and Puyallup was skipped by Sounder trains during the first months of service in late 2000. Sounder service at Kent and Puyallup stations began on February 5, 2001. The opening dates for both stations were consolidated together, with Puyallup opening a month earlier than originally planned. A formal grand opening for Puyallup station was celebrated on May 5, including the full opening of the station's 300 parking stalls. The opening of the station was credited with attracting new businesses and development to downtown Puyallup, as part of the city's desired revitalization plan that came bundled with a new public library, central park, and city hall. The station's park and ride was expanded in 2010 with an additional 219 parking spaces at a satellite lot adjacent to the Washington State Fairgrounds. The Puyallup lodge of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, site of Puyallup station's planned parking garage The need for expanded parking at Puyallup station led to formal proposals by the city and Sound Transit to build a parking garage for commuters. The garage was first considered in 2007 and approved the following year in the Sound Transit 2 ballot measure, as part of a station access project. In 2014, Sound Transit approved a preliminary plan to build a 420-stall parking garage on property owned by the Puyallup Fraternal Order of Eagles, located west of the station's platforms, along with potential pedestrian overpasses crossing 5th Avenue and the railroad tracks. The garage project was stalled in early 2016 by the discovery of unstable soil at the site and the Eagles chapter declining to negotiate a land sale. Despite the issues, Sound Transit approved construction on the $60 million garage and access project in 2016, including a 500-stall parking garage at the Eagles site and a 166-stall parking lot on 3rd Avenue. Sound Transit began eminent domain procedures against the Eagles and their property in July 2017, prompting protests from Eagles members to the Puyallup city council. A settlement between Sound Transit and the Eagles was reached in 2018. The parking garage is planned to begin construction in 2019 and open in 2021, while other pedestrian and bicycle improvements are scheduled to be finished by 2023. Services Puyallup station is served by 13 daily round-trips on Sounder, which travel north to King Street Station in Downtown Seattle and south to Tacoma Dome Station or Lakewood station on weekdays. Sounder trains travel from Puyallup to Seattle in approximately 49 minutes and to Tacoma in 13 minutes. In addition to regular Sounder service, Sound Transit runs special weekend trains from Everett and Seattle to Puyallup station for the annual Washington State Fair, with free shuttle buses from the station to the fairgrounds. The station is also served by Sound Transit Express and Pierce Transit buses, which stop at several bus bays on the north platform. Sound Transit Express route 578 begins in Puyallup and travels north to Downtown Seattle via Sumner station, Auburn station, and Federal Way Transit Center; Sound Transit Express route 580 connects Puyallup to Lakewood station with trips that are timed to Sounder arrivals and departures. Pierce Transit's routes connect Puyallup station to South Hill Mall, the South Hill area, Tacoma, and Federal Way. Pierce Transit also operates a local shuttle, the Puyallup Connector (route 425), which travels between stops in downtown Puyallup and South Hill.

Born in March of either 1706 or 1707, probably in Nowogrodek, Baka is regarded as one of the most prominent poets of the 18th century Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Life =Early years= Little is known about early days of his life, furthermore, no portrait of Baka has been found so far. He was born into a wealthy family living in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and his father Adam Baka was a treasurer of the Mscislaw Voivodeship. Baka entered the Society of Jesus on July 16, 1723 and in 1735 he was ordained a priest, five years later becoming a monk. He studied at the Vilna Academy, but little is known about his curriculum. It has only been established that Baka passed a theology exam on May 7, 1736. Also, in late 1730s, he lectured rhetorics at the Academy. Some time in late 1730s or early 1740s, Baka left Vilna for the town of Kraslaw (now Latvia, then Inflanty Voivodeship). There, he worked as a priest and a missionary, in the Jesuit office Missio Plateriana. It was most likely in Kraslaw that he wrote his first works. Later on, Baka moved to the village of Blonie (also Livonia), where he opened his own office, which he called Missio Bakana. He often traveled across the area, trying to be in touch with local population. =Late years and death= Baka spent final years of his life in Vilna, where he moved for unknown reasons. Since 1756 or 1768, he lived in so- called House of Professors near Jesuit Church of Saint Casimirius. He was very active, sometimes visiting other places, such as Nowogrodek. His sermons were very popular, and in 1773 he was named Doctor of Theology by the Vilna Academy. He died unexpectedly on June 2, 1780 in Warsaw. It is unknown why he visited the capital of the Commonwealth, according to available sources, he had never left the Grand Duchy of Lithuania before. His death was mentioned by local daily Gazeta Warszawska. Baka was buried in Warsaw, in a Jesuit church on ≈öwiƒôtoja≈Ñska Street.

It is served by Sounder commuter rail and the Orange Line of Link light rail, as well as local and intercity buses. Located near the Tacoma Dome south of Downtown Tacoma, the station consists of two train platforms used by Sounder that will eventually be shared with Amtrak trains, a platform for the Orange Line, a bus terminal, and two parking garages. The Sounder station is integrated into Freighthouse Square, a former Milwaukee Road depot that was converted into a shopping mall, and is on the east side of the Amtrak station. The Tacoma Dome Station complex was constructed and opened in phases from 1997 to 2017. The parking garage and bus terminal were opened in 1997. Sounder service began in September 2000, followed by Tacoma Link (now the Orange Line) in August 2003, and a permanent platform for Sounder was opened in September 2003. Amtrak service briefly began on December 18, 2017, after the opening of the Point Defiance Bypass, replacing a nearby station. However, after a derailment that day, Amtrak indefinitely rerouted trains back to the old station. By 2030, an extension of the Link light rail system will connect Tacoma Dome Station to Federal Way, Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport, and Downtown Seattle. Sounder station Plans for a commuter rail line between Seattle and the Tacoma Dome area date back to the late 1980s, using existing tracks owned by the BNSF Railway. In early 1995, the Regional Transit Authority (RTA; later Sound Transit) ran experimental commuter rail service to Tacoma from Seattle during weekday peak periods and on weekends for Seattle SuperSonics games at the Tacoma Dome. The RTA's regional transit plan was approved by voters in 1996 and included a permanent commuter rail service between Tacoma and Seattle, with funding for a new station in the Tacoma Dome area. Pierce Transit approved construction of a $36.7 million, 1,200-stall park and ride garage near the Tacoma Dome in 1994, in anticipation of future commuter rail service. Construction on the garage began in July 1996, and the transit center complex opened on October 25, 1997, replacing a smaller park and ride lot. Sounder commuter rail service at Tacoma Dome Station began on September 18, 2000, using a temporary platform near Puyallup Avenue two blocks north of the parking garage. A second parking garage, holding 1,200 stalls, was opened the following month to accommodate Sounder commuters. In November, Sound Transit reached an agreement with the City of Tacoma to build the permanent Sounder platform at Freighthouse Square, using of Tacoma Rail tracks. A finalized agreement was approved by Sound Transit and the City of Tacoma in April 2002, with two tracks and a grade separated crossing of Portland Avenue near the Port of Tacoma. Construction of the $17.3 million station began with a groundbreaking ceremony on December 11, 2002. The concourse and platform were completed on September 15, 2003, with service beginning that morning, and dedicated by elected officials on September 26. The new platform was closed in January 2004, after concerns about soil instability on the new approach tracks had become apparent after a minor derailment. Trains reverted to using the temporary platform until August, when a $1.5 million stabilization project was completed. Tacoma Dome Station is also the terminus of the Orange Line, a short streetcar line that travels to Downtown Tacoma. The Tacoma Dome platform for the Orange Line (then called Tacoma Link) opened on August 22, 2003, after two years of construction. The station also served as the terminus of the Spirit of Washington Dinner Train, which ran south from Freighthouse Square toward Lake Kapowsin near Mount Rainier. The excursion train service began in August 2007 after relocating from the Eastside Rail Corridor, but closed in October due to poor ridership. From 2000 to 2012, Tacoma Dome Station served as the southern terminus of the Sounder South Line. Sound Transit began construction on an extension to Lakewood in 2009, after years of delays due to cost increases and a lack of dedicated funding. of new tracks were built between Tacoma Dome Station and the existing Lakewood Subdivision, including an overpass over Pacific Avenue, as part of the extension. Sounder trains began serving South Tacoma and Lakewood stations on October 8, 2012, with some trips terminating at either Lakewood or Tacoma Dome. Amtrak station alt=A building with exposed wood and yellow paper, clearly under construction, with a railroad in the foreground In the 1990s, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) identified Freighthouse Square as a potential site for a new Amtrak station serving Tacoma, with multi-modal connections in a single hub, to replace the Puyallup Avenue station opened in 1984. The new station would be built as part of the Point Defiance Bypass project, which would create an inland route for trains traveling between Tacoma and Lacey that would have reduced interference from freight traffic and mudslides. The bypass and new station were funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and construction of the new tracks was formally approved by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) in early 2013. Freighthouse Square was selected as the preferred site by WSDOT and the FRA in October 2012, ahead of a parking lot to the west of Pacific Avenue. A preliminary design for the new station was unveiled in December 2013, replacing of Freighthouse Square's west end with a structure clad in red corrugated metal. The design was met with public outcry over its unattractive design, labeled an \\"Amshack\\", and the proposed destruction of Freighthouse Square's facade for what The News Tribune termed an \\"architectural abomination\\". The backlash forced WSDOT to withdraw its design, hiring a Tacoma-based architecture firm and forming a citizen advisory committee to guide future station design. The advisory committee recommended building the station on the east end of the Freighthouse Square complex, but WSDOT determined it was too expensive to build and operate due to the elevation distance between the tracks and ground level; instead, WSDOT recommended a site to the west of the Sounder entrance that would be less costly to operate. The revised WSDOT proposal was well received by the public and approved by the advisory committee, along with recommendations for additional canopies and other features. The Amtrak station's final design consists of a building to the west of the Sounder entrance, with of interior space. The building features a ceiling with cross laminated timber columns and beams over the waiting area and public arcade, furnished with terrazzo floors, large glass walls, and public artwork. The public arcade includes vertical lift doors that allow it to become a sheltered outdoor space. The existing Sounder platform was extended by to accommodate the longer Coast Starlight trainset as part of the rebuilt Tacoma Trestle; a second platform and track was also built to allow additional train service. Early designs for the station also included a pedestrian bridge between the station's two platforms and the existing parking garages, but it was left unfunded. A monumental clock tower was also to be included in the station's design, but was rejected after a lack of interest from the public. The new design was approved by WSDOT, Amtrak, Sound Transit, and the City of Tacoma in early 2015 and sent to the FRA for final review. In January 2016, WSDOT began advertising for demolition and construction bids, with plans to begin construction in spring. A month later, however, negotiations with the owner of Freighthouse Square over property acquisition and construction mitigation costs broke down and stalled the project. WSDOT attempted to condemn the property through a lawsuit, but came to an agreement with the property owner in March. Construction began in June 2016 and the station was declared substantially complete in May 2017. Sounder trains began using the new platform and track on November 13, 2017, causing temporary confusion for passengers because of the new arrangement. The station was dedicated on December 15, 2017, and Amtrak service on the Point Defiance Bypass began on December 18. The inaugural Amtrak trip on the new bypass derailed near DuPont, and service reverted indefinitely to the old route via the Puyallup Avenue station. WSDOT announced that it would halt the return of Amtrak trains to the bypass until full implementation of positive train control, which was completed and fully activated in March 2019. The restoration of Amtrak service on the Point Defiance Bypass is tentatively scheduled for 2020, after agreements with local officials and the arrival of new Talgo trainsets. Future As part of the Sound Transit 3 expansion program approved by voters in 2016, Sound Transit plans to build a Link light rail extension from Federal Way to Tacoma by 2030. The line will terminate near Tacoma Dome Station, with a pedestrian bridge connecting to the Freighthouse Square complex and other train platforms. , Sound Transit is evaluating six station options at Tacoma Dome Station, with elevated platforms above either Puyallup Avenue, 25th Street, or 26th Street. The project was proposed as part of a failed ballot measure in 1995 and was cut from the successful 1996 Sound Move program. The Roads and Transit package in 2007 included funding for a SeaTac‚ÄìTacoma extension, but was also rejected; the smaller Sound Transit 2 proposal, approved by voters in 2008, funded construction to Federal Way and right of way acquisition for a future Tacoma extension until funding cutbacks during the Great Recession caused plans to be indefinitely delayed. Station layout Tacoma Dome Station is located on East 25th Street, between East D Street and East G Street, in the Dome District area southeast of Downtown Tacoma. The station consists of two buildings, three train platforms, a bus terminal, and two parking garages. The Sounder and Amtrak concourses are located on the south side of the street within Freighthouse Square, a former Milwaukee Road freight depot built in 1909 and later renovated into a shopping center. The station's Amtrak and Sounder platforms are situated on the south side of the building. The lone Orange Line platform is located on the north side of East 25th Street, adjacent to the station's two parking garages, with a capacity of 2,283 parking spaces as well as bicycle lockers and cages. The garage's south side also houses the Pierce Transit customer service center, while the north side on Puyallup Avenue (located downhill from the train station) has the bus platforms and Greyhound station. The bus platform, with bus bays on both sides, is connected to the train station and garage via a footbridge and stairway. Ticket vending machines are located inside the Sounder concourse, the customer service center, and at the bus platform. The station has restrooms located in the customer service center and the bus platform. The station has two pieces of public art commissioned by Sound Transit during construction of the Sounder and Link stations. A kinetic sculpture by Luke Blackstone is contained within two steel tanks mounted above the parking garage's walkway. Several recycled artifacts representing Tacoma's history are scattered between the station's two parking garages as part of \\"Wild Parcel\\", a collaborative piece by Tacoma artists and landscape architects. An additional piece of public art was installed in January 2019 at the intersection of South Tacoma Way and Pacific Avenue as part of the Lakewood extension. Entitled \\"Gertie's Ghost\\", it is a steel structure that consists of eight octopus tentacles and was created by Oakland-based artists Sean Orlando and David Shulman. Services alt=A passenger train parked at a train station's platform, which stretches into the background, interrupted by a series of lampposts and glass walls Tacoma Dome Station is the intermodal connection between several transit modes, including intercity rail, commuter rail, light rail, and buses. The Orange Line terminates at the station, running north to Downtown Tacoma at frequencies of 12 to 24 minutes. It is served by 13 daily round-trips on Sounder commuter trains, which run north to King Street Station in Seattle and south to Lakewood on weekdays. The station has several express bus routes to Seattle and Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport operated by Sound Transit Express; and routes to Olympia operated by Intercity Transit. Pierce Transit, the facility's owner and operator, has seven local routes that intersect at Tacoma Dome Station, traveling onward to Downtown Tacoma, North Tacoma, South Tacoma, Gig Harbor, Puyallup, and Federal Way. Greyhound runs intercity bus service from the station to Seattle and Portland. BoltBus service from the station began in March 2019 and serves routes to Portland, Seattle, Bellingham, and Vancouver, British Columbia.

History Coastal Conservation Association (CCA) is a non-profit organization with 17 coastal state chapters spanning the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic seaboard, and the Pacific Northwest. CCA began in 1977 after drastic commercial overfishing along the Texas coast decimated redfish and speckled trout populations. 14 concerned recreational anglers created the Gulf Coast Conservation Association to combat commercial overfishing. The stewardship started with the \\"Save the Redfish\\" campaign, and by 1985, chapters had formed along the Gulf Coast. By the early ‚Äò90s, the mid-Atlantic region and the New England had chapters. Washington and Oregon opened CCA chapters in 2007. CCA has participated productively in virtually every national fisheries debate since 1984. In the federal court system, CCA‚Äôs legal defense fund has been used to defend net bans; fight for the implementation of bycatch reduction devices; support pro-fisheries legislation; and battle arbitrary no-fishing zones. The CCA network is engaged in hundreds of local, state, and national projects that initiate scientific studies; fund marine-science scholarships; build artificial reefs; create Finfish hatcheries; initiate hydrologic and contaminant studies; monitor freshwater inflows; support local marine law enforcement; and more. Through broad-based recreational angler support; a strong legal and legislative presence; decades of experience; and an unwavering vision for the future of U.S. and global marine resources, CCA battles for the sustainable health of our coastal fisheries and for recreational anglers‚Äô interests. =Organization= The CCA functions as a bottom up enterprise, focusing on the grassroots level of local politics and traveling up all the way through national levels of government.

It was recorded on July 18, 1979 at The Power Station in New York in one of the early recording sessions for Bruce Springsteen's album The River. It was not released on the album, but in 1981 it was released as the B-side to the single release of \\"Fade Away\\", a song taken from The River album. According to Springsteen, \\"Be True\\" was left off The River album in favor of the song \\"Crush on You\\", a decision he has a hard time understanding in retrospect. Springsteen was already second guessing his decision to exclude \\"Be True\\" from The River before the album was even released. Composition \\"Be True\\" is a mid-tempo pop/rock song. It had been slated to be included on The Ties That Bind, a single album Springsteen had submitted to his record company in 1979 but then pulled back to be replaced by The River. Music critic Clinton Heylin considers it one of the \\"centrepieces\\" of the would-be album. AllMusic critic Mark Deming notes that unlike many songs in which movies are used \\"as a symbol of people‚Äôs hopes and dreams,\\" in \\"Be True\\" those dreams \\"stand in the way of a better reality.\\" Its lyrics, which \\"contrast the romance of life in movies with the loneliness of real life\\" fit with one of the major themes of The River, that of the \\"conflict between dreams and reality.\\" According to author Jane Skinner Sawyers, the lyrics of the refrain. \\"You be true to me/And I'll be true to you\\" \\"\\"sum up Springsteen's philosophy.\\" Sawyer considers that its sweetness and tenderness would have made it a top hit had it been released in the 1960s. Recording history \\"Be True\\" went through several versions before its final incarnation. The original version, recorded in the first half of 1979, was titled \\"Mary Lou,\\" which was intended as a \\"really catchy three minute pop tune\\" which \\"moved lyrically\\" and \\"linked together in a certain way.\\" In \\"Mary Lou\\", the singer sings to a woman he is interested in that she should not sell herself cheap but rather \\"be true to [herself] in some fashion.\\" According to Springsteen, the theme was \\"how do you find yourself through the falseness of some of those things.\\" The second version of the song, officially \\"Little White Lies,\\" but also known as \\"White Lies\\" and \\"Don't Do It To Me,\\" was recorded in June 1979. It contains an intro similar to that on the Rolling Stones' single \\"Paint It, Black.\\" Heylin claims that this version \\"explodes the moment the drums kick in\\" and that drummer Max Weinberg regards this version as one of his favorite E Street Band songs. The final incarnation of \\"Be True\\" was recorded on July 18, 1979. Release history In France, it was released as the B-side of the \\"Cadillac Ranch\\" single, and in Spain it was released as the B-side of the \\"Sherry Darling\\" single. Although left off the album and released only as a B-side of a single, \\"Be True\\" reached #42 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. A featured selection on the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express, a live version from that tour was included on the Chimes of Freedom EP. The live version also appeared on various different formats to promote the \\"Tougher Than The Rest\\" single release the same year. Eventually the studio version of \\"Mary Lou\\" and \\"Be True\\" were released on the Bruce Springsteen album Tracks, a 4-disc box set released in 1998. \\"Little White Lies\\" was released on The Ties That Bind: The River Collection in 2015, along with \\"Mary Lou\\" and \\"Be True\\"; however, there are two circulating versions of \\"Little White Lies\\" that share the same music, but are lyrically two completely different songs. The unofficial studio \\"bootleg\\" version uses the same lyrics found in \\"Mary Lou\\" and \\"Be True\\" and does not contain \\"little white lies\\" anywhere in the lyrics, whereas the first verse from the official studio version of \\"Little White Lies\\" released in 2015 later appeared in \\"Loose Ends\\".

Biography Renato Zanelli, nom d'art of Renato Zanelli Morales, was born in Almendral, Los Andes, Valpara√≠so, Chile on April 1, 1892. His father was Italian and his mother Chilean. In 1894 he was taken to Europe and was educated in Switzerland and Italy. He returned to Chile in 1911 to work in his father's salpeter factory office in Valparaiso. His voice was discovered at a social party by Angelo Querz√©, an Italian tenor who had sung in Chile in 1894 in the local premiere of \\"Otello\\".http://www.cantabile- subito.de/Baritones/Zanelli__Renato/zanelli__renato.html He studied in Santiago with Angelo Querze, making his debut there as a baritone in 1916, as Valentin. He later sang such important baritone roles as Tonio, de Luna, and Renato. His Metropolitan Opera debut came in 1919, as Amonasro. He remained there until 1923, singing most of the major Italian baritone parts. Zanelli then left for Italy for further studies with Dante Lari and Fernando Tanara in Milan. His first appearance as a tenor occurred in 1924 at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, as Raoul. He went on to sing widely in Italy and South America in roles as diverse as Pollione, Don Jos√©, Andrea Ch√©nier, Canio, Tristan and Siegmund. He sang his first Otello in Turin in 1926, which also was his debut role at the Royal Opera House in London. His portrayal of Otello was notable for the intensity of its dramatic utterance. He took part in the first performance, in 1930, of Pizzetti's Lo straniero at Teatro dell'Opera di Roma. Zanelli had a rich voice and was equally successful as a baritone and a tenor, his early death from cancer cutting short a brilliant career. His artistry is preserved, however, on a number of recordings of operatic arias which he made at the height of his powers in the two vocal categories that he had mastered. These recordings are available on CD. His brother, Carlos Zanelli-Morales (1897‚Äì1970), was also a successful baritone. He sang under the stage name of Carlo Morelli in Italy and also at the Met from 1935 to 1940. Zanelli died on March 25, 1935 in Santiago, Chile after fighting cancer.

United Kingdom  U.S.A Fried Chicken Lick'n Chick'n Perfect Chicken Restaurants are commonplace in inner city areas of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has one of the largest, fastest growing and most diverse fried chicken markets in the world, with about 1,000 individual brands and 1,700 outlets. Shop signs are commonly designed in a red, white and blue colour scheme, and include a drawing or cartoon of a chicken, as well as a reference to the Southern United States. Some British chicken outlets serve Halal meat and use a more spicy batter formula to differentiate themselves from KFC and appeal to young Muslim customers. Some have also diversified to sell kebabs, pizza and fish and chips. Especially popular in poor and ethnic minority neighbourhoods, fried chicken restaurants have been criticised for contributing to urban blight. For instance, Tottenham MP David Lammy thinks the proliferation of chicken joints hampers prosperity in his constituency.

Scientists says styrax benzoin from Sumatra has the best quality. The process of tapping and harvesting frankincense takes one year. The styrax benzoin tree trunk is cut slightly, so that the white styrax sap will appear from the skin. After 4-6 months of the styrax sap hardens on the tree trunks at which point the sap can be harvested. The sap that has been harvested is not clean and is dried for 3 to 6 months to remove impurities. After the sap has dried, it is ready for export. You can find incense trees in several countries in Southeast Asia, such as Malaysia, Laos, Vietnam and Indonesia. The tree can thrive in mountainous areas and cold temperatures with high rainfall. Styrax trees can also grow in lowland areas with hot temperatures but these do not produce good quality styrax sap.JSTOR Plant Science Cultivation Styrax benzoin is cultivated as a main source of benzoin resin in Indonesia.

The protests were spurred by the death in police custody of Mutallip Hajim. The authorities label groups like the Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami (Islamic Party of Liberation) or the East Turkestan Islamic Movement terrorists and attribute to them most of unrest activities of the last years.  Incidents  According to reports, on 18 March 2008, an Uighur woman detonated a bomb on a city bus in Urumqi, escaping before the explosion. While officials denied the incident, the International Herald Tribune reported of residents confirming the bombing. Many businesses belonging to those that belong to the Muslim ethnic group Hui were destroyed by the separatist group. On 23 March 2008, Muslim Uighurs held anti-government protests in the far western region of Xinjiang, China. Chinese officials blamed separatists inspired by the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Demonstrators took to the streets at the weekly bazaar in Hotan. The authorities maintain tight controls on information from the area and reports of deaths or their denial could not be independently verified. Demonstrations followed the death in custody of a wealthy Uyghur jade trader and philanthropist, Mutallip Hajim, 38. The protesters, who according to several accounts numbered around 600, began their march at the Lop bus station. An unknown number of men joined their march to the Big Bazaar shopping area, where they were surrounded by police who arrested around 400. The New York Times reported that the demonstrators were hoisting banners and shouting pro- independence slogans before the police forces moved in. On 23 March and 24 March 2008, as many as 1,000 people in Hotan and Karakax County took to the streets in protest. The protests coincided with unrest in Tibet, but the motivations appeared to be local. One issue that reportedly brought locals to the streets in protest was a government ban on women wearing headscarfs. Another issue was the death of Mutallip Hajim. Alim Seytoff, head of the World Uyghur Congress, stated that, \\"The Uighurs began protesting after the killing of Mutallip Hajim, who had died in police custody.\\" This claim was echoed by unnamed sources in a Radio Free Asia report. Local police and the government run religious affairs department refused to comment on Hajim's death when contacted by Agence France-Presse. Police arrested 70 people from Uyghur ethnic group in the Silk Road oasis city of Kashgar on 3 April, fearing trouble when the Olympic torch passes through the city in June, The Guardian reported. Residents of townships and villages near Gulja, a city in northwestern Xinjiang, said that about 25 Uyghurs were arrested on 4 April on a tip that people in the area were making bombs. On 4 August 2008, two men attacked a police post near the city of Kashgar. They threw two improvised explosive devices and attacked at the police with knives. According to the government news agency, 16 policemen died and another 16 were injured. On 10 August 2008, in the oasis town of Kuqa, a series of explosions and shootings were reported. The explosions occurred at various police stations and office buildings. The events claimed 12 deaths, ten of which were of the attackers themselves. On 12 August 2008, unidentified men assaulted civilian guards with knives in Yamanya Town, leaving three dead and one critically injured. On 28 August 2008, a group of policemen were attacked by six to seven attackers with knives in the town of Qizilboy in Peyzawat county, resulting in the death two ethnic Uyghur police officers and at least two other policemen were critically injured. According to the deputy Peyzawat county police chief, Omerjan, the police officers who are all ethnic Uyghurs who were searching a cornfield following a tip that a woman suspected of aiding assailants in the Yamanya attack was hiding there.

There is an ethnic minority known as the Griko people, who live in the Southern Italian regions of Calabria (Province of Reggio Calabria) and Apulia, especially the peninsula of Salento, within the old Magna Graecia region, who speak a distinctive dialect of Greek called Griko.Greek MFA: Greek community in Italy They are believed to be remnants of the ancientG. Rohlfs, Griechen und Romanen in Unteritalien, 1924. and medieval Greek communities, who have lived in the south of Italy for centuries. A Greek community has long existed in Venice as well, the current center of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy and Malta, which in addition was a Byzantine province until the 10th century and held territory in Morea and Crete until the 17th century. Alongside this group, a smaller number of more recent migrants from Greece lives in Italy, forming an expatriate community in the country. Today many Greeks in Southern Italy follow Italian customs and culture, experiencing assimilation. Ancient Greek Diaspora 6th century BC In the 8th and 7th centuries BC, for various reasons, including demographic crisis (famine, overcrowding, climate change, etc.), the search for new commercial outlets and ports, and expulsion from their homeland, Greeks began a large colonization drive, including southern Italy.Greek Italy:A Roadmap In this same time, Greek colonies were established in places as widely separated as the eastern coast of the Black Sea and Massalia (Marseille). They included settlements in Sicily and the southern part of the Italian peninsula. The Romans called the area of Sicily and the foot of the boot of Italy Magna Graecia (Latin, \\"Greater Greece\\"), since it was so densely inhabited by Greeks. The ancient geographers differed on whether the term included Sicily or merely Apulia and Calabria  Strabo being the most prominent advocate of the wider definitions. Medieval During the Early Middle Ages, new waves of Greeks came to Magna Graecia from Greece and Asia Minor, as Southern Italy remained governed by the Eastern Roman Empire. Although most of the Greek inhabitants of Southern Italy became de-hellenized and no longer spoke Greek, remarkably a small Griko-speaking minority still exists today in Calabria and mostly in Salento. Griko is the name of a language combining ancient Doric, Byzantine Greek, and Italian elements, spoken by people in the Magna Graecia region. There is rich oral tradition and Griko folklore, limited now, though once numerous, to only a few thousand people, most of them having become absorbed into the surrounding Italian element. Records of Magna Graecia being predominantly Greek-speaking date as late as the 11th century (the end of Byzantine empire what is commonly known as the Eastern Roman Empire). Recall that the Roman empire had become so vast that it was divided into two parts for administrative purposes. The migration of Byzantine Greek scholars and other emigres from Byzantium during the decline of the Byzantine empire (1203‚Äì1453) and mainly after the fall of Constantinople in 1453 until the 16th century, is considered by modern scholars as crucial in the revival of Greek and Roman studies, arts and sciences, and subsequently in the development of Renaissance humanism.Byzantines in Renaissance Italy These emigres were grammarians, humanists, poets, writers, printers, lecturers, musicians, astronomers, architects, academics, artists, scribes, philosophers, scientists, politicians and theologians.Greeks in Italy In the decades following the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople many Greeks began to settle in territories of the Republic of Venice, including in Venice itself. In 1479 there were between 4000 and 5000 Greek residents in Venice. Moreover, it was one of the economically strongest Greek communities of that time outside the Ottoman Empire. In November 1494 the Greeks in Venice asked permission and were permitted to found a confraternity, the Scuola dei Greci, a philanthropic and religious society which had its own committee and officers to represent the interests of the flourishing Greek community. This was the first official recognition of the legal status of the Greek colony by the Venetian authorities. In 1539 the Greeks of Venice were permitted to begin building their own church, the San Giorgio dei Greci which still stands in the centre of Venice in the present day on the Rio dei Greci. Modern Italy Although most of the Greek inhabitants of Southern Italy became entirely Italianized during the Middle Ages (as Paestum had already been in the 4th century BC), pockets of Greek culture and language remained and survived into modern times. This is due to the fact that the migration routes between southern Italy and the Greek mainland never entirely ceased to exist. Thus, for example, Greeks re-colonized the region in the 16th and 17th centuries. This happened in reaction to the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Ottoman Turks. Especially after the fall of Coroni (1534) large numbers of Greeks and Albanians sought, and were granted, refuge in the areas of Calabria, Salento and Sicily. The Greeks from Coroni - the so-called Coronians - belonged to the nobility and brought with them substantial movable property. They were granted special privileges and given tax exemptions. Another part of the Greeks that moved to Italy came from the Mani region of the Peloponnese. The Maniots were known for their proud military traditions and for their bloody vendettas (another portion of these Greeks moved to Corsica; cf. the Corsican vendettas). These migrations strengthened the depopulated Italian south with a culturally vibrant and militarily capable element. When the Italian Fascists gained power in 1922, they persecuted the Greek-speakers in Italy.Minority Rights Group International - Italy - Greek-speakers Griko people The Griko people are a population group in Italy of ultimately Greek origin which still exists today in the Italian regions of Calabria and Apulia. The Griko people traditionally spoke the Griko language, a form of the Greek language combining ancient Doric and Byzantine Greek elements. Some believe that the origins of the Griko language may ultimately be traced to the colonies of Magna Graecia. Greeks were the dominant population element of some regions in the south of Italy, especially Calabria, the Salento, parts of Lucania and Sicily until the 12th century. Over the past centuries the Griko have been heavily influenced by the Catholic Church and Latin culture and as a result many Griko have become largely assimilated into mainstream Italian culture, though once numerous, the Griko are now limited, most of them having become absorbed into the surrounding Italian element. The Griko language is severely endangered due to language shift towards Italian and large-scale internal migration to the cities in recent decades. The Griko community is currently estimated at 60,000 members. Immigrants The Bulgari brand was founded by Sotirio Bulgari, a Greek immigrant to Italy After World War II, a large number of Greeks immigrated to countries abroad, mostly to the United States, Greek settlement in the Philippines, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, The United Kingdom, Argentina, Brazil, Norway, Germany, United Arab Emirates, and Singapore. however, a smaller number of diaspora migrants from Greece entered Italy from World War II onwards, today the Greek diaspora community consists of some 30,000 people, the majority of whom are located in Rome and Central Italy.

The title Liten Agda och Olof Tyste translates literally as: Little Agda and Olof the Silent. The title Agda Michelsdotter translates literally as: Agda, Michel's daughter; Olof is her boyfriend. After being kept from Olof by her father, she joins the Vadstena Abbey, a convent, instead of marrying a wealthy nobleman. She escapes from the convent and elopes with Olof, banished by the Church until the King grants the couple a reprieve. Their story was told in F√∂rr och nu i Wadstena (Past and present in Vadstena) by Constans Pontin. It bears similarities to the fate of Ingeborg J√∂nsdotter (d. 1524), a merchant's daughter from Vadstena who was forced to enter the same convent in 1495 after a love affair with a young noble.Wilhelimna St√•lberg: Anteqningar om svenska qvinnor (Notes on Swedish women) (in Swedish) Background According to the legend, Agda was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, Michel (or Mickel), in the city of Vadstena. She was in love with a young boy, Olof, who was turned away by her father. The sorrow of losing Agda made Olof sad and detached, and he became known as Olof Tyste, meaning Olof the Quiet One or Olof the Silent. Michel presented Agda to a wealthy man and told her to either marry him or enter a convent; she chose to enter the Vadstena Abbey of Saint Bridget. This was not at all to her father's liking, as he had expected her to choose marriage, but, as it says in the legend, \\"he had offered her a choice; and she had chosen\\" She entered the convent as a novice, a beginning student of the Church. Elopement A year after Agda had become a novice, a great scandal occurred, which came to be known thorough the country. Somehow, Olof and Agda had managed to meet secretly during her time in the convent, and one night Agda climbed down the wall of the convent to the beach of V√§ttern, where Olof waited with a boat. Together, they escaped across the water to V√§sterg√∂tland. The reaction was fierce; a nun had broken the vow of chastity and committed the crime of heresy: the law of the church demanded that Agda be buried alive and that the Olof be burned at the stake. The scandal of the convent abduction was reported to bishop Hans Brask in Link√∂ping, who issued a ban on the couple and declared them outlaws. Henceforth, everyone was forbidden to give them food or water, to house them or to assist them in any way, and anyone was allowed to kill them without punishment. Banishment Agda and Olof traveled to one of Olof's friends in Husaby. They were just about to be married, when their wedding ceremony was interrupted and the banishment declared to those present. They were immediately sent out of the church. People let them pass, \\"as if they were contaminated by the plague\\". For months, until and past Christmas they fled, as the legend says, from farm to farm. At first they were received in a friendly way, but as soon as the news of the banishment reached their hosts, they were turned away. One day they were reached by the news that the king was in the city of Vadstena. Agda had heard that he sympathized with the Protestant religion, and she suggested that they should seek him out and appeal to him directly. The end The king had given order that no one seeking an audience with him should be turned away during his visit in the city. The soldiers, though they stepped backwards from Agda and Olof, in fear of the clerical ban, did not dare to turn them away when they demanded to see the king. The king, \\"received them with much goodness, folded their hands and promised to help them to the happy victory of their faithful love\\". He wrote to the bishop to recall the banishment right away. He also sent Agda and Olof with a military escort to the house of Agda's father, Michel, with the order that he should welcome his daughter and future son-in-law. Michel answered that the king had no say in his private affairs and that he would welcome his daughter and Olof by letting his servants hunt them away with dogs. The king's chancellor Laurentius, who accompanied them, lost his temper and told Michel, on his own initiative, that the king had promised to cut off Michel's head if he did not kindly receive and nurse \\"his children\\". Michel believed him, and the next day, the king sent for him and reconciled him with Agda and Olof, and soon after, the king danced with Agda at her wedding. Historical accuracy This event is said to have happened in the year of 1526,Lennart J√∂r√§lv: Reliker och mirakel. Den heliga Birgitta och Vadstena (Relics and miracles. Saint Bridget and Vadstena) (2003) after the accession to Gustav Vasa on the throne (1523), and one year before the reformation (1527). In 1525, the King, Gustav Vasa, allowed for the marriage of the priest Olaus Petri, In 1526 he oversaw the translation of the bible, further earning him the reputation as a reformer. It is confirmed that King Gustav did order the Bishop to recall the banishment of a woman who had been placed at the Vadstena Abbey but escaped with a suitor unwelcome by her family, with the words that the bishop had previously on several occasions allowed women to leave the convent, and that he suspected that the different attitude of the bishop on this occasion was that the woman in question left the convent because she wished to marry.Carl Grimberg (Swedish) : Svenska folkets underbara √∂den. 2, 1521-1611 (in English: \\"The wonderous destinies of the Swedish people. 2, 1521-1611\\") (1959), page 75 In connection to this case, the King gave the order during the reformation that no one should be allowed to enter a convent without the approval of the monarch This instruction was given in 1527 and the man who helped his beloved to escape from the abbey was named as OlofHistoriskt bibliotek utgifvet af Carl Silfverstolpe Agda's tale bears similarities to the fate of Ingeborg J√∂nsdotter (d. 1524), a merchant's daughter from Vadstena who was forced to enter the same convent in 1495 after a love affair with a young nobleman, with the difference that J√∂nsdotter remained in the convent and never saw her lover again.

It is a chick-lit novel by Sophie Kinsella, a pen-name of Madeleine Wickham. It focuses on the main character Rebecca (Becky) Bloomwood, a financial journalist, who is in a serious amount of debt through her shopping addiction.  Plot summary  Rebecca Bloomwood lives in a flat in fashionable Fulham, London, that is owned by her best friend Suze's wealthy, aristocratic parents.http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-2101974_ITM Becky works as a financial journalist for the magazine Successful Savings, a job she dislikes. Becky admits to knowing very little about personal finance, and is thousands of pounds in debt due to her uncontrollable spending on designer homeware, clothes and beauty products.http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11724746_ITM The book emphasises that her cycle of debt is not easily broken, as, even as she is thousands of pounds in debt, Becky still receives letters offering her credit and department store cards. She often rationalises her overspending, for instance by referring to items as an 'investment' or necessary, but not everyone agrees with it. During a visit to Surrey, her parents order Becky to shape up and cut back on her spending spree or make more money. On her way to a press conference held by Brandon Communications, Becky notices a sale sign in the window of the Denny and George shop. She sees that the scarf she has long craved for is on sale at a discount of 50%. Becky sees this as a unique opportunity but realizes that she has left her Visa card at the office and asks the shop assistant to reserve the scarf until she can retrieve her credit card. The assistant reluctantly agrees to hold it until the end of the day only. Upon arriving at the press conference, she is greeted by a staff member of Brandon Communications, who mentions that there's been some surprising news in the banking field and asks Becky her opinion on the news. Becky has no idea what the woman is referring to and has to feign knowledge. After the staffer leaves, Luke Brandon, head of Brandon Communications, realizing that she was feigning knowledge of what was happening, tells her that one financial group recently bought another, and it was recently rumoured that Flagstaff Life was going the same way. Halfway through the conference Becky is given another errand by her employer and realizes that she will not have time to return to the office for her credit card, but only needs twenty pounds more to buy her Denny & George scarf. She asks her friend Elly Granger if she can borrow some money, but Elly has none. Luke hears Becky ask for twenty pounds, and stops the whole Press Conference just so he can hand a twenty-pound note to her, once she has made up a story of needing the money to buy a present for her aunt who is in hospital. Later on during the week, Becky's flatmate Suze asks her to go to a restaurant with her and her cousins, including Tarquin. There, Becky sees Luke and his parents having dinner. Luke's stepmother, Annabel, comments on Becky's scarf, and she politely thanks her. Becky claims that her aunt gave it to her in order to avoid Luke being suspicious. Luke runs into Becky after that and asks her to come shopping with him at Harrods. Initially she enjoys shopping with him for luggage, helping Luke choose the best purchase. After he reveals that the luggage is actually for his girlfriend, Sacha, Becky is very upset thinking that he humiliated her. She tells Luke off that she feels he's used her and not treated her with respect. Suze and Becky happen to be flicking through a magazine and see a list of eligible millionaires, which includes Tarquin and Luke Brandon. Tarquin asks Becky out, and compliments Becky on her scarf. While Tarquin goes to the bathroom, Becky sneaks a look at his checkbook, and is unimpressed by the content. Tarquin returns and Becky is sure he saw her looking at the checkbook. Becky gives up trying to date Tarquin, as he is just not her type, even if he is very rich. Throughout the story, a man named Derek Smeath, who is the manager of Becky's bank, is constantly trying to get hold of her so he can set up a re-payment schedule for her overdraft. Becky always has some excuse as to why she cannot send a cheque or meet with Mr. Smeath and his assistant, Erica. The excuses range from a broken leg, a dead aunt, etc., etc., until it becomes obvious to Mr. Smeath that Becky is unable to repay the overdraft. He becomes quite insistent upon setting up a meeting with her. Unable to come up with any more excuses to avoid meeting the bank manager, Becky goes back home to hide at her parents' house, telling them the bank manager is a stalker. Becky learns that her next door neighbors made a financial decision based on advice that Becky had absentmindedly given them and stand to miss out on thousands of pounds in a windfall resulting from a bank takeover. Becky is horrified by being partly culpable and sets out to make things right by writing an article that exposes the bank's duplicity. The article is a success, and leads to Becky appearing on a daytime television show, The Morning Coffee. Unfortunately, Becky did not know that the bank was a client of Luke Brandon's PR firm. Luke is angry with her, believing she wrote the article just to get back at him for treating her poorly. Becky and Luke square off during her appearance on The Morning Coffee. After arguing with Becky, Luke concedes that she was right, and announces that Brandon Communications will no longer be representing that bank. Becky gets a regular slot on the show and finally talks to Mr. Smeath. After apologizing for her behavior, she and Smeath agree to set up a meeting to work out her financial debt. Luke invites Becky out for a seeming business dinner at the Ritz Hotel. When Becky arrives at their meeting, business is not on the agenda and instead they eat their fill of the food and end up spending the night at the Ritz together. Becky has to miss yet another meeting arranged with her bank manager, but he writes and tells her this can be postponed, as due to her regular slot on television, her finances are now rosy. But the bank manager, Derek Smeath, will continue to keep an eye on her account.  Characters  Becky Bloomwood: the main character and protagonist in the story. Although she works as a financial journalist, she also has significant debts concerning her credit cards and her constant overdrafts. Despite it, nothing stops her from buying new clothes, shoes and new items which others think are unnecessary. Susan \\"Suze\\" Cleath-Stuart: Becky's aristocratic best friend who keeps an eye on her spending spree. She is described as blonde and is an even worse shopaholic than Becky. In Shopaholic Abroad, it's revealed that Suze and Alicia have a bitter history and of which she blamed the latter for wrongly getting her fired just because she was originally up for promotion by Luke. Luke Brandon: The CEO and owner of Brandon Communications. He is described by Becky as being 6'4, dark hair and dark eyes. Luke originally dated Sacha de Bonneville before dating Becky. Alicia Billington: Luke's employee at Brandon Communications and is described by Becky as being blonde and long-legs. This earns her the nickname Alicia Bitch Long-Legs because she's selfish and uncaring of others. Alicia and Suze have a bitter history with each other when they first worked at Brandon C as PRs. She was responsible for an incident that got Suze wrongly fired just because she wanted the promotion for herself. Alicia and four others involved in her scam are later fired by Luke for her plans in ruining Brandon C.'s reputation. Graham and Jane Bloomwood: Becky's parents who are extremely cautious of their spending and tells her to shape up by cutting back on her spending spree or make more money. In \\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" Becky learns that Graham had a previous relationship with a woman named Marguerite and that she had a half-sister named Jessica \\"Jess\\" Bertram. Philip: Becky's boss at Successful Savings who hasn't promoted Becky and chosen Clare Edwards instead due to her lack of responsibility. Clare Edwards: Becky's co-worker whom Philip had promoted based on how she takes her job seriously. She later replaces Becky as a financial expert in \\"Shopaholic Abroad\\" Derek Smeath: Becky's manager at Endwich Bank. He is described as polite and professional, but also persistent whenever she refuses to meet him for a meeting. In the end, she and Smeath work out a meeting with each other. Tarquin Cleath-Stuart: Suze's cousin whom Becky tried to date, but realizes he's not her type. He and Suze later get married in \\"Shopaholic Ties the Knot\\". They have three children. Martin and Janice Webster: Close friends and neighbors of the Bloomwoods. Tom Webster: Martin and Janice's son. He originally was dating Lucy until she dumped him in \\"Shopaholic and Sister\\". Since \\"Shopaholic and Baby\\" Tom has dated Becky's older half-sister, Jessica, and in \\"Mini Shopaholic\\" they married in Chile. They have plans to adopt first, which even Becky fully supports, but Janice insists they have a natural child first. Lucy: Tom's girlfriend from the first novel and later fianc√©e by \\"Shopaholic Ties The Knot\\". She later dumps him at the beginning of \\"Shopaholic and Sister\\" and hasn't been heard from since then. Elly Granger: Becky's other friend who only makes her appearance in this novel. She asks Elly for some money, but she has none. Sacha de Bonneville: Luke's French girlfriend whom he buys an expensive luggage set based on Becky's recommendations at Harrods. She later dumps him at the end of the first novel, also making her a one-time character.  Critical reception  The earlier novels in the series received a generally positive reception from critics. One review considered it to be clever that Kinsella begins each chapter with an ominous letter to Becky from her bank. Readers seemed to like Becky, care about what was happening to her, as if for a friend. While she has faults, she is 'irresistibly daft. ' When it comes to reviewing this book, many agree that Sophie Kinsella has managed to combine two essential ingredients that make for a favourite among readers: abundant flashes of reality and a witty sense of humour. Women identified with the character and her situation. Reviews encouraged readers to 'stick to' these earlier books in the series, considering them better than the later books which appeared to have been written excessively quickly, although they would still satisfy those already faithful to the series.  Film adaptation  A film adaptation of the novels starring Isla Fisher as Becky Bloomwood, Hugh Dancy as Luke Brandon, and Krysten Ritter as Suze was released on 13 February 2009.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1093908/releaseinfo The film focused on some plots, while eliminating others to make room for the 2nd novel's plot Shopaholic Abroad. =Differences between Film and Novel= * The novel takes place in England, while the film is in the United States. * In the novel, Becky is a brunette with green eyes, while in the film, she's a redhead and has brown eyes. * In the novel, Becky describes Luke as 6'4 with dark hair and brown eyes, with a frown on his face. In the film, while retaining his dark hair, Luke's eyes are blue and is only 5'11. * In the novel, the Denny and George scarf that Becky purchases is described as being blue-gray. In the film, it's green. * In the novel, Becky works at Successful Savings a job she describes as being boring and just fell into, while in the film, she works at a gardening magazine. * The film omits the Webster family who are good friends of the Bloomwoods. As well as Martin and Janice's son, Tom, and his then fianc√©e, Lucy. * Becky's boss at Successful Savings in the novel, Philip, is also omitted and replaced by Luke, who in the novel owns Brandon Communications. * In the novel, Derek Smeath, is polite and professional, though at times persistent concerning Becky's debt issues. In the end, the two manages to work out a meeting. In the film, Smeath becomes more antagonistic each time Becky avoids meeting him. * The novel introduces Alicia Billington, a senior executive employee at Brandon Communications. She has a bitter history with Suze due to a previous incident (that Alicia caused) that got Suze fired. The film introduces her as a rival of Becky's who got the job at Alette. * In the novel, Suze is described as being blonde and aristocratic, although has problems with being a shopaholic. In the film, Suze is brunette and artistic. * In the novel, upon learning about the Websters' financial trouble due to her absentminded advice, Becky exposes Flagstaff Life's fraud via the British Tabloid magazine, \\"The Daily World\\". After squaring off with Becky on \\"The Morning Coffee\\", Luke conceded that she was right and refused to continue representing the bank who defrauds their customers. The film only has them talk about the mysterious girl with the green scarf. * Unlike in the film, Becky's parents are more cautious in their spending and tells Becky to shape up by cutting back on her spending or make more money. * In the novel, Suze helps make artistic frames, that leads to her having a successful frame business. The film completely omits this. * Unlike in the film, Becky never went to a support group for her shopping addiction until the end of the 6th novel, Mini Shopaholic. * In the novel, Clare Edwards is described as being boring, pale and smug. Becky never did like her for it. In the film, Clare is more expressive and sympathetic toward Becky concerning her credit card debts since she knows what it's like to be in debt herself. It is she who helps Becky attend a shopaholics support group, which Clare also attends just in case she relapses back to her old way.

In his first ethnographic book entitled Hip-Hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization, Condry explores issues of race, gender, language, musical history, and contemporary cultural politics, all as they relate to the Japanese rap music scene. He argues that performance sites, such as recording studios and nightclubs, are the specific paths that lead to cultural globalization. Condry, Ian. Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006. Condry believes that by viewing such locations more closely, we can then understand the specific dialogue that occurs between global/local, producer/consumer, and artist/industry. HIs second book, The Soul of Anime: Collaborative Creativity and Japan's Media Success Story, explores the questions, who makes anime and what makes it a global success? Based on fieldwork in Tokyo anime studios such as Madhouse, Gonzo, Aniplex and Studio 4C, the book examines the process of making Japanese animation. He describes screenwriting meetings, toy design sessions, and fan practices in an effort to show that solitary genius is less important that cross-industry collaborations. In addition, the work of fans, including fansubbers who are often regarded as simply pirates, are also integral to the dynamics that lead to the global spread of Japanese animation.

Biography  Bertrand Bitz's early musical education is quite eclectic. In his childhood, he studied solfege and played a brass instrument in the music school of his village band, l'Echo du Mont-Noble. Then he began to practice the organ and the guitar and gradually developed a specific taste for songwriting and interpretation of his self-written songs. The songs of Bertrand Bitz address a lot of themes, from social subjects (consumerism, unemployment) to philosophical interrogations (friendship, passion-love, death, separation). For example, the song Pour combien appears as an uncompromising condemnation of capitalist consumerism which tends to change love into a simple economic good. Bertrand Bitz also possesses a distinctive style. In his songs, lyrics are always in the foreground and are subtly underlined by a musical accompaniment made of uncluttered lines. In 2003, at this time singer of Hillside, a Swiss pop-rock group based in Sierre, Bitz released the album entitled Instants vol√©s (Stolen instants). The same year his artistic life was transformed by the meeting of Ludovic Pannatier, a lyrics writer. In 2005, Bitz, under his own name, released a second album, Tout √ßa nous poursuit (All that is pursuing us), with the collaboration of Ludovic Pannatier and Alexandra Bitz. Included in this album the song Lorsque nos yeux (When our eyes) wins a 4th prize at MyCokeMusic.ch contest in Z√ºrich. In 2007, he wins second prize at the famous Swiss singing contest \\"La m√©daille d'or de la chanson\\" in Saignel√©gier. There he sings En Thalasso. Among previous winners of this prestigious competition are Le bel Hubert (1981) or L'Homme Hareng Nu (2007), also known as Laurent Steulet. On February 1, 2008, Bertrand Bitz was one of Manuel Maury's guests in the prime time TV show \\"T√™tes en l'air\\" broadcast on Swiss French TV network (TSR). In April 2008, Bertrand Bitz released his first album aimed at a national diffusion : Multifaces.Bertrand Bitz. Multifaces. Froideville: Edit. Lugeon, 2008Giroud, Manuela. \\"Des notes dans la t√™te\\", in Le Nouvelliste (04/03/08) He also began to work with the manager Jacques S. who is the agent, in particular, of Sarclo. On April 1, 2008 he was received by G√©rard Suter in the program \\"Radio Paradiso\\" broadcast on Swiss French radio network Radio suisse romande (RSR). On that occasion, Bitz revealed the backgrounds behind the conception of Multifaces. He said he had intended not to create songs too similar but songs reflecting different moments of life. Good moments, he says, inspire more popular, more joyful, songs. Bad moments such as death, sorrow, heartbreak or something else which may affect you, are translated into more tormented songs.Interview of Bertrand Bitz by G√©rard Suter, Radio Paradiso, RSR (04/01/08) Included in Multifaces, L'attente (The wait) is representative of the dinstinctive personal process of reflection which leads Bertrand Bitz to songwriting. In this case, L'attente develops Bertrand Bitz's reflection on the painful consequences of passion-love. \\"Seul face au silence, face √† l'indiff√©rence, l'attente est si longue et la souffrance si douce...\\"Alone face up to silence, face up to indifference, the wait is so long and the suffering so sweet...\\" [L'attente in Bertrand Bitz. Multifaces. Froideville: Edit. Lugeon, 2008]\\" are the words Bertrand Bitz sings. From April 4 to 6, 2008, Bertrand Bitz gives the premiere of Multifaces at Interface theater in Sion.

PCI contains a small cysteine-rich module, called a T-knot scaffold, that is shared by several different protein families, including the EGF family.

Mechanism of action is inhibition of receptor dimerization and receptor trans-autophosphorylation induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF). PCI blocks the formation and activation of ErbB1/ErbB-2 (EGFR and HER2) heterodimers that have a prominent role in carcinoma development. PCI also inhibits transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha).

Providers of study abroad vary enormously in terms of organizational structure, program model and type, and services offered to the participants. Given the tremendous growth in the number of U.S. students studying abroad over the last two decades, the study abroad industry has become more crowded and competitive in recent years. The study abroad business has traditionally been a cottage industry with a hodgepodge of domestic and foreign universities, for-profit and non-profit independent organizations providing thousands of programs in more than 100 countries. Some, like the Danish Institute for Study Abroad, offer their own programs, with their own courses and curricular expectations. Others, like the Institute for the International Education of Students (IES) and The College of Global Studies at Arcadia University, offer some of their own programs, but also are known for acting as intermediaries‚Äîoffering student services, plus a quality control stamp, for those students enrolling in foreign universities who want more of a cushion than what's available when they directly enroll through international student offices abroad. According to the Institute of International Education, the majority of U.S. college students studying abroad, about 72 percent, participate on programs sponsored by their home institution. However, at least 28 percent of the approximately 260,000 Americans who studied abroad in academic year 2008/09 study through an outside program. Overview Outside providers like IES and The College of Global Studies at Arcadia University act as intermediaries by assisting program participants with logistics like course registration and housing arrangements. While models differ, academic and social guidance is generally included throughout the duration of a program, such as orientation, support services, field trips and cultural activities. Additionally, providers are typically able to provide transcripts that ease credit transfer for students who enroll in their programs based at universities abroad ‚Äì offer all these extra services, of course, at an extra cost. Independent providers, like Help Me Abroad, offer solutions to adapt to international students‚Äô requests. They act as intermediaries and allow a wider choice for students who can pick the state, university and program to attend instead of applying to premade programs. Relationship with U.S. universities At many campuses, study abroad programs are run by multiple companies and non-profit institutes that offer colleges generous incentives to increase enrollments. An influential article that appeared in The New York Times in 2007 highlighted that this can include free and subsidized travel overseas for officials, back-office services to defray operating expenses, stipends to market the programs to students, unpaid membership on advisory councils and boards, and even cash bonuses and commissions on student-paid fees. This money generally goes directly to colleges, not always to the students who take the trips. Critics say that these and similar arrangements, which are seldom disclosed, typically limit student options and drive up prices for gaining international credentials compared with the most economical alternative ‚Äî enrolling directly in a foreign university, paying generally lower tuition to that institution and having the credits transferred. Some campuses require students to use one of several affiliated providers, but some even have exclusive arrangements with study abroad agents, further limiting options.

Although this is one of the lesser known songs from Born to Run, \\"Night\\" has become somewhat of a stage favorite for the E Street Band. The song was not immediately played during the 1975 portions of the Born to Run Tour, but later became a frequent set-opener, especially during the 1976 and 1977 legs. It was still sometimes being used as an opening song decades later during the 2007‚Äì2008 Magic Tour. The mood of the music is mostly exciting as are the lyrics which have a romantic quality as well. The music is propelled by Gary Tallent's bass. It is similar to the album's famous title track in that both songs deal with men and their fast cars. The lyrics mostly describe the central character as a blue collar worker who, after working a full day, runs off into the night to go drag racing and search for the love of a woman. For the protagonist, the only freedom and joy comes when he is on the highway, and he lives for the nights and weekends when he can escape work. Like a couple of other songs on Born to Run, \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\" and \\"She's the One\\", the story of the relationship is told in a flashback. The desperation and darkness of the lyrics makes a strong contrast with some of the other songs on the Born to Run album, which glorify night life. Although \\"Night\\" and \\"Born to Run\\" show Springsteen beginning to deal seriously with blue collar protagonists, he would develop the theme further on his next album, Darkness on the Edge of Town, in which he would portray additional facets of blue collar working life on songs such as \\"Badlands\\", \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\", \\"The Promised Land\\", \\"Prove It All Night\\" and, especially, \\"Factory\\". This central theme would later be explored on The River, especially in the song \\"Out in the Street\\", and became a focus of Springsteen's post-Darkness on the Edge of Town songwriting dealing with working class characters leading dead-end lives. In 1979, it was released as the B-side of the \\"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\\" single in Europe. The song was recorded in a style similar to the album's title track \\"Born to Run\\". Springsteen wanted to emulate record producer Phil Spector's Wall of Sound technique where multiple instruments played at the same time with their sounds bleeding into each other's microphones. The result is a \\"wash\\" of sound where some individual instruments are difficult to define, yet blend in to create a dense orchestral ambiance.

It was located in the present-day municipality of Link√∂ping in √ñsterg√∂tland.  History  The exact year of the foundation is not known. The abbey was founded by King Inge the Elder of Sweden and Queen Helenashe later entered it herself as a nun on the orders of Pope Paschal II, which gives a date range for the foundation: Paschal became pope in 1099; the date of Inge's death is disputed, but probably occurred around 1105 or a little later. In the following decade King Inge the Younger and Queen Ulvhild made large donations to it. The original buildings burned down in the early 13th century, but were rebuilt, and a new church was dedicated in the presence of Magnus III and Hedwig of Holstein in 1289. Vreta Abbey was a house of Benedictine nuns until 1162, when it was turned into a Cistercian nunnery. The first Cistercian abbess was Ingegerd, sister of Charles VII. A second sister, Helena, widow of Canute V of Denmark, entered Vreta as a nun after her husband's death in 1157, and other members of the Swedish and Danish royal families were also here. In the 13th century, the Swedish princess Helena Sverkersdotter were among its abbesses. It was a prestigious establishment, and the church is the burial place of the kings Inge the Elder, Philip, Inge the Younger and Magnus II, and the princes Ragnvald (son of Inge the Elder) and Sune, plus according to an older sourceMagnus Bor√¶n in Klostret i Vreta i √ñsterg√∂tland 1724 & 2003 p. 31 the latter's young nephews, Alf and Boleslaw Johansson. It served as a school for daughters of Sweden's ruling families and nobility. Vreta Abbey has entered folklore as the scene during the 13th century of a number of prominent abductions of girls for marriages disapproved of by their families.see Maiden Abduction from Vreta Vreta was the mother house of Askeby Abbey near Link√∂ping, Riseberga Abbey in N√§rke and Solberga Abbey in Gotland. =Dissolution= As a result of the Reformation the abbey was forbidden to accept any new novices, but was otherwise treated very leniently. It continued in use as a school for daughters of the nobility and a retirement place for old noblewomen, and in 1529, the king allowed the last abbess, Sigrid Botholfsdotter (d. 1538), to buy it, and its activities continued undisturbed. Vreta Abby received the nuns from the former Askeby Abbey and Sk√§nninge Abbey when they were closed in 1529 and 1544 respectively. In 1536, Gustav I gave the abbey and its assets to his Catholic mother-in-law Ebba Eriksdotter Vasa; she spent her last years here and died in 1549. There were still nuns here in 1562, and the last two of whom, Brita Gisledotter and Kirstin M√•nsdotter, died in 1582. Vreta Abbey's remaining church now belongs to the Church of Sweden. Site and buildings The church continued in use as a Lutheran parish church and still stands today, distinguished by its possession of a medieval hagioscope. The remaining buildings were mostly allowed to fall into ruin. Between 1916 and 1926 the ruins were excavated, and large portions to the north of the church, which was itself restored between 1914 and 1917, remain visible. The finds, including an unusual wooden waterpipe, are on display in the adjoining museum. Apart from the church, the only monastic building completely preserved is the barn, although some walls were reconstructed in the 20th century. The stones from the former refectory were used to build the tower of Link√∂ping Cathedral.

In Willa Cather and Material Culture: Real-World Writing, Writing The Real World, ed. by Janis Stout. University of Alabama Press, 2005. pp. 66-77\\\\. According to Bucker, Cather used British spellings such as \\"colour\\" and \\"plough\\" for the latter part of her career, beginning in the early 1920s. In 1932, it was published in the collection Obscure Destinies.  Part One  ‚ÄúNeighbour Rosicky‚Äù is the story of a 65-year-old Czech farmer, Anton Rosicky, who now resides in Nebraska with his wife and six children. The story begins with Anton at Dr. Ed Burleigh's office, where he learns that he has a bad heart. The doctor informs him that he can no longer continue to work the fields, and should stick to less strenuous chores about the home and barn. The Rosicky family's kindness is reflected in Dr. Burleigh's (whom the family refers to as ‚ÄúDr. Ed‚Äù) recollection of the hospitality shown in their home after delivering a neighbor's baby. He feels sorry for them, as they never flourish in life despite their compassion for others.  Part Two  On his way home from the doctor's, Rosicky stops at the general store to buy fabric and candy for his wife. Before returning home, he stops to admire the graveyard that borders his property. The snow reminds him that winter brings rest for nature and man. When he arrives home he explains to his wife that his heart ‚Äúain‚Äôt so good like it used to be.‚Äù Together they recall their loving marriage, and the difference between themselves and the other farmers in the area. The Rosickys prefer to live happy and keep their children healthy, rather than having money and selling their cream off to a creamery.  Part Three  Out of worry, Mary travels to see Dr. Burleigh to find out more about Rosicky's heart. After her visit, she talks with her boys to make sure that he is not doing anything too strenuous. Finally, Rosicky stops fighting and gives in to the doctor's orders. Rosicky spends his time that winter staying indoors doing carpentry and tailoring. He kept all of his tools on a shelf in ‚ÄúFather‚Äôs corner.‚Äù While sewing, he begins thinking about his past tailoring in New York City when he first came to America. Although his wages were adequate, he did not save any money because he loaned it out to friends, went to the opera, and spent it on girls. He was unhappy in the city, and realized that he needed to be in contact with the earth; so at the age of 35, he moved west to Nebraska to start a new life as a farmer.  Part Four  Rosicky's oldest son, Rudolph, and his ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù wife, Polly, rent a farm close by. Rosicky is worried about their marriage because Polly is a city girl, not used to having to be on a farm. He is concerned that because of Polly's unhappiness, Rudolph will take a job in the city where he can make more money, and she can be around the life she is accustomed to. Rosicky offers to loan them the family car to go into town on this and future Saturday evenings. To make sure they go out that night, Rosicky also does the dishes and cleans up the kitchen for Polly.  Part Five  On the day before Christmas, Rosicky is reminded of his time in London, where he was faced with the difficulties of finding food and shelter. He begins to worry about the crops and if they will be able to handle the tough winter that is ahead of them. Mary attempts to lighten the mood by reminding him of a year in which the heat destroyed the crops around the Fourth of July, and how he showed no despair at that time. This is followed by numerous stories told back and forth amongst the family, one of which recounts an episode when Rosicky was in London and stole a goose from his landlady. Afterwards, he felt such guilt that he searched the city to find a way to replace it, eventually meeting wealthy Czechs who gave him the money he needed. Polly is extremely moved by this story, and decides that she wants to invite Rudolph's family to their home for New Year's dinner.  Part Six  At the end of the story, Rosicky imagines the future of his children and hopes that they do not suffer like he did throughout the beginning part of his life. Rosicky goes to Rudolph's farm to help him tend to the alfalfa field. The strenuous labor causes him to have a heart attack, and Polly comes to Rosicky's aid and calls him ‚ÄúFather‚Äù for the first time. She realizes that his gratefulness and compassion comes across as a love that no one has ever shown her before. Rudolph and Polly later take Rosicky back to his home, where he dies the next morning. At the end of the story, Dr. Burleigh stops at the graveyard where Rosicky is buried to pay his respects. He reflects on Rosicky's fulfilling life and how it ‚Äúseemed to him complete and beautiful.‚Äù RIP to Rosicky.  Literary criticism  Willa Cather migrated in 1883 with her family to the plains of Nebraska. This move gave her firsthand experience in order to write stories of the immigrant experience. Clifton Fadiman, in a review of Cather's work, states ‚Äúno one has better commemorated the virtues of the Bohemian and Scandinavian immigrants whose enterprise and heroism won an empire.‚ÄùFadiman, Clifford. Rev. of \\"Neighbour Rosicky\\" by Willa Cather. Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism. Ed. Dennis Poupard. Detroit: Gale, 1983, 94-96. In ‚ÄúNeighbour Rosicky‚Äù Cather portrays a realistic image of the immigration and settlement process, through Anton Rosicky's story. She specifically represents the Czech immigrant ideals which are independence, hard work, family unity, and freedom.

The community is made up of Greeks from Russia who were deported by force from that country to Uzbekistan in the 1940s, and political refugees from Greece. About 30,000 Greeks lived in the country before World War II and a further 11,000 arrived after the Greek Civil War and the defeat of Democratic Army of Greece. Their numbers have dwindled from a high of some 40,000 in the 1960s. The main reason is emigration to Greece after the end of the Cold War when laws allowed the return of all ethnic Greeks who had been exiled for political reasons after the Greek Civil War.

Four were built by Vickers at Bexleyheath, one of these was subsequently modified to become the F.B.26A. Design and development The design was a development of the earlier Vickers F.B.12 prototypes;Lamberton, 1960. p 78. and was a two-bay biplane with a high-mounted nacelle for the pilot and an initial armament of two .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Guns. Behind this was a water-cooled 200 hp (150 kW) Hispano-Suiza engine driving the propeller. The tailplane was mounted on four booms with a single fin and rudder. After modifications to the radiator layout and wing structure and re-armed with three Lewis guns in an Eeman mounting capable of firing up at a 45¬∞ angle to engage enemy bombers from below, being numbered B1484, the FB.26 was passed to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Martlesham Heath for evaluation. The prototype was destroyed on 25 August 1917 when Harold Barnwell, the Vickers test pilot failed to recover from a spin.Mason 1992 p.108 A second aircraft, B1486, was built and was operated first by No. 39 Squadron at Woodford and then passed to No. 141 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps in February 1918. Service evaluation was unfavorable: although performance was satisfactory, its handling qualities were poor. A third aircraft, B1485, powered by a 230 hp (170 kW) Bentley rotary engine and modified for ground-attack was built in 1918 but by the time it was built the Sopwith Salamander had already been ordered for production and development was abandoned. Three further aircraft had been ordered and allocated service numbers but it is not known whether any of these were built.

This semisynthetic derivative of the indolocarbazole K252a was investigated by Cephalon as a treatment for various types of cancer. It is an inhibitor of the kinases fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), tropomyosin receptor kinase (trk) A (TrkA), TrkB and TrkC. Uses Lestaurtinib has undergone clinical trials for the treatment of various cancers, including pancreatic and prostate cancers, V617F JAK2 positive polycythemia vera and essential thrombocytosis, and refractory neuroblastoma. The most significant effort was invested in developing lestaurtinib for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). 24% of the adult AML-affected population exhibits FLT3 mutations, which are associated with an increased likelihood of relapse and mortality after treatment above the general AML population. FLT3 mutations suppress apoptosis in mutated cells, but lestaurtinib has the potential to overcome this suppression by inhibiting FLT3 kinase activity. Preclinical studies Lestaurtinib was identified early on as a trk receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, with a concentration inhibiting 50% of tyrosine kinase activity (IC50) of 25 nM. In vivo trials demonstrated a 50‚Äì70% reduction in tumor burden for xenografted pancreatic and prostate cancers; however, subsequent clinical trials for pancreatic and prostate cancers did not achieve the endpoints specified. In 2001, lestaurtinib was shown to have an IC50 of 2‚Äì3 nM with respect to FLT3 tyrosine kinase, with no significant effect on structurally similar tyrosine kinases at those concentrations. Since leukemias typically develop multiple pathways of survival, lestaurtinib was studied in conjunction with traditional chemotherapy; it was determined that, whereas lestaurtinib treatment prior to chemotherapy produced antagonistic results, lestaurtinib treatment concurrent or subsequent to chemotherapy produced synergistic results. Most recently, lestaurtinib‚Äôs potency as a JAK2 inhibitor was investigated. Clinical trials Lestaurtinib was filed as Investigational New Drug (IND) number 76431. Initial Phase I studies with lestaurtinib involved determination of pharmacokinetic parameters following a single dose in healthy volunteers. Next, safety and tolerability were investigated in a Phase I trial involving 30 volunteers with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. Although there were no notable tumor responses, a strong correlation was noted between dose and adverse events, with the primary adverse event reported being gastrointestinal reaction. A Phase II study in 18 patients with pancreatic cancer was initiated for combination treatment with lestaurtinib and gemcitabine, but efficacy of lestaurtinib was not observed. In 2004, a Phase I/II study involved 17 patients at 2 locations with relapsed, refractory poor-risk AML with FLT3 mutations; this study demonstrated effective FLT3 inhibition by lestaurtinib. A multi-center Phase II study of 29 patients above the age of 60 was initiated for treatment with lestaurtinib alone; the results, reported in 2006, indicated that the primary endpoint of complete remission was not achieved in any participants. Despite this failure, another multi-center Phase II trial involving 42 patients combined lestaurtinib with conventional chemotherapy; the results, reported in 2005, indicated that twice as many patients showed a clinical response when treated with lestaurtinib as compared to those not treated. Consequently, a Phase III trial was initiated with 224 patients for lestaurtinib following chemotherapy; no significant difference in cancer remission was seen between patients treated with chemotherapy alone and with lestaurtinib and chemotherapy, according to results in a 2011 report. Additional clinical trials have been initiated since this Phase III trial. These include a multi-center Phase II trial involving 37 patients with V617F JAK2 positive polycythemia vera and essential thrombocytosis; results published in 2014 indicate that the trial did not achieve the endpoint of 15% reduction of V617F JAK2 allele burden in 15% of patients. A Phase I study of 47 patients reported in 2010 that treatment of refractory neuroblastoma was well tolerated at the recommended doses, and an additional Phase I study in children with refractory neuroblastoma was completed in 2011. Phase I results were reported in 2015 for a lestaurtinib trial involving patients with V617F JAK2 positive myelofibrosis. Commercialization and intellectual property Lestaurtinib was studied by Cephalon, an international pharmaceutical company based in Frazer, PA. Founded in 1987, Cephalon had grown to a Fortune 1000 company by 2011, with 4000 employees and 170 products sold in 100 countries. Lestaurtinib was mentioned as one of two oncology drugs being developed by Cephalon in a 2007 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) report. According to this report, in addition to holding patent applications involving methods of treatment, formulations, and polymorphs of lestaurtinib, Cephalon held a composition of matter patent for lestaurtinib in the United States that would expire in 2008. In 2006, the U.S. FDA granted lestaurtinib orphan drug status for the treatment of AML, reflecting the significant need but minimal market for treatment of AML. In the wake of preliminary failing results for the Phase III clinical trial involving Lestaurtinib, Cephalon founder and CEO Frank Baldino, Ph.D., issued the following statement in 2009: In 2011, Cephalon was acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NASDAQ: TEVA) for $6.8 billion in cash, making Cephalon a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva. This acquisition was in line with Teva‚Äôs vision to expand their branded and specialty drug offerings, more than doubling branded drug sales to a value of $7 billion. In their 2011 annual SEC report, Teva did not include lestaurtinib in a listing of major oncology drugs in their pipeline. A significant number of patents are related to lestaurtinib. A Google patent search yields 1,278 patents involving lestaurtinib, 6 of which include lestaurtinib in the title and 8 of which are assigned to Cephalon. 2,017 patents involve CEP-701, none of which include CEP-701 in the title and 8 of which are assigned to Cephalon. 13,666 patents are related to FLT3 inhibitors, 7 of which include FLT3 inhibition in the title and 3 of which are assigned to Cephalon.

In 1987 the State Government of Victoria decided to merge four schools: Beaumaris High School, Hampton High School, Highett High School, and Sandringham Technical School. It was at the time when the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) was first introduced as the main certificate for the later years of schooling. The Sandringham Technical School site became the senior campus of Sandringham College; Hampton High, Beaumaris High and Highett High became Years 7‚Äì10 junior campuses.  Campuses  Sandringham College comprises the following two campuses: * Year 10-12 Campus (formerly Sandringham Campus and Sandringham Technical School), located at 11 Holloway Rd, Sandringham. It has a student population of approximately 760. * Year 7‚Äì9 Campus (formerly Highett Campus and Highett High School), at 356 Bluff Rd, Sandringham. It has a student population of approximately 435. The former Hampton Campus was closed in December 1988. The former Beaumaris Campus closed in December 2015, and Beaumaris Secondary College, a stand-alone school, was opened on that site in 2018. The Year 7-9 Campus caters to students in Years 7‚Äì9, whilst the Year 10-12 campus is designed for the education of students studying for Years 10 - VCE, VCAL, or undertaking Vocational Education and Training (VET) studies. The school has an international program, with sister schools in Britain and Asia. Controversies When the school introduced uniforms in 2014, it provoked uproar from students who objected to uniforms as being against the culture of the school.When the school introduced blazers to the uniform in 2019 in an effort to improve the image of the school, the junior campus faculty threatened to expel any student who complained about them, the item became more unpopular after the school announced that the blazer would continue to be worn in the summer months, and consequently the faculty were booed in the school assembly. The school countered by declaring that the blazers improved confidence and boosted academic results.  Architecture and history  Both campuses of Sandringham College were designed by the Public Works Department of Victoria and built in the Light Timber Construction style. * Highett High School was constructed in 1955 with Stage 2 extensions made in 1957 and 1960. * Sandringham Technical School had two LTC wings constructed in 1955.

By these we mean that for all t :f(t+\\\\pi)=f(t), and if p is a number with 0 < p < \\\\pi , the equation f(t+p) = f(t) must fail for some t . It is named after George William Hill, who introduced it in 1886. Because f(t) has period \\\\pi , the Hill equation can be rewritten using the Fourier series of f(t): :\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}+\\\\left(\\\\theta_0+2\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\theta_n \\\\cos(2nt)+\\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty \\\\phi_m \\\\sin(2mt) \\\\right ) y=0. Important special cases of Hill's equation include the Mathieu equation (in which only the terms corresponding to n = 0, 1 are included) and the Meissner equation. Hill's equation is an important example in the understanding of periodic differential equations. Depending on the exact shape of f(t) , solutions may stay bounded for all time, or the amplitude of the oscillations in solutions may grow exponentially. The precise form of the solutions to Hill's equation is described by Floquet theory. Solutions can also be written in terms of Hill determinants. Aside from its original application to lunar stability, the Hill equation appears in many settings including the modeling of a quadrupole mass spectrometer, as the one-dimensional Schr√∂dinger equation of an electron in a crystal, quantum optics of two-level systems, and in accelerator physics.

K√°ri S√∂lmundarson was a Hebridean viking and soldier of fortune who lived in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries. He is a major character in Nj√°l's Saga. K√°ri was the son of Solmund, who was the son of Thorbjorn \\"Jarl's Champion,\\" an Icelander exiled before the establishment of the Althing for murder.Grettir's Saga ¬ß 10. Grettir's Saga refers to K√°ri as \\"K√°ri the Singed,\\" a reference to his escape from the burning of Bergthorshvoll. Early career It is unknown where K√°ri was born (though possibly Iceland). He was, however, a hirdman of Sigurd the Stout, jarl of Orkney. He came to the rescue of Helgi Nj√°lsson and Grim Nj√°lsson, the sons of Nj√°ll √ûorgeirsson of Bergthorshvoll, Iceland in the 990's. The brothers, who were on a trading expedition to the British Isles, had come under attack by the vikings Snaekolf and Grjotgard Mordansson. After killing the raiders, K√°ri brought the Nj√°lssons to Orkney, where they stayed for a time at Jarl Sigurd's court and fought in his campaigns in northern and central Scotland.Nj√°l's Saga ¬ß¬ß 83-86. K√°ri came to the aid of Helgi and Grim again when the brothers were arrested by Hakon Jarl of Norway for indirectly aiding in the escape of their fellow Icelander, Thrain Sigfusson.Nj√°l's Saga ¬ß¬ß 88-89. In Iceland When Helgi and Grim returned to Iceland, K√°ri accompanied them. He bought a landholding at Dyrholmar, but settled at Bergthorshvoll, where he married Nj√°l's daughter Helga and became close friends with Nj√°l's son Skarph√©√∞inn.Nj√°l's Saga ¬ß 90. He likely became at least nominally a Christian when Iceland converted during the Althing of 1000. K√°ri became entangled in the Nj√°lssons' blood feud with the clan of Thrain Sigfusson, and participated in Skarph√©√∞inn's ambush and murder of Thrain.Nj√°l's Saga ¬ß¬ß 90-128. In around 1010, Thrain's allies and kinsmen, led by Flosi √û√≥r√∞arson, attacked Bergthorshvoll and burned it with its inhabitants inside. K√°ri managed to escape under cover of smoke, but his friends Helgi and Skarph√©√∞inn were both killed. Nj√°l, his wife Bergthora, and K√°ri's son Thord all refused Flosi's offer of reprieve and died in the flames.Nj√°l's Saga ¬ß¬ß 128-130. K√°ri¬¥s sword was Fj√∂rsv√°fnir. Aftermath of the Burning K√°ri gathered supporters and prompted the prosecution of the Burners, and there is a legal joust between the parties. Fighting broke out and almost escalated into a full-scale civil war until Snorri Go√∞i and his followers separated the belligerents. As part of an imposed settlement, the Burners were exiled for three years, but K√°ri attacked them on their way home, and pursued those who escaped abroad. K√°ri and a small group of followers spent the next several years taking vengeance on the Burners, following them to Orkney and Wales. In a particularly brazen display, K√°ri entered the hall of Jarl Sigurd of Orkney as Gunnar Lambason was telling a slanderous version of the story of the burning of Bergthorshvoll. K√°ri killed Gunnar and composed the verse: :Men bold of battle, :boast of the burning of Nj√°l. :But have you heard, :how we harried them? :Those givers of gold had a good return, :ravens feasted on their raw flesh.Nj√°l's Saga ¬ß 155. K√°ri stayed in Caithness during the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, when Jarl Sigurd and his allies fought against Brian Boru, High King of Ireland. During his stay in Scotland his wife Helga died. Flosi returned to Iceland after a pilgrimage to Rome. K√°ri followed, but was shipwrecked near Flosi‚Äôs home. Testing Flosi‚Äôs nobility he went to him for help, and they arranged a final peace. K√°ri married Flosi's niece Hildigunn, who was the widow of Hoskuld Thrainsson, the son of Thrain Sigfusson and foster-son of Nj√°l. Descendants K√°ri had four children with Helga, his first wife: his son Thord, who died during the Burning of Bergthorshvoll, and the daughters Thorgerd, Ragnheid, and Valgerd. By his second wife Hildigunn, K√°ri had three sons: Starkadr, Thord and Flosi. Notes Resources *Cook, Robert, trans. Nj√°l's Saga. Penguin Classics, 2002. *Durrenberger, E.

These youth must transition to adulthood without the support of family, leaving the youth to learn to cook and care for themselves, find jobs (often without a high school degree), and apply to college on their own. Many of these youth end up using drugs and alcohol or participating in prostitution to earn money.The Exchange, Transitional Living Programs Move Homeless Youth Closer to Independence, March 2006 TLPs provide youth with safe and stable living arrangements, which can be in the form of host family homes, group homes, maternity group homes, or supervised apartments. TLPs also provide training and support services, either directly or by referral, to help youth develop the life skills needed to gain independence and live on their own. Types of services include: life skills training, including financial planning and responsibility, food preparation, and parenting skills; educational opportunities, including GED preparation, high-school completion support, college counseling, and vocational training; employment opportunities and assistance like career counseling, resume writing, and interview skills; substance abuse treatment or prevention; group or individual counseling; and medical care, including routine physicals and emergency treatment.

Antonio Giuseppe Anselmi (6 October 1876, Nicolosi - 27 May 1929, Zoagli) was an Italian operatic tenor. He became famous throughout Europe during the first decade of the 20th century for his stylish performances of lyric roles. He never sang in the United States. Life and career Anselmi came from the Catania area on the east coast of Sicily. He studied violin and piano at the Naples Conservatory as a teenager, and then joined an operetta troupe with which he toured Italy and the Middle East. The music publisher Giulio Ricordi allegedly heard him and advised him to undergo vocal instruction with Luigi Mancinelli, one of Italy's leading conductors. According to some sources, Anselmi's first appearance on stage in an operatic role happened as early as 1896, when he sang Turiddu (Cavalleria rusticana) in Greece. His Italian operatic debut took place in Genoa in 1900, and his career took off quickly from there. He appeared initially at the Teatro San Carlo, Naples, in late December of that year and, in 1901, at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London. Engagements at La Scala, Milan, and the Monte-Carlo Opera ensued in 1904 and 1908, respectively. He was much admired at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, and also sang in Brussels, Berlin and Vienna prior to World War I. His greatest triumphs, however, occurred in the cities of St Petersburg (often opposite Lina Cavalieri), Warsaw and, in particular, Madrid, where he even eclipsed the famous tenor Enrico Caruso in popularity. Although his style of singing was not liked at first by the London critics, he soon became a favorite with audiences in the British capital, and he sang intermittently at Covent Garden until 1909. Anselmi's operatic career tailed off at the end of World War I; his last known appearances occurred in 1918. He spent his remaining years teaching and composing in Italy. Anselmi died in 1929 of pneumonia, at Zoagli in the Italian province of Liguria. He had retained a deep affection for Madrid, and he bequeathed his heart to that city, where it was exhibited inside an urn at the Teatro Real museum. Voice and recordings Giuseppe Anselmi Giuseppe Anselmi Commentators often describe Anselmi (and his famous contemporary Alessandro Bonci) as being among the last exponents of the old bel canto method of Italian singing, which was largely supplanted in Italy during the early 1900s by a more forceful mode of vocalism associated with Wagner's music dramas and verismo opera. Anselmi was a good-looking man with an arresting stage presence, which made him extremely popular with many opera- goers. He was sometimes referred to as Il tenore di donne (the tenor of/for women) which apparently had a double meaning; details of his personal life have never emerged. He possessed a sweet-toned if rather throaty and fluttery lyric tenor voice, which he employed with memorable grace and elegance. Anselmi was noted for his performances as Almaviva and Don Ottavio, but he also excelled in the roles of Edgardo, Ernesto (in Don Pasquale), Duca di Mantua, Alfredo, Faust, Enzo, Cavaradossi, Loris and Lensky, among others. Anselmi recorded for Fonotipia Records in Milan (1907-1910), with excerpts from Don Pasquale, Rigoletto, Pagliacci, Fedora, Werther, Manon, Luisa Miller, Les p√™cheurs de perles, Don Giovanni, Cavalleria rusticana, Mignon, L'elisir d'amore, Rom√©o et Juliette, La boh√®me, La Gioconda, Il barbiere di Siviglia, Tosca, Iris, Carmen, Manon Lescaut, Lucia di Lammermoor, Eugene Onegin, Lucrezia Borgia, Manru (of Paderewski), La favorite, Mefistofele, Marcella, Cos√¨ fan tutte, Martha, Il duca d'Alba, Le maschere, \\"Stabat mater\\" (of Pergolesi), Verdi Requiem, Serse, Aida, L'africaine, La traviata, Gitana, and various songs; and Edison Records in London (1913), with excerpts from Pagliacci, La Gioconda, La favorite, Les p√™cheurs de perles, L'africaine, Lucia di Lammermoor, Mignon, and Cavalleria rusticana.

As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as Hay Fever, Private Lives, Design for Living, Present Laughter and Blithe Spirit, have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta Bitter Sweet and comic revues), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel Pomp and Circumstance, and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works, as well as those of others. At the outbreak of the Second World War Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an Academy Honorary Award in 1943 for his naval film drama In Which We Serve and was knighted in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\", \\"London Pride\\" and \\"I Went to a Marvellous Party\\". Coward's plays and songs achieved new popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including Graham Payn, his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously.

Streatfeild died from tuberculosis in 1915, but Mrs Astley Cooper continued to encourage her late friend's prot√©g√©, who remained a frequent guest at her estate, Hambleton Hall in Rutland.Hoare, pp. 39‚Äì43 Coward continued to perform during most of the First World War, appearing at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1916 in The Happy Family and on tour with Amy Brandon Thomas's company in Charley's Aunt. In 1917, he appeared in The Saving Grace, a comedy produced by Hawtrey. Coward recalled in his memoirs, \\"My part was reasonably large and I was really quite good in it, owing to the kindness and care of Hawtrey's direction. He took endless trouble with me... and taught me during those two short weeks many technical points of comedy acting which I use to this day.\\"Coward (Present Indicative), p. 66 In 1918, Coward was conscripted into the Artists Rifles but was assessed as unfit for active service because of a tubercular tendency, and he was discharged on health grounds after nine months.Lesley, pp. 41‚Äì42 That year he appeared in the D. W. Griffith film Hearts of the World in an uncredited role. He sold short stories to several magazines to help his family financially. He also began writing plays, collaborating on the first two (Ida Collaborates (1917) and Women and Whisky (1918)) with his friend Esm√© Wynne.\\"Plays and Musicals\\", The Noel Coward Society, accessed 8 February 2009 His first solo effort as a playwright was The Rat Trap (1918) which was eventually produced at the Everyman Theatre, Hampstead, in October 1926.Thaxter, John. \\"The Rat Trap\\" , British Theatre Guide, 2006, accessed 8 February 2009 During these years, he met Lorn McNaughtan, who became his private secretary and served in that capacity for more than forty years, until her death. = Inter-war successes = In 1920, at the age of 20, Coward starred in his own play, the light comedy I'll Leave It to You. After a three-week run in Manchester it opened in London at the New Theatre (renamed the No√´l Coward Theatre in 2006), his first full-length play in the West End.Thaxter, John. I'll Leave It To You , British Theatre Guide, 2009 Neville Cardus's praise in The Manchester Guardian was grudging.Cardus, Neville. \\"Gaiety Theatre\\", The Manchester Guardian, 4 May 1920, p. 13 Notices for the London production were mixed, but encouraging. The Observer commented, \\"Mr Coward... has a sense of comedy, and if he can overcome a tendency to smartness, he will probably produce a good play one of these days.\\"Ervine, St John. \\"At the Play\\", The Observer, 25 July 1920, p. 9 The Times, on the other hand, was enthusiastic: \\"It is a remarkable piece of work from so young a head ‚Äì spontaneous, light, and always 'brainy'.\\"\\"I'll Leave It to You\\", The Times, 22 July 1920, p. 10 Coward in The Knight of the Burning Pestle in 1920 The play ran for a month (and was Coward's first play seen in America), after which Coward returned to acting in works by other writers, starring as Ralph in The Knight of the Burning Pestle in Birmingham and then London.Coward (Present Indicative), pp. 104‚Äì05 and 112 He did not enjoy the role, finding Francis Beaumont and his sometime collaborator John Fletcher \\"two of the dullest Elizabethan writers ever known ... I had a very, very long part, but I was very, very bad at it\\".Castle, p. 38 Nevertheless, The Manchester Guardian thought that Coward got the best out of the role,\\"The Knight of the Burning Pestle\\", The Manchester Guardian, 25 November 1920, p. 14 and The Times called the play \\"the jolliest thing in London\\".\\"A Jacobean Romp\\", The Times, 25 November 1920, p. 10 Coward completed a one-act satire, The Better Half, about a man's relationship with two women. It had a short run at The Little Theatre, London, in 1922. The critic St John Ervine wrote of the piece, \\"When Mr Coward has learned that tea-table chitter-chatter had better remain the prerogative of women he will write more interesting plays than he now seems likely to write.\\"Ervine, St John. \\"New Grand Guignol Series\\", The Observer, 4 June 1922, p. 9 The play was thought to be lost until a typescript was found in 2007 in the archive of the Lord Chamberlain's Office, the official censor of stage plays in the UK until 1968.Thorpe, Vanessa. \\"Coward's long-lost satire was almost too 'daring' about women\\", The Observer, 16 September 2007, accessed 22 September 2016 In 1921, Coward made his first trip to America, hoping to interest producers there in his plays. Although he had little luck, he found the Broadway theatre stimulating. He absorbed its smartness and pace into his own work, which brought him his first real success as a playwright with The Young Idea. The play opened in London in 1923, after a provincial tour, with Coward in one of the leading roles.Hoare, pp. 89‚Äì91 The reviews were good: \\"Mr No√´l Coward calls his brilliant little farce a 'comedy of youth', and so it is. And youth pervaded the Savoy last night, applauding everything so boisterously that you felt, not without exhilaration, that you were in the midst of a 'rag'.\\"\\"New Play at the Savoy\\", The Times, 2 February 1923, p. 8 One critic, who noted the influence of Bernard Shaw on Coward's writing, thought more highly of the play than of Coward's newly found fans: \\"I was unfortunately wedged in the centre of a group of his more exuberant friends who greeted each of his sallies with 'That's a No√´lism!'\\"\\"The Young Idea\\", The Observer, 4 February 1923, p. 11 The play ran in London from 1 February to 24 March 1923, after which Coward turned to revue, co-writing and performing in Andr√© Charlot's London Calling!Coward (Present Indicative), pp. 112 and 150 Coward with Lilian Braithwaite, his co-star in The Vortex and the mother of his close friend Joyce Carey In 1924, Coward achieved his first great critical and financial success as a playwright with The Vortex. The story is about a nymphomaniac socialite and her cocaine-addicted son (played by Coward). Some saw the drugs as a mask for homosexuality;Hoare, p. 129 Kenneth Tynan later described it as \\"a jeremiad against narcotics with dialogue that sounds today not so much stilted as high-heeled\\".Tynan, pp. 286‚Äì88 The Vortex was considered shocking in its day for its depiction of sexual vanity and drug abuse among the upper classes. Its notoriety and fiery performances attracted large audiences, justifying a move from a small suburban theatre to a larger one in the West End.Coward (Present Indicative), pp. 182‚Äì85 Coward, still having trouble finding producers, raised the money to produce the play himself. During the run of The Vortex, Coward met Jack Wilson, an American stockbroker (later a director and producer), who became his business manager and lover. Wilson used his position to steal from Coward, but the playwright was in love and accepted both the larceny and Wilson's heavy drinking.Kenrick, John. \\"Noel Coward ‚Äì Biographical Sketch ‚Äì Part II\\", Coward 101 at Musicals 101: The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film, 2000, accessed 9 March 2009 The success of The Vortex in both London and America caused a great demand for new Coward plays. In 1925 he premiered Fallen Angels, a three-act comedy that amused and shocked audiences with the spectacle of two middle-aged women slowly getting drunk while awaiting the arrival of their mutual lover.\\"Fallen Angels\\", The Manchester Guardian, 23 April 1925, p. 12 Hay Fever, the first of Coward's plays to gain an enduring place in the mainstream theatrical repertoire, also appeared in 1925. It is a comedy about four egocentric members of an artistic family who casually invite acquaintances to their country house for the weekend and bemuse and enrage each other's guests. Some writers have seen elements of Coward's old mentor, Mrs Astley Cooper, and her set in the characters of the family.Hoare, pp. 42‚Äì43 By the 1970s the play was recognised as a classic, described in The Times as a \\"dazzling achievement; like The Importance of Being Earnest, it is pure comedy with no mission but to delight, and it depends purely on the interplay of characters, not on elaborate comic machinery.\\" By June 1925 Coward had four shows running in the West End: The Vortex, Fallen Angels, Hay Fever and On with the Dance.Morley (1974), p. 107 Coward was turning out numerous plays and acting in his own works and others'. Soon, his frantic pace caught up with him, and he collapsed on stage in 1926 while starring in a stage adaptation of The Constant Nymph and had to take an extended rest, recuperating in Hawaii. Other Coward works produced in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays Easy Virtue (1926), a drama about a divorc√©e's clash with her snobbish in-laws; The Queen Was in the Parlour, a Ruritanian romance; This Was a Man (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; The Marquise (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; Home Chat (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues On with the Dance (1925) and This Year of Grace (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, \\"A Room with a View\\".\\"Appendix 3 (The Relative Popularity of Coward's Works)\\", No√´l Coward Music Index, accessed 29 November 2015 His biggest failure in this period was the play Sirocco (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred Ivor Novello, of whom Coward said, \\"the two most beautiful things in the world are Ivor's profile and my mind\\".Richards, p. 56 Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre. Coward later said of this flop, \\"My first instinct was to leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen in our minds to practically the entire population of the British Isles.\\"Richards, p. 26 By 1929 Coward was one of the world's highest-earning writers, with an annual income of ¬£50,000, more than ¬£2,800,000 in terms of 2018 values.\\"Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1270 to the present\\", Measuring Worth website, accessed 6 June 2019 Coward thrived during the Great Depression, writing a succession of popular hits.Lahr, p. 93 They ranged from large-scale spectaculars to intimate comedies. Examples of the former were the operetta Bitter Sweet (1929), about a woman who elopes with her music teacher,Norton, Richard C. \\"Coward & Novello\\", Operetta Research Center, 1 September 2007, accessed 29 November 2015 and the historical extravaganza Cavalcade (1931) at Drury Lane, about thirty years in the lives of two families, which required a huge cast, gargantuan sets and a complex hydraulic stage. Its 1933 film adaptation won the Academy Award for best picture.\\"Best Picture ‚Äì 1932/33 (6th)\\" Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, accessed 4 December 2013 Coward's intimate- scale hits of the period included Private Lives (1930) and Design for Living (1932). In Private Lives, Coward starred alongside his most famous stage partner, Gertrude Lawrence, together with the young Laurence Olivier. It was a highlight of both Coward's and Lawrence's career, selling out in both London and New York. Coward disliked long runs, and after this he made a rule of starring in a play for no more than three months at any venue. Design for Living, written for Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, was so risqu√©, with its theme of bisexuality and a m√©nage √† trois, that Coward premiered it in New York, knowing that it would not survive the censor in London.Hoare, p. 249 Ivor Novello, top l., Alfred Lunt, top r., Lynn Fontanne, lower l. and Judy Campbellstars of Coward premi√®res of the 1920s1940s In 1933 Coward wrote, directed and co-starred with the French singer Yvonne Printemps in both London and New York productions of an operetta, Conversation Piece (1933). He next wrote, directed and co-starred with Lawrence in Tonight at 8.30 (1936), a cycle of ten short plays, presented in various permutations across three evenings. One of these plays, Still Life, was expanded into the 1945 David Lean film Brief Encounter.Morley (1974), pp. 226‚Äì28 and 230 Tonight at 8.30 was followed by a musical, Operette (1938), from which the most famous number is \\"The Stately Homes of England\\", and a revue entitled Set to Music (1938, a Broadway version of his 1932 London revue, Words and Music).Morley (1974), pp. 237 and 239 Coward's last pre-war plays were This Happy Breed, a drama about a working-class family, and Present Laughter, a comic self-caricature with an egomaniac actor as the central character. These were first performed in 1942, although they were both written in 1939.Lahr, pp. 32 and 93 Between 1929 and 1936 Coward recorded many of his best-known songs for His Master's Voice (HMV), now reissued on CD, including the romantic \\"I'll See You Again\\" from Bitter Sweet, the comic \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\" from Words and Music, and \\"Mrs Worthington\\".Naxos CDs 8.120559 and 8.120623 = Second World War = With the outbreak of the Second World War Coward abandoned the theatre and sought official war work. After running the British propaganda office in Paris, where he concluded that \\"if the policy of His Majesty's Government is to bore the Germans to death I don't think we have time\\",Richards, p. 105 he worked on behalf of British intelligence.Koch, Stephen. \\"The Playboy was a Spy\\", The New York Times, 13 April 2008, accessed 4 January 2009 His task was to use his celebrity to influence American public and political opinion in favour of helping Britain. He was frustrated by British press criticism of his foreign travel while his countrymen suffered at home, but he was unable to reveal that he was acting on behalf of the Secret Service.Hastings, Chris. \\"Winston Churchill vetoed Coward knighthood\\", Telegraph.co.uk, 3 November 2007, accessed 4 January 2009 In 1942 George VI wished to award Coward a knighthood for his efforts, but was dissuaded by Winston Churchill. Mindful of the public view of Coward's flamboyant lifestyle, Churchill used, as his reason for withholding the honour, Coward's ¬£200 fine for contravening currency regulations in 1941. Had the Germans invaded Britain, Coward was scheduled to be arrested and killed, as he was in The Black Book along with other figures such as Virginia Woolf, Paul Robeson, Bertrand Russell, C. P. Snow and H. G. Wells. When this came to light after the war, Coward wrote: \\"If anyone had told me at that time I was high up on the Nazi blacklist, I should have laughed ... I remember Rebecca West, who was one of the many who shared the honour with me, sent me a telegram which read: 'My dear ‚Äì the people we should have been seen dead with'.\\"Coward (Future Indefinite), p. 121 Coward, with Norman Hackforth at the piano, performing for sailors aboard in Ceylon, August 1944 Churchill's view was that Coward would do more for the war effort by entertaining the troops and the home front than by intelligence work: \\"Go and sing to them when the guns are firing ‚Äì that's your job!\\"Morley (1974), p. 246 Coward, though disappointed, followed this advice. He toured, acted and sang indefatigably in Europe, Africa, Asia and America.\\"Light Entertainment\\", Time, 19 July 1954, accessed 4 January 2009 He wrote and recorded war-themed popular songs, including \\"London Pride\\" and \\"Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans\\". His London home was wrecked by German bombs in 1941, and he took up temporary residence at the Savoy Hotel.Hoare, p. 317 During one air raid on the area around the Savoy he joined Carroll Gibbons and Judy Campbell in impromptu cabaret to distract the captive guests from their fears.Hoare, p. 318 Another of Coward's wartime projects, as writer, star, composer and co- director (alongside David Lean), was the naval film drama In Which We Serve. The film was popular on both sides of the Atlantic, and he was awarded an honorary certificate of merit at the 1943 Academy Awards ceremony.\\"In Which we Serve\\" , Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, accessed 5 December 2013 Coward played a naval captain, basing the character on his friend Lord Louis Mountbatten. Lean went on to direct and adapt film versions of several Coward plays. Coward's most enduring work from the war years was the hugely successful black comedy Blithe Spirit (1941), about a novelist who researches the occult and hires a medium. A s√©ance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a 1945 film, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in Blithe Spirit, in rotation with his comedy Present Laughter and his working-class drama This Happy Breed.Hoare, p. 331 In his Middle East Diary Coward made several statements that offended many Americans. In particular, he commented that he was \\"less impressed by some of the mournful little Brooklyn boys lying there in tears amid the alien corn with nothing worse than a bullet wound in the leg or a fractured arm\\".Calder, Robert. Beware the British serpent, p. 103Hoare, p. 341 After protests from both The New York Times and The Washington Post, the Foreign Office urged Coward not to visit the United States in January 1945. He did not return to America again during the war. In the aftermath of the war, Coward wrote an alternative reality play, Peace In Our Time, depicting an England occupied by Nazi Germany. = Post-war career = Coward's new plays after the war were moderately successful but failed to match the popularity of his pre-war hits.Lahr, p. 136 Relative Values (1951) addresses the culture clash between an aristocratic English family and a Hollywood actress with matrimonial ambitions; South Sea Bubble (1951) is a political comedy set in a British colony; Quadrille (1952) is a drama about Victorian love and elopement; and Nude with Violin (1956, starring John Gielgud in London and Coward in New York) is a satire on modern art and critical pretension.Lesley, pp. 314, 370 and 361 A revue, Sigh No More (1945), was a moderate success,Morley (1974), p. 308 but two musicals, Pacific 1860 (1946), a lavish South Seas romance, and Ace of Clubs (1949), set in a night club, were financial failures.Lesley, pp. 248 and 289 Further blows in this period were the deaths of Coward's friends Charles Cochran and Gertrude Lawrence, in 1951 and 1952 respectively. Despite his disappointments, Coward maintained a high public profile; his performance as King Magnus in Shaw's The Apple Cart for the Coronation season of 1953, co- starring Margaret Leighton, received much coverage in the press,\\"Haymarket Theatre\\", The Times, 8 May 1953, p. 12; and Brown, Ivor. \\"Royal and Ancient\\", The Manchester Guardian, 8 May 1953, p. 5 and his cabaret act, honed during his wartime tours entertaining the troops, was a supreme success, first in London at the Caf√© de Paris, and later in Las Vegas.Morley (1974), pp. 339‚Äì40 The theatre critic Kenneth Tynan wrote: In 1955 Coward's cabaret act at Las Vegas, recorded live for the gramophone, and released as No√´l Coward at Las Vegas,Reissued in 2003 on CD by CBS ‚Äì DRG 19037 was so successful that CBS engaged him to write and direct a series of three 90-minute television specials for the 1955‚Äì56 season. The first of these, Together With Music, paired Coward with Mary Martin, featuring him in many of the numbers from his Las Vegas act.Kenrick, John. \\"Noel Coward ‚Äì Biography, Part III\\", Coward 101 at Musicals 101: The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film, accessed 16 February 2009 It was followed by productions of Blithe Spirit in which he starred with Claudette Colbert, Lauren Bacall and Mildred Natwick and This Happy Breed with Edna Best and Roger Moore. Despite excellent reviews, the audience viewing figures were moderate.Payn and Morley, pp. 287‚Äì88, 304 and 314 Al Hirschfeld's drawing of Coward rather than the stars of this 1968 revival. During the 1950s and 1960s Coward continued to write musicals and plays. After the Ball, his 1953 adaptation of Lady Windermere's Fan, was the last musical he premiered in the West End; his last two musicals were first produced on Broadway. Sail Away (1961), set on a luxury cruise liner, was Coward's most successful post-war musical, with productions in America, Britain and Australia.Lesley, pp. 410‚Äì14, and 428‚Äì29 The Girl Who Came to Supper, a musical adaptation of The Sleeping Prince (1963), ran for only three months.Lesley, p. 430 He directed the successful 1964 Broadway musical adaptation of Blithe Spirit, called High Spirits. Coward's late plays include a farce, Look After Lulu! (1959), and a tragi-comic study of old age, Waiting in the Wings (1960), both of which were successful despite \\"critical disdain\\".Simon, John. \\"Waiting in the Wings\\", The NY Magazine, 3 January 2000, accessed 8 February 2009 Coward argued that the primary purpose of a play was to entertain, and he made no attempt at modernism, which he felt was boring to the audience although fascinating to the critics. His comic novel, Pomp and Circumstance (1960), about life in a tropical British colony, met with more critical success.Payn and Morley, pp. 451 and 453 Coward's final stage success came with Suite in Three Keys (1966), a trilogy set in a hotel penthouse suite. He wrote it as his swan song as a stage actor: \\"I would like to act once more before I fold my bedraggled wings.\\"Coward, Plays, Five, introduction, unnumbered page The trilogy gained glowing reviews and did good box office business in the UK.Morley (1974), p. 375 In one of the three plays, A Song at Twilight, Coward abandoned his customary reticence on the subject and played an explicitly homosexual character. The daring piece earned Coward new critical praise.\\"Noel Coward's Skeleton Feast\\", The Times, 15 April 1966, p. 16 He intended to star in the trilogy on Broadway but was too ill to travel. Only two of the Suite in Three Keys plays were performed in New York, with the title changed to No√´l Coward in Two Keys, starring Hume Cronyn.Hoare, p. 502 Coward won new popularity in several notable films later in his career, such as Around the World in 80 Days (1956), Our Man in Havana (1959), Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965), Boom! (1968) and The Italian Job (1969).Hoare, pp. 380, 414, 491, 507 and 508 Stage and film opportunities he turned down in the 1950s included an invitation to compose a musical version of Pygmalion (two years before My Fair Lady was written), and offers of the roles of the king in the original stage production of The King and I, and Colonel Nicholson in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai.Hoare, pp. 387, 386, and 473 Invited to play the title role in the 1962 film Dr. No, he replied, \\"No, no, no, a thousand times, no.\\"Day, p. 310 In the same year, he turned down the role of Humbert Humbert in Lolita, saying, \\"At my time of life the film story would be logical if the 12-year-old heroine was a sweet little old lady.\\"Richards, p. 83 In the mid-1960s and early 1970s successful productions of his 1920s and 1930s plays, and new revues celebrating his music, including Oh, Coward! on Broadway and Cowardy Custard in London, revived Coward's popularity and critical reputation. He dubbed this comeback \\"Dad's Renaissance\\".Hoare p. 479 et seq. It began with a hit 1963 revival of Private Lives in London and then New York.Morley (1974), pp. 370‚Äì72 Invited to direct Hay Fever with Edith Evans at the National Theatre, he wrote in 1964, \\"I am thrilled and flattered and frankly a little flabbergasted that the National Theatre should have had the curious perceptiveness to choose a very early play of mine and to give it a cast that could play the Albanian telephone directory.\\"Morley (1974), p. 369 Other examples of \\"Dad's Renaissance\\" included a 1968 Off-Broadway production of Private Lives at the Theatre de Lys starring Elaine Stritch, Lee Bowman and Betsy von Furstenberg, and directed by Charles Nelson Reilly. Despite this impressive cast, Coward's popularity had risen so high that the theatre poster for the production used an Al Hirschfeld caricature of Coward (pictured) instead of an image of the production or its stars. The illustration captures how Coward's image had changed by the 1960s: he was no longer seen as the smooth 1930s sophisticate, but as the doyen of the theatre. As The New Statesman wrote in 1964, \\"Who would have thought the landmarks of the Sixties would include the emergence of No√´l Coward as the grand old man of British drama? There he was one morning, flipping verbal tiddlywinks with reporters about \\"Dad's Renaissance\\"; the next he was... beside Forster, T. S. Eliot and the OMs, demonstrably the greatest living English playwright.\\"Ronald Bryden in The New Statesman, August 1964, quoted in Hoare, p. 479 Time wrote that \\"in the 60s... his best work, with its inspired inconsequentiality, seemed to exert not only a period charm but charm, period.\\" = Death and honours = The No√´l Coward Theatre By the end of the 1960s, Coward suffered from arteriosclerosis and, during the run of Suite in Three Keys, he struggled with bouts of memory loss.Hoare, p. 501 This also affected his work in The Italian Job, and he retired from acting immediately afterwards.Lesley, p. 454 Coward was knighted in 1969 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.\\"Coward, Sir No√´l\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 12 March 2009.

The critic Kenneth Tynan's description in 1953 was close to an acknowledgment of Coward's sexuality: \\"Forty years ago he was Slightly in Peter Pan, and you might say that he has been wholly in Peter Pan ever since. No private considerations have been allowed to deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and Rattigan, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor.\\" Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering \\"any sexual activities when over-advertised\\" to be tasteless.Payn, p. 248 Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, \\"There are still a few old ladies in Worthing who don't know.\\"Hoare, p. 509 Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.Lesley, p. xvii Coward's most important relationship, which began in the mid-1940s and lasted until his death, was with the South African stage and film actor Graham Payn.Payn, passim Coward featured Payn in several of his London productions. Payn later co-edited with Sheridan Morley a collection of Coward's diaries, published in 1982. Coward's other relationships included the playwright Keith Winter, actors Louis Hayward and Alan Webb, his manager Jack Wilson and the composer Ned Rorem, who published details of their relationship in his diaries.Hoare, pp. 162‚Äì63, 258, 261‚Äì62, 275, 273‚Äì74, and 469‚Äì70 Coward had a 19-year friendship with Prince George, Duke of Kent, but biographers differ on whether it was platonic.Hoare, p. 122 Payn believed that it was, although Coward reportedly admitted to the historian Michael Thornton that there had been \\"a little dalliance\\".\\"Upstairs life of a royal rogue\\", The Daily Express, 26 February 2012 Coward said, on the duke's death, \\"I suddenly find that I loved him more than I knew.\\"Lesley, p. 231 Coward maintained close friendships with many women, including the actress and author Esm√© Wynne-Tyson, his first collaborator and constant correspondent; Gladys Calthrop, who designed sets and costumes for many of his works; his secretary and close confidante Lorn Loraine; the actresses Gertrude Lawrence, Joyce Carey and Judy Campbell; and \\"his loyal and lifelong amiti√© amoureuse\\", Marlene Dietrich.Lesley, p. 176 In his profession, Coward was widely admired and loved for his generosity and kindness to those who fell on hard times. Stories are told of the unobtrusive way in which he relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the Actors Orphanage, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young Peter Collinson, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward to play a role in The Italian Job. Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.Payn and Morley, p. 668 Coward in his home in Switzerland in 1972 In 1926, Coward acquired Goldenhurst Farm, in Aldington, Kent, making it his home for most of the next thirty years, except when the military used it during the Second World War.Clark, Ross. \\"Mad about the house\\", The Telegraph, 24 November 2004, accessed 27 August 2016 It is a Grade II listed building., accessed 24 August 2016 In the 1950s, Coward left the UK for tax reasons, receiving harsh criticism in the press.Lesley, p. 355 He first settled in Bermuda but later bought houses in Jamaica and Switzerland (in the village of Les Avants, near Montreux), which remained his homes for the rest of his life.Lesley, p. 395 His expatriate neighbours and friends included Joan Sutherland, David Niven, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards in SwitzerlandLesley, p. 437 and Ian Fleming and his wife Ann in Jamaica. Coward was a witness at the Flemings' wedding, but his diaries record his exasperation with their constant bickering.Lesley, p. 310; and Payn and Morley, p. 463 Coward's political views were conservative, but not unswervingly so: he despised the government of Neville Chamberlain for its policy of appeasing Nazi Germany, and he differed sharply with Winston Churchill over the abdication crisis of 1936. Whereas Churchill supported Edward VIII's wish to marry \\"his cutie\\", Wallis Simpson, Coward thought the king irresponsible, telling Churchill, \\"England doesn't wish for a Queen Cutie.\\"Lesley, pp. 187 and 197 Coward disliked propaganda in plays; \\"The theatre is a wonderful place, a house of strange enchantment, a temple of illusion. What it most emphatically is not and never will be is a scruffy, ill-lit, fumed-oak drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for political propaganda.\\"Kenrick, John. \\"Noel Coward 101: Cowardy Quotations\\", Musicals101.com, The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film, accessed 8 February 2009 Nevertheless, his own views sometimes surfaced in his plays: both Cavalcade and This Happy Breed are, in the words of the playwright David Edgar, \\"overtly Conservative political plays written in the Brechtian epic manner.\\"Kaplan, p. 4 In religion, Coward was agnostic. He wrote of his views, \\"Do I believe in God? I can't say No and I can't say Yes, To me it's anybody's guess.\\"Coward (Not Yet the Dodo), p. 54. Coward spelled his first name with the di√¶resis (\\"I didn't put the dots over the 'e' in No√´l. The language did. Otherwise it's not No√´l but Nool!\\").Richards, p. 58 The press and many book publishers failed to follow suit, and his name was printed as 'Noel' in The Times, The Observer and other contemporary newspapers and books. The papers of No√´l Coward are held in the University of Birmingham.  Public image  The Coward image: with cigarette holder in 1930 \\"Why\\", asked Coward, \\"am I always expected to wear a dressing-gown, smoke cigarettes in a long holder and say 'Darling, how wonderful'?\\"Richards, p. 59 The answer lay in Coward's assiduous cultivation of a carefully crafted image. As a suburban boy who had been taken up by the upper classes he rapidly acquired the taste for high life: \\"I am determined to travel through life first class.\\"Richards, p. 28 He first wore a dressing gown onstage in The Vortex and used the fashion in several of his other famous plays, including Private Lives and Present Laughter.Sacheli, Robert. \\"Joyeux Noel\\", Dandyism.net, 16 December 2006, accessed 17 March 2009Private Lives, Act II, passim George Walden identifies him as a modern dandy.Barbey D'Aurevilly, p. 45 In connection with the National Theatre's 2008 exhibition, The Independent commented, \\"His famous silk, polka-dot dressing gown and elegant cigarette holder both seem to belong to another era. But 2008 is proving to be the year that Britain falls in love with No√´l Coward all over again.\\" As soon as he achieved success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him sitting up in bed holding a cigarette holder: \\"I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope.\\"Castle, p. 66 Soon after that, Coward wrote, \\"I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and soon I was informed by my evening paper that I had started a fashion. I believe that to a certain extent this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and more of our seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them.\\"Coward (Present Indicative), p. 183 He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising Cecil Beaton to tone down his outfits: \\"It is important not to let the public have a loophole to lampoon you.\\"Hoare, p. 201 However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle. In 1969 he told Time magazine, \\"I acted up like crazy. I did everything that was expected of me. Part of the job.\\" Time concluded, \\"Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise.\\" Coward's distinctive clipped diction arose from his childhood: his mother was deaf and Coward developed his staccato style of speaking to make it easier for her to hear what he was saying; it also helped him eradicate a slight lisp.Hoare, p. 16 His nickname, \\"The Master\\", \\"started as a joke and became true\\", according to Coward. It was used of him from the 1920s onwards. Coward himself made light of it: when asked by a journalist why he was known as \\"The Master\\", he replied, \\"Oh, you know ‚Äì Jack of all trades, master of none.\\"Richards, p. 65 He could, however, joke about his own immodesty: \\"My sense of my importance to the world is relatively small. On the other hand, my sense of my own importance to myself is tremendous.\\"Richards, p. 67 When a Time interviewer apologised, \\"I hope you haven't been bored having to go through all these interviews for your [70th] birthday, having to answer the same old questions about yourself\\", Coward rejoined, \\"Not at all. I'm fascinated by the subject.\\" Works and appearances Coward wrote more than 65 plays and musicals (not all produced or published) and appeared in approximately 70 stage productions.Mander and Mitchenson, passim More than 20 films were made from his plays and musicals, either by Coward or other screenwriters, and he acted in 17 films.Contemporary Authors Online, Thomson Gale, 2004, accessed 30 December 2008: requires subscription; and Noel Coward at the IMDB database, accessed 12 March 2009 =Plays= In a 2005 survey Dan Rebellato divides the plays into early, middle and late periods.Rebellato, Dan. \\"Coward, No√´l\\", The Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance, Oxford University Press, 2005. Retrieved 5 April 2020 In The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature (2006) Jean Chothia calls the plays of the 1920s and 30s, \\"the quintessential theatrical works of the years between World Wars I and II\\".Chothia, Jean. \\"Coward, No√´l\\", The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature, Oxford University Press, 2006. Retrieved 5 April 2020 Rebellato considers Hay Fever (1925) typical of the early plays, \\"showing a highly theatrical family running rings around a group of staid outsiders\\"; Easy Virtue (1926) \\"brings the well-made play into the twentieth century\\". Chothia writes that \\"the seeming triviality\\" and rich, flippant characters of Coward's plays, though popular with the public, aroused hostility from a few, such as the playwright Sean O'Casey, \\"perhaps particularly because of the ease with which his sexually charged writing seemed to elude censorship\\". Rebellato rates Private Lives (1930) as the pinnacle of Coward's early plays, with its \\"evasion of moral judgement, and the blur of paradox and witticism\\". During the 1930s, once he was established by his early successes, Coward experimented with theatrical forms. The historical epic Cavalcade (1931) with its huge cast, and the cycle of ten short plays Tonight at 8.30 (1935), played to full houses, but are difficult to revive because of the expense and \\"logistical complexities\\" of staging them.Morgan, Terry. \\"Tonight at 8.30\\", Variety, 5 November 2007 He continued to push the boundaries of social acceptability in the 1930s: Design for Living (1932), with its bisexual triangle, had to be premiered in the US, beyond the reach of the British censor. Chothia comments that a feature of Coward's plays of the 1920s and 30s is that, \\"unusually for the period, the women in Coward's plays are at least as self-assertive as the men, and as likely to seethe with desire or rage, so that courtship and the battle of the sexes is waged on strictly equal terms\\". The best-known plays of Coward's middle period, the late 1930s and the 40s, Present Laughter, This Happy Breed and Blithe Spirit are more traditional in construction and less unconventional in content. Coward toured them throughout Britain during the Second World War, and the first and third of them are frequently revived in Britain and the US. Coward's plays from the late 1940s and early 50s are generally seen as showing a decline in his theatrical flair. Morley comments, \\"The truth is that, although the theatrical and political world had changed considerably through the century for which he stood as an ineffably English icon, No√´l himself changed very little.\\"Morley, Sheridan. \\"No√´l Coward\\", No√´l Coward. Retrieved 5 April 2020 Chothis comments, \\"sentimentality and nostalgia, often lurking but usually kept in check in earlier works, were cloyingly present in such post-World War II plays as Peace in Our Time and Nude with Violin, although his writing was back on form with the astringent Waiting in the Wings\\". His final plays, in Suite in Three Keys (1966), were well received,Bryden, Ronald. \\"Theatre\\", The Observer, 1 May 1966, p. 24 but the Coward plays most often revived are from the years 1925 to 1940: Hay Fever, Private Lives, Design for Living, Present Laughter and Blithe Spirit.\\"Productions\\", No√´l Coward. Retrieved 5 April 2020 =Musicals and revues= Coward wrote the words and music for eight full-length musicals between 1928 and 1963. By far the most successful was the first, Bitter Sweet (1929), which he termed an operetta. It ran in the West End for 697 performances between 1929 and 1931.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 183; and Gaye, p. 1529 Bitter Sweet was set in 19th-century Vienna and London; for his next musical, Conversation Piece (1934) Coward again chose a historical setting: Regency Brighton. Notices were excellent, but the run ended after 177 performances when the leading lady, Yvonne Printemps, had to leave the cast to honour a filming commitment. The show has a cast of more than fifty and has never been professionally revived in London.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 270‚Äì271 A third musical with a historical setting, Operette, ran for 133 performances in 1938 and closed for lack of box-office business. Coward later described it as \\"over-written and under-composed\\", with too much plot and too few good numbers.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 326 and 336‚Äì337 He persisted with a romantic historical theme with Pacific 1860 (1946), another work with a huge cast. It ran for 129 performances, and Coward's failure to keep up with public tastes was pointed up by the success of the Rodgers and Hammerstein show that followed Pacific 1860 at Drury Lane: Oklahoma! ran there for 1,534 performances.Gaye, p. 1525 His friend and biographer Cole Lesley wrote that although Coward admired Oklahoma! enormously, he \\"did not learn from it and the change it had brought about, that the songs should in some way further the storyline.\\"Lesley, p. 196 Lesley added that Coward compounded this error by managing \\"in every single show to write one song, nothing whatever to do with the plot, that was an absolute showstopper\\". With Ace of Clubs (1949) Coward sought to be up-to-date, with the setting of a contemporary Soho nightclub. It did better than its three predecessors, running for 211 performances, but Coward wrote, \\"I am furious about Ace of Clubs not being a real smash and I have come to the conclusion that if they don't care for first rate music, lyrics, dialogue and performance they can stuff it up their collective arses and go and see [Ivor Novello's] King's Rhapsody\\".Lesley, p. 291 He reverted, without success, to a romantic historical setting for After the Ball (1954 ‚Äì 188 performances). His last two musicals were premiered on Broadway rather than in London. Sail Away (1961) with a setting on a modern cruise ship ran for 167 performances in New York and then 252 in London.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 489; and Gaye, p. 1537 For his last and least successful musical, Coward reverted to Ruritanian royalty in The Girl Who Came to Supper (1963), which closed after 112 performances in New York and has never been staged in London.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 500 and 510 Coward's first contributions to revue were in 1922, writing most of the songs and some of the sketches in Andr√© Charlot's London Calling!. This was before his first major success as a playwright and actor, in The Vortex, written the following year and staged in 1924. The revue contained only one song that features prominently in the No√´l Coward Society's list of his most popular numbers ‚Äì \\"Parisian Pierrot\\", sung by Gertrude Lawrence. His other early revues, On With the Dance (1925) and This Year of Grace (1928) were liked by the press and public, and contained several songs that have remained well known, including \\"Dance, Little Lady\\", \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\" and \\"A Room With a View\\".Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 128 and 171 Words and Music (1932) and its Broadway successor Set to Music (1939) included \\"Mad About the Boy\\", \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\", \\"Marvellous Party\\" and \\"The Party's Over Now \\". At the end of the Second World War, Coward wrote his last original revue. He recalled \\"I had thought of a good title, Sigh No More, which later, I regret to say, turned out to be the best part of the revue\\".Quoted in Morley (2004), p. 91 It was a moderate success with 213 performances in 1945‚Äì46.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 378 Among the best-known songs from the show are \\"I Wonder What Happened to Him?\\", \\"Matelot\\" and \\"Nina\\". Towards the end of his life Coward was consulted about, but did not compile, two 1972 revues that were anthologies of his songs from the 1920s to the 1960s, Cowardy Custard in London (the title was chosen by Coward) and Oh, Coward! in New York, at the premiere of which he made his last public appearance.Lesley, pp. 469 and 471 =Songs= Coward wrote three hundred songs. The No√´l Coward Society's website, drawing on performing statistics from the publishers and the Performing Rights Society, names \\"Mad About the Boy\\" (from Words and Music) as Coward's most popular song, followed, in order, by: * \\"I'll See You Again\\" (Bitter Sweet) * \\"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\\" (Words and Music) * \\"If Love Were All\\" (Bitter Sweet) * \\"Someday I'll Find You\\" (Private Lives) * \\"I'll Follow My Secret Heart\\" (Conversation Piece) * \\"London Pride\\" (1941) * \\"A Room With a View\\" (This Year of Grace) * \\"Mrs Worthington\\" (1934) * \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\" (On with the Dance) * \\"The Stately Homes of England\\" (Operette) Coward was no fan of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan, but as a songwriter was nevertheless strongly influenced by them. He recalled: \\"I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them... my aunts and uncles, who were legion, sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation.\\"Programme note for Cowardy Custard (1972) quoting The No√´l Coward Song Book His colleague Terence Rattigan wrote that as a lyricist Coward was \\"the best of his kind since W. S. Gilbert.\\"Day, p. 257  Critical reputation and legacy  The playwright John Osborne said, \\"Mr Coward is his own invention and contribution to this century. Anyone who cannot see that should keep well away from the theatre.\\"\\"Noel Coward\\", Introduction page to NoelCoward.com, accessed 8 February 2009 Tynan wrote in 1964, \\"Even the youngest of us will know, in fifty years' time, exactly what we mean by 'a very Noel Coward sort of person'.\\" In praise of Coward's versatility, Lord Mountbatten said, in a tribute on Coward's seventieth birthday, \\"There are probably greater painters than No√´l, greater novelists than No√´l, greater librettists, greater composers of music, greater singers, greater dancers, greater comedians, greater tragedians, greater stage producers, greater film directors, greater cabaret artists, greater TV stars. If there are, they are fourteen different people. Only one man combined all fourteen different labels ‚Äì The Master.\\"Day, p. 3 Coward in 1963 Tynan's was the first generation of critics to realise that Coward's plays might enjoy more than ephemeral success. In the 1930s, Cyril Connolly wrote that they were \\"written in the most topical and perishable way imaginable, the cream in them turns sour overnight\\".Lahr, p. 2 What seemed daring in the 1920s and 1930s came to seem old-fashioned in the 1950s, and Coward never repeated the success of his pre- war plays. By the 1960s, critics began to note that underneath the witty dialogue and the Art Deco glamour of the inter-war years, Coward's best plays also dealt with recognisable people and familiar relationships, with an emotional depth and pathos that had been often overlooked.Kaplan, pp. 7‚Äì13 By the time of his death, The Times was writing of him, \\"None of the great figures of the English theatre has been more versatile than he\\", and the paper ranked his plays in \\"the classical tradition of Congreve, Sheridan, Wilde and Shaw\\".\\"Obituary: Sir Noel Coward\\", The Times, 27 March 1973, p. 18 A symposium published in 1999 to mark the centenary of Coward's birth listed some of his major productions scheduled for the year in Britain and North America, including Ace of Clubs, After the Ball, Blithe Spirit, Cavalcade, Easy Virtue, Hay Fever, Present Laughter, Private Lives, Sail Away, A Song at Twilight, The Young Idea and Waiting in the Wings, with stars including Lauren Bacall, Rosemary Harris, Ian McKellen, Corin Redgrave, Vanessa Redgrave and Elaine Stritch.Kaplan, pp. 217‚Äì21 In another tribute, Tim Rice said of Coward's songs: \\"The wit and wisdom of No√´l Coward's lyrics will be as lively and contemporary in 100 years' time as they are today\\", and many have been recorded by Damon Albarn, Ian Bostridge, The Divine Comedy, Elton John, Valerie Masterson, Paul McCartney, Michael Nyman, Pet Shop Boys, Vic Reeves, Sting, Joan Sutherland, Robbie Williams and others.\\"Twentieth-century blues: the songs of Noel Coward\\", \\"Ian Bostridge: No√´l Coward songbook\\"; and \\"Sutherland sings Noel Coward\\", WorldCat, accessed 5 December 2013 Coward's music, writings, characteristic voice and style have been widely parodied and imitated, for instance in Monty Python, Round the Horne and Privates on Parade.\\"Sir Noel (Pierce) Coward\\", Cambridge Encyclopedia, Vol. 69Nichols, Peter: Privates on Parade, Act 2, Scene 1 (\\"No√´l, No√´l\\") Coward has frequently been depicted as a character in plays,Hoare, Philip. \\"Manuscripts and the Master\\", The Daily Telegraph, 22 May 2005Martin, Dominic.

Life He was born in the town of Ajdov≈°ƒçina in the County of Gorizia and Gradisca, in what was then Austria-Hungary (today in Slovenia). Danilo was the oldest of six children in a family which made its living through tanning, and which ran a small leather shop. He graduated from the Gorizia State Grammar School in 1910 and entered the University of Vienna, where he studied medicine. Upon finishing he returned to his birthplace with Jelka ≈†pacapan, who was to become his wife, and began working as a doctor. In Ajdov≈°ƒçina he made the acquaintance of painter Veno Pilon. Lokar did specialist work in Zagreb for a time before realizing that he could not work as a surgeon due to his poor health; as a consequence he decided to become a writer. In 1933 he published his first short story, \\"The Dance\\", in the progressive literary review Sodobnost. During World War II he was imprisoned by the Italian Fascist authorities in the concentration camp at Medea, in the Friuli region. Upon the Italian armistice he joined the partisan forces together with his wife. After the war he worked as a doctor until 1951, when he retired, fully dedicating his time to writing. In 1959 he won the Pre≈°eren Award, the highest Slovenian prize for artistic achievements, for his short story collection Sodni dan na Vasi (\\"Doomsday in the Village\\"). Lokar died in Ljubljana in 1989 and was buried in his hometown. Danilo Lokar was the brother-in-law of the Slovene Communist theoretician Dragotin Gustinƒçiƒç and uncle of the renowned journalist Jurij Gustinƒçiƒç.Petra Kolenc, Dr. Henrik Tuma in njegova knji≈ænica (Nova Gorica - Ljubljana: ZRC SAZU, 2008), 16 Work Lokar's stories often describe people from the Vipava Valley and its surroundings. Artistic elements, especially related to painting, can often be seen in his plots; these are frequently fleshed out with more essay-like passages. Lokar's work is known mostly for its expressionist manner and for the peculiar worldview which it espouses.

It is believed to have been formed by extension, between two fault-bounded blocks which rotated anti-clockwise to take up the compression resulting from Europe's collision with Africa. The basin is filled with turbidites and evaporites of the Tortonian-Messinian ages of the Miocene Epoch. It is a matter of some debate whether the basin dried out at the same time as the main Mediterranean basins.  Basin fill  The basin is divided into the following members: * At the bottom of the image, the house is constructed on the steep yellow cliffs of the resistant Azagador Member. * The lower (whiter) and upper (yellower) Abad Marls, a Tortonian/Messinian series of turbidites featuring pronounced Milankovic (20,000 year precession) cyclicity, allowing chronostratigraphic dating; these fine muds are easily eroded. * When the sea returned overdeepening the basin, salt water waterfalls eroded a 200 m depression patterned by 30 m deep gullies. * the Messinian Yesares Member, a gypsum evaporite, forms the steep bluffs at the top of the valley; there is some debate about how conformable its contact with the Abad marls is. * Pliocene deposits, rest unconformably on the top. * Complexity of drawdown and reflooding complicate correlation of the ‚ÄòSalinity Crisis' stratigraphy.

He rose to prominence in the 1120s, becoming Prior of Christ Church Cathedral Priory sometime after the death of Prior Conrad on 17 February 1127.Greenway, \\"Priors of Canterbury\\". He held this position for little more than a year, until in 1128 he was invited to become the first Abbot of Dunfermline, with the monastery of Dunfermline recently being promoted from a priory to an abbey, being refounded with thirteen monks from Canterbury.Barrow, \\"Benedictines\\", p. 174; Greenway, \\"Priors of Canterbury\\"; Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 67. Canterbury and Dunfermline Dunfermline was a daughter-house of Christ Church, while that Benedictine priory held significant influence in the Kingdom of Scotland. Such influence had been established by Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the reign of King M√°el Coluim mac Donnchada (1058-1093) via the latter's consort, the English princess Margaret of Wessex.Barrow, \\"Benedictines\\", p. 174.

Now in the reign of King David I (1124-1153), the Scottish monarchy was expanding the monastery at Dunfermline, and Geoffrey came to Scotland as part of royal plans to expand the size and promote the status of the house.Barrow, \\"Benedictines\\", pp. 174-6.

First Abbot of Dunfermline After receiving a blessing by Robert, Bishop of St Andrews, Geoffrey began his career as Dunfermline's abbot. During his abbacy, Geoffrey witnessed a great number of royal charters and King David persistently treated him with more respect that any other abbot ‚Äî he was usually the first abbot to be named in any witness list. Despite initial problem with Causant√≠n, the local mormaer, Geoffrey's abbacy was generally one of successful expansion of property in which numbers of English immigrants arrived to settle in and around the town of Dunfermline.Barrow, \\"Benedictines\\", p. 176. During his abbacy the abbey was transformed from a small church establishment into a large Romanesque monastery, finally dedicated in 1150.

He was sometimes credited as Joe Morris on record, though he is no relation to free jazz guitarist Joe Morris or trumpeter Joe Morris. Career Columbus was active as a jazz musician from the 1920s into the 1970s, and was the father of Sonny Payne. He led his own band from the 1930s into the late 1940s, holding a residency at the Savoy Ballroom for a period.[ Chris Columbus] at Allmusic After the middle of the 1940s he drummed behind Louis Jordan, remaining with him until 1952. In the mid-to-late 1950s, Columbus backed Wild Bill Davis's organ combo, and he recorded with Duke Ellington in 1967. He worked again as a leader in the 1970s, in addition to doing tours of Europe with Davis. While in France he played with Floyd Smith, Al Grey, Eddie \\"Cleanhead\\" Vinson, Buddy Tate, and Milt Buckner. Prior to a stroke which partially paralyzed him in 1993, Columbo was the oldest working musician in Atlantic City.Kent, Bill (1996-08-04). \\"A Jazz-Age Survivor\\", The New York Times.David Schwartz (Mon, February 2, 2009). \\"The Time Keeper \\". Columbo got his first professional gig playing with Fletcher Henderson in 1921. Between the 1920s and the 1960s, he played at most of the city's nightclubs, and led the Club Harlem orchestra for 34 years until 1978, when the club shut its doors. Thereafter, Columbo's band went on to perform at practically every Atlantic City casino hotel. At the time of his stroke, he was playing regularly at the Showboat. Poster for the 1945 film It Happened in Harlem Columbo worked, recorded, and toured with such luminaries as Duke Ellington, Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Jordan, Louis Armstrong, Wild Bill Davis, and Ella Fitzgerald. Columbo did an album on the Strand label called Jazz: Re- Discovering Old Favorites by the Chris Columbo Quintette including a version of \\"Summertime\\" featuring organist Johnny \\"Hammond\\" Smith. This record (with flip side an uptempo minor blues called \\"\\" ) was fairly successful on radio in the early 1960s. Columbo flipped his sticks in the air, bounced them off the floor and often leaped from a motorcycle seat which was his drum throne. His son was the Count Basie Orchestra drummer Sonny Payne. Columbo also appeared in the 1945 film It Happened In Harlem, based on the Harlem nightclub Smalls Paradise, and the 1947 film Look Out Sister. Family Chris is survived by two daughters, Yvette Mathison and JoAnn Morris, grand daughters Sheril Plunkett and Tana Lee, and great grand-children Dylan Plunkett, Kacie Mae Plunkett and Chance Lee. Death Columbo suffered a stroke in 1993 and died in 2002; he was 100 years old. To recognize his contributions to the history and music of Atlantic City, a section of Kentucky Avenue, home of Club Harlem, was renamed Chris Columbo Lane in 2005.

The Bahrainis landed at Zubarah, which was abandoned since 1811 and then moved to establish themselves at Fuwayrit, close to Al Huwaila. Despite being reinforced by a small number of Wahhabi horsemen and infantry, the chief of Al Huwaila sought mediation which was successful in keeping the status quo but required the desertion of Al Huwaila and the moving of its inhabitants to Bahrain. However, the Al Khalifas family induced some members of the Al Bukuwara tribe of Fuwayrit to attack Al Huwaila, killing a member of the Isa bin Tarif's family in the process. Moving to Abu Dhabi and intent on continuing his disagreement with Bahrain, Isa bin Tarif chief of Al Huwaila found himself constrained by the British, who refused to allow them to continue warfare against Bahrain. The British also brought pressure to bear on the inhabitants of Al Bidda and Al Wakrah, who were also engaged in what were considered by the British as unlawful activities.Background to Qatar in the Gulf - http://www.catnaps.org/islamic/history.html  Conquest of Mombasa in 1837  On 5 March 1837, the Al Bin Ali under the command of their leader Isa bin Tarif attacked Mombasa at the request of Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, repeatedly bombarding Fort Jesus for a week until the Portuguese surrendered on 12 March.^ R/15/1/75 British Bushire Archives, Agent at Muscat to Political Resident in Bushire, 27 March 1837 Activities in Bahrain Negotiations followed between Isa bin Tarif, the British, the Sultan of Muscat and Egypt, the latter of whom wished to expand their interests in the region.

In Al-Bida, Shaikh Isa Bin Tarif built a wall to the sea from both the East and West.The Group of Virtues, Rashid bin Fadhel Al Bin Ali, p92 In Al-Bida, Shaikh Isa Bin Tarif was its chief, which at that time meant that he was the Shaikh of Qatar since power was centralised in Al-Bida after it has been transformed from Zubarah, the original homeland of the Utub, Isa Bin Tarif's tribe. = 1847 Battle of Umm Suwaya and his death= The town of Fuwayrit frequently visited and its affairs interfered with by the ruler of Bahrain, Mohammed bin Khalifa. In 1847, Isa became convinced that Mohammed wanted to bring the nearby town of Zubarah under his control so he could prevent future attacks on Bahrain from being launched from the coast of Qatar. The deposed ruler of Bahrain, Abdullah bin Ahmed bin Khalifa, lived in Qatar during this period. After garnering support from the Wahhabis of Najd, he threatened to occupy Bahrain. Isa pledged allegiance to Abdullah and offered to assist him. This prompted Mohammed bin Khalifa to write a letter to Captain William Lowe, captain of the East India Company's naval squadron, in November. Captain Lowe responded to the letter by requesting Mohammed to refrain from hostilities at sea, and warned that any vessels found being used for war would be seized. Mohammed retorted by blaming Isa and Abdullah for creating a warlike atmosphere. On 7 November 1847, Isa and his deputy jointly wrote to Samuel Hennell describing their suspicions of Mohammed's plan to invade the north-east coast of Qatar.Habibur Rahman, p. 96 Intent on defending the coast from Bahraini intervention, Isa and Mubarak bin Ahmed arrived in Fuwayrit with 400 troops in the first week of November. Mohammed retorted by sending 7 small ships and 20 battils and advancing towards Fuwayrit by way of Zubarah. As the tensions worsened, the British dispatched several naval ships to blockade Al- Bida and wrote warning letters to Isa, Abdullah and Mohammed. Shortly after, Ali bin Khalifa landed on the coast of Al Khor with 500 Bahraini troops under his command. The Bahraini forces were accompanied by the governors of Al-Hasa and Qatif. The forces of Isa and Mubarak bin Ahmed numbered 600 troops.Habibur Rahman, p. 97 The decisive battle took place on 17 November near Fuwayrit.

Gissler's quest was to find the Golden Madonna of the Treasure of Lima, a solid gold, gem-encrusted, life-size image of the Virgin Mary, allegedly buried there by the mutineer, Captain William Thompson, in 1820. Over the years Gissler dug a complex system of tunnels, some of which can still be entered even today. Gissler was absolutely certain that he would find the treasure, since he had two maps from independent sources that pointed to the same place where the treasure was supposed to have been buried. In parallel, Gissler was also on the search for the treasure of the pirate Benito Bonito. Impressed with his organization, the Costa Rican government in 1897 allowed him to formally establish a colony of several German farmers and named him the first (and up to now only) Governor of Cocos Island. The treasure hunt was mainly funded by financiers who had invested in the specially created Cocos Plantation Company. Several settler families who grew tobacco also lived with Gissler on the island. However, because of the island's harsh conditions and remote location from the Costa Rican mainland, Gissler's colony turned out to be short-lived, for during the following ten years all the settler families went away; August and his wife were the last to abandon the island. Gissler's quest for treasure was also unsuccessful: in over twenty years he never found more than six gold coins despite diligent searching. Dispirited, he eventually left the island for New York in 1908. In all, of the over 300 treasure expeditions that have come to Cocos Island over the years, none are known to have ever found any treasure.

Area of damage caused in Cathays by 2 parachute landmines killing 23. Bombing raids =1940‚Äì41= During 1940 the Luftwaffe targeted Cardiff on 3, 10 and 12 July and 7 August. This was followed in 1941 with raids on 2, 3 and 10 January. Over 100 bombers attacked the city over a 10-hour period beginning at 6.37 PM on the night of 2 January 1941. Dropping high explosive bombs, incendiary bombs and parachute mines, the Riverside area was the first to be bombed. In Grangetown, the Hollyman Brothers bakery was hit by a parachute mine and 32 people who were using the basement as a shelter were killed. When the raid was over 165 people had been killed and 427 more injured, while nearly 350 homes were destroyed or had to be demolished. Chapels and the nave of Llandaff Cathedral were also damaged. Western Cardiff was the worst hit area, particularly Canton and Riverside, where 116 people were killed, an estimated 50 of which were killed in one street in Riverside, De Burgh Street.

The raid of 29 April 1941 did not have the usual precursory flares or incendiaries and instead four land mines, probably intended for the Civic Centre, were parachuted without warning soon after the siren sounded. One landed harmlessly in the Castle grounds, narrowly missing the Civic shelter, but the other three had tragic consequences. Ten died in Lewis Street in Riverside from one mine. The other two fell in Cathays on Llanbleddian Gardens and Wyverne Road, killing 23 people.

This was a 1992 production of a 1940 BBC Radio play by William Aguet with music by Arthur Honegger. A Downtown Music Gallery review detailed the background on this production: :The art of the radio-play was a very important and respected creative mode of entertainment in Europe before the age of television, where subsidized radio stations encouraged experiments in this medium. Composers such as Britten, Hindemith, Gerhard, and Honegger were quick to take up the challenge, composing memorable scores which were designed from the start as close collaborations with poets and dramatists. Honegger was keen to reach the widest possible public while retaining his own musical ideas. He had already collaborated with numerous distinguished writers for the theater and had supplied scores for films, such as Abel Gance's Napoleon. All of this experience made readied him for a collaboration with William Aguet when Christophe Colomb was proposed for Radio Lausanne in 1940. Christophe Colomb is an ambitious radio-play, scored for 10 actors, an orchestra of 40 musicians, plus a large chorus with soloists. Perhaps it is due to these unusual forces that the piece faded into obscurity after its radio premiere. Through much hard work, Opera Sacra of Buffalo, New York reconstructed Christoph Colomb from the original manuscript and performed it with a new English translation of Aguet's surprisingly astute and politically correct text.Downtown Music Gallery; Christophe Colomb Classical top ten As a music critic and member of the WNED music staff, Rawson compiled his Classical Top Ten list: * 1.

Haden-Guest was a guest on Charlie RoseArticle at Charlie Rose website while promoting his book True Colors: The Real Life of the Art World, published by Grove Atlantic.

In response to a suggestion that Peter Fallow in the Tom Wolfe novel The Bonfire of the Vanities (1987) was based on British expatriate journalist Christopher Hitchens, Hitchens said that Haden-Guest was a more likely candidate. A website maintained by the University of Kent cites Haden-Guest as the inspiration for Fallow.

It is located on the eastern edge of the La V√©rendrye Wildlife Reserve in the La Vall√©e-de-la- Gatineau Regional County Municipality in the Outaouais region. Its source is the Cabonga Reservoir from where it flows in a mostly southern direction for 115 km and drains into the Gens de Terre Bay of the Baskatong Reservoir. Tributaries include: *B√©linge River *Wapus River *Serpent River The section of the river between the Wapus River and the iron bridge downstream runs through a gorge with cliffs on both sides. This section is marked by continuous class II-IV whitewater, and should only be paddled by expert canoers. The flow of the river depends greatly on the water level management in the Cabonga Reservoir. History The name of the river may be attributed to Louis Antoine de Bougainville (1729-1811), aide-de-camp to Marquis de Montcalm. In 1757, he wrote in his journal: \\"T√™tes-de-Boule brought by the Nipissings. Those savages are also called people of the land (gens des terres), live in the woods, are great hunters, mediocre warriors, neither have police nor politics, trade more with the English at the Hudson Bay than with us\\". And in a memo from 1759, Bougainville wrote: \\"The nations that deal there are the T√™tes-de-Boules (Atikamekw) or people of the land and the Namcosakio who come from towards the Hudson Bay.\\" The name \\"Gens de Terre\\" was probably assigned by voyageurs or fur traders as a reminder of this native American nomadic tribe, whose territory stretched between the upper basins of the Saint- Maurice, Gatineau, and Ottawa Rivers. It has been used in official documents since at least 1867. In the early twentieth century, the river was called Bark River by the English. The river was used for a long time by loggers for log driving. The log drivers were nicknamed La Maline (the malignant) because of the obstacles and difficulties that were found along the route.

He is considered the twelfth bishop of Naples, succeeding Maximus. His episcopate ran from February 363 to April 29, 409, the traditional date of his death. Maximus is actually considered the 10th bishop by the Catholic Church; between the episcopates of Maximus and Severus was the episcopate of Zosimus, who was Arian and thus considered heretical by the Catholic Church. Severus was a friend of Saint Ambrose, whom he met at council at Capua in 392. To Severus is attributed the construction of the Battistero di San Giovanni in Fonte, associated with the basilica of Santa Restituta. Severus also built outside of the city walls the Basilica of San Fortunato, to which he translated the relics of his predecessor Maximus. To Severus is also attributed the first translation of the body of St. Januarius from Pozzuoli to Naples, which occurred in 367. According to an early hagiography,Hagiographic sources are compiled in Acta Sanctorum Sepotembris, Tomus Sextis, new ed. J. Carnandet, ed. (Paris 1867:761-892); a condensed account of the removals of the relics is given by Diana Norman, \\"The Succorpo in the Cathedral of Naples: 'Empress of All Chapels'\\"Zeitschrift f√ºr Kunstgeschichte 49.3 (1986:323-355). Januarius' relics were transferred by order of Severus to the Neapolitan catacombs extra moenia.Norman (1986), p. 331 Veneration His relics were translated from the Battistero di Napoli to the district known as Rione Sanit√† in the 9th century, to what became known as the Catacombs of San Severo. In 1310, Archbishop Umberto d‚ÄôOrmont (Uberto d'Ormont), who had served as abbot of the Basilica of San Severo, placed Severus' relics in the main altar of San Severo, and had built a marble ciborium, which has been attributed to Tino da Camaino. The Marble Calendar of Naples, sculpted in the ninth century and preserved in the Cathedral of Naples, lists Severus under the feast day of April 29 ‚Äìthe date that appears in the Roman Martyrology. A legendary Vita, written in the eleventh century, states that Severus brought a dead man back to life after the man‚Äôs widow and children had been left destitute. The factsQuoted in Sabine Baring-Gould, The Lives of the Saints (J. Hodges, 1880), 374-5 are these: a man of Naples one day went to a bathing establishment and forgot to take with him the usual fee for the proprietor: an egg.Sabine Baring-Gould writes: ‚ÄúOr perhaps a piece of money which from its form may have been commonly called an egg, or ovum.‚Äù The man promised to pay the bath-keeper back. Unfortunately, he died a few days later and the bath-keeper then demanded from the widow a large amount of money that he pretended the deceased man had owed him. A judge ordered that the woman and her children be sold into slavery since she could not pay. The widow appealed to Saint Severus for assistance. Severus declared, ‚ÄúThe dead man himself shall give evidence.‚Äù The town was gathered together at the man‚Äôs tomb and Severus asked the dead man to answer truthfully about how much he owed the bath-keeper. The corpse opened his eyes, and stood up, and said ‚ÄúI owe but one egg.‚Äù Then he fell back again. The crowd immediately attacked the bath-keeper, but Severus protected the man from further harm.

Location and layout The present entrance to the caves is in South Street in the centre of Dorking. There is evidence of a number of original entrances to the caves, including two shafts, but all with the exception of the South Street entrance have been sealed. The upper level of the caves is laid out as a wine cellar and was last used for this purpose in the 19th century. In the centre of the upper level is a set of steps leading down to a landing, from which leads a further set of steps to a lower passage. At the far end of this passage is a circular room with a bench cut out of the rock. History The Dorking 'caves' are tunnels, being manmade and as such not caves in the true sense of the word (a natural underground/cliff-side space large enough for a human to enter). Dorking Caves is a long-used name and the one used in all promotional and official literature. The exact age of the caves is unknown. Historian John Aubrey mentioned them in the late 17th century, praising their qualities as wine cellars, in which capacity parts of them served until the 19th century. Extensive graffiti adorns the caves, largely from the 18th and 19th centuries. The oldest date found inscribed on the walls is 1672. The caves formed a network connecting the cellars of buildings around the town and were probably used initially for storage, but have had a variety of uses including as hiding places for smugglers' contraband. One cave in High Street provided a venue for cock fighting while others according to recent oral tradition were used as a hiding places by persecuted religious groups (see European Wars of Religion) and secret societies.

Their relationship was strained by Ackland‚Äôs infidelities and alcoholism, but survived for nearly forty years. Both were closely involved with communism, remaining under continued scrutiny by the authorities. Ackland‚Äôs poetry did not become widely noticed until after her death, when her reflective, confessional style was more in vogue, and left-wing writers of the 1930‚Äôs had become a popular topic. Life Mary Kathleen Macrory Ackland was born 20 May 1906 at 54 Brook Street, London to Robert Craig Ackland and Ruth Kathleen (n√©e Macrory). Nicknamed \\"Molly\\" by her family, she was the younger of two sisters. With no sons born to the family, her father, a West End London dentist, worked at making a symbolic son of Molly, teaching her to shoot rifles and to box. This attention to Molly made her sister Joan Alice Elizabeth (b. 1898) immensely jealous. Older by eight years, Joan psychologically tormented and physically abused Molly. Molly received an Anglo-Catholic upbringing in Norfolk and a convent school education in London. In 1925 at the age of nineteen, she impetuously married Richard Turpin, a homosexual youth who was unable to consummate their marriage. Upon her marriage, she was also received into the Catholic church, a religion that she later abandoned, returned to, and then abandoned again in the last decade of her life. The consummation was difficult and she had to undergo an operation to stretch her hymen. In less than a year, she had her marriage to Turpin annulled on the grounds that she was a virgin. The doctor who performed the examination failed to spot that she was pregnant due to an affair. Her husband had agreed to adopt the child but she had a miscarriage and she was determined to end the marriage. She began wearing men's clothing, cut her hair in a short style called the Eton crop, and was at times mistaken for a handsome young boy. She changed her name to the androgynous Valentine Ackland in the late 1920s when she decided to become a serious poet. Her poetry appeared in British and American literary journals during the 1920s to the 1940s, but Ackland deeply regretted that she never became a more widely read poet. Indeed, much of her poetry was published posthumously, and she received little attention from critics until a revival of interest in her work in the 1970s. In 1930, Ackland was introduced to the short story writer and novelist Sylvia Townsend Warner, with whom she had a lifelong, thirty-nine year relationship, albeit tumultuous at times given Ackland's infidelities and increasing alcoholism. Warner was twelve years older than Ackland, and the two lived together until Ackland's death from breast cancer in 1969. Warner outlived Ackland by nine years, dying in 1978. Ackland's reflections upon her relationship with Warner and with American heiress and writer Elizabeth Wade White (1908‚Äì1994), were posthumously published in For Sylvia: An Honest Account (1985). Ackland was responsible for involving Warner in the Communist Party and its participation in the II International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture, held in Valencia between July 4 and 17, 1937 within the framework of the Spanish Civil War as well as numerous socialist and pacifist activities. The two women's involvement in the Communist Party came under investigation by the British government in the late 1930s and remained an open file until 1957, when the investigation was halted. Ackland and Warner supported the Republican cause during the Spanish Civil War, and Ackland criticised the British government for its indifference to the \\"sufferings of the Spanish people at the grass- roots level\\" in her poem \\"Instructions from England, 1936\\".Jackson, Angela. British Women and the Spanish Civil War. New York: Routledge, 2002, p. 135. After World War II, Ackland turned her attention to confessional poetry and a memoir concerning her relationship with Warner and its many emotional issues as Ackland pursued involvements with other women. At first, Warner was tolerant of her younger lover's dalliances, but the seriousness and length of Ackland's relationship with Elizabeth Wade White was distressing to Warner and pushed her relationship with Ackland to the edge. Ackland's distresses at loving two women simultaneously and of endeavouring to balance her feelings for each woman with the responsibilities and commitments of her primary relationship with Warner are presented openly in Ackland's poetry and in her memoir of this period. Ackland was struggling with additional doubts and conflicts during this period as well. She continued to battle her alcoholism, and she was undergoing shifts in her political and religious alliances. In 1934, Ackland and Warner produced a volume of poetry, \\"Whether a Dove or a Seagull\\", an unusual and democratic experiment in writing, as none of the poems is ascribed to either author. The volume was also an attempt by Warner to introduce Ackland to publication since Warner had an already established reputation as a novelist, and her work was widely read in the 1930s. The volume was controversial for its frank discussion of lesbianism at a time and in a society in which lesbianism was regarded as deviant and immoral behaviour. In 1937, Ackland and Warner moved from rural Dorset to a house near Dorchester. Both became involved with Communist ideals and issues, with Ackland writing a column \\"Country Dealings\\" concerning rural poverty for the \\"Daily Worker\\" and the \\"Left Review.\\" In 1939, the two women attended the American Writers Congress in New York City to consider the loss of democracy in Europe and returned when World War II broke out. Ackland's poetry of this period attempted to capture the political dynamics she saw at work, but she had a difficult time as a poet mastering the craft of combining political polemics with her natural tendency toward lyrical expression. In a similar vein, her distress over the loss of democracy in Europe became a broader identification with Existentialism and the sense that the human condition itself was hopeless. Ackland died at her home in Maiden Newton, Dorset on 9 November 1969 from breast cancer that had metastasised to her lungs. She was buried together with Sylvia Townsend Warner in St Nicholas's churchyard at Chaldon Herring in Dorset, with the inscription from Horace ' (Ode III.30, \\"I shall not wholly die\\") on her gravestone. Critical assessment Ackland's poetry‚Äîlargely neglected after the 1940s‚Äîcame into a resurgence of interest with the emergence of both women's studies and of lesbian literature. Contemporary critical reaction finds much to value in Ackland's poetry and confessional writings, which are of historical interest to the development of self-reflective, modernist poetry, and to the political and cultural issues of the 1930s and 1940s. One example of a critical analysis is Wendy Mulford's book, This Narrow Place: Sylvia Townsend Warner and Valentine Ackland: Life, Letters and Politics, 1930-1951, Pandora, London, 1988. With regard to her self-reflection as a poet, Ackland exhibits themes and explorations similar to poets such as Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. Of interest, too, is Ackland's explorations of the personal effects of terminal illness as her life was drawing to a close from cancer. In her later years, Ackland turned from Catholicism to Quaker beliefs and also to involvement with issues of environmentalism. In overall assessment, Mulford considers the two-minds at work in Ackland's work. She cites as examples Ackland's focus on optimism and dread, the longing for emotional closeness and the fear of intimacy, self- assertion and self-negation, the search for privacy and solitude amidst the longing for connection and social acceptance as a lesbian and as a noteworthy poet. In this regard, Ackland shares much thematically‚Äîthough not in artistic achievement‚Äîwith metaphysical poets such as John Donne and Philip Larkin in the effort to see personal experience from multiple perspectives while never fully resting with one perspective or another. A contemporary examination of Ackland's poetry was published by Carcanet Press in 2008 titled Journey from Winter: Selected Poems.

The single was released on 26 May 2008. The song was first introduced by the band at their Queen Margaret Union show on 22 February 2008 as the first song on the set list. The first ever radio play was on 3 April 2008 by the radio DJ Jim Gellatly on his X-posure show on XFM Scotland, the same DJ who was the first to give The Fratellis radio play. Zane Lowe played the track to open his show on BBC Radio 1 on 7 April. The radio edit was released on iTunes (US) on Tuesday 22 May 2008, without any of the B-sides available. The B-sides include two songs previously released as demos, \\"Boy Done Good\\" and \\"Ella's in the Band\\", and the previously unheard track \\"When All the Lights Go Out\\". The single received mixed reviews from critics and fans, making a rather disappointing return for The Fratellis as a lead single. It entered the UK Singles Chart at #27 on downloads alone on the day before its physical release, the band's fifth UK Top 40 single. It peaked at #23 the following week before slipping down to #38 during its third week. Track listing This is listed on the iTunes Store as Mistress Mabel - EP.

She was the first ship to serve by that name. Zaca was built under a United States Shipping Board contract and completed as SS Zaca in 1918 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Shipbuilding Company. She was acquired by the U.S. Navy for duty with the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS). Designated Id. No. 3792, she was commissioned as USS Zaca on 30 December 1918 at her builder's yard, Lieutenant Commander James J. Carey, USNRF, in command. Following sea trials, Zaca loaded 7,446 tons of flour at the Sperry Mills Dock, Vallejo, California, and got underway from San Francisco Bay on 12 January 1919, bound for the United States East Coast. While in the Panama Canal Zone, the freighter took on board 41 passengers for transportation to Norfolk, Virginia, and transited the Panama Canal on 30 January 1919. She arrived in Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 8 February 1919. Zaca spent a week at Norfolk replenishing and undergoing minor repairs before sailing for European waters on 15 February 1919 with her cargo of flour, which had been consigned by the United States Food Administration for the relief of the hungry people of war-torn Europe in the aftermath of World War I. After arriving at Danzig on 19 March 1919, she discharged her cargo and sailed for the United States on 4 April 1919. Proceeding via Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Plymouth, England, Zaca arrived at New York City on 29 April 1919, unloaded her ballast, and was decommissioned on 12 May 1919, the same day on which she was returned to the United States Shipping Board and struck from the Navy List. As SS Zaca, the ship operated commercially under the flag of the United States Shipping Board until October 1920, when she was burned out by a ruptured fuel oil pipe in her engine room. Her hulk was towed to New York City, where it lay until she was scrapped in January 1924.

Before New Zealand became a British Colony in 1840, the Jewish population consisted of fewer than 30 people, including noted early settler Joel Samuel Polack. Immigration has led to four main groups: older families who came from the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century, lineage of European refugees from the 1930s and 1940s, families who emigrated from Britain in the 1950s, and recent immigrants from South Africa, Israel and the former Soviet Union. Prominent New Zealand Jews include nineteenth century Premier Sir Julius Vogel and at least five Auckland mayors, including Dove-Myer Robinson.

Note how the clasts are oriented at an angle to the base of the channel (blue line), which was originally approximately horizontal. In sedimentology imbrication refers to a primary depositional fabric consisting of a preferred orientation of clasts such that they overlap one another in a consistent fashion, rather like a run of toppled dominoes. Imbrication is observed in conglomerates and some volcaniclastic deposits.Pettijohn F. J., 1957, Sedimentary Rocks, Harper and Row, Second Edition p. 78 Types : In conglomerates the shape of many clasts can be approximated to an ellipsoid, with a long axis (A), an intermediate axis (B) and a short axis (C). * A-axis imbrication where the long axes of the clasts are oriented parallel to the flow direction. This fabric is characteristic of clasts carried in suspension and this is only preserved in the case of a fast-waning flow in which the clasts are deposited without any significant rolling. This fabric is typical of conglomerates at the base of turbidite beds but is also occasionally observed in alluvial fan deposits reworked by flash floods * AB-plane imbrication where the long axes of the clasts are oriented perpendicular to the flow direction and the imbrication is of the flattened AB plane, with the intermediate axes in the flow direction. This fabric is characteristic of clasts carried as bedload. This imbrication forms as the clasts are rolled along the base of a channel. The flat clasts roll onto those downstream and come to rest with their downstream end propped up by the downstream pebbles and can be used to diagnose original flow directions. =Relation to paleocurrent= The type of imbrication is generally related to paleoflow direction.; cite in Pettijohn, 1957. WadellWadell, H., 1936, Shape and position of rock fragments, Geografiska Annaler, pp. 74-92, cite in Pettijohn, 1957. found the long axis aligned with paleocurrent, and dipping basinward in glacial sediments, whereas deltaic gravels may be oppositely inclined.

Early life  Bascomb was born the youngest of a family of ten children, another of whom was future tenor saxophonist Paul Bascomb. He played piano as a child but settled on trumpet, and first played with Hawkins at the Alabama State Teachers' School (now Alabama State University) in 1932, where Hawkins led the Bama State Collegians band.  Career  Dud remained in Hawkins's employ until 1944, and soloed with him on many of his most well-known recordings. Bascomb eventually left Hawkins to play in his brother's septet, which became a big band later in the decade. He played briefly with Duke Ellington in 1947. In the 1950s Bascomb played for three years at Tyle's Chicken Shack in New Jersey, leading a quintet which counted Lou Donaldson among its members. He toured Japan three times with Sam Taylor and Europe with Buddy Tate in the 1960s, in addition to touring and recording with James Brown. He recorded sparingly as a leader; his Savoy Records sessions in 1959-60 were not issued until 1986.

Primary care emphasizes the holistic nature of health and it is based on knowledge of the patient in the context of the family and the community, emphasizing disease prevention and health promotion. This history of this role began in the 1960s when health care planners and legislators determined that primary health care was not meeting the immediate demands of the United States' citizens. Medical schools were given money to start family practice programs to meet this need, and the practice movement began to grow. Education and board certification Following educational preparation at the master's or doctoral level, FNPs must become board certified by an approved certification body. Board certification must be maintained by obtaining continuing nursing education credits. In the US, board certification is provided either through the American Nurses Credentialing Center (awards the FNP-BC credential) or through the American Association of Nurse Practitioners certification program (awards the NP-C credential).  Becoming a family nurse practitioner  Before becoming a family nurse practitioner, a person must graduate from a four-year college or university nursing program that is accredited by American Associated of Colleges of Nursing(AACN) or the National League for Nursing(NLN). This would result in a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the college or university. Next, a person would need to pass the RN licensing exam, which is the NCLEX (National Council Licensure Examination). After passing this exam, the person is a Registered Nurse and is able to enter the work force. Most nurses work for a few years in the field before pursuing further education. After completion of this prior work, a person can apply to and obtain a Master's or Doctoral degree from a family nurse practitioner program. The program should be accredited by the Commission of Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) or the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN). A family nurse practitioner may also select a sub-specialty. The following are some possibilities: Medical-Surgical, Cardiac, Endocrine/Diabetes, Renal/Urology, Perinatal, Long-Term Care, Orthopedics, Rehabilitation, Pulmonary, Pediatrics, Gerontology, ER/Trauma, Post-Partum, Psychiatric, and Critical Care. Scope of practice FNPs deliver a range of acute, chronic and preventive healthcare services. In addition to diagnosing and treating illness, they also provide preventive care, including routine checkups, health-risk assessments, immunization and screening tests, and personalized counseling on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. FNPs also manage chronic illness, often coordinating care provided by specialty physicians.

Nine years later, some of the additional buildings nearby that had been built for church use were added to the listing.  History  Springville Center for the Arts Springville Center for the Arts opened in a store front location in 1998. The organization grew out of the long-standing community theater organization, the Springville Players, after a series of town hall meetings with interested artists and actors. The former Brown's Shoe Store was converted into a black box theater with adjoining gallery and reception space. Initial programming quickly expanded to include youth theater productions, a cinema program, workshops, a writers workshop and concerts. In June 2007, the organization purchased a Baptist church dating to the 1860s. All programming is currently done at an interim setup at the site with extensive exterior restoration and interior renovations planned.  Springville Players  The Springville Players began producing live community theater in the 1966 with \\"Mr. Roberts\\". For the first thirty-two years, theater events took place at the Springville Griffith High School auditorium, Bluemont, and Springville Griffith Elementary School amongst other temporary locations before moving to a rented space at 35 East Main Street. Programming typically includes one drama, comedy and a musical per season and is coordinated by a volunteer committee. Starting in 2003 with Les Mis, an additional summer youth production was added.  Harold L. Olmsted Gallery  With the creation of an Arts Center in 1998, Springville Players, later Springville Center for the Arts, Inc., added a community gallery. Volunteers curated approximately twelve exhibits per year. The Harold L. Olmsted Gallery, named after a local notable architect, landscape architect and artist, was dedicated at the new facility on August 10, 2010 and continues to exhibit work by local artists.

Rosh Pinah is home to two mines, Skorpion Zinc and Rosh Pinah mine. Both mines extract mainly zinc and lead. Like other mining towns in Namibia, the settlement was created when the first mine was opened. The Rosh Pinah mine was established in 1969 and has been in continuous operation since then. Skorpion Zinc opened in 2001 and is the eighth-largest zinc mine in the world. It is the largest employer in town, providing 1,900 jobs. The settlement is administered by the company RoshSkor (named after and co-owned by both mining operators) because it does not have its own local government authority and falls, like all Namibian settlements, under its regional administration. The town manager is Slabbert Burger.

It has a vast and diverse geography famous for its deep canyons, high- and low-elevation deserts, numerous natural rock formations, and volcanic mountain ranges. Arizona shares land borders with Utah to the north, the Mexican state of Sonora to the south, New Mexico to the east, and Nevada to the northwest, as well as water borders with California and the Mexican state of Baja California to the southwest along the Colorado River. Arizona is also one of the Four Corners states and is diagonally adjacent to Colorado. Arizona has a total area of , making it the sixth largest U.S. state.Summary of 2000 Census Table 17 Of this area, just 0.32% consists of water, which makes Arizona the state with the second lowest percentage of water area (New Mexico is the lowest at 0.19%). Arizona spans about at its widest and at its longest, and has an average elevation of about .Weir, Bill. The Land, arizonahandbook.com. The geographic center of Arizona is located in Yavapai County, approximately east-southeast of the city of Prescott. Political geography A map of Arizona's counties Arizona is divided into 15 counties, and has 90 incorporated cities and towns. Approximately 65 percent of Arizona residents live in Maricopa County, which had a population of 3,817,117 as of the 2010 Census. Maricopa County ranks fourth among the nation's counties in terms of population, and is more populated than 24 of the U.S. states. The county seat of Maricopa County is Phoenix, which is Arizona's largest city and capital. The next most populous county is Pima County, which had a 2010 census population of 980,263. The county seat of Pima County is Tucson, where nearly all of the population is concentrated. Combined, nearly 80% of Arizona residents live in either Maricopa County or Pima County, even though the two counties make up 16% of Arizona's total area. Because of the high population of Maricopa County and Pima County, both counties are dominant in state politics. About 15% of Arizona is privately owned, the remaining land consisting primarily of public forest and park land, Native American reservations, military institutions, and swaths of wilderness held by the Bureau of Land Management. Arizona is home to 21 federally recognized tribes, which are each semi-autonomous. The large majority are part of the Navajo Nation, which is the largest Native American reservation in terms of population and size. The Navajo Reservation covers all of northeastern Arizona along with portions of New Mexico and Utah, and had a population of 107,449 as of the 2010 census. Climate K√∂ppen climate types of Arizona Due to the state's large area and range of elevation, there is a variety of localized climate conditions. Overall, most of Arizona receives little precipitation, and is classified as having either an arid or semi-arid climate. The northern parts of the state and the mountainous areas tend to have cooler climates, while the southern parts of the state tend to be warm year round. =Rainfall= A map of Arizona's average rainfall Precipitation in Arizona is governed by elevation and the season of year. The peak periods of rainfall are during the early winter, when storm systems from the Pacific Ocean cross the state, and during the summer, then moisture-bearing winds sweep into Arizona from the southeast, which obtain moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Summer rains tend to occur in the form of thunderstorms, which result from excessive heating of the ground and the lifting of moisture-laden air along mountain ranges. These thunderstorms can cause strong winds, brief periods of blowing dust, and infrequently cause hail. The heaviest precipitation is found in the mountain ranges of central and southeastern Arizona, while the driest conditions are found in the arid regions of southwestern Arizona. The number of days with measurable precipitation can vary from around 70 in the Flagstaff area to 15 in the Yuma area.Arizona Weather & When to Go, tripadvisor.com.

Annual average humidity values vary from 55% in Flagstaff to 23% in Yuma. Due to the high temperatures, low humidity, and occurrence of sunshine, Arizona has high rates of evaporation. Average annual lake evaporation varies from about in the southwestern part of the state to about in the northeast.CLIMATE OF ARIZONA, Desert Research Institute Western Regional Climate Center. Snow While the desert parts of Arizona are renowned for their warm climates, snow is not uncommon to portions of Arizona. From November through March, when storm systems from the Pacific Ocean cross the state, heavy snow can accumulate in the mountains of central and northern Arizona. Moderate snow can occur as far south as Nogales, Arizona, which is located on the southern border with Mexico, since it experiences below-freezing nighttime temperatures during the winter. The rims of the Grand Canyon experience snow during the winter due to their high altitudes. The South Rim of the Grand Canyon, located at an altitude averaging , receives of snow annually, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, located at an altitude over receives of snow.Grand Canyon National Park Weather, Grand Canyon National Park. =Temperature= Because of the dry climate and sparse cloud cover throughout the state, temperatures can vary dramatically, from day to night, and from season to season. Parts of Arizona located in the Sonoran Desert have warm daytime temperatures year round, while other parts of the state experience seasonal coldness regularly. The average daily temperatures of Yuma, which is located near Arizona's southwestern corner, range from 43¬∞ to 67 ¬∞F (6¬∞ to 19 ¬∞C) in January, and from 81¬∞ to 107 ¬∞F (27¬∞ to 42 ¬∞C) in July. In Flagstaff, located in the state's central interior, the average daily temperatures range from 14¬∞ to 41 ¬∞F (‚Äì10¬∞ to 5 ¬∞C) during January, and from 50¬∞ to 81 ¬∞F (10¬∞ to 27 ¬∞C) in July. The record high temperature for Arizona was 128 ¬∞F (53 ¬∞C), measured in Lake Havasu City on June 29, 1994 and July 5, 2007. The record low temperature for Arizona was -40 ¬∞F (-40 ¬∞C), measured at Hawley Lake on January 7, 1971.U.S. Extreme Record Temperatures & Differences, Golden Gate Weather Services. =Full statistics for ThreadEx cities= Physiographic regions Map of the physiographic regions of Arizona A shaded relief map of Arizona Arizona can be divided into two major physiographic regions: the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and Range Province, and a transitioning zone between the two called the Transition Zone. =Colorado Plateau= The Colorado Plateau is a semi-arid, mostly flat-lying region ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet (1524 m to 2438 m) in elevation, centered on the Four Corners region. The Colorado Plateau encompasses an area of approximately .Geology of the Colorado Plateau, National Park Service. It consists of northern Arizona, except for a small portion of northwestern Arizona. The Plateau ends with the steep rock wall of the Mogollon Rim, which defines the southern edge of the plateau. The Colorado Plateau has the nickname \\"Red Rock Country\\" because of its brightly colored sedimentary rock left visible by dryness and erosion, and protected from deformation. The geology of the Colorado Plateau is exhibited by the canyons of the Colorado River, and the Grand Canyon exposes one of the most unusual rock sequences in the world. The area hosts many distinctive natural features unique to Arizona, including the Grand Canyon, Antelope Canyon, Meteor Crater, Painted Desert, and the Petrified Forest. =Transition Zone= The Transition Zone is a northwest-trending escarpment of mountainous terrain in central Arizona shaped by the intersection of the higher-level Colorado Plateau with the lower-level Basin and Range Province. The area is termed the Transition Zone because it is transitional between the two regions, with characteristics from both. The area consists of a series of rugged mountain ranges and valleys. Many of the mountains of the Transition Zone are part of the Mogollon Rim, a cliff, or a dramatic escarpment in places, which extends from northern Yavapai County eastward to near the border with New Mexico. The mountain ranges of the Transition Zone include the Mazatzal, Santa Maria, Sierra Ancha, and White mountain ranges. Because of the range of elevation within the Transition Zone, climatic conditions can vary widely over small areas. The Transition Zone tends to be one of the areas of Arizona to receive heavier rainfall due to its mountainous terrain, and experiences a variation in temperature by altitude. =Basin and Range Province= The Basin and Range Province is a region occupying the southern part of Arizona, along with a strip of land consisting of the western part of the state. It is also part of a much larger region encompassing southwestern New Mexico, western Utah, and virtually all of Nevada, and extending into northwestern Mexico. The Basin and Range is characterized by steep, linear mountain ranges alternating with lengthy deserts. The mountain ranges, which poke through the lengthy desert plains surrounding them, can rise above , and create biological islands inhabited by cool-climate plants and animals. The geology of the Basin and Range is the result of crustal extension of the North American plate. Due to the crustal extension, the area of the crust underneath the region is some of the thinnest in the world. The Basin and Range supplies nearly all of the copper mined in Arizona, and contains other minerals such as gold, silver, and barite. Rivers The major rivers of Arizona are the Colorado River, and one of its main tributaries, the Gila River. Nearly all of Arizona is drained by either the Colorado River or one of its tributaries. =Colorado River= The Colorado River is vital to Arizona because of the perennial dryness of the region. The river is famous because of its role in the creation of the Grand Canyon, which was created over a period of six million years. Several irrigation systems divert water from the Colorado River, of which the one most vital to Arizona is the Central Arizona Project. The Central Arizona Project, which is 336 miles (541 km) long, diverts of water from Lake Havasu City into central and southern Arizona.Central Arizona Project The river is also utilized for hydroelectric power through various dams along the river. The dams on the Colorado River, going downstream, are the Glen Canyon Dam, Hoover Dam, Davis Dam, Parker Dam, Imperial Dam, Laguna Dam, and the Morelos Dam. =Gila River= The Gila River is long, and extends from southwestern New Mexico to its confluence with the Colorado River near Yuma. While the upper Gila River is free-flowing, the portion of the river below the Phoenix area is usually either a trickle or completely dry because of the diversion of water for irrigation. The only major dam on the Gila River is Coolidge Dam, located southeast of Globe, Arizona. Deserts The Sonoran Desert west of Maricopa, Arizona =Sonoran Desert= The Sonoran Desert covers the southwestern area of Arizona, including the cities of Phoenix, Tucson, and Yuma. The Sonoran Desert is one of the hottest deserts of the United States, and maintains warm temperatures year round. Despite the sparse amounts of precipitation during the year, the desert is home to a diverse population of flora and fauna because it has two rainy seasons a year. Several plant populations thrive because of their specialized adaptions to the climate, and various species of cactus can be found in the wild. The Sonoran Desert is the only place in the world where the saguaro cactus grows in the wild, and the fishhook, prickly pear, and organ pipe are among other types of cactus found in the Sonoran Desert. =Mojave Desert= Northwestern Arizona contains part of the Mojave Desert, which is at a higher altitude than the Sonoran Desert. The boundaries of the Mojave Desert can be determined by the presence of Yucca brevifolia (Yucca palm), which is endemic to the desert. Unlike the Sonoran Desert, the Mojave Desert has few trees, both in number and diversity. =Painted Desert= The Painted Desert is a broad area of badlands located on the Colorado Plateau in Northern Arizona. It covers at least , and stretches from north of Cameron, near the Grand Canyon, ending just beyond the Petrified Forest.Painted Desert Arizona , Arizona Leisure. The Painted Desert derives its name from the multitude of colored sediments and bentonite clay seen from its Chinle rock formation, left exposed by erosion. In the southern portion of the desert, the remains of a Triassic period coniferous forest have fossilized over millions of years. Most of the Painted Desert is located within the Navajo Nation, and is only accessible by foot. =Chihuahuan Desert= A small portion of southeastern Arizona is part of the Chihuahuan Desert. Because of its higher elevation in comparison to the Sonoran Desert, it tends to have milder temperatures during the summer. Islands Arizona is the third largest state to not have an ocean coastline‚Äîafter Montana and New Mexico. Despite being landlocked, Arizona does contain islands, even though the state has the third lowest amount of water at only 363.73 mi¬≤ (942 km¬≤) after West Virginia and New Mexico. Arizona's 0.32% of water is the second lowest percentage after New Mexico's 0.2% of water. The majority of Arizona's islands are in the Colorado River (mainly Lake Mead). Lake Roosevelt also contains a number of islands. Mountains Humphreys Peak seen on its western side from U.S. Route 180, with Agassiz Peak in the background Arizona is a fairly mountainous and rugged state, and is home to the world's largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest. Many mountain ranges exceed in elevation, and some can hold snow all summer. Arizona has 194 named mountain ranges. The highest are along the southwest margin of the Colorado Plateau, including the volcanic San Francisco Peaks just north of Flagstaff and the White Mountains of the Mogollon Rim. The Basin and Range region of southern and western Arizona has many rugged ranges existing as sky islands in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts. =List of the ten highest mountain peaks in Arizona= Humphreys Peak Humphreys Peak in the Coconino National Forest is the highest summit in Arizona. It is part of the San Francisco Peaks, a volcanic mountain range north of Flagstaff. It tops out at above sea level, and is one of the most prominent summits in the United States outside of the Rocky Mountains. The mountain is high enough to maintain snow cover in summer, when temperatures may not exceed 40 ¬∞F. The only maintained trail to the summit is the Humphreys Trail, a strenuous hike that starts at Arizona Snowbowl.Humphreys Peak on Summitpost.org Towards the top of the trail Humphreys Peak contains the only area of subarctic tundra south of the Rocky Mountains. Agassiz Peak Simply referred to as \\"Agassiz\\", Agassiz Peak is Mount Humphreys' sister peak and one of the San Francisco Mountains' \\"Big 4\\", or the top five highest peaks in Arizona. Its summit is above sea level. The mountain is closed to climbers in the summer to protect its fragile tundra environment. This peak loses its snow usually in late May but has been known to keep snow until June.http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150289/agassiz-peak.html Fremont Peak At above sea level, Fremont Peak is also located in the San Francisco Mountains. This summit is relatively unknown to visitors and locals, and it is located along the Doyle Saddle, where it is not very prominent. It really isn't a summit, just a high point on the Doyle Saddle. The Humphreys Trail runs on this ridge and atop Fremont Peak.http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150242/fremont-peak.html Aubineau Peak Aubineau Peak, the fourth highest summit in Arizona, tops out at above sea level. This is a fairly steep peak, and the home of the 2005 avalanche. This mountain is on the north side of the San Francisco Mountains and is adjacent to Abineau Canyon.http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150295/aubineau-peak-and-rees- peak.html Ree's Peak Ree's Peak is a much smaller peak than most of the summits in the San Francisco mountains, and at , it makes the northeastern tip of the range. This peak lacks alpine tundra but is home to the famed bristlecone pine. The peak is distinguishable only by looking directly at it, otherwise the other summits completely flush it out. Doyle Peak Doyle Peak is listed at , and can be seen as the summit most on the right, if you are looking at the San Francisco Mountains from the Flagstaff area. The peak can be best viewed from Shultz Pass road, and is known for its continuous aspen belt. This peak is the starting point of the Doyle Saddle, connecting Doyle Peak with Agassiz Peak.http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150288/doyle-peak.html Mount Baldy Mount Baldy, located in Arizona's White Mountains on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation, is an eroded mountain peak whose summit is above sea level. Its name was given to it by locals because it lacks trees on the upper ridge, giving it a baldlike appearance. Mount Baldy is home to the Sunrise Ski Area. The mountain is not part of a range, just a single prominent peak whose flanks are gentle and peak is rounded, not rugged. This is the same for most of the White Mountains, a geologically old range once as high as the Alaska Range, but that has been eroded away over the eons. Mount Baldy is home to a bristlecone pine forest, and some consider the White Mountains as a Rocky Mountains extension due to similar averages in elevation, tree species, animals, and weather. Mount Ord At , Mount Ord is part of the White Mountains, and is located in Apache County on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Snow often stays on this mountain the longest during summer due to its high elevation and gentle north slope, snow can stick at , sometimes more, until June, only then melting into patches.http://www.mountainzone.com/mountains/detail.asp?fid=4381156 Paradise Butte At , Paradise Butte is found in the White Mountains near Mount Baldy and Mount Ord, near Sunrise Ski Park.

Authentication management is the process of determining a user‚Äôs (or application‚Äôs) identity. This is normally done by prompting for a user name and a password. Additional methods of authentication can also include access tokens (which generate one-time passwords) and digital certificates. Once a user's (or process') identity is confirmed, policy-based authorization comes into play. A web resource can have one or more policies attached to it that say e.g. \\"only allow internal employees to access this resource\\" and/or \\"only allow members of the Admin Group to access this resource.\\" The requested resource is used to look up the policy, and then the policy is evaluated against the user‚Äôs identity. If the user passes the policy evaluation, she/he is granted access to the resource. If the user fails the evaluation, access is denied. After an authentication or authorization policy decision is made, the outcome can be recorded for auditing purposes, such as: * determining the last login time of a user * identifying attempts to gain access to protected resources * logging any administrative actions As a benefit to the end user, a web access management product can then tie this security together (which is more of a benefit to IT and administrative staff), and offer single sign on, the process by which a user logs in only once to a web resource, and then is automatically logged into all related resources. Users can be inconvenienced when attempting to get authenticated to multiple websites throughout the course of a day (potentially each with different user names and passwords). A web access management product can record the initial authentication, and provide the user with a cookie that acts as a temporary token for authentication to all other protected resources, thereby requiring the user to log in only once. History Web access management products originated in the late 1990s, and were then known as single sign on. Five of the original products were Hewlett-Packard HP IceWall SSO, CA Technologies SiteMinder, Oblix Access Manager, Magnaquest Technologies Limited IAM (Identity and Access Management) and Novell iChain. These products were simple in their functional capabilities, but solved an important issue of the time ‚Äì how to share user credentials across multiple domains without forcing the user to log in more than once. The challenge stemmed from the fact that cookies are domain- specific, so there was no simple way to seamlessly transfer a user from one website to another. The new term became known as web access management, because products added the functionality of controlling which resources (web pages) a user could access, in addition to authenticating them. Architectures There are three different types of architectures when it comes to web access management architectures: plug-in (or web agent), proxy and tokenization. Plugins are programs that are installed on every web/application server, register with those servers, and are called at every request for a web page. They intercept the request and communicate with an external policy server to make policy decisions. One of the benefits of a plugin (or agent) based architecture is that they can be highly customized for unique needs of a particular web server. One of the drawbacks is that a different plugin is required for every web server on every platform (and potentially for every version of every server). Further, as technology evolves, upgrades to agents must be distributed and compatible with evolving host software. Proxy-based architectures differ in that all web requests are routed through the proxy server to the back-end web/application servers. This can provide a more universal integration with web servers since the common standard protocol, HTTP, is used instead of vendor-specific application programming interfaces (APIs). One of the drawbacks is that additional hardware is usually required to run the proxy servers. Tokenization differs in that a user receives a token which can be used to directly access the back-end web/application servers. In this architecture the authentication occurs through the web access management tool but all data flows around it. This removes the network bottlenecks caused by proxy-based architectures. One of the drawbacks is that the back-end web/application server must be able to accept the token or otherwise the web access management tool must be designed to use common standard protocols. Solutions like CA SiteMinder (now known as CA Single Sign-On) offer both agent and proxy based options while including standards based federation. maXecurity from P2 Security employs a proxy approach. NetIQ Access Manager offers a hybrid solution that consists of both proxy and J2EE agent approaches. TELEGRID SMRTe employs a tokenization approach. Costs In most cases, the annual maintenance costs dwarf the purchase price. For example, when policy servers are used (in both the plugin and proxy-based architectures), high-end hardware is needed in order to handle the workload required to run the web access management infrastructure. Centralized administration is an additional hidden cost, because customers will need to hire and train staff to exclusively manage policy entitlements for the underlying web applications. A final hidden cost relates to regulatory compliance. Since web access management is similar in concept to a firewall (more closely aligned to an application-layer firewall), it must be able to handle major audit requirements, especially for public companies subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (not to mention those that are bound by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, PCI, or CPNI). Larger companies spend tremendous amounts of time and money auditing these web access management infrastructures since they are the enforcement points for many internal and external applications.

It is mainly situated between the A5009 and A53 roads. It shares its borders with Light Oaks, Baddeley Green, Sneyd Green, and Abbey Hulton. Milton is part of the Abbey Green ward. Bagnall Road Wood, a local nature reserve, is a short distance east of the village.  History  The name Milton derived from the Old English terms 'Mill tun' and reflects the many mills that were in operation in the 19th Century. In 1777, the Caldon Canal running through Milton was built and was important to the village's later development. It allowed packing houses for finished pottery to be constructed adjacent to the canal. From the late 19th century Milton had a number of industries. Prominent among these was Bullers Ltd who established a new factory at Milton in 1920. Bullers were manufacturers of electrical porcelain, essential to the pottery industry as a whole. There were also aluminium works, the British Aluminium Company, and chemical works, Josiah Hardman Ltd, at Milton. The Hardman Institute, which included a reading room, was established in 1895 by Josiah Hardman. =Railway= The opening of the railway from Milton to Cheddleton in 1867 (part of the North Staffordshire Railway) extended Milton's transport infrastructure and provided the village with a local station.

The discovery was announced (under the designation WASP-11b) by press release by the SuperWASP project in April 2008 along with planets WASP-6b through to WASP-15b, however at this stage more data was needed to confirm the parameters of the planets and the coordinates were not given. On 26 September 2008, the HATNet Project's paper describing the planet which they designated HAT-P-10b appeared on the arXiv preprint server. The SuperWASP team's paper appeared as a preprint on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia on the same day, confirming that the two objects (WASP-11b and HAT-P-10b) were in fact the same, and the teams agreed to use the combined designation. The planet has the third lowest insolation of the known transiting planets (only Gliese 436 b and HD 17156 b have lower insolation). The temperature implies it falls into the pL class of hot Jupiters: planets which lack significant quantities of titanium(II) oxide and vanadium(II) oxide in their atmospheres and do not have temperature inversions. An alternative classification system for hot Jupiters is based on the equilibrium temperature and the planet's Safronov number.The Safronov number is defined as \\\\textstyle \\\\Theta = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{Planetary\\\\ escape\\\\ velocity}}{\\\\mathrm{Orbital\\\\ velocity}}\\\\right)^2 In this scheme, for a given temperature, class I planets have high Safronov numbers and tend to be in orbit around cooler host stars, while class II planets have lower Safronov numbers.

Ordered in 1809, the ship was designed by Master Shipwright William Bell and constructed at Amherstburg Royal Naval Dockyard in Amherstburg, Upper Canada on Lake Erie. The design was based on the and was considered an effective design. During the War of 1812, Queen Charlotte was part of the Lake Erie squadron. After the Royal Navy took over command of the Great Lakes, Queen Charlotte was commissioned in 1813. On 10 September 1813, Queen Charlotte and the rest of the Lake Erie squadron were captured at the Battle of Lake Erie. The ship entered service with the United States Navy, though after the defeat of the British squadron, saw no further action during the war. Following the war, the ship was intentionally sunk at Put-in-Bay near Erie, Pennsylvania for preservation. Raised and sold into commercial service in 1825, the vessel continued in service until 1844, when the ship was no longer considered serviceable and left to rot as a dismasted hulk. Description and construction In 1809, with increased threat of war with the United States, Sir James Craig, the Governor-General of British North America ordered two ships in January 1809 as part of the fleet renewal of the Upper Canada Provincial Marine. One was to be constructed on Lake Ontario, the other on Lake Erie. Queen Charlotte was the latter and the vessel's keel was laid down in mid-1809 at Amherstburg Royal Naval Dockyard at Amherstburg, Upper Canada. The design for the ship was similar to , the vessel being constructed on Lake Ontario and was initially planned to be a \\"corvette brig\\" carrying guns on one deck and capable of carrying a large number of troops. William Bell, the master shipwright at Amherstburg, requested changes to the design that extended the draught and enlarged the size of the ship from a brig. These changes were approved in October 1809. The resulting design resembled the s, but was shorter, narrower while retaining the flush deck and rig. Construction was intended to be completed in 1809, however the lack of good timber and shipwrights delayed the ship's launch. During the winter months, timbers had to be brought overland, then in early 1810, the Provincial Marine vessels Earl of Camden and were sent to Pelee Island to load cedar while shipwrights from the Provincial Marine shipyard at Kingston, Upper Canada were sent to augment those at Amherstburg. The ship was constructed of oak for the large members and hull planking, cedar for the beams and futtocks and pine for the deck planking. The ship was long with a beam of and a depth of hold of and a draught of . Queen Charlotte had a displacement of 254 tons burthen and had a ship's company of 126 officers and ratings. The vessel had an initial armament of sixteen 24-pounder carronades and four 24-pounder long guns. Service history Queen Charlotte was launched in late 1810 and with her arrival, the older Provincial Marine vessel Earl of Camden was discarded. The ship's close resemblance to Royal George was only distinguished by a stern light and railing on the quarterdeck. With the outbreak of the War of 1812, Queen Charlotte was the largest vessel in the squadron on Lake Erie. On 15 August 1812 during the Battle of Detroit, gunners of the Provincial Marine set up a battery of one 18-pounder and two 12-pounder guns and two mortars on the Canadian shore of the Detroit River and began bombarding Fort Detroit, joined by General Hunter and Queen Charlotte in the river. With the arrival of the Royal Navy on the Great Lakes in 1813, Commander Robert Heriot Barclay was sent to command the Lake Erie squadron. Queen Charlotte was commissioned in the Royal Navy in 1813 under the command of Commander Robert Finnis. Barclay called the ship a \\"fine vessel\\" and \\"well-manned, would be a very effective fighting ship\\". However, the vessel was not well-manned with a crew of only 75 in early 1813. The ship's armament was altered in 1813, with fourteen 24-pounder carronades, one 24-pounder long gun placed on a pivot and two standard 24-pounder long guns. =Battle of Lake Erie= At the time of Barclay's arrival, the Americans were constructing larger, more powerful ships at Erie in a bid to wrest control of the lake. Barclay intended to raid Erie and burn the new construction before the vessels could enter service, but was prevented from enacting the plan by the Army, which refused to give him the troops he needed. Barclay instead set up a blockade of Erie, intending to interdict the ships if they launched. Barclay put this plan in motion three days after arriving at Amherstburg. On 30 July 1813, Barclay's squadron lifted the blockade in order to resupply at Amherstburg. During his absence, the American commander, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry launched the ships. Upon his return, Barclay saw the powerful American ships on the lake and the squadron retreated to Amherstburg to await the launch of . At the end of July, Perry began his own blockade, preventing the water transport of supplies between Long Point and Amherstburg. This caused shortages in basic provisions among the British, and also prevented the armament and supplies meant for Detroit from arriving. After Detroit was completed, Barclay was forced to shift guns from among his active vessels in order to arm the ship and a spare set of sails from Queen Charlotte were also donated. On 9 September 1813, with Detroit added to the squadron, Barclay sailed from his anchorage in the Detroit River to break the blockade. Queen Charlotte was located fourth in Barclay's line of battle and carried 130 crew aboard, of which less than 15 were sailors. Once battle was engaged between the British and Americans, Queen Charlotte faced off with . However, the distance was too great between the ships for any of the shots to be effective. As the trailing American schooners caught up to the battle, began to fire on Queen Charlotte too. Both American ships concentrated their fire on the quarterdeck which led to the death of Commander Finnis and the wounding of the first lieutenant. Inexperienced Lieutenant Robert Irvine took over command of the vessel. However, he could not move into a better position to take on Niagara and Somers as they were upwind. Instead, he chose to slip around General Hunter which was third in the line and attack Perry's flagship . Three of the British ships now pounded Lawrence, forcing the ship out of battle and Perry to shift his flag to Niagara. Niagara then moved forward to attack Detroit but keeping out of range of Queen Charlotte. As Queen Charlotte manoeuvred to get within range, the vessel nearly collided with Detroit and the two became entangled. Niagara was then free to fire into both ships relatively unmolested. The two British ships became untangled but the damage was done and Queen Charlotte struck her colours, followed by Detroit and the rest of the squadron. The Americans used their prizes Detroit and Queen Charlotte as hospital ships. A gale swept the lake on 13 September and dismasted both, further damaging the already battered ships. Once the wounded had been ferried to Erie, the two British ships were effectively reduced to hulks. In November Queen Charlotte was brought to Put- in-Bay and was laid up, to see no further action during the war. In 1815, Queen Charlotte, Detroit and Lawrence were all sunk at Put-in-Bay for preservation. =Commercial service and fate= In 1825 Queen Charlotte was sold to George Brown of Erie, who raised her and fitted her out as a merchant ship. Between 1842 and 1844 she was employed in the stave and timber trade. She eventually become a prey to dry rot and the elements until her owners, deeming her no longer seaworthy, left her a dismasted hulk.Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, 27 September 1844.

Used to weigh gold and merchandise, at first glance the goldweights look like miniature models of everyday objects. However, this provided merchants with secure and fair-trade arrangements with one another. The status of a man increased significantly if he owned a complete set of weights. Complete small sets of weights were gifts to newly wedded men. This insured that he would be able to enter the merchant trade respectably and successfully. Beyond their practical application, the weights are miniature representations of West African culture items such as adinkra symbols, plants, animals and people. Image:akan weight-alligator.JPGAlligator goldweight Image:gw.geometric small.jpgGeometric goldweight Image:gw.holding vessel 2.jpgFigurative goldweight Dating the weights Stylistic studies of goldweights can provide relative dates into the two broad early and late periods. The Early period is thought to have been from about 1400‚Äì1720 AD, with some overlap with the Late period, 1700-1900 AD. There is a distinct difference between the Early and Late periods. Geometric weights are the oldest forms, dating from 1400 AD onwards while figurative weights, those made in the image of people, animals, building etc., first appear around 1600 AD.. Radiocarbon dating, a standard and accurate method in many disciplines, cannot be used to date the weights, as it is an inorganic material. The base components of inorganic materials, such as metals, formed long before the manufacturing of the artifact. The copper and zinc used to make the alloy are exponentially older than the artifact itself. Studies on the quality or origins of the base metals in brass are not very useful due to the broad distribution and recycling of the material. Studying the weight's cultural background or provenance is an accurate method of dating the weights. Historical records accompanying the weight describing the people to whom it belonged to, as well as a comparative study of the weights and oral and artistic traditions of neighbouring communities should be part of studying the background and provenance of the weights. Image:pyramid.goldweigh.1.jpgEarly Period 1400 A.D.-1700 A.D. Geometric style 1/2 inch long Meanings behind the weights Scholars use the weights, and the oral traditions behind the weights, to understand aspects of Akan culture that otherwise may have been lost. The weights represent stories, riddles, and code of conducts that helped guide Akan peoples in the ways they live their lives. Central to Akan culture is the concern for equality and justice; it is rich in oral histories on this subject. Many weights symbolize significant and well-known stories. The weights were part of the Akan's cultural reinforcement, expressing personal behaviour codes, beliefs, and values in a medium that was assembled by many people. Anthony Appiah describes how his mother, who collected goldweights, was visited by Muslim Hausa traders from the north. The goldweights they brought were \\"sold by people who had no use for them any more, now that paper and coin had replaced gold-dust as currency. And as she collected them, she heard more and more of the folklore that went with them; the proverbs that every figurative gold-weight elicited; the folk-tales, Ananseasem, that the proverbs evoked.\\" Appiah also heard these Ananseasem, Anansi stories, from his father, and writes: \\"Between his stories and the cultural messages that came with the gold-weights, we gathered the sort of sense of a cultural tradition that comes from growing up in it. For us it was not Asante tradition but the webwork of our lives.\\" There are a number of parallels between Akan goldweights and the seals used in Harappa. Both artifacts stabilized and secured regional and local trade between peoples, while they took on further meaning beyond their practical uses.

Double-edged swords symbolize a joint rule between female and male, rather than implying violence or rule with fear. The naming of the weights is incredibly complex, as a complete list of Akan weights had more than sixty values, and each set had a local name that varied regionally. There are, from studies done by Garrard, twelve weight-name lists from Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Collections of weights Some estimate that there are 3 million goldweights in existence. Simon Fraser University has a small collection, consisting mostly of geometric style weights, with a number of human figurative weights. Both types are pictured here and come from the SFU Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography. Many of the largest museums of in the US and Europe have sizable collections of goldweights. The National Museum of Ghana, the Mus√©e des Civilisations de C√¥te d'Ivoire in Abidjan, Derby Museum and smaller museums in Mali all have collections of weights with a range of dates. Private collections have amassed a wide range of weights as well. Manufacture of the weights In the past, each weight was meticulously carved, then cast using the ancient technique of lost wax. As the Akan culture moved away from using gold as the basis of their economy, the weights lost their cultural day-to-day use and some of their significance. Their popularity with tourists has created a market that the locals fill with mass-produced weights. These modern reproductions of the weights have become a tourist favorite. Rather than the simple but artistic facial features of the anthropomorphic weights or the clean, smooth lines of the geomorphic weights, modern weights are unrefined and mass-produced look. The strong oral tradition of the Akan is not included in the creation of the weights; however, this does not seem to lessen their popularity. The skill involved in casting weights was enormous; as most weights were less than 2¬Ω ounces and their exact mass was meticulously measured. They were a standard of measure to be used in trade, and had to be accurate. The goldsmith, or adwumfo, would make adjustments if the casting weighed too much or too little. Even the most beautiful, figurative weights had limbs and horns removed, or edges filed down until it met the closest weight equivalent. Weights that were not heavy enough would have small lead rings or glass beads attached to bring up the weight to the desired standard. There are far more weights without modifications than not, speaking to the talent of the goldsmiths. Most weights were within 3% of their theoretical value; this variance is similar to those of European nest weights from the same time. Early weights display bold, but simple, artistic designs. Later weights developed into beautiful works of art with fine details. However, by the 1890s (Late Period) the quality of both design and material was very poor, and the abandonment of the weights quickly followed. Tim Garrard (April 28, 1943 ‚Äì May 17, 2007) studied the Akan gold culture. His research was centered on goldweights and their cultural significances and purposes. He was also interested in the gold trade, the creation of the weight measurements, and how Akan trade networks operated with other networks. His works and those that use his work as a base are very informative about broader Akan culture. The weights pictured here are part of the collection at the SFU museum. Donated to the museum in the late 1970s, they are part of a wide collection of African cultural pieces. Notes See also *Geology of Ghana *Birimian References # Danguah, J.

Adams was the highest- ranking African-American woman in the army by the completion of the war. The 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion's motto was \\"No Mail, Low Morale.\\" A monument honoring this unique group of women was dedicated at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas on November 30, 2018. Early life and education Adams was born on December 5, 1918 in Kittrell, North Carolina and grew up in Columbia, South Carolina. Her parents believed strongly in education and were high achievers. Her father, a college graduate, was an African Methodist Episcopal minister. Her mother was a schoolteacher. Adams was the oldest of four children. She graduated from Booker T. Washington High School as valedictorian and from Wilberforce University in Ohio in 1938, majoring in math and physics. After graduation, she returned to Columbia where she taught mathematics at the local high school while studying part-time for a M.A. degree in psychology at the Ohio State University, receiving her master's degree in 1946. Career Adams enlisted in the U.S. Army's Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) in July 1942. She was the first African-American woman to be an officer in the WAAC. At the time, the U.S. Army was still segregated, so she was placed in a company with fellow female African-American women officers and stationed at Fort Des Moines. In 1943, she was assigned to be the training supervisor at base headquarters. In early 1944, Adams was reassigned as the Training Center control officer in charge of improving efficiency and job training. She also had other responsibilities, such as surveying officer (finding lost property) and summary court officer (handling women's minor offenses). In December 1944, Adams led the only company of black WACs ever to serve overseas. They were stationed in Birmingham, England. The women began to socialize with the citizens and broke through prejudices on both sides. Adams was put in charge of a postal directory service unit. Another part of her job included raising the morale of women. Adams achieved this by creating beauty parlors for the women to relax and socialize in. In March 1945, she was appointed the commanding officer of the first battalion of African-American women, the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion. They were stationed first in Birmingham. Three months later, they were moved to Rouen, France, then to Paris. They were responsible for the delivery of mail to over seven million soldiers during World War II. By the completion of the war, Lieutenant Colonel Adams was the highest ranking African-American woman in the military. At the conclusion of the war, when asked about her ground breaking achievements, Adams responded simply, \\"I just wanted to do my job\\". She decided to leave the service in 1946 when she was called to serve at the Pentagon. = Fighting segregation and racism in the Army = Growing up in the south, Adams experienced the hardships of segregation. When she entered the Army, she still faced discrimination but was not afraid to speak up and fight for desegregation in the Army. One of the first battles Adams fought for equality was when the Army proposed segregating the training regiment. When she was told she would head one of the segregated regiments, she refused. Fortunately, the Army decided against creating separate regiments. On another occasion, when a general stated, \\"I'm going to send a white first lieutenant down here to show you how to run this unit\\", then Major Adams responded, \\"Over my dead body, sir.\\" The general threatened to court-martial her for disobeying orders. She then began to file charges against him for using \\"language stressing racial segregation\\" and ignoring a directive from Allied headquarters. They both dropped the matter, and the general later came to respect Adams. When the Red Cross tried to donate equipment for a new segregated recreation center, Adams refused it because her unit had been sharing the recreation center with white units. Adams encouraged her battalion to socialize with white men coming back from the front and even the residents of wherever they were stationed. She wanted to create comradeship between enlisted personnel and officers and ease the tensions of racism. =Educator= After her service in the Army, she earned a master's degree in psychology from Ohio State University. She then worked at the Veterans Administration in Cleveland, Ohio, but soon left to teach at the Miller Academy of Fine Arts. She moved to Nashville, Tennessee and was the director of student personnel at Tennessee A&I; College. She then moved to Georgia and became the director of student personnel and assistant professor of education at Georgia State College. = Community service = Adams devoted much of her post-war life to community service. She served on the Board of Directors of Dayton Power and Light, the Dayton Metro Housing Authority, the Dayton Opera Company, the Board of Governors of the American Red Cross, and the Board of Trustees of Sinclair Community College. She volunteered for United Way, the United Negro College Fund, the Urban League, and the YWCA. She also co- directed the Black Leadership Development Program. Personal life In 1949, Adams married Stanley A. Earley, Jr. They moved to Switzerland for a time while Stanley completed medical school. They returned to the U.S. in 1952 and settled in Dayton, Ohio where they had two children, Stanley III and Judith Earley. Adams died at age 83 on January 13, 2002, in Dayton. Awards and honors Adams received many honors and awards, including a Woman of the Year from the National Council of Negro Women in 1946, the Top Ten Women of the Miami Valley Dayton Daily News, 1965 and Service to the Community Award from the Ohio State Senate in 1989. In 1987, she received the Senior Citizens Gold Watch Award. Adams was listed on the Smithsonian Institution's 110 most important historical Black women, Black Women Against the Odds, in 1982. She was inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame in 1979 and the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame in 1993. She was also inducted into the South Carolina Black Hall of Fame and named citizen of the year by The Montgomery County Board of Commissioners in 1991. In 1997, Adams was included in the BellSouth African- American History Calendar. She also received honorary doctorates from Wilberforce University and the University of Dayton in 1991.

Sandaldjian's creations included a carving of Mount Ararat on a grain of rice; a crucifix in which a minute golden figure of Jesus hangs upon a cross made from a bisected strand of Sandaldjian's own hair; and recreations of Disney figures (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or Mickey Mouse, for example) or historical figures (such as Napoleon or Pope John Paul II) presented in the eye or on the tip of a needle.Alan Burdick, \\"Endpaper/Workbook; Pope By a Hair\\", New York Times, September 19, 1993.John Mack, The Art of Small Things (Harvard University Press, 2008), , , pp. 19 (excerpt available at Google Books). Sandaldjian was born in Alexandria, Egypt, and went to the Soviet Union to study music in Yerevan, Armenia and in Moscow. After graduating from the Ippolitov-Ivanov Music College in 1955, he became a violinist, and taught music at a conservatory in Yerevan. In the early 1970s he learned about the art of microminiature from one of his students, Eduard Ghazaryan.Regarding Edward Kazarian, see Robert Paul Jordan, \\"The Proud Armenians\\", National Geographic, June 1978, pp. 846, 863. Sandaldjian emigrated to the United States in 1980, but was required to leave behind his first collection of 18 miniature works. Over the next decade, he produced another 33 miniatures. Working extremely slowly under a microscope, Sandaldjian employed self-made tools such as sharpened needles tipped with ruby or diamond dust, compiling his sculptures out of minuscule materials such as dust, lint, and hair. Even among the few practitioners of microminiature art, Sandaldjian was unusual in that he painted his work, using a single sharpened strand of hair as a brush. Sandaldjian would time his motions to come between his heartbeats, thus maximizing his control of his fingers. Those who saw Sandaldjian at work said that they could not tell when his hands moved.Phil Cousineau, Stoking the Creative Fires: 9 Ways to Rekindle Passion and Imagination (Conari, 2008), , , pp.39-41 (excerpt available at Google Books). As recounted in Lawrence Weschler's book Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder, Museum of Jurassic Technology founder David Hildebrand Wilson learned about Sandaldjian from a museum visitor, and began visiting him at his home in Montebello, California. Wilson, who described the artist as \\"a very calm man\\", eventually decided to give Sandaldjian a show at the museum, but when he called Sandaldjian to tell him, Wilson learned that the artist had died only 10 days earlier. Weschler also relates that his initial doubts about the veracity of the museum's Sandaldjian exhibit were allayed when he located Sandaldjian's son in Montebello, who confirmed details about how his father worked, and also told Wechsler about the tradition of microminiature art in Armenia.Lawrence Weschler, Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of Wonder (Pantheon Books, 1995), , pp. 58-60.
