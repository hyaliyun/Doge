The party had, until 2009, two representatives in the Assembly of the Republic, elected on the lists of the Social Democratic Party, following an agreement with the latter party's leader, Pedro Santana Lopes. In 2009, under the leadership of Câmara Pereira, the party decided to run in the elections of that year on its own, gaining no seats. The party had not been elected on its own since the dissolution of the Democratic Alliance, of which it was a part, and seldom reached 0.5% of votes.

A regional party, whose electorate was concentrated on the islands of São Miguel, it was created by former supporters of the New State. it seldom obtained more than 1% of the votes in regional or national elections (even within the Azores). History The party had its origin in the Movimento para a Autodeterminação do Povo Açoriano (MAPA) (Self- determination Movement for the Azorean People) founded in 1979 by Francisco da Costa Matos. The Movement and, later the PDA, promoted a form of home rule for the Azores, following the example of the Bermudas. While registered with the Supremo Tribunal de Justiça (Supreme Court) on 5 November 1979 as the União Democrática do Atlântico (Democratic Union of the Atlantic), it had changed its name to the PDA by the 1983 election. In the Regional legislative election in the Azores held in 2004 the PDA got 284 votes. It first presented a list of candidates for the national assembly elections on 20 February 2005, but only received 0.35% (1618 votes) for the Azores. Although initially perceived as a far-right party, the party claimed to be as a right-of-centre party. It supported Socialist Manuel Alegre when he ran as an independent in the Portuguese presidential election of 2006 and, again, in 2011. During the 2008 regional elections, the party ran a campaign that included the support for a mandatory local history discipline in the regions curriculum. Visiting the district school in Ribeira Grande, party leader José Ventura, indicated proposals to extend history in school, and evaluate students. As he indicated, \\"the student who is diligent and disciplined, of course, at the end of the school year must have learned something\\", referring to situations in the local educational system, that permitted some students advancing without a comprehensive understanding. On the 19 October 2008 vote, the party received 0.8% (627) of the votes. In the Regional legislative election in the Azores held in 2012 the PDA got 530 votes. During the 2011 Portuguese legislative elections, the party candidates included representatives of the Movimento Partido do Norte (Movement of the North Party), led by ex-PS deputy Pedro Batista, whose party competed in various constituencies, including Aveiro, Braga, Bragança, Porto, Guarda, Viana do Castelo and Vila Real, addition to the Azores.

He was a fellow of Magdalen College and Professor of Classical Languages and Literature at the University of Oxford. He holds a DPhil from Oxford University. Academic career Taplin's primary focus as a scholar is Greek drama, especially from the viewpoint of staging and performance. His first book (based on his dissertation) was The Stagecraft of Aeschylus, in which he dealt with the entrances and exits of characters in Aeschylus's plays. Subsequent books, including Comic Angels (1993) and Pots and Plays (2007) examine vase paintings as evidence for the performance of tragedy and comedy. In 1996, together with Edith Hall, he set up the APGRD (Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama). It is devoted to the international production and reception of ancient plays since the Renaissance. He has also worked with productions in the theatre, including The Oresteia at the National Theatre (1980–81), The Thebans at the RSC (1991–92), and The Oresteia at the National Theatre (1999–2000). Apart from Greek drama, his chief area of interest is Homer. Among the general public, Taplin is probably best known for Greek Fire, a celebration of the capacity of Ancient Greek culture to stand the test of time and influence modern art, thought and society. The book accompanied a Channel 4 documentary series of the same name. The book has been translated into five languages. In 2008, Taplin took part in the programme \\"Greek and Latin Voices\\" for the BBC where he gave a talk on Homer and translated the Homeric texts for the programme. Taplin retired as Tutor in Classics at Magdalen College, Oxford in 2008.

Anderson was first elected to the legislature in a by-election on December 23, 1948, defeating CCF opponent Michael Taczynski in the Fairford constituency. The by-election was called after former Premier Stuart Garson resigned to run for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada.

City of Oboth) is a small village in southern Israel. Located in the northeastern Arabah, it falls under the jurisdiction of Central Arava Regional Council. It operated as a kibbutz from 1967 until the 1980s. In it had a population of . It is the site of an extensive archaeological complex known as Tamar Fortress or Hatzevah Fortress () which dates to the 10th century BCE (United Monarchy/First Temple period). Geography Ir Ovot is located south of the Dead Sea and southeast of Dimona in the Arabah valley, an arid plain located below the Negev plateau and south of the Jordan Rift Valley within the larger Great Rift Valley. The settlement abuts the Ein Hatzeva bloc of agricultural villages on the opposite side of Highway 90 near the Jordanian border, and is within the boundaries of the Tamar Regional Council. =History= Originally the site of the Ein Husub police station during the British Mandate of Palestine, the location was captured by the Israel Defense Forces in 1948. The village of Ir Ovot was founded in 1967, in an area deserted apart from a small military base and roadside cafe on the way to Eilat. It was founded by a group of Messianic Americans led by former law student and court clerk Simcha Pearlmutter, a Jew from Miami, Florida who claimed to have received a revelation from God. History of the Hatzeva Fortress Fortress. Fortress gate. First observed and documented by Alois Musil in 1902, the Roman fortress was identified on Fritz Frank's 1932 travels in the region. In 1934, Nelson Glueck identified the location as a Nabatæan caravanserai coopted by the Romans, but the site's true significance was noted by Benjamin Mazar and Michael Avi-Yonah's 1950 discovery of sherds from the First Temple period. In the 1960s, it was first suggested by Yohanan Aharoni that the site might be the same as Tamar of the Book of Ezekiel and , and Eusebius of Caesarea's Tamara. The first salvage excavation took place in 1972 under Aharoni and Rudolph Cohen's direction, but much of the work was carried out by Cohen, Yigal Yisrael, and recently Tali Erickson-Gini, following the 1986 involvement of \\"Blossoming Rose\\" in partnership with the Israel Antiquities Authority, Jewish National Fund and Tamar Regional Council. Known in addition to Tamar as the Hatzeva Fortress, or alternatively identified with Solomon's Tadmor, the site has six strata which indicate Early Israelite, Nabatæan, Edomite, Roman, and Early Arab occupations. It includes a 1,000-year-old shade tree, and the largest Paliurus spina-christi in Israel. The area was used for training crews in site conservation before their work on the Masada site. =10th century BCE= The earliest remains, dating to the Solomonic period of the 10th century BCE, resembles other contemporary Negev plateau fortresses and included period Negevite pottery. Ranging from tenth to sixth centuries BCE, Negevite was also uncovered at Tel Kadesh Barnea and :de:Tell el-Kheleifeh; it is probable that this level was destroyed by Pharaoh Shishaq like other sites of that period. =9th–8th century BCE= The second layer consists of a very large Iron Age fortification surrounded by a casemate wall. This First Temple period building of the Kingdom of Judah is almost as large as contemporary cities such as Tel Be'er Sheva, and is four times larger than other fortified Negev cities at 10,000 square metres. Excavation revealed a four-chambered, north-facing gate complex near the northeastern corner and three storerooms, a pair of granaries, a moat and a defensive wall. The city was possibly constructed by King Amaziah of Judah, an 8th-century BCE ruler who fortified the Judean kingdom and went to war with neighbouring Edom in the northern Arabah, or his son Uzziah whose construction of towers in the desert is mentioned by the second Book of Chronicles. =7th–6th century BCE= A third fortress from the Late First Temple period from the 7th–6th centuries BCE was found, though because only the walls' foundations remain, reconstructing the floor plan has been difficult. However, an eastern wall with two towers set apart was reconstructed. A pit full of smashed clay and stone, which were reassembled into 74 cultic vessels, was also found, indicating a probable Edomite shrine. Censers, chalices, altars and human figurines were unearthed outside the fortress wall on the site's northern edge in 1993, near the foundations of a small building that seems to have been a shrine. Some of the sherds resemble vessels found in an Edomite shrine at Horvat Qitmit, about to the northwest. A circular stone stamp seal discovered inside the fortress, picturing two men in long robes on either side of an altar, provides another indicator of Edomite origin. The pit recoveries dating to the end of the seventh century could possibly have been destroyed in the campaign of religious reforms spearheaded by King Josiah mentioned in Book of Kings II. =1st–4th century CE= Evidence of Roman administrative and military presence is plentiful, and the junction of the east–west Incense Road to Gaza and the north–south route to the Red Sea probably made it an economically valuable frontier outpost. The Roman fortress' layout is similar to other imperial outposts in the region. An official Latin inscription that dates several area strongholds to the 3rd century CE was discovered on a large limestone slab at nearby Yotvata bears. This site was the largest in the area at , and included four projecting towers on the fortress' corners. Artefacts tell of probably destruction in the middle of the fourth century CE, perhaps by a 344 earthquake, though it was promptly rebuilt with improved, stone flooring and again destroyed two decades later, probably from an earthquake in 363. A thermæ and caravanserai of the same period were also found, and is similar to the thermæ at Ashkelon and others in the nearby country. A row of rooms from an earlier, 1st century BCE to 1st century CE fortress revealed artefacts pointing to a Nabatæan occupation predating Roman annexation. Coins bearing the likeness of Nabatæan kings were found, along with storage jars and other vessels. =7th–8th century CE= A building fragment stratum from the Early Arab period was uncovered immediately beneath the ground surface, along with evidence of a farm located above the Roman thermæ's remains and below the modern structures.

Standing at , he played the shooting guard position. He is currently a commentator for the Sacramento Kings on NBC Sports California. Early life and college career Born in Seattle, Washington, Christie is the son of John Malone and Norma Christie. He was raised in Seattle by his mother Norma Christie. He began playing street ball at a young age, but it was under the guidance of Mark Morris High School coach Dave Denny that his game took off. \\"Once I came there, and I put that with the street side of basketball, I noticed great strides\\", he said. \\"I was learning the basics of basketball—the things you don't learn on the playground.\\" Christie played basketball in eighth grade at Cascade Middle School and for Mark Morris High School during his freshman and sophomore years. He had moved to Longview to live with his father, former Mark Morris track star John Malone. He later attended Seattle's Rainier Beach High School. In 1988, his senior year at Beach he led the school's varsity boys' basketball team to their first-ever Washington state championship. He then went on to Pepperdine University (studying sociology), where he gained national exposure. While at Pepperdine, he was twice named WCC Player of the Year (1991, 1992). He also led the Waves to the NCAA Tournament those two years, averaging over 19 points per game during his final two seasons. Professional career Christie was selected 17th overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. However, because of contract difficulties, he never played for the Sonics and was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, along with Benoit Benjamin, in exchange for Sam Perkins later that season, where in his first game his name was spelled incorrectly on his jersey as \\"Chrisite.\\" He was used sparingly in Los Angeles. In 1994, the Lakers traded him to the New York Knicks for two second-round draft picks. Again, he did not play often. In 1996, he was again traded mid-season, this time to the Toronto Raptors in a package with Herb Williams, for Willie Anderson and Victor Alexander. He stayed with the Raptors until the conclusion of the season in 2000. By then, Christie had picked up his scoring and had been a consistent starter for the Raptors. At the end of the 2000 season, Christie was traded to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for forward Corliss Williamson. In Sacramento, Christie became the Kings' popular starting shooting guard and developed into one of the league's best defenders, perennially named to the NBA All-Defensive Team; also he was recognized as one of the best 3pt-shooters during this time. Alongside Jason Williams, Peja Stojaković, Chris Webber, and Vlade Divac, the Kings starting five would become known as \\"The Greatest Show on Court.\\" Christie's defense helped the Kings rise in the NBA ranks, becoming a perennial playoff contender and eventually a championship contender, leading the league in wins in 2001–02. In 2005, however, he was traded to the Orlando Magic for Cuttino Mobley and Michael Bradley. Christie left the Kings as second all-time in total steals. He was unhappy about the trade and played only a few games before being sidelined with bone spurs. Following Christie's ankle surgery, the Orlando Magic released him on August 11, 2005 under the new NBA collective bargaining agreement one-time amnesty clause. Christie signed a one-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks shortly thereafter. Due to a slow healing surgically repaired left ankle, Christie was waived by the Dallas Mavericks on November 25, 2005, signaling his impending retirement. He had left the team the week prior to have his surgically repaired left ankle examined by his personal physician. In seven games with the Dallas Mavericks, Christie averaged 3.7 points and 2.0 assists. In January 2007, Christie attempted a comeback when he signed a 10-day contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. After the All-Star break, Christie, on his second 10-day contract, decided to part ways with the team. In 2014, Christie was named to a team assembled by Dennis Rodman as part of his \\"basketball diplomacy\\" effort in North Korea with the job of playing an exhibition match against the North Korean Senior National Team to celebrate the birthday of Kim Jong-un. Personal life Christie, and his wife Jackie, have three children. In 2002, The New York Times published a feature story in which Doug and his wife Jackie spoke about their amazing marriage and committed lifestyle. The couple remarry every year on their wedding anniversary, complete with guests and festivities. Christie is a devout Christian. In 2006, BET's BET J launched the reality show The Christies Committed, featuring the Christies' struggle to balance family and celebrity life. Jackie is also featured on VH1's reality TV show's Basketball Wives: LA and the main series Basketball Wives. During a 2012 appearance on The Rickey Smiley Show, Jackie Christie joked that the couple would soon be producing an adult film.

The name is an acronym of the four primary aspects of the disorder: Macrosomia (excessive birth weight), Obesity, Macrocephaly (excessive head size) and Ocular abnormalities. It is unknown if it is a life-limiting condition. MOMO syndrome was first diagnosed in 1993 by Professor Célia Priszkulnik Koiffmann, a Brazilian researcher in the Genetic and Clinical Studies of neurodevelopmental disorders. This syndrome's acronym is an intended pun. It refers to the traditionally tall and obese king of Carnivals, Momus—Rei Momo in Portuguese. Signs and symptoms Along with the four aspects of the disorder that give it its name, there are also other common symptoms: *A downward slant of the forehead *Delayed bone maturation *Mental retardation The ocular abnormalities are generally retinal coloboma and nystagmus. Pathophysiology Because MOMO is such a rare disorder, very few studies have been conducted into its causes. Current research suggests that it is linked to a de novo (new) autosomal dominant mutation. Diagnosis History Archie Thompson was born in 2002 in Icklesham, England and weighed 8 lb 4 oz (3740 g). By 15 months his weight had increased to 4 stone (56 lb; 25 kg) and by 24 months it was up to 6 stone (84 pounds; 38 kg). The condition placed a large strain on his heart and lungs. The Thompson family were featured in a documentary for Five first shown on 3 October 2004. It has since aired on Discovery Fit & Health in the United States. Danielle Falan, from São Paulo, Brazil, is one of the oldest surviving sufferers of MOMO syndrome. At age 17 she was featured in the Archie Thompson documentary as her mother traveled to visit her in Brazil. Falan attended school as normal, and hopes to attend college. Six other cases have been diagnosed, in Italy, in Brazil , two in Germany, , in Cuba, 2018 Diorkeblin Hernández Durruthy , and in Poland. An additional case was reported in 2010.

It was designed and developed by Lutz Mueller. newLISP is free and open-source software released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later. History newLISP design is influenced by the two main Lisp dialects, Common Lisp and Scheme, and by other languages like Pascal and C. newLISP originated in 1991 and was originally developed on a Sun-4 workstation. It later moved to Windows 3.0, where version 1.3 was released on CompuServe around 1993, then became available as a Windows graphical user interface (GUI) graphics-capable application and a DOS console application (both 16-bit). In 1995, with the release of Windows 95, newLISP moved to 32-bit. In April 1999, newLISP was ported to Linux; some of its core algorithms were rewritten, and all Windows-specific code removed. newLISP was released as an open-source software project licensed under the GPL, and development on Windows stopped after version 6.0.25. During the first half of 2001, newLISP was ported back to Windows on the Cygwin platform without graphics abilities. In the second half of 2001, a cross-platform Tcl/Tk frontend named newLISP-tk was released around version 6.3.0. In 2006, 64-bit precision was introduced for integer arithmetic and for some operations on files in version 9.0. Since the release of 6.5 in mid-2002, development has been very active, and many new features have been added. Philosophy newLISP attempts to provide a fast, powerful, cross-platform, full-featured scripting version of the language Lisp while using only a modest system resources such as data storage (e.g., disk space) and memory. It provides Lisp features such as lists, symbol processing, function mapping, anonymous functions (lambda expressions), s-expressions (excluding improper lists), and macros. It also provides the functions expected of a modern scripting language, including supporting regular expressions, XML, Unicode (UTF-8), networking via Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), matrix and array processing, advanced math, statistics and Bayesian statistical analysis, mathematical finance, and distributed computing. newLISP runs on the operating systems Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), Linux, macOS, Solaris, and Windows. It supports MYSQL, SQLite and ODBC database access, Common Gateway Interface (CGI), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (POP) 3, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and XML remote procedure call (XML-RPC). It can run in server mode as a daemon. Language features =Contexts= newLISP supports namespaces termed contexts, which can be assigned to variables and passed to functions, but which are associated with globally unique symbols, limiting their use as first-class citizens (objects). A prototype-based object-oriented style of programming is possible in newLISP, using contexts as prototypes to construct objects. Variables inside contexts do not interfere with variables of the same name in other contexts, but inside a context, variables behave according to the rules of dynamic scoping. =Scoping= newLISP uses dynamic scoping. When a function is called, that function can see all variables of its caller, its caller's caller, and so on, within the same context or namespace. It supports both explicitly and implicitly defined local dynamic variables that shadow variables with the same name from the outer environment, thus preventing accidental use or change of the variables from caller environment. Parameter variables of the called function automatically shadow the caller's variable environment. Globally, variables can be grouped in separate namespaces. =Memory management= newLISP uses a method of automatic memory management different from traditional garbage collection schemes, termed one reference only (ORO) memory management. Each variable is referenced only by its context, and each context is referenced globally. Sharing of subobjects among objects, cyclic structures, or multiple variables pointing to the same object are unsupported in newLISP. Objects are copied when stored in data structures or passed to functions, except for certain built-in functions. The exceptions are symbols and contexts, which are shared instead of copied, and thus can be used for indirection. Symbols and contexts are globally named and are deleted explicitly; deleting a symbol or context scans all other objects to replace references to it with \`nil\`. =GUI options= newLISP graphical user interface (GUI) server (newLISP-GS) is a Java-based Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) server providing a graphical programming interface. A newLISP-GS based development environment is included in newLISP binary distributions, and GTK-server, OpenGL, and Tcl/Tk-based programming interfaces are available. =Standalone binaries= Any newLISP version allows building executable files, portable applications, for deployment which are self-contained and need no installing. =Interaction with shared libraries= newLISP has an import function, which allows importing functions from a dynamic-link library (DLL) on Windows API Win32, or from a shared library on Linux or Unix. Frameworks Web frameworks available for newLISP include Dragonfly and Rockets.

However SEAC was reassembled successfully and ran for another ten years until its dismantling in 1964. Printout reads: WIPE YOUR EYE5…… I GO AWAY .%………..- SEAC (Standards Eastern Automatic Computer or Standards Electronic Automatic Computer)1955 BRL report was a first-generation electronic computer, built in 1950 by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS) and was initially called the National Bureau of Standards Interim Computer, because it was a small-scale computer designed to be built quickly and put into operation while the NBS waited for more powerful computers to be completed (the DYSEAC). The team that developed SEAC was organized by Samuel N. Alexander. SEAC was demonstrated in April 1950 and was dedicated on June 1950; it is claimed to be the first fully operational stored-program electronic computer in the US.  Description  Based on EDVAC, SEAC used only 747 vacuum tubes (a small number for the time) eventually expanded to 1,500 tubes. It had 10,500 germanium diodes which performed all of the logic functions (see the article diode–transistor logic for the working principles of diode logic), later expanded to 16,000 diodes. It was the first computer to do most of its logic with solid-state devices. The tubes were used for amplification, inversion and storing information in dynamic flip-flops. The machine used 64 acoustic delay lines to store 512 words of memory, with each word being 45 bits in size. The clock rate was kept low (1 MHz). The computer's instruction set consisted of only 11 types of instructions: fixed-point addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; comparison, and input & output. It eventually expanded to 16 instructions. The addition time was 864 microseconds and the multiplication time was 2,980 microseconds (i.e. close to 3 milliseconds). Weight: (Central Machine).

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1958, and was Speaker of the Assembly for most of Douglas Campbell's administration. Bachynsky came to Canada in 1904 and to Manitoba in 1909. He was educated in Galicia. Bachynsky attended teacher's college in Brandon and worked as a teacher before entering politics. In 1920, he married Julia Wlasinuk. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1922 provincial election. Campaigning as a member of the United Farmers of Manitoba, he defeated the incumbent member, independent Henry L. Mabb, by a margin of 581 votes to 354 in the constituency of Fisher. After the election, the UFM formed government as the Progressive Party, and Bachynsky became a backbench supporter of John Bracken's administration. Bachynsky again defeated Mabb, who was by this time identifying himself as a Conservative, in the 1927 election. He was again returned with comfortable margins in the elections of 1932 and 1936, now identifying himself as a Liberal-Progressive after an alliance between the province's Liberal and Progressive parties. Bachnysky faced a more difficult challenge in the 1941 election, defeating pro-government independent L.W. Michalchuk by just thirty-three votes. He again defeated Michalchuk, then a CCF candidate, in the 1945 election by 121 votes. Bachynsky was returned without difficulty in the elections of 1949 and 1953. After serving twenty- eight years as a backbencher, he was appointed Speaker of Legislature by Premier Douglas Campbell on November 7, 1950. Bachynsky had difficulty concealing his dislike of the CCF backbench, and once expressed his sympathy to CCF leader Seymour Farmer for putting up with this \\"bunch of wild broncos\\". Lloyd Stinson, who became leader of the Manitoba CCF in 1952, claimed Bachynsky was \\"such a volatile, vociferous orator that he was temperamentally unsuited to be an impartial moderator\\". Stinson also claims that Bachynsky consistently ruled against the CCF on procedural matters after becoming speaker. After thirty-six years in the legislature, Bachynsky lost the Fisher constituency by 56 votes to CCF candidate Peter Wagner in the 1958 provincial election. He died on his farm in Poplarfield in 1969.

The film also starred Eric Roberts, James Earl Jones, Sally Kirkland, Simon Rhee and Chris Penn. The plot revolves around a team of American martial artists facing a team of South Korean martial artists in a MMA tournament. Several subplots pop up in the story — moral conflicts, the power of the human spirit triumphing over adversity and the meaning of life are some themes. Set and filmed in Los Angeles, California, and Seoul, South Korea, between February 13 and April 6, 1989, Best of the Best was released on November 10, 1989. The film has spawned three sequels: Best of the Best 2 (1993), Best of the Best 3: No Turning Back (1995), and Best of the Best 4: Without Warning (1998). Phillip Rhee portrays Tommy Lee in all four films, produced all of them, directed the third and fourth films, and co-wrote the first and fourth films. Plot Alexander Grady, a widower and father is chosen to represent the United States of America in an international martial arts tournament against Team Korea. Once a rising star in the martial arts world, he suffered a shoulder injury that forced him into retirement. Also chosen for the team are Tommy Lee, a highly skilled martial arts instructor; Travis Brickley, an extremely brash fighter with a short fuse; Virgil Keller, a devout Buddhist; and Sonny Grasso, a streetwise fighter from Detroit. Despite being coached by veteran trainer Frank Couzo, their chances of winning are virtually non- existent, as the Koreans train all year long, enjoy lucrative financial support from their nation, and have—on at least one occasion—killed a competitor in the ring. To win, they will need to be the best technically, physically, and mentally. As training begins, the team struggles to bond as Travis antagonizes them. Given the pressure, the American team hires a second assistant coach, Catherine Wade, whose spiritual approach to training clashes with Couzo's more rigorous coaching techniques. Tommy is disturbed when his opponent is revealed to be Dae Han, Team Korea's best fighter who was responsible for killing Tommy's brother in a similar tournament. Couzo hopes that Tommy's desire for revenge will give him the necessary aggression to win, while Wade is more concerned about Tommy's mental state. With time and training, the team begins to bond and to earn each other's respect. Couzo cuts Alex from the team when he breaks the rigid training regimen to visit his son, who had been hit by a car; later, Tommy quits after knocking out Virgil with a powerful spinning side kick during practice. Travis and the others persuade Couzo to reinstate Alex, and Tommy eventually rejoins the team after a change of heart. In the first two matches of the tournament, Virgil and Sonny are out-classed by their Korean opponents. Travis does his best to psyche up the team with his brash attitude, going point for point with his Korean counterpart, but loses in a tie-breaker brick-breaking competition. Alex dominates his match with his opponent, Sae Jin Kwon, but takes a devastating axe-kick to his shoulder which dislocates it. Instead of giving up, he implores Tommy to \\"pop\\" the shoulder back into place and resumes the fight, ultimately defeating his opponent with one arm. Finally, Tommy faces Dae Han. After a slow start, Tommy gets the upper hand and delivers a series of blows that forces Dae Han solely on the defensive. As the match nears its end, Tommy has brought the American team within two points of outright victory, and Dae Han can barely stand. Tommy prepares to finish the fight, but knowing that Dae Han would not survive the attack, his coaches and teammates dissuade him. Tommy hesitates and lets the clock run out, saving the man's life but forfeiting the overall victory. Couzo consoles Tommy afterwards, telling him, \\"You won that match. Don't ever forget that\\". At the medal ceremony, Dae Han unexpectedly approaches Tommy and praises him for his honorable act. He tearfully apologizes for the death of Tommy's brother, and in return offers himself as a brother. Tommy accepts, and Dae Han places his medal around Tommy's neck before the two men embrace. Sae Jin Kwon then walks up to Alex and states his long-time admiration for him as a fighter, before also handing over his medal. The other members of Team Korea then follow suit, awarding their medals to their respective American opponents.

The book is critical of Pius' conduct during the Second World War, arguing that he did not do enough, or speak out enough, against the Holocaust. Cornwell argues that Pius's entire career as the nuncio to Germany, Cardinal Secretary of State, and Pope, was characterized by a desire to increase and centralize the power of the Papacy, and that he subordinated opposition to the Nazis to that goal. He further argues that Pius was antisemitic and that this stance prevented him from caring about the European Jews.Phayer, 2000, p. xii–xiii.

The author has moderated some of his allegations since publication of the book. In 2004, Cornwell stated that Pius XII \\"had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany. ...But even if his prevarications and silences were performed with the best of intentions, he had an obligation in the postwar period to explain those actions\\".Cornwell 2004 p. 193 He similarly stated in 2008 that Pius XII's \\"scope for action was severely limited\\", but that \\"[n]evertheless, due to his ineffectual and diplomatic language in respect of the Nazis and the Jews, I still believe that it was incumbent on him to explain his failure to speak out after the war. This he never did.\\" In 2009 he described Pacelli as effectively a \\"fellow traveller\\" of the Nazis.John Cornwell. Review of Hitler's Priests: Catholic Clergy and National Socialism. By Kevin P. Spicer. in Church History: Studies in Christianity and Culture, Volume 78, Issue March 2009, pp 235–237. Published online by Cambridge University Press, 20 February 2009. Cornwell's work Cornwell's work was the first to have access to testimonies from Pius's beatification process as well as to many documents from Eugenio Pacelli's nunciature which had just been opened under the seventy-five year rule by the Vatican State Secretary archives.Sanchez, 2002, p. 34. Cornwell's work has received both praise and criticism. Eamon Duffy wrote that Cornwell's \\"gripping and impassioned account\\" had presented \\"an indictment that [could not] be ignored\\" and Saul Friedländer that Cornwell had demonstrated how \\"Pius XII brought the authoritarianism and the centralization of his predecessors to their most extreme stage.\\" Susan Zuccotti's Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy (2000) and Michael Phayer's The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965 (2000) are critical of both Cornwell and Pius XII. Ronald J. Rychlak's Hitler, the War and the Pope is critical as well but defends Pius XII in light of his own access to recent documents.Ronald J Rychlak Hitler, the War and the Pope Genesis Press, Columbus, MS, 2000, pp 401 ff. Cornwell researched the conduct of Pacelli, both while he served as nuncio to Germany and after he was made Pope; some of Cornwell's principal resources were the Vatican archives. Cornwell stated that he reassured the archivists he was on the side of the pope as God's representative on earth and, acting in good faith, he had \\"generous access to unseen material\\". He concluded that: Allegations of antisemitism Cornwell alleged that, from at least his early '40s onward, Pacelli had antisemitic tendencies. He traced the earliest manifestation of these antisemitic tendencies to an incident in 1917 in which Pacelli refused to help facilitate the exportation of palm fronds from Italy to be used by German Jews in Munich to celebrate the festival of Tabernacles. Cornwell argued that, although this incident was \\"small in itself\\", it \\"belies subsequent claims that Pacelli had a great love of the Jewish religion and was always motivated by its best interests.\\" Cornwell stated he uncovered a \\"time bomb\\" letter signed and personally annotated by Pacelli that had been lying in the Vatican archives since 1919, regarding the actions of communist revolutionaries in Munich. Regarding this letter, Cornwell stated: \\"The repeated references to the Jewishness of these individuals, amid the catalogue of epithets describing their physical and moral repulsiveness, gives an impression of stereotypical anti-Semitic contempt\\".Cornwell, John. Hitler's Pope, Penguin, 2000, pp. 74–75. Cornwell asserts that the letter from Pacelli to Pietro Gaspam [sic Gaparri] portrays Jews in an unfavorable light and associates them with the Bolshevik revolution. In the assessment of Frank J. Coppa, writing for Encyclopædia Britannica, Cornwell's depiction of Pacelli as antisemitic lacks \\"credible substantiation\\". Coppa writes: \\"though Pius's wartime public condemnations of racism and genocide were cloaked in generalities, he did not turn a blind eye to the suffering but chose to use diplomacy to aid the persecuted. It is impossible to know if a more forthright condemnation of the Holocaust would have proved more effective in saving lives, though it probably would have better assured his reputation.\\" Papal absolutism Cornwell asserts that Pacelli was a strong proponent of the absolute leadership principle. He writes that, \\"More than any other Vatican official of the century, [Pacelli] promoted the modern ideology of autocratic papal control, the highly centralized, dictatorial authority.\\" Allegations of collaboration with fascist leaders Cornwell argued that Pacelli's antisemitism, combined with his drive to promote papal absolutism, inexorably led him to collaboration with fascist leaders, a collaboration which led to what Cornwell characterizes as \\"the betrayal of Catholic democratic politics in Germany\\". Cornwell describes this collaboration with fascist leaders as starting in 1929 with the concordat with Mussolini known as the Lateran Treaty, and followed by the concordat with Hitler known as the Reichskonkordat. =Lateran Treaty= Cornwell recounts that Eugenio Pacelli's brother, Francesco, successfully negotiated a concordat with Mussolini as part of an agreement known as the Lateran Treaty. A precondition of the negotiations had involved the dissolution of the parliamentary Catholic Italian Popular Party. Cornwell claims that Pius XI disliked political Catholicism because it was beyond his control. According to Cornwell, a succession of Popes took the view that Catholic party politics \\"brought democracy into the church by the back door\\". Cornwell asserts that the result of the demise of the Popular Party was the \\"wholesale shift of Catholics into the Fascist Party and the collapse of democracy in Italy\\". =Anti-communist posture of the Vatican= Cornwell asserts that Pius XI and his new secretary of state, Eugenio Pacelli, were determined that at a time that saw the church persecuted by Communist and socialist regimes from the Soviet Union to Mexico and later Spain, no accommodation was to be reached with Communists. At the same time, Cornwell alleges that Pius XI and Pacelli were more open to collaboration with totalitarian movements and regimes of the right. =Reichskonkordat= Cornwell asserts that Hitler was determined to conclude a concordat with the Vatican similar to the one that Mussolini had negotiated. According to Cornwell, Hitler was obsessed by a fear of German Catholics who, politically united by the Center Party, had defeated Otto von Bismarck's Kulturkampf, during the \\"culture struggle\\" against the Catholic Church in the 1870s. According to Cornwell, Hitler was \\"convinced that his movement could succeed only if political Catholicism and its democratic networks were eliminated\\". Criticism of Cornwell's work A major response to Hitler's Pope came from University of Mississippi law professor Ronald J. Rychlak in his 2000 book on the subject, Hitler, the War, and the Pope.Ronald Rychlak, Cornwell's Errors: Reviewing Hitler's Pope. Rychlak was acknowledged by the Vatican to have been given special access to their closed archives for his research. Rychlak disagreed with Cornwell's claim of having found a \\"time bomb letter\\", arguing that the letter in question had actually been written not by Pacelli but by his assistant, and moreover had been fully published and discussed in a 1992 book by Emma Fattorini (a highly respected docent at the University of Rome). With respect to Cornwell's allegations of antisemitism, Rychlak stated that \\"When Pius XII died in 1958, there were tributes from virtually every Jewish group around the world\\".Religion of peace?: why Christianity is and Islam isn't By Robert Spencer; page 124-125 Rychlak also alleged that Cornwell manipulated the photograph on the front cover of the American edition of the book, and incorrectly dated the photo as having been taken in March 1939, the month that Pacelli was made Pope. Rychlak charged that this had been done deliberately in order to give the impression that Pius had just visited Hitler when, in fact, the photo had been taken in 1927 as Pius was leaving a reception held for German President Paul von Hindenburg. Robert Royal has also repeated this allegation. In his 2005 book The Myth of Hitler's Pope, the historian and rabbi David G. Dalin also countered Cornwell. Dalin suggested that Yad Vashem should honor Pope Pius XII as a \\"Righteous Gentile,\\" concluding that \\"[t]he anti-papal polemics of ex-seminarians like Garry Wills and John Cornwell ... of ex-priests like James Carroll, and or other lapsed or angry liberal Catholics exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today.\\" Dalin called the book's conclusions \\"unverified\\" and \\"strongly anti-religious\\". Eugene Fisher, who has a PhD in Hebrew culture and education, said it was a \\"sad commentary on the secular media that this anti-Catholic screed was ever published\\". In his book The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice, Philip Jenkins said that Hitler's Pope could not be understood except as a series of \\"very low blows against the modern Catholic Church, and specifically the papacy of John Paul II.\\"Jenkins, Philip The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice, p.201, 2003 Oxford University Press US Ken Woodward, writing in Newsweek, stated that Hitler's Pope has \\"errors of fact and ignorance of context [that] appear on almost every page.\\"Kenneth L.

In an historical assessment of Pope Pius XII, the Encyclopædia Britannica addressed Cornwell's book in the following terms: \\"John Cornwell's controversial book on Pius, Hitler's Pope (1999), characterized him as antisemitic. [The depiction], however, lack[s] credible substantiation\\". The Encyclopedia further assessed his role in aiding Jews during the Holocaust as follows: \\"Although he allowed the national hierarchies to assess and respond to the situation in their countries, he established the Vatican Information Service to provide aid to, and information about, thousands of war refugees and instructed the church to provide discreet aid to Jews, which quietly saved thousands of lives\\". The 2013 book Disinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promoting Terrorism by Rychlak and Pacepa criticises Cornwell and suggests the basis for many allegations were leaks from the Soviets as an attempt to undermine Catholic influence and thus weaken it as an anti-Communist enemy. Cornwell's later views According to a 2004 article in The Economist, Cornwell's historical work has not always been \\"fair-minded\\" and Hitler's Pope specifically \\"lacked balance\\". The article goes on to state that Cornwell, \\"chastened\\", had admitted as much himself, in a later work, The Pontiff in Winter, citing the following quote as evidence: In a more recent interview, Mr. Cornwell stated: In 2009 he described Cardinal Pacelli (the future Pope Pius XII) as being an example of a \\"fellow traveller\\" of the Nazis who was willing to accept the generosity of Hitler in the educational sphere (more schools, teachers and pupil places), so long as the Church withdrew from the social and political sphere, at the same time as Jews were being dismissed from universities and Jewish pupil places were being reduced. For this he considers Pacelli as effectively being in collusion with the Nazi cause, if not by intent. He further argues that Monsignor Kass, who was involved in negotiations for the Reichskonkordat, and at that time the head of the Roman Catholic Centre Party, persuaded his party members, with the acquiescence of Pacelli, in the summer of 1933 to enable Hitler to acquire dictatorial powers. He argues that the Catholic Centre Party vote was decisive in the adoption of dictatorial powers by Hitler and that the party's subsequent dissolution was at Pacelli's prompting.

It is the only school of Lake Forest Community High School District 115, which serves the communities of Lake Forest, Lake Bluff, Knollwood, and smaller parts of Mettawa and North Chicago. It is fed by Lake Bluff Middle School, Lake Forest Country Day School, Saint Mary's, and Deer Path Middle School. History The current LFHS was built in 1935. The most recent addition took place in 2008, and was responsible for the adding of a commons area, a new lunchroom and a music wing as well as other minor adjustments. Campus View from the west The high school has both a studio theater and auditorium, as well as a television studio with 5,500 videotapes. It also has computer labs, a computerized library with CD-ROM retrieval, student publication facilities, photography lab, and special education facilities. Sports facilities include a field house, climbing wall, swimming pool with a diving well and student gym. The grounds include a large front lawn (used for field hockey, lacrosse, and ultimate) and a full-sized track and football field with 2 sets of bleachers. Because the school is situated very close to residential areas, the City of Lake Forest does not permit the school's football team to use floodlights, effectively prohibiting night games; however, in 2006, the city did allow the school to rent lights for a one-time night game. A 2007 referendum relocated the school's football facilities to the school's west campus, where the use of floodlights is not prohibited. The referendum passed by an overwhelming 2/3 majority, and renovations took place in two phases. The first phase, completed during the 2007/2008 school year, included the addition of a music wing, and renovation of the west campus including construction of a Varsity field. The second phase, completed in August 2008, included academic renovations at the east campus with a brand new dining room, a large atrium or \\"The Commons\\" and library, and construction of administrative offices at the west campus, additionally at West campus a new football field complete with floodlights and astro turf was built, now allowing night games. Prior to this, a first referendum was passed on November 7, 2006 unanimously by the Lake Forest High School Board of Education. This referendum was later passed on to the rest of the community and appropriated $54 million to be paid back over the next 20 years. Academics In 2005, Lake Forest graduated 98.9% of its senior class. It has been included in the \\"Top million\\" and \\"Most Successful\\" lists of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Parade magazine. The average class size is 19.3. Lake Forest has made Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievements Examination, a state test part of the No Child Left Behind Act.Illinois School Report Card In 2010, Lake Forest had a mean ACT composite score of 26.5—one of the highest in the state. The national average was 21.1. SAT mean scores were 601 in Critical Reading; 621 in Math; and 594 in Writing. The average tenure of faculty members is 11.3 years with 96% of the faculty holding a master's degree or higher. There are 156 certified staff members, creating a student to staff ratio of 12.7 Along with the typical course offerings, Lake Forest High School also covers 26 AP classes and 40 Honors classes. The Advanced Placement courses offered include: Biology, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Chemistry, Computer Programming, Computer Science, Economics, Environmental Science, French V, French VI, German IV, Latin IV, Latin V, Literary Analysis and Criticism, Modern European History, Music Theory, Psychology, Physics C, Political Science, Spanish V, Statistics, Studio Art, United States History, and World History. The Lake Forest High School Foundation was established in 2002 and adopted the mission statement of providing funding for resources necessary to support and enrich the educational experience of the students, faculty and staff of Lake Forest High School. This Foundation is there to provide Lake Forest High School's students and faculty with the funding they need to become more educated. The Lake Forest High School Foundation has given over 220 grants which totals to about $1,600,000. Athletics Lake Forest High School has won 71 state championships in athletics, 43 since 2000. In their 2010–2011 season, the Scouts won three state championships. The school's Varsity Dance Team (Pom Pons) won the 2013 and 2014 Large Varsity Pom National Champions at the National Dance Team Competition. The Girls Varsity Tennis Team has won two state titles in the past three years, and the Varsity Field Hockey was state champions in 2012.

Manuscript now in the British Library. The Banu Qurayza (, ; alternate spellings include Quraiza, Qurayzah, Quraytha, and the archaic Koreiza) were a Jewish tribe which lived in northern Arabia, at the oasis of Yathrib (now known as Medina), until the 7th century, when the men were sentenced to death and women and children enslaved after they betrayed the pact made with the Muslims following the Invasion of Banu Qurayza by Muslim forces under Muhammad. Jewish tribes reportedly arrived in Hijaz in the wake of the Jewish-Roman wars and introduced agriculture, putting them in a culturally, economically and politically dominant position.Peters, Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, p. 192f. However, in the 5th century, the Banu Aws and the Banu Khazraj, two Arab tribes that had arrived from Yemen, gained dominance. When these two tribes became embroiled in conflict with each other, the Jewish tribes, now clients or allies of the Arabs, fought on different sides, the Qurayza siding with the Aws.Watt, \\"Muhammad\\", In: The Cambridge History of Islam, Vol. 1A, p.49 In 622, the Islamic prophet Muhammad arrived at Yathrib from Mecca and reportedly established a pact between the conflicting parties.Alford Welch, Encyclopaedia of Islam, \\"Muhammad\\". While the city found itself at war with Muhammad's native Meccan tribe of the Quraysh, tensions between the growing numbers of Muslims and the Jewish communities mounted. In 627, when the Quraysh and their allies besieged the city in the Battle of the Trench, the Qurayza initially tried to remain neutral but eventually entered into negotiations with the besieging army, violating the pact they had agreed to years earlier. Subsequently, the tribe was charged with treason and besieged by the Muslims commanded by Muhammad.Peterson, Muhammad: the prophet of God, p. 125-127.Ramadan, In the Footsteps of the Prophet, p. 140f. The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered and their men were beheaded.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, vol. 1, p. 191.Brown, A New Introduction to Islam, p. 81.Lings, Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources, p. 229-233. The historicity of this incident has been questioned by Islamic scholars of the Revisionist School of Islamic StudiesFred Donner: Muhammad and the Believers - At the Origins of Islam (2012) p. 73. and by some western specialists. History in pre-Islamic Arabia =Early history= Extant sources provide no conclusive evidence whether the Banu Qurayza were ethnically Jewish or Arab converts to Judaism.Watt, Encyclopaedia of Islam, \\"Kurayza, Banu\\". Just like the other Jews of Yathrib, the Qurayza claimed to be of Israelite descentWatt, Encyclopaedia of Islam, \\"Al-Madina\\". and observed the commandments of Judaism, but adopted many Arab customs and intermarried with Arabs. They were dubbed the \\"priestly tribe\\" (kahinan in Arabic from the Hebrew kohanim).Encyclopedia Judaica, \\"Qurayza\\".Stillman, The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book, p. 9. Ibn Ishaq, the author of the traditional Muslim biography of Muhammad, traces their genealogy to Aaron and further to AbrahamGuillaume, The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah, p. 7-9. but gives only eight intermediaries between Aaron and the purported founder of the Qurayza tribe. In the 5th century CE, the Qurayza lived in Yathrib together with two other major Jewish tribes, the Banu Qaynuqa and Banu Nadir. Al- Isfahani writes in his 10th century collection of Arabic poetry that Jews arrived in Hijaz in the wake of the Jewish-Roman wars; the Qurayza settled in Mahzur, a wadi in Al Harrah.Serjeant, \\"The \\"Sunnah Jami'ah, Pacts with the Yathrib Jews, and the \\"Tahrim\\" of Yathrib: Analysis and Translation of the Documents Comprised in the So-Called Constitution of Medina\\", p. 2f. The 15th century Muslim scholar Al-Samhudi lists a dozen other Jewish clans living in the town of which the most important one was Banu Hadl, closely aligned with the Banu Qurayza. The Jews introduced agriculture to Yathrib, growing date palms and cereals, and this cultural and economic advantage enabled the Jews to dominate the local Arabs politically. Al-Waqidi wrote that the Banu Qurayza were people of high lineage and of properties, \\"whereas we were but an Arab tribe who did not possess any palm trees nor vineyards, being people of only sheep and camels.\\" Ibn Khordadbeh later reported that during the Persian domination in Hijaz, the Banu Qurayza served as tax collectors for the shah. =Account of the king of Himyar= Ibn Ishaq tells of a conflict between the last Yemenite King of HimyarMuslim sources usually referred to Himyar kings by the dynastic title of \\"Tubba\\". and the residents of Yathrib. When the king was passing by the oasis, the residents killed his son, and the Yemenite ruler threatened to exterminate the people and cut down the palms. According to Ibn Ishaq, he was stopped from doing so by two rabbis from the Banu Qurayza, who implored the king to spare the oasis because it was the place \\"to which a prophet of the Quraysh would migrate in time to come, and it would be his home and resting-place\\". The Yemenite king thus did not destroy the town and converted to Judaism. He took the rabbis with him, and in Mecca, they reportedly recognized the Kaaba as a temple built by Abraham and advised the king \\"to do what the people of Mecca did: to circumambulate the temple, to venerate and honor it, to shave his head and to behave with all humility until he had left its precincts.\\" On approaching Yemen, tells Ibn Ishaq, the rabbis demonstrated to the local people a miracle by coming out of a fire unscathed and the Yemenites accepted Judaism.Peters, Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, p. 49f. =Arrival of the Aws and Khazraj= The situation changed after two Arab tribes named Banu Aws and Banu Khazraj arrived to Yathrib from Yemen. At first, these tribes were clients of the Jews, but toward the end of the 5th century CE, they revolted and became independent. Most modern historians accept the claim of the Muslim sources that after the revolt, the Jewish tribes became clients of the Aws and the Khazraj. William Montgomery Watt however considers this clientship to be unhistorical prior to 627 and maintains that the Jews retained a measure of political independence after the Arab revolt. Eventually, the Aws and the Khazraj became hostile to each other. They had been fighting possibly for around a hundred years before 620 and at least since 570s. The Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were allied with the Aws, while the Banu Qaynuqa sided with the Khazraj.For alliances see Guillaume, p. 253. There are reports of the constant conflict between Banu Qurayza and Banu Nadir, the two allies of Aws, yet the sources often refer to these two tribes as “brothers”.Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, \\"Qurayza (Banu)\\". Aws and Khazraj and their Jewish allies fought a total of four wars. The last and bloodiest altercation was the Battle of Bu'ath, the outcome of which was inconclusive. The Qurayza appear as a tribe of considerable military importance: they possessed large numbers of weaponry, as upon their surrender 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armor, and 500 shields were later seized by the Muslims.Heck, \\"Arabia Without Spices: An Alternate Hypothesis\\", p. 547-567. Meir J. Kister notes that these quantities are \\"disproportionate relative to the number of fighting men\\" and conjectures that the \\"Qurayza used to sell (or lend) some of the weapons kept in their storehouses\\". He also mentions that the Qurayza were addressed as Ahlu al-halqa (\\"people of the weapons\\") by the Quraysh and notes that these weapons \\"strengthened their position and prestige in the tribal society\\". Arrival of Muhammad The continuing feud between the Aws and the Khazraj was probably the chief cause for several emissaries to invite Muhammad to Yathrib in order to adjudicate in disputed cases. Ibn Ishaq recorded that after his arrival in 622, Muhammad established a compact, the Constitution of Medina, which committed the Jewish and Muslim tribes to mutual cooperation. The nature of this document as recorded by Ibn Ishaq and transmitted by Ibn Hisham is the subject of dispute among modern historians, many of whom maintain that this \\"treaty\\" is possibly a collage of agreements, of different dates, and that it is not clear when they were made.Firestone, Jihad: The Origin of Holy War in Islam, p. 118, 170. For opinions disputing the early date of the Constitution of Medina, see e.g., Peters, Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, p. 119. Watt holds that the Qurayza and Nadir were probably mentioned in an earlier version of the Constitution requiring the parties not to support an enemy against each other. Aside from the general agreements, the chronicles by Ibn Ishaq and al-Waqidi contain a report that after his arrival, Muhammad signed a special treaty with the Qurayza chief Ka'b ibn Asad. Ibn Ishaq gives no sources, while al-Waqidi refers to Ka’b ibn Malik of Salima, a clan hostile to the Jews, and Mummad ibn Ka’b, the son of a Qurayza boy who was sold into slavery in the aftermath of the siege and subsequently became a Muslim. The sources are suspect of being against the Qurayza and therefore the historicity of this agreement between Muhammad and the Banu Qurayza is open to grave doubt. Among modern historians, R. B. Serjeant supports the historicity of this document and suggests that the Jews knew \\"of the penalty for breaking faith with Muhammad\\".Serjeant, p. 36. On the other hand, Norman Stillman argues that the Muslim historians had invented this agreement in order to justify the subsequent treatment of the Qurayza.Stillman, p. 14-16. Watt also rejects the existence of such a special agreement but notes that the Jews were bound by the aforementioned general agreement and by their alliance to the two Arab tribes not to support an enemy against Muhammad. Serjeant agrees with this and opines that the Qurayza were aware of the two parts of a pact made between Muhammad and the Jewish tribes in the confederation according to which \\"Jews having their religion and the Muslims having their religion excepting anyone who acts wrongfully and commits crime/acts treacherously/breaks an agreement, for he but slays himself and the people of his house.\\" During the first few months after Muhammad's arrival in Medina, the Banu Qurayza were involved in a dispute with the Banu Nadir: The more powerful Nadir rigorously applied lex talionis against the Qurayza while not allowing it being enforced against themselves. Further, the blood money paid for killing a man of the Qurayza was only half of the blood-money required for killing a man of the Nadir,Ananikian, \\"Tahrif or the alteration of the bible according to the Moslems\\", p. 63-64. placing the Qurayza in a socially inferior position. The Qurayza called on Muhammad as arbitrator, who delivered the surah and judged that the Nadir and Qurayza should be treated alike in the application of lex talionis and raised the assessment of the Qurayza to the full amount of blood money.Serjeant, p. 36.Guillaume, p. 267-268.Nomani, Sirat al-Nabi, p. 382. Tensions quickly mounted between the growing numbers of Muslims and Jewish tribes, while Muhammad found himself at war with his native Meccan tribe of the Quraysh. In 624, after his victory over the Meccans in the Battle of Badr, Banu Qaynuqa threatened Muhammad's political position and assaulted a Muslim woman which led to their expulsion from Medina for breaking the peace treaty of Constitution of Medina.Guillaume 363, Stillman 122, ibn Kathir 2Watt (1956), p. 209. The Qurayza remained passive during the whole Qaynuqa affair, apparently because the Qaynuqa were historically allied with the Khazraj, while the Qurayza were the allies of the Aws.See e.g. Stillman, p. 13. Soon afterwards, Muhammad came into conflict with the Banu Nadir. He had one of the Banu Nadir's chiefs, the poet Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, assassinatedRubin, \\"The Assassination of Kaʿb b. al-Ashraf\\", p. 65-71. and after the Battle of Uhud accused the tribe of treachery and plotting against his life and expelled them from the city.Stillman, p. 14. The Qurayza remained passive during this conflict, according to R. B. Serjeant because of the blood money issue related above. Battle of the Trench In 627, the Meccans, accompanied by tribal allies as well as the Banu NadirF. Donner: \\"Muhammad's Political Consolidation in Arabia up to the Conquest of Mecca\\", The Muslim World 69 (1979), p. 233.V. Vacca, Encyclopedia of Islam, \\"Banu Nadir\\". \\\\- who had been very active in supporting the MeccansBernard Lewis, The Political Language of Islam, p. 191. \\\\- marched against Medina - the Muslim stronghold - and laid siege to it. It is unclear whether their treaty with Muhammad obliged the Qurayza to help him defend Medina, or merely to remain neutral, according to Ramadan, they had signed an agreement of mutual assistance with Muhammad. The Qurayza did not participate in the fighting - according to David Norcliffe, because they were offended by attacks against Jews in Muhammad's preaching - but lent tools to the town's defenders.Norcliffe, Islam: Faith and Practice, p. 21. According to Al-Waqidi, the Banu Qurayza helped the defense effort of Medina by supplying spades, picks, and baskets for the excavation of the defensive trench the defenders of Medina had dug in preparation. According to Watt, the Banu Qurayza \\"seem to have tried to remain neutral\\" in the battleWatt, Muhammad at Medina, p. 36-38. but later changed their attitude when a Jew from Khaybar persuaded them that Muhammad was sure to be overwhelmedWatt, Muhammad, Prophet and Statesman, p. 170-176. and though they did not commit any act overtly hostile to Muhammad, according to Watt, they entered into negotiations with the invading army. Ibn Ishaq writes that during the siege, the Qurayza readmitted Huyayy ibn Akhtab, the chief of the Banu Nadir whom Muhammad had exiled and who had instigated the alliance of his tribe with the besieging Quraysh and Ghatafan tribes. According to Ibn Ishaq, Huyayy persuaded the Qurayza chief Ka'b ibn Asad to help the Meccans conquer Medina. Ka'b was, according to Al-Waqidi's account, initially reluctant to break the contract and argued that Muhammad never broke any contract with them or exposed them to any shame, but decided to support the Meccans after Huyayy had promised to join the Qurayza in Medina if the besieging army would return to Mecca without having killed Muhammad.Guillaume, p. 453. Ibn Kathir and al-Waqidi report that Huyayy tore into pieces the agreement between Ka'b and Muhammad.See also above for the critical view on the historicity of this treaty. Rumors of this one-sided renunciation of the pact spread and were confirmed by Muhammad's emissaries, Sa'd ibn Mua'dh and Sa'd ibn Ubadah, leading men of the Aws and Khazraj respectively. Sa'd ibn Mua'dh reportedly issued threats against the Qurayza but was restrained by his colleague.Muir, A Life of Mahomet and History of Islam to the Era of the Hegira, chapter XVII, p. 259f. As this would have allowed the besiegers to access the city and thus meant the collapse of the defenders' strategy, Muhammad \\"became anxious about their conduct and sent some of the leading Muslims to talk to them; the result was disquieting.\\" According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad sent Nuaym ibn Masud, a well-respected elder of the Ghatafan who had secretly converted to Islam, to go to Muhammad's enemies and sow discord among them. Nuaym went to the Qurayza and advised them to join the hostilities against Muhammad only if the besiegers provide hostages from among their chiefs. He then hurried to the invaders and warned them that if the Qurayza asked for hostages, it is because they intended to turn them over to the Medinan defenders. When the representatives of the Quraysh and the Ghatafan came to the Qurayza, asking for support in the planned decisive battle with Muhammad, the Qurayza indeed demanded hostages. The representatives of the besiegers refused, breaking down negotiationsGuillaume, p. 458f.Ramadan, p. 143. and resulting in the Banu Qurayza becoming extremely distrustful of the besieging army. The Qurayza did not take any actions to support them until the besieging forces retreated. Thus the threat of a second front against the defenders never materialised. Siege and surrender After the Meccans' withdrawal, Muhammad then led his forces against the Banu Qurayza neighborhood. According to Ibn Ishaq, he had been asked to do so by the angel Gabriel. The Banu Qurayza retreated into their stronghold and endured the siege for 25 days. As their morale waned, Ka'b ibn Asad suggested three alternative ways out of their predicament: embrace Islam; kill their own children and women, then rush out for a charge to either win or die; or make a surprise attack on the Sabbath. The Banu Qurayza accepted none of these alternatives. Instead they asked to confer with Abu Lubaba, one of their allies from the Aws. According to Ibn Ishaq, Abu Lubaba felt pity for the women and children of the tribe who were crying and when asked whether the Qurayza should surrender to Muhammad, advised them to do so. However he also \\"made a sign with his hand toward his throat, indicating that [their fate] at the hands of the Prophet would be slaughter\\".Guillaume, p. 461-464.Peters, Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, p. 222-224.Stillman, p. 137-141.Inamdar, Muhammad and the Rise of Islam, p. 166f. The next morning, the Banu Qurayza surrendered and the Muslims seized their stronghold and their stores.These included weapons, household goods, utensils, camels and cattle. The stored wine was spilled. See Kister, p. 94. The men - Ibn Ishaq numbers between 400 and 900 \\\\- were bound and placed under the custody of one Muhammad ibn Maslamah, who had killed Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, while the women and children - numbering about 1,000Kister, \\"The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza\\", p. 93f. \\\\- were placed under Abdullah ibn Sallam, a former rabbi who had converted to Islam.Muir, p. 272-274.Ramadan, p. 145. Killing of the Banu Qurayza The circumstances of the Qurayza's demise have been related by Ibn Ishaq and other Muslim historians who relied upon his account. According to Watt, Peters and Stillman, the Qurayza surrendered to Muhammad's judgement \\\\- a move Watt classifies as unconditional. The Aws, who wanted to honor their old alliance with the Qurayza, asked Muhammad to treat the Qurayza leniently as he had previously treated the Qaynuqa for the sake of Ibn Ubayy. (Arab custom required support of an ally, independent of the ally's conduct to a third party.) Muhammad then suggested to bring the case before an arbitrator chosen from the Aws, to which both the Aws and the Qurayza agreed to. Muhammad then appointed Sa'd ibn Mua'dh to decide the fate of the Jewish tribe.Adil, Muhammad: The Messenger of Islam, p. 395f. According to Hashmi, Buchanan and Moore, the tribe agreed to surrender on the condition of a Muslim arbitrator of their choosing.Hashmi, Buchanan & Moore, States, Nations, and Borders: The Ethics of Making Boundaries. According to Khadduri (also cited by Abu-Nimer), \\"both parties agreed to submit their dispute to a person chosen by them\\"Khadduri, War and Peace in the Law of Islam, p. 233f.Abu-Nimer, \\"A Framework for Nonviolence and Peacebuilding in Islam\\", p. 247. in accordance with the Arabian tradition of arbitration. Muir holds that the Qurayza surrendered on the condition that \\"their fate was decided by their allies, the Bani Aws\\".Muir (p. 272-274) rejects as unlikely the view that the Qurayza surrendered to Muhammad (as later espoused by Watt) as well accounts that the besieged Jews, refusing to surrender to Muhammad, instead named Sa'd as alternative and subsequently surrendered to him. In all accounts, the appointed arbitrator was Sa'd ibn Mua'dh, a leading man among the Aws. During the Battle of the Trench, he had been one of Muhammad's emissaries to the Qurayza (see above) and now was dying from a wound he had received later in the battle. When Sa'd arrived, his fellow Aws pleaded for leniency towards the Qurayza and on his request pledged that they would abide by his decision. He then decreed that \\"the men should be killed, the property divided, and the women and children taken as captives\\". Muhammad approved of the ruling, calling it similar to God's judgment. Chiragh Ali argued that this statement may have referred to \\"king\\" or \\"ruler\\" rather than God.Chirāgh ʼAlī, Critical Exposition of Popular Jihad. Sa'd dismissed the pleas of the Aws, according to Watt because being close to death and concerned with his afterlife, he put what he considered \\"his duty to God and the Muslim community\\" before tribal allegiance. Tariq Ramadan argues that Muhammad deviated from his earlier, more lenient treatment of prisoners as this was seen \\"as sign of weakness if not madness\\", Peterson concurs that the Muslims wanted to deter future treachery by setting an example with severe punishment. Lings reports that Sa'ad feared that if expelled, the Qurayza would join the Nadir in the fight against the Muslims. According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd so as not to pronounce the judgment himself, after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: \\"Sa\`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.\\" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender. Ibn Ishaq describes the killing of the Banu Qurayza men as follows: Several accounts note Muhammad's companions as executioners, Ali and Al-Zubayr in particular, and that each clan of the Aws was also charged with killing a group of Qurayza men. Subhash Inamdar argues that this was done in order to avoid the risk of further conflicts between Muhammad and the Aws. According to Inamdar, Muhammad wanted to distance himself from the events and, had he been involved, he would have risked alienating some of the Aws. It is also reported that one woman, who had thrown a millstone from the battlements during the siege and killed one of the Muslim besiegers, was also beheaded along with the men.Muir (p. 277) follows Hishami and also refers to Aisha, who had related: \\"But I shall never cease to marvel at her good humour and laughter, although she knew that she was to die.\\" (Ibn Ishaq, Biography of Muhammad). Ibn Asakir writes in his History of Damascus that the Banu Kilab, a clan of Arab clients of the Banu Qurayza, were killed alongside the Jewish tribe.Lecker, \\"On Arabs of the Banū Kilāb executed together with the Jewish Banū Qurayza\\", p. 69. Three boys of the clan of Hadl, who had been with Qurayza in the strongholds, slipped out before the surrender and converted to Islam. The son of one of them, Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Qurazi, gained distinction as a scholar. One or two other men also escaped. The spoils of battle, including the enslaved women and children of the tribe, were divided up among the Islamic warriors that had participated in the siege and among the emigrees from Mecca (who had hitherto depended on the help of the Muslims native to Medina.Kister, \\"The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza\\", p. 95f.Rodinson, Muhammad: Prophet of Islam, p. 213. Mohammad collected one-fifth of the booty, which was then redistributed to the Muslims in need, as was customary. As part of his share of the spoils, Muhammad selected one of the women, Rayhana, for himself and took her as part of his booty. Muhammad offered to free and marry her and according to some sources she accepted his proposal.Ramadan, p. 146. She is said to have later become a Muslim. Some of the women and children of the Banu Qurayza who were enslaved by the Muslims were later bought by Jews, in particular the Banu Nadir. Peterson argues that this is because the Nadir felt responsible for the Qurayza's fate due to the role of their chieftain in the events. =Analysis= According to Islamic traditions, the Qur'an briefly refers to the incident in Surah , yet it is historically doubtful whether the Qur'an really refers to this event. Muslim jurists have looked upon Surah as a justification of the treatment of the Banu Qurayza, arguing that the Qurayza broke their pact with Muhammad, and thus Muhammad was justified in repudiating his side of the pact and killing the Qurayza en masse. Arab Muslim theologians and historians have either viewed the incident as \\"the punishment of the Medina Jews, who were invited to convert and refused, perfectly exemplify the Quran's tales of what happened to those who rejected the prophets of old\\" or offered a political, rather than religious, explanation.Peters, Islam. A Guide for Jews and Christians, p. 77. In the 8th and early 9th century many Muslim jurists, such as Ash-Shafii, based their judgments and decrees supporting collective punishment for treachery on the accounts of the demise of the Qurayza, with which they were well acquainted.Kister, The Massacre of the Banū Quraiza, p. 66. However, the proceedings of Muhammad with regard to the Banu Nadir and the Banu Qurayza were not taken as a model for the relationship of Muslim states toward its Jewish subjects.Handwörterbuch des Islam, \\"Ahl al- Kitab\\".Ayoub, \\"Dhimmah in Qur'an and Hadith\\", p. 179; Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol. 2, Book 23, Number 475 and Volume 5, Book 57, Number 50 as authorities.Shorter Encyclopaedia of Islam, \\"Ahl al-Kitab.Lewis, The Jews of Islam, p. 32.Khadduri, p. 175. In his 1861 biography of Muhammad Sir William Muir argued that the massacre cannot be justified by political necessity and \\"casts an odious blot upon the prophet's name\\".Mahomet and Islam, London 1895, p. 151. Quote: \\"The massacre of Banu Coreitza was a barbarous deed which cannot be justified by any reason of political necessity. Mahomet might... have been justified in making them quit altogether a neighborhood in which they formed a dangerous nucleus of disaffection at home, and an encouragement for attack abroad. But the indiscriminate slaughter of the whole tribe cannot but be recognized as an act of enormous cruelty, which casts an odious blot upon the prophet's name.\\" Leone Caetani argued that the judgement was in fact dictated by Muhammad, making him responsible for the massacre.\\"Con questa versione la tradizione ha voluto togliere a Maometto la responsabilità diretta dell’inumano massacro di circa 900 innocenti: l'artiﬁzio tradizionistico è tanto trasparente che non occorre nemmeno di porlo in rilievo. La sentenza di Sa'd fu in ogni caso dettata e ispirata dal Profeta, il quale gli fece certamente capire quale era la decisione da lui desiderata. La responsabilità dell’eccidio incombe tutta sul Profeta.\\" (Annali dell' Islam, Vol. I, p. 632, Note 1.) Translation: \\"By this version the tradition has tried to remove from Muhammad the direct responsibility for the inhuman massacre of about 900 innocent persons; the artifice of the traditionists is so transparent that it is hardly necessary to set it in relief. The sentence of Sa'd was in any case dictated and inspired by the Prophet, who certainly made him understand what was the decision required of him. The responsibility for the slaughter falls entirely on the Prophet.\\" Francesco Gabrieli commented that \\"we can only record the fact... that this God or at least this aspect of Him, is not ours\\".Muhammad and the Conquest of Islam, London 1968, p. 73. Quote: \\"This dark episode, which Muslim tradition, it must be said, takes quite calmly, has provoked lively discussion among western biographers of Muhammed, with caustic accusations on the one hand and legalistic excuses on the other.... In this case he was ruthless, with the approval of his conscience and of his God, for the two were one; we can only record the fact, while reaffirming our consciousness as Christians and civilized men, that this God or at least this aspect of Him, is not ours.\\" ParetParet, Mohammed und der Koran, p. 122-124. and WattWatt, Muhammad at Medina, p. 217-218. say that the Banu Qurayza were killed not because of their faith but for \\"treasonable activities against the Medinan community\\". Watt relates that \\"no important clan of Jews was left in Medina\\" but he and Paret also note that Muhammad did not clear all Jews out of Medina.The Encyclopedia Judaica (Vol. XI, col. 1212) estimates the Jewish population of Medina at 8,000 to 10,000. Barakat Ahmad (p. 43) calls this an understatement and calculates that there still remained 24,000 to 28,000 Jews in Medina, after the demise of the Qurayza. These figures are cited by Peters (Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, p. 301 (note 41): \\"According to Ahmad, whose estimate of the Jewish population at 36,000-42,000 has already been cited, the departure of the Banu Nadir and the decimation of the Banu Qurayza would still have left between 24,000-28,000 Jews at Medina.\\") but are disputed by Reuven Firestone (\\"The failure of a Jewish program of public satire in the squares of Medina\\"). Watt (Muhammad, Prophet and Statesman, p. 175f.) describes the remaining Jews as \\"several small groups\\". Aiming at placing the events in their historical context, Watt points to the \\"harsh political circumstances of that era\\" and argues that the treatment of Qurayza was regular Arab practice (\\"but on a larger scale than usual\\").Watt, Muhammad at Medina, p. 296. Similar statements are made by Stillman, Paret, LewisBernard Lewis: The Political Language of Islam. University of Chicago Press, 1991. p.191 and Rodinson. On the other hand, Michael Lecker and Irving Zeitlin consider the events \\"unprecedented in the Arab peninsula - a novelty\\" and state that \\"prior to Islam, the annihilation of an adversary was never an aim of war.\\"Zeitlin, The Historical Muhammad, p. 133. Similar statements are made by HirschbergHirschberg, Yisrael Ba'Arav, p. 146. and Baron.Baron, A Social and Religious History of the Jews. Volume III: Heirs of Rome and Persia, p. 79. Some authors assert that the judgement of Sa'd ibn Mua'dh was conducted according to laws of Torah.See Lings, Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources, p. 232Daniel C. Peterson. Muhammad, Prophet of God, Kindle loc. 2627.

Muhammad Hamidullah goes further and says that Sa'd \\"applied to them their own Biblical law [...] and their own practice.\\"Muhammad Hammīdullāh, Battlefields, p. 3, footnote no. 1. No contemporaneous source says explicitly that Sa'd based his judgment on the Torah. Moreover, the respective verses of the Torah make no mention of treason or breach of faith, and the Jewish law as it existed at the time and as it is still understood today applies these Torah verses only to the situation of the conquest of Canaan under Joshua, and not to any other period of history.e.g., Tosefta Avodah Zarah, 26b; The savoraim, the Jewish sages of Babylonia and the Levant who were involved in the dissemination of rabbinic halakha as codified in the Mishnah and, later, the Talmud, maintained close relations with the Jewish communities of Yemen and Arabia, and their rulings were accepted in those regions.

Maimonides, writing in the 13th century, reported a long-standing tradition that Deuteronomy 20 applied only to the period of the conquest of Canaan and was never applicable thereafter. Mishne Torah Sanhedrin 11. According to David M. Granskou and Peter Richardson (Anti-Judaism in Early Christianity) this command has not been practiced by Jews after times of David. =Doubts about the historicity of the event= Walid N. Arafat and Barakat Ahmad have disputed that the Banu Qurayza were killed on quite such a large scale.Meri, Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia, p. 754. Arafat disputes large-scale killings and argued that Ibn Ishaq gathered information from descendants of the Qurayza Jews, who embellished or manufactured the details of the incident. Arafat relates the testimony of Ibn Hajar, who denounced this and other accounts as \\"odd tales\\" and quoted Malik ibn Anas, a contemporary of Ibn Ishaq, whom he rejected as a \\"liar\\", an \\"impostor\\" and for seeking out the Jewish descendants for gathering information about Muhammad's campaign with their forefathers.Arafat, \\"New Light on the Story of Banu Qurayza and the Jews of Medina\\", p. 100-107. Arafat relates the testimony of Ibn Hajar, who denounced this and other accounts as \\"odd tales\\" and quoted Malik ibn Anas, a contemporary of Ibn Ishaq, whom he rejected as a \\"liar\\", an \\"impostor\\" and for seeking out the Jewish descendants for gathering information about Muhammad's campaign with their forefathers. Ahmad argues that only some of the tribe were killed, while some of the fighters were merely enslaved.Nemoy, \\"Barakat Ahmad's \\"Muhammad and the Jews\\"\\", p. 325. Nemoy is sourcing Ahmad's Muhammad and the Jews.See Article by Imam Mohamad Jebara \\"Myth of the Medina Massacre\\" http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/myth-of-the-medina-massacre/Ahmad, p. 85-94. Watt finds Arafat's arguments \\"not entirely convincing\\", while Meir J. Kister has contradicted the arguments of Arafat and Ahmad.Kister, \\"The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza\\". The historicity of this event has been put into question by western scholars such as Hans Jansen, Fred Donner, Patricia Crone & Michael Cook. Other Jewish tribes Most Jewish tribes that remained loyal towards the prophet always held a friendly status and were called allies of the Muslims. Taking the tribe of Banu al-Harith as an example that were concluded in the 31 Points of the Constitution of Medina and honored as allies to the Muslims being as \\"one nation\\", but retaining their Jewish religion. Constitution_of_Medina s:Constitution of Medinawww.balagh.net They were given the same rights as Banu Awf and entered into mutual protection pacts with the Muslim tribes.Charles Kurzman, Liberal Islam, p. 172 In the Constitution of Medina, Jews were given equality to Muslims in exchange for political loyaltyEsposito, John.

A significant narrative symbolising the inter-faith harmony between early Muslims and Jews is that of the Rabbi Mukhayriq. The Rabbi was from Banu Nadir and fought alongside Muslims at the Battle of Uhud and bequeathed his entire wealth to Muhammad in the case of his death. He was subsequently called ″the best of the Jews″ by Muhammad.

It was originally intended as a less dangerous alternative to the Oregon Trail by which to reach the Oregon Territory. Much of the route was coterminous with the California Trail. Background In 1843, part of the Applegate family of Missouri headed west along the Oregon Trail to the Oregon Country. Brothers Charles, Jesse, and Lindsay led their families through many hardships along the trail, including the loss of two children on the journey down the Columbia River. These experiences influenced the family to find an easier and safer way to the Willamette Valley. In 1846, the Oregon Provisional Legislature allowed the Applegates and others to attempt to find a more southerly route to Oregon. The group began the trek on June 25, 1846, with Jesse Applegate, Lindsay Applegate, David Goff, John Owen, B. F. Burch, W. Sportsman, Robert Smith, a Mr. Goodhue, J. Jones, B. Ausbuan, and Levi Scott starting the survey. Leaving La Creole, the party spent three and a half months surveying a route to Fort Hall in present-day Idaho. At that location, the Applegate Trail departed the main branch of the Oregon Trail.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Portland: Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 218-19. On the return trip, the group brought approximately 150 immigrants along the new southern route, also known as the South Road, South Emigrant Trail or the Scott-Applegate Trail. Route From Fort Hall, the route headed south following the Humboldt River before passing through the Black Rock Desert in present-day Nevada. The trail then entered Northern California and passed Goose and Tule lakes. After crossing the Lost River, the route then crossed the Klamath Basin and the Cascade Range into Southern Oregon. The trail followed Keene Creek to the Siskiyou Mountains, then Bear Creek and the Rogue River. Heading north from there, the route crossed the Umpqua River before crossing the Calapooya Mountains into the southern Willamette Valley. Subsequent history After the initial party traveled the trail, it continued to be used and improved over the next few decades. In 1848, when news of the California Gold Rush reached the Willamette Valley, many settlers including Jesse and Lindsay Applegate left Oregon for the gold fields and used the trail to reach northern California. On August 3, 1992, the Applegate Trail became a National Historic Trail as part of the California National Historic Trail. The Nevada section of the trail is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Applegate-Lassen Trail.

It is operated by the University of Chicago and publishes a wide variety of academic titles, including The Chicago Manual of Style, numerous academic journals, and advanced monographs in the academic fields. One of its quasi-independent projects is the BiblioVault, a digital repository for scholarly books. The Press building is located just south of the Midway Plaisance on the University of Chicago campus. History Harper Library The University of Chicago Press was founded in 1890, making it one of the oldest continuously operating university presses in the United States. Its first published book was Robert F. Harper's Assyrian and Babylonian Letters Belonging to the Kouyunjik Collections of the British Museum. The book sold five copies during its first two years, but by 1900 the University of Chicago Press had published 127 books and pamphlets and 11 scholarly journals, including the current Journal of Political Economy, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, and American Journal of Sociology. For its first three years, the Press was an entity discrete from the university; it was operated by the Boston publishing house D. C. Heath in conjunction with the Chicago printer R. R. Donnelley. This arrangement proved unworkable, however, and in 1894 the university officially assumed responsibility for the Press. In 1902, as part of the university, the Press started working on the Decennial Publications. Composed of articles and monographs by scholars and administrators on the state of the university and its faculty's research, the Decennial Publications was a radical reorganization of the Press. This allowed the Press, by 1905, to begin publishing books by scholars not of the University of Chicago. A manuscript editing and proofreading department was added to the existing staff of printers and typesetters, leading, in 1906, to the first edition of The Chicago Manual of Style. By 1931, the Press was an established, leading academic publisher. Leading books of that era include Dr. Edgar J. Goodspeed's The New Testament: An American Translation (the Press's first nationally successful title) and its successor, Goodspeed and J. M. Povis Smith's The Complete Bible: An American Translation; Sir William Alexander Craigie's A Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles, published in four volumes in 1943; John Manly and Edith Rickert's The Canterbury Tales, published in 1940; and Kate Turabian's A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations. In 1956, the Press first published paperback-bound books (including the Phoenix Books series)Phoenix Books (University of Chicago Press) - Book Series List , publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 22 October 2017. under its imprint. Of the Press's best-known books, most date from the 1950s, including translations of the Complete Greek Tragedies and Richmond Lattimore's The Iliad of Homer. That decade also saw the first edition of A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, which has since been used by students of Biblical Greek worldwide. In 1966, Morris Philipson began his 34-year tenure as director of the University of Chicago Press. He committed time and resources to lengthening the backlist, becoming known for assuming ambitious scholarly projects, among the largest of which was The Lisle Letters — a vast collection of 16th-century correspondence by Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, a wealth of information about every aspect of 16th-century life. As the Press's scholarly volume expanded, the Press also advanced as a trade publisher. In 1992, Norman Maclean's books A River Runs Through It and Young Men and Fire were national best sellers, and A River Runs Through It was made into a film directed by and starring Robert Redford. In 1982, Philipson was the first director of an academic press to win the Publisher Citation, one of PEN's most prestigious awards. Shortly before he retired in June 2000, Philipson received the Association of American Publishers' Curtis Benjamin Award for Creative Publishing, awarded to the person whose \\"creativity and leadership have left a lasting mark on American publishing.\\" Paula Barker Duffy served as director of the Press from 2000 to 2007. Under her administration, the Press expanded its distribution operations and created the Chicago Digital Distribution Center and BiblioVault. Editorial depth in reference and regional books increased with titles such as The Encyclopedia of Chicago, Timothy J. Gilfoyle's Millennium Park, and new editions of The Chicago Manual of Style, the Turabian Manual, and The University of Chicago Spanish Dictionary. The Press also launched an electronic reference work, The Chicago Manual of Style Online. In 2014, the Press received The International Academic and Professional Publisher Award for excellence at the London Book Fair. Current status University of Chicago Press Garrett P. Kiely became the 15th director of the University of Chicago Press on September 1, 2007. He heads one of academic publishing's largest operations, employing more than 300 people across three divisions—books, journals, and distribution—and publishing 81 journal titles and approximately 280 new books and 70 paperback reprints each year. The Press publishes over 50 new trade titles per year, across many subject areas. It also publishes regional titles, such as The Encyclopedia of Chicago (2004), edited by James R. Grossman, Ann Durkin Keating, and Janice Reiff;Grossman, Keating, and Reiff, eds. The Encyclopedia of Chicago (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004) The Chicagoan: A Lost Magazine of the Jazz Age (2008) by Neil Harris; One More Time: The Best of Mike Royko (1999), a collection of columns by Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaperman Mike Royko of the Chicago Sun- Times and the Chicago Tribune; and many other books about the art, architecture, and nature of Chicago and the Midwest. The Press has recently expanded its digital offerings to include most newly published books as well as key backlist titles. In 2013, Chicago Journals began offering e-book editions of each new issue of each journal, for use on e-reader devices such as smartphones, iPad, and Amazon Kindle. The contents of The Chicago Manual of Style are available online to paid subscribers. The Chicago Distribution Center is recognized as a leading distributor of scholarly works, with over 100 client presses.\\"About the Press,\\" University of Chicago Press, accessed April 23, 2015. =Books Division= The Books Division of the University of Chicago Press has been publishing books for scholars, students, and general readers since 1892 and has published over 11,000 books since its founding. The Books Division presently has more than 6,000 books in print, including such well-known works as The Chicago Manual of Style (1906); The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962), by Thomas Kuhn; A River Runs Through It (1976), by Norman Maclean; and The Road to Serfdom (1944), by F. A. Hayek. In July 2009, the Press announced the Chicago Digital Editions program, which made many of the Press's titles available in e-book form for sale to individuals. As of August 2016, more than 3,500 titles are available in this format. In August 2010, the Press published the 16th Edition of The Chicago Manual of Style simultaneously in print and online editions. The Books Division offers a Free E-book Of The Month program, through which site visitors may provide their e-mail address and receive a link to that month's free, downloadable e-book selection. =Journals Division= The Journals Division of the University of Chicago Press publishes and distributes influential scholarly publications on behalf of learned and professional societies and associations, foundations, museums, and other not-for-profit organizations. As of 2016 it publishes 81 titles in a wide range of academic disciplines including the biological and medical sciences, education, the humanities, the physical sciences, and the social sciences. All are peer-reviewed journals of original scholarship, with readerships that include scholars, scientists, and medical practitioners as well as interested, educated laypeople. Since 1974 the Press has published the prestigious humanities journal Critical Inquiry. The Journals Division has been a pioneer in making scholarly and scientific journals available in electronic form in conjunction with their print editions. Electronic publishing efforts were launched in 1995; by 2004 all the journals published by the University of Chicago Press were available online. In 2013, all new journal issues were also made available to subscribers in e-book format. =Chicago Distribution Center= The Distribution Services Division provides the University of Chicago Press's customer service, warehousing, and related services.

The ICC is an active member of NASCO. History In response to the harsh economic times imposed by the Great Depression, members of the Socialist Club at the University of Michigan founded the Michigan Socialist House, located at 335 East Ann Street, in 1932. In return for four to five hours of work and two dollars each week, each of the 18 founding members received room, board, barber, canning, and laundry service. The success of the Michigan Socialist House fueled other cooperative endeavors by the Socialist Club, the most notable being the Michigan Cooperative Boarding House, later to be renamed the Michigan Wolverine Eating Co-op. The Michigan Wolverine Eating Co-op would later play a vital role in the expansion of the cooperative movement on campus. By serving as a common ground for members of the Socialist Club and the Student Christian Association, which owned the building at the time, the Wolverine Eating Co-op introduced the idea of housing cooperatives to many within the religious community. The second wave of student cooperative houses was formally initiated in 1934 through the efforts of the Reverend and Mrs. H. L. Pickerill. The Pickerills welcomed students to live in their house in exchange for performing household chores. By 1936 there were a total of eight students living in the Pickerills' attic who, with the help of a $700 loan from the Reverend, rented a house on Thompson Street naming it the Student Cooperative House and, later, Rochdale House. Because the women who often visited the Rochdale Co-op were in a similar economic position to their male counterparts and the University did not allow for males and females to cohabitate, they began to look for a house of their own. A house at 517 East Ann Street was rented and ran smoothly as the Girls' Cooperative House until 1939 when it was forced to move to 1511 Washtenaw Street, adopting the new name, the Alice Freeman Palmer House, named after prominent women's educational rights activist Alice Freeman Palmer. In 1937, adhering to the Rochdale Principles of cooperation among cooperatives and continuing education, the four existing student cooperatives, the Michigan Socialist House, the Michigan Wolverine Eating Co-op, the Rochdale cooperative House and the yet to be renamed Girls' Cooperative House joined together to form the Campus Cooperative Council. This organization later became known as the Inter-Cooperative Council and, in 1939, submitted a draft of its first constitution to be adopted and ratified by each of the cooperatives on campus. The increased economy, efficiency, and publicity gained through the establishment of the Inter-Cooperative Council facilitated the establishment of many more student cooperatives on Campus. This expansion reached its peak prior to the outbreak of World War II when the ICC consisted of 12 independent rooming and boarding houses. All of the organization's houses were rented until 1943 when Stevens House was purchased, named after Albert K. Stevens, an early supporter of the ICC. The ICC hired its first paid executive director, Luther H. Buchele, in 1951, although some students felt having paid leadership was at odds with cooperative values. Under his leadership, the Inter- Cooperative Council began a steady period of expansion from 1953 to 1978, during which several more houses were purchased and the North Campus Co-ops were constructed. Governance In accordance with the second Rochdale principle, democratic member control, ultimate authority in the organization lies with the Board of Directors. The ICC Board meets on Sundays, usually twice a month during the academic year (September to April) and one a month during the summer (May to August). =Board of Directors= The Board of Directors includes one voting representative from each house (including Escher), the chairpersons of standing committees (non-voting), and the General Manager (non-voting). =Committees= Each board member must serve on a committee. The committees are: *Diversity Committee (DivCom) *Operations Management Committee (OpsCom) *Marketing and Recruitment Committee (MarCo) *Education Committee (EdCom) *Finance Committee (FinCom) *Facilities Management Committee (FamCom) The chairs of each committee, the ICC president, and the General Manager sit on another committee that helps to coordinate the efforts of all the other committees and the board of directors. This committee is known as the Coordinating Committee (CoCo). Houses The ICC currently owns 19 houses around the Central and North Campuses of the University of Michigan. The houses are primarily named after past co-opers and are often known locally by the honoree's last name (e.g. Karl D. Gregory House goes by simply 'Gregory'). Gregory House, an ICC affiliated cooperative house =Central Campus= Ella Baker Cooperative House Ella Baker Graduate Co-operative, known previously under several names including the James R. Jones House, Joint House, and Tri-House (in conjunction with A.K. Stevens) was originally opened as two separate houses; Mark VIII, purchased in 1961, and Pickerell, purchased in 1965. The two houses were connected via the addition of a large central room and functioned as a single co-op. After being remodeled in 2007, the co-op adopted its current name and offered housing tailored for graduate students instead of operating primarily for undergraduates. It is located at 917-923 S. Forest Ave. Black Elk Cooperative House Black Elk Cooperative House was founded in 1986, and is located at 902 Baldwin Avenue. Eugene V. Debs Cooperative House Debs Cooperative House Eugene V. Debs Cooperative House was founded in 1967, and is located at 909 E. University Avenue. Debs Cooperative houses 23 residents, and members cook vegetarian and vegan meals. Karl D. Gregory Cooperative House Karl D. Gregory Cooperative House at 1617 Washtenaw was originally built in 1909 for the Tau Gamma Nu fraternity and was purchased by the ICC in 1995. Gregory House is the only house in the organization that is expressly substance free. No tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs are allowed on the property. As of June 2008, Gregory House has a maximum capacity of 29 members (by way of 13 single and 8 double capacity rooms) as of June 2008. Karl D. Gregory is an alumnus of Nakamura House. Gregory has been a long time activist of civil and human rights. After being successful under appointments by Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Ford, Carter, and Reagan, he generously donated $20,000 to the ICC. This was used to acquire the Karl D. Gregory Cooperative House, named in his honor. Coretta Scott King Cooperative House *Coretta Scott King Cooperative House is located at 803 East Kingsley Street. Compared to other ICC co-ops, King functions closer to an apartment complex with six separate units, having less common shared space. Muriel Lester Cooperative House Muriel Lester Cooperative House was founded in 1940 as an all-women's cooperative house; today it is located at 900 Oakland Street and is, like all ICC co-ops, inclusive of all genders. It houses 15 residents, and cooks vegetarian and vegan food. The November 27th, 1943 Thanksgiving issue of the Saturday Evening Post featured Lester Cooperative House in an article about student cooperative movements in America.Michigan Alumnus, Vol. 50: https://books.google.com/books?id=gPvhAAAAMAAJ&pg;=PA193&lpg;=PA193&dq;=Muriel%20Lester#v=onepage&q;=Muriel%20Lester&f;=false Benjamin Linder Cooperative House Benjamin Linder Cooperative House houses 15 people during the spring/summer terms, and 20 people during the school year. It is located at 711 Catherine St. and is known for its dinners. There is always a vegetarian option. Luther Buchele Cooperative House Luther Buchele Cooperative House, known as 'Luther House' or 'Luther Cooperative', is made up of two houses located at 1510 and 1520 Hill Street. The buildings were purchased by the Inter-Cooperative Council in 1986; prior to that the buildings were home to John Sinclair, the MC5 and the White Panther Party.http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/freeingjohnsinclair/essays/evolution_of_a_commune Located behind the two residential houses is the ICC's Moses Coady-Paulo Friere Cooperative Education Center, at which various educational and board meetings are held. Luther Cooperative is one of the larger cooperatives in the ICC, capable of housing up to 49 members split between the two homes. Michigan Cooperative House Michigan Cooperative House Michigan Cooperative House is the oldest cooperative house in the ICC, founded in 1932 as the Michigan Socialist House. It is located at 315 N. State Street. Minnie's Cooperative House Minnie's Cooperative House was founded in 1970, and is located at 307 N. State Street. It neighbors Michigan Cooperative House, and as such the two share meals and many aspects of their culture. John Nakamura Cooperative House *John Nakamura Harold Osterweil Cooperative House Osterweil House Harold Osterweil Cooperative House is a student housing cooperative located on East Jefferson Street in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Osterweil is the third oldest co-operative and is one of the smallest in the Inter-Cooperative Council. The cooperative is named after Economics professor Harold Osterweil.The Michigan Independent Its first residents were men during the summer of 1946, but in the fall of 1946 Osterweil became a women's house and in 1970 became co-ed. By the time of its purchase, all new student housing had to be approved by the University because students were legally considered minors at that time. Because the ICC moved so fast in its expansion, the University was not asked for approval until after the house was already purchased. The first house that the University granted approval for retroactively is most likely Osterweil.

When the American Civil War occurred, Dacotah assumed the role of a gunboat in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America. When the war was over, Dacotah — who was named for the American Dakota tribe — resumed her role protecting American interests worldwide by showing her presence in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Launched at Norfolk, Virginia, in 1859 Dacotah was launched on 23 March 1859 by Norfolk Navy Yard and commissioned on 1 May 1860, Commander W. Radford in command. Pre-Civil War service Sailing from Norfolk, Virginia on 30 June 1860, Dacotah rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and arrived at Hong Kong on 8 January 1861 to join the East Indian Squadron. She cruised off China until returning to Hong Kong on 14 June. On 6 August, she sailed for home and arrived at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands on 21 November for two weeks of patrolling before arriving at New York City on 20 December. Civil War service =Virginia operations= Out of commission from 31 December 1861-25 February 1862, Dacotah sailed on 9 March to join the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. She served in the waters around Hampton Roads, Virginia from 13 March-14 September except for a cruise to New Orleans, Louisiana in May–June to carry messages to Flag Officer David Farragut. From 19 July, she was assigned to the James River Flotilla. She had several skirmishes with the Confederates including those in which a company of her sailors and marines, destroyed a Confederate battery of 11 guns at Harden's Bluff, Virginia on 2 July, and one of 15 guns at Day's Point, Virginia the next day. =Searching for CSS Alabama= Ordered to Nassau, Bahamas on 4 September to search for the Confederate privateers Alabama and Florida, she patrolled off the Bahamas until 1 November, when she was sent to search further northward to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. She joined the blockading forces off Wilmington, North Carolina on 8 December and served there until 11 June 1863, when she stood out for Baltimore, Maryland and repairs to her boilers. Returning to the blockade on 15 September she was ordered into quarantine at New York City the next month when several cases of smallpox were discovered on board. During a repair period at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, she participated in the search for the captured steamer-turned-raider Chesapeake from 13–23 December. = Assigned to the North Atlantic blockade= Dacotah departed Portsmouth on 28 January 1864 to rejoin the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Beaufort, North Carolina, serving there until 2 August, when she sailed for Boston Navy Yard and overhaul. Out of commission from 19 August 1864-29 May 1865, she cruised in the West Indies from 13 June until her arrival at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 31 August. Post-Civil War service Dacotah put to sea from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 27 January 1866 for a voyage to the Pacific, calling at Funchal, Madeira, Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, and, after passing through the Straits of Magellan, at Valparaíso. Following duty off the coasts of South and Central America, Mexico, and California until 26 July 1869, Dacotah remained in an inactive status until sold at Mare Island Navy Yard on 30 May 1873.

Life He was born on 19 April 1785 in Scotland near Aberchalder and came to Canada when he was seven years old. There he studied to become a lawyer and was called to the bar at the age of 23, opening his own law office. An interest in politics earned him a seat on the legislature and an appointment as attorney-general. He also became a lieutenant colonel in the York MilitiaMalcomson p.55 and, at the outbreak of the War of 1812, became secretary and provincial aide-de-camp to General Isaac Brock. On 13 October 1812, during the Battle of Queenston Heights, Brock was struck and killed by an American musket ball. Despite being a lawyer by trade with little military experience, Lieutenant-Colonel Macdonell, along with Captain John Williams of the 49th Foot,Malcomson p.154 led a second attempt to retake the Redan, one that was very nearly successful. With Williams' men of the 49th starting from brush to the right of the line near the escarpment and Macdonell's anchoring the left, the force of between 70 and 80 men (more than half of whom were militia) advanced toward the Redan Battery. The U.S. forces under the command of Captain John E. Wool had been reinforced by more troops who had just made their way up the path to the top of the Heights, and Macdonell faced some four hundred troops. Despite the disadvantage in numbers as well as attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force to the edge of the gorge on which the Redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount, causing it to rear and twist around. Another shot hit Macdonnell in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse.Malcomson p.155 He was removed from the battlefield but succumbed to his injuries early the next day. On 16 October 1812 Lieut. Col. Macdonell, along with General Brock, was buried in the bastion at the northeast corner of Fort George. In 1824, both bodies were moved to Queenston Heights to be interred in the first Brock's Monument. It is documented that when moving the remains someone noted that while Lieut. Col. Macdonell was in a later state of decomposition, General Brock's remains were near perfect. In 1840, Irish-Canadian Benjamin Lett was suspected of (but never charged with) setting an explosive charge that heavily damaged the first monument. When a new monument was built, there was no mention of Macdonell on it. But inside the monument there is a brass plaque which reads: > Beneath are deposited the mortal remains of Lieut. Colonel John Macdonell > P.A. D.C. and Aide-de-camp to the lamented Major General Sir Isaac Brock. > K.B. Who fell mortally wounded at the Battle of Queenston on 13 October 1812 > and died on the following day. His remains were removed and reinterred with > due solemnity, on 13 October 1853. Macdonell monument at the Redan Battery At the Redan Battery, a plaque mounted on a trio of large stones also serves as a monument to Macdonell. The plaque reads: > Site of Redan Battery  Near this spot Lieut-Col. John Macdonell Attorney > General of Upper Canada was mortally wounded 13 October 1812. In his 1984 album From Fresh Water, the late Canadian folk singer Stan Rogers immortalised Macdonell in the song Macdonnell on the Heights.

Located in the Western Galilee about east of the Mediterranean seaside town of Nahariya, it falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Asher Regional Council. In it had a population of . The kibbutz is located on lands which used to belong to the depopulated Palestinian villages of Al-Kabri and al-Nahr. History =Prehistory= The area of Kabri springs was first settled 16,000 years ago , during the Neolithic period. Permanent structures appeared around the year 10000 BCE . Archaeological digs uncovered the remains of an ancient city. The city was built around the year 2500 BCE and its territory ranged over , which were surrounded by dirt embankments high and thick, on which were built guard towers. The ancient city that existed 1km to the south-west is known to archaeologists as Tel Kabri, though its Canaanite name is not known. It was a city-state in the heart of which was placed the palace of the ruling monarch. The two-story palace was decorated with colorful frescoes and ornaments in Minoan style. Residents of the city (their number is estimated at 5,000) earned their living through agriculture and international commerce. Leftover bits and pieces of merchandise whose origins lay in Egypt, Turkey and Crete were found in the ruins and in graves during the excavations. The city was connected to a port on the coast, apparently the one under Achziv. The city- state was completely abandoned around the year 1600 BCE for unknown reasons. =Ancient history= After a few generations, the Phoenicians established next to the abandoned city a fortress town on , in which were found the weapons and kitchen equipment of Greek mercenaries, as well as an extremely rare bowl, in which was prepared the color purple, the Phoenicians' main export. That settlement survived from the 9th century BCE until the end of 7th century, at which time it was destroyed by the Babylonians. =Modern history= The Palestinian village of al-Kabri existed at the site from the post-Crusader period until 1949. In 1948 the Yehiam convoy was ambushed while passing the village. According to Israeli historian Benny Morris, a subsequent Haganah attack led to the flight of most of the villagers, while others were killed in what became known as the al-Kabri incident. The Haganah planned to \\"destroy and burn\\" Al-Kabri and neighboring villages in the western Galilee. Later, Al-Kabri was among villages razed to ensure that its residents \\"could and would never return.\\"Morris, Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–49, 1st. ed, p. 125 In 1949 a new kibbutz was founded on the site of the village by displaced members of kibbutz Beit HaArava and young refugees from the Youth Aliyah.Ori Reisman, Information Center for Israeli Art Beit HaArava was located along the Jordan River near Jericho, and had been evacuated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, was subsequently destroyed by the invading Jordanian forces. Beit HaArava's children and noncombatant women members had been evacuated to kibbutz Shefayim during the War of Independence. The members subsequently divided in 1949 into two groups. One became the founding members of Kabri and the other joined Gesher HaZiv, another kibbutz in the Western Galilee. Geography The kibbutz is situated near four natural springs, which provide water to it and the neighboring moshavim of Ben Ami and Nativ HaShayara. There are also two archeological sites within its boundaries: Tel Kabri and a Byzantine well and mosaic floor. It commands a view of the Mediterranean and is within sight of the Lebanese border. Economy The kibbutz supports itself from a successful banana plantation and from the avocado groves where most of the archaeological excavation has taken place by the ongoing archaeological expedition at Tel Kabri. The kibbutz also runs a metal and wax casting factory (Cabiran), a plastics factory (Ri'on), a restaurant, regional auditorium, and a vacation village. Educational institutions Two schools are located on the kibbutz grounds—the \\"Maayanot\\" regional elementary school and the \\"Manor-Kabri\\" regional high school—in which children and youth of the kibbutz and nearby settlements receive their education. The high school particularly emphasizes education in the arts, offering majors (Grades 10–12) in music, visual arts, drama, and cinema/video. Owing to the educational programs offered in the performing arts along with academic subjects from the state curriculum, it attracts pupils from all over the area.

Statement The original problem was stated as follows (English translation from 1902): :Proof of the existence of linear differential equations having a prescribed monodromic group :In the theory of linear differential equations with one independent variable z, I wish to indicate an important problem one which very likely Riemann himself may have had in mind. This problem is as follows: To show that there always exists a linear differential equation of the Fuchsian class, with given singular points and monodromic group. The problem requires the production of n functions of the variable z, regular throughout the complex z-plane except at the given singular points; at these points the functions may become infinite of only finite order, and when z describes circuits about these points the functions shall undergo the prescribed linear substitutions. The existence of such differential equations has been shown to be probable by counting the constants, but the rigorous proof has been obtained up to this time only in the particular case where the fundamental equations of the given substitutions have roots all of absolute magnitude unity. has given this proof, based upon Poincaré's theory of the Fuchsian zeta-functions. The theory of linear differential equations would evidently have a more finished appearance if the problem here sketched could be disposed of by some perfectly general method. Definitions In fact it is more appropriate to speak not about differential equations but about linear systems of differential equations: in order to realise any monodromy by a differential equation one has to admit, in general, the presence of additional apparent singularities, i.e. singularities with trivial local monodromy. In more modern language, the (systems of) differential equations in question are those defined in the complex plane, less a few points, and with a regular singularity at those. A more strict version of the problem requires these singularities to be Fuchsian, i.e. poles of first order (logarithmic poles). A monodromy group is prescribed, by means of a finite-dimensional complex representation of the fundamental group of the complement in the Riemann sphere of those points, plus the point at infinity, up to equivalence. The fundamental group is actually a free group, on 'circuits' going once round each missing point, starting and ending at a given base point. The question is whether the mapping from these Fuchsian equations to classes of representations is surjective. History This problem is more commonly called the Riemann–Hilbert problem. There is now a modern (D-module and derived category) version, the 'Riemann–Hilbert correspondence' in all dimensions. The history of proofs involving a single complex variable is complicated. Josip Plemelj published a solution in 1908. This work was for a long time accepted as a definitive solution; there was work of G. D. Birkhoff in 1913 also, but the whole area, including work of Ludwig Schlesinger on isomonodromic deformations that would much later be revived in connection with soliton theory, went out of fashion. wrote a monograph summing up his work. A few years later the Soviet mathematician Yuliy S. Il'yashenko and others started raising doubts about Plemelj's work. In fact, Plemelj correctly proves that any monodromy group can be realised by a regular linear system which is Fuchsian at all but one of the singular points. Plemelj's claim that the system can be made Fuchsian at the last point as well is wrong. (Il'yashenko has shown that if one of the monodromy operators is diagonalizable, then Plemelj's claim is true.) Indeed found a counterexample to Plemelj's statement. This is commonly viewed as providing a counterexample to the precise question Hilbert had in mind; Bolibrukh showed that for a given pole configuration certain monodromy groups can be realised by regular, but not by Fuchsian systems. (In 1990 he published the thorough study of the case of regular systems of size 3 exhibiting all situations when such counterexamples exists. In 1978 Dekkers had shown that for systems of size 2 Plemelj's claim is true. and independently showed that for any size, an irreducible monodromy group can be realised by a Fuchsian system. The codimension of the variety of monodromy groups of regular systems of size n with p+1 poles which cannot be realised by Fuchsian systems equals 2(n-1)p ().) Parallel to this the Grothendieck school of algebraic geometry had become interested in questions of 'integrable connections on algebraic varieties', generalising the theory of linear differential equations on Riemann surfaces. Pierre Deligne proved a precise Riemann–Hilbert correspondence in this general context (a major point being to say what 'Fuchsian' means). With work by Helmut Röhrl, the case in one complex dimension was again covered.

In 2005, there were approximately 2,761 Tiriyó in the three countries. They live in several major villages and a number of minor villages in the border zone between Brazil and Suriname. They speak the Tiriyó language, a member of the Cariban language family and refer to themselves as tarëno, etymologically 'people from here' or 'local people'. About 30% are Christians, while 70% follow indigenous religions.Joshua Project http://www.joshuaproject.net/people- profile.php?peo3=15581&rog3;=NS  History  Photo taken during the 1904 Tapanahony Expedition The modern Tiriyó are formed from various different indigenous communities; some of these, such as the Aramixó, are mentioned in European writings as early as 1609-1610. Many of the now-Tiriyó groups lived between Brazil and French Guiana until they were driven out by the Oyampi, a Tupi-Guaranian group allied with the Portuguese. Together, the Portuguese and Oyampi drove these groups westward, and they mingled with the groups that were in the area to form the modern Tiriyó group. As such, the Tiriyó established contact relatively early with runaway slave groups that settled in the area around the end of the 18th century. They maintained regular commercial relations with one group, the Ndyuka, and for many years they were the only contact the Tiriyó had with foreign populations. The first recorded contact between the Tiriyó and a European took place in 1843 between a ‘Drio’ village and Robert Schomburgk; this and the meeting between French explorer Jules Crevaux and a few ‘Trio’ were the only two points of contact between Tiriyó and Europeans in the 19th century. The expeditions in the interior of Suriname in the early 20th century did observe Tiriyós, however they tended to flee when approached, and no useful information could be gathered. In 1907, De Goeje managed to make contact in the Tumuk Humak expedition resulting in the first dictionary of the Tiriyó language. Subsequent contact between Europeans and Tiriyó in the first half of the twentieth century produced ethnographic and linguistic studies of the region and Tiriyó subgroups in particular. After the ‘exploratory phase’ of contact came the ‘missionary phase,’ wherein newly built airstrips facilitated contact between missionaries and the Tiriyó. These missions tried to concentrate the Tiriyó population in larger villages to more easily convert them to Christianity, and over time, other Indigenous groups such as the Akuriyó joined them here. Until 1957, a village could accommodate up to 50 people. The average life span of a village used to be three to six years, and the death of a captain or chief was often a reason for abandonment as well. The newly acquired agricultural techniques allowed for a bigger population. In 1967, the village of Alalapadu passed the 500 mark, and the soils surrounding the village started to become depleted. The town was abandoned, but not completely as some Tiriyó settled in the vicinity of the old village. The same thing happened with Kwamalasamutu, and in 1997 granman Asongo decided, that part of the population should spread out, also as a defence against encroachment by gold miners and tourist lodges. Government The Tiriyó have a high degree of independence, because their settlements are difficult to access. However, they are interested in reinforcing relationships with the foreign world. Traditionally there was no clear hierarchy or a granman (paramount chief). In 1997, Asongo Alalaparu was appointed granman by the Surinamese President, and captains were appointed to manage the village. In 2011, a District Commissioner had been appointed to represent the central government in the Coeroeni resort. As of 2019, the District Commission is Trees Cirino. The village of Kasuela is located in the disputed Tigri Area which is claimed by both Guyana and Suriname. The village is headed by Captain Kenke Jaimo who is recognized by both governments. The Tiriyó in Brazil live in the Tumucumaque Indigenous Park which has been recognized since 1997. In 2004, Apitikatxi, the association of Tiriyó, Kaxuyana and Txikuyana indigenous peoples was founded to improve rights of indigenous peoples. The organisation is headed by Demetrio Amisipa Tiriyó. A problem which remains is that there are two systems: a traditional tribal government and a national government which are often not compatible. The Tiriyó in the larger villages are influenced by schooling, modern day facilities, and telecommunications. The traditional culture is disappearing and young people are beginning to move to the city. Indigenous rights A concern is the fundamental rights, because the Tiriyó are spread over three countries, and unlike the Maroons, there are no significant treaties. Mining concessions are often made with the Government without consultation of the native population. Even though the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights ruled in 2007 that all indigenous and tribal peoples have the right to manage, distribute, and effectively control their territory,, Article 41 of the Constitution of Suriname states: \\"Natural resources and resources are the property of the nation and should be mobilized for economic, social and cultural development. The nation has the inalienable right to take full ownership of its natural resources in order to apply them for the economic, social and cultural development of Suriname.\\" Also in Brazil, indigenous peoples are often viewed as opponents to economic growth and barriers to development.

Life and career =Early career - Zero Woman= Iijima began her entertainment career in 1988 on the late night Japanese TV show 11 PM, followed by a number of appearances in commercials and as a Race Queen. An early cinema role was the December 1990 straight-to-video V-cinema drama which also starred Risa Tachibana and Mari Ayukawa. The next year, she was featured in the comedy which was released to theaters by the Toei Company in December 1991. Over the next four years, Iijima starred in more than a dozen V-cinema productions as well as posing for gravure (non- nude) photobooks and performing in gravure videos. In January 1995, Iijima was cast as the lead in the action feature film , a revival of the Zero Woman character from Miki Sugimoto's 1974 film. Despite the title of this film, the Zero Woman franchise continued with a number of sequels. The film was released in an English-language version on VHS and DVD in May 2002 as Zero Woman: Final Mission. =Early TV work= After Zero Woman, Iijima worked largely in the domain of Japanese TV dramas (J-dorama) including the Fuji Television suspense drama starring Atsuko Asano which aired from July to September 1995 and the 1998 comedy also on Fuji TV, , co-starring Masahiko Nishimura, which had a setting in New York City.Clements p. 281-282 In August 1999, Iijima starred in the Fuji TV produced theatrical film .

Various complications ensue including a romance with her new boss played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi. Iijima returned to television in 2000 with the Fuji TV series which ran in twelve episode from July to September 2000. Her role was once again the poor little rich girl (as in the film Messengers) but this time she has to resurrect a fading bus company in Tokyo with Teruyoshi Uchimura as the love interest.Clements p. 33-34 In the 2001 Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) drama , Iijima is cast against type as a breadwinner housewife with a sullen stay-at- home husband.Clements p. 66 For her 2002 TV series , Iijima returned to Fuji TV and the romantic comedy genre as the vice president of a company in the bridal industry.Clements p. 347 In late 2002 she appeared as the oldest of four daughters of a widowed father (played by Masakazu Tamura) in the TBS domestic drama .Clements p. 159-160 Iijima wed musician Nobuteru Maeda in September 1997 but their marriage ended in divorce in March 2001. =Later TV work= Iijima continued acting in Japanese TV serials including the 2003 Fuji TV romance and the 2005 TBS romantic drama . but she also starred in a serious drama about World War II.

For the 2008 TV series , broadcast March to September 2008, Iijima, no longer the ingenue, plays the mother of the twenty-year-old heroine Hitomi (Eikura Nana). The romantic comedy has a 23-year-old \\"salaryman\\" (Hayato Ichihara) falling in love with Iijima's character, an \\"around 40 year old\\" beautician.

Masters could free slaves, and in many cases such freedmen went on to rise to positions of power. This would include those children born into slavery but who were actually the children of the master of the house. Their father would ensure that his children were not condemned to a life of slavery. The institution of slavery condemned a majority of slaves to agricultural and industrial labor and they lived hard lives. In many of these cultures slaves formed a very large part of the economy, and in particular the Roman Empire and some of the Greek poleis built a large part of their wealth on slaves acquired through conquest. Ancient Near East The Sumerian king Code of Ur-Nammu includes laws relating to slaves, written circa 2100 – 2050 BCE; it is the oldest known tablet containing a law code surviving today. The Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, dating to c. 1700 BCE, also makes distinctions between the freeborn, freed and slave. C. 1480 BC, fugitive slave treaty between Idrimi of Alakakh (now Tell Atchana) and Pillia of Kizzuwatna (now Cilicia). Ref:. Hittite texts from Anatolia include laws regulating the institution of slavery. Of particular interest is a law stipulating that reward for the capture of an escaped slave would be higher if the slave had already succeeded in crossing the Halys River and getting farther away from the center of Hittite civilization — from which it can be concluded that at least some of the slaves kept by the Hittites possessed a realistic chance of escaping and regaining their freedom, possibly by finding refuge with other kingdoms or ethnic groups. Ancient Egypt In Ancient Egypt, slaves were mainly obtained through prisoners of war. Other ways people could become slaves was by inheriting the status from their parents. One could also become a slave on account of his inability to pay his debts. Slavery was the direct result of poverty. People also sold themselves into slavery because they were poor peasants and needed food and shelter. The lives of slaves were normally better than that of peasants. Slaves only attempted escape when their treatment was unusually harsh. For many, being a slave in Egypt made them better off than a freeman elsewhere. Young slaves could not be put to hard work, and had to be brought up by the mistress of the household. Not all slaves went to houses. Some also sold themselves to temples, or were assigned to temples by the king. Slave trading was not very popular until later in Ancient Egypt. Afterwards, slave trades sprang up all over Egypt. However, there was barely any worldwide trade. Rather, the individual dealers seem to have approached their customers personally. Only slaves with special traits were traded worldwide. Prices of slaves changed with time. Slaves with a special skill were more valuable than those without one. Slaves had plenty of jobs that they could be assigned to. Some had domestic jobs, like taking care of children, cooking, brewing, or cleaning. Some were gardeners or field hands in stables. They could be craftsmen or even get a higher status. For example, if they could write, they could become a manager of the master's estate. Captive slaves were mostly assigned to the temples or a king, and they had to do manual labor. The worst thing that could happen to a slave was being assigned to the quarries and mines. Private ownership of slaves, captured in war and given by the king to their captor, certainly occurred at the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty (1550–1295 BCE). Sales of slaves occurred in the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (732–656 BCE), and contracts of servitude survive from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (c. 672 – 525 BCE) and from the reign of Darius: apparently such a contract then required the consent of the slave. In the Bible The Bible contains several references to slavery, which was a common practice in antiquity. The Bible stipulates the treatment of slaves, especially in the Old Testament.Deuteronomy 15:12-18 There are also references to slavery in the New Testament. Male Israelite slaves were to be offered release after six to seven years of service, with some conditions.Exodus 21:2-6Deuteronomy 15:12-15Jeremiah 34:14 Foreign slaves and their posterity became the perpetual property of the owner's family,Leviticus 25:44-47 except in the case of certain injuries.Exodus 21:26-27 The Bible was cited as justification for slavery by defenders.Stringfellow, A Scriptural defense of slavery, 1856Raymund Harris, Scriptural researches on the licitness of the slave, (Liverpool: H. Hodgson, 1788) Abolitionists have also used text from the New Testament and the Exodus story in the Old Testament to argue for the manumission of slaves. Ancient Greece The study of slavery in Ancient Greece remains a complex subject, in part because of the many different levels of servility, from traditional chattel slave through various forms of serfdom, such as Helots, Penestai, and several other classes of non-citizen. Most philosophers of classical antiquity defended slavery as a natural and necessary institution. Aristotle believed that the practice of any manual or banausic job should disqualify the practitioner from citizenship. Quoting Euripides, Aristotle declared all non-Greeks slaves by birth, fit for nothing but obedience. By the late 4th century BCE passages start to appear from other Greeks, especially in Athens, which opposed slavery and suggested that every person living in a city-state had the right to freedom subject to no one, except those laws decided using majoritarianism. Alcidamas, for example, said: \\"God has set everyone free. No one is made a slave by nature.\\" Furthermore, a fragment of a poem of Philemon also shows that he opposed slavery. Corinthian black-figure terra-cotta votive tablet of slaves working in a mine, dated to the late seventh century BC Greece in pre-Roman times consisted of many independent city-states, each with its own laws. All of them permitted slavery, but the rules differed greatly from region to region. Greek slaves had some opportunities for emancipation, though all of these came at some cost to their masters. The law protected slaves, and though a slave's master had the right to beat him at will, a number of moral and cultural limitations existed on excessive use of force by masters. In Ancient Athens, about 30% of the population were slaves. The system in Athens encouraged slaves to save up to purchase their freedom, and records survive of slaves operating businesses by themselves, making only a fixed tax-payment to their masters. Athens also had a law forbidding the striking of slaves—if a person struck an apparent slave in Athens, that person might find himself hitting a fellow-citizen, because many citizens dressed no better. It startled other Greeks that Athenians tolerated back-chat from slaves (Old Oligarch, Constitution of the Athenians). Pausanias (writing nearly seven centuries after the event) states that Athenian slaves fought together with Athenian freemen in the Battle of Marathon, and the monuments memorialize them. Spartan serfs, Helots, could win freedom through bravery in battle. Plutarch mentions that during the Battle of Salamis Athenians did their best to save their \\"women, children and slaves\\". On the other hand, much of the wealth of Athens came from its silver mines at Laurion, where slaves, working in extremely poor conditions, produced the greatest part of the silver (although recent excavations seem to suggest the presence of free workers at Laurion). During the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, twenty thousand Athenian slaves, including both mine- workers and artisans, escaped to the Spartans when their army camped at Decelea in 413 BC. A drunk man vomiting, while a young slave is holding his forehead. Brygos Painter, 500-470 BC Other than flight, resistance on the part of slaves occurred only rarely. GEM de Ste. Croix gives two reasons: # slaves came from various regions and spoke various languages # a slave-holder could rely on the support of fellow slave-holders if his slaves offered resistance. Athens had various categories of slave, such as: * House-slaves, living in their master's home and working at home, on the land or in a shop. * Freelance slaves, who didn't live with their master but worked in their master's shop or fields and paid him taxes from money they got from their own properties (insofar as society allowed slaves to own property). * Public slaves, who worked as police-officers, ushers, secretaries, street-sweepers, etc. * War- captives (andrapoda) who served primarily in unskilled tasks at which they could be chained: for example, rowers in commercial ships, or miners. In some areas of Greece there existed a class of unfree laborers tied to the land and called penestae in Thessaly and helots in Sparta. Penestae and helots did not rate as chattel slaves; one could not freely buy and sell them. The comedies of Menander show how the Athenians preferred to view a house-slave: as an enterprising and unscrupulous rascal, who must use his wits to profit from his master, rescue him from his troubles, or gain him the girl of his dreams. These plots were adapted by the Roman playwrights Plautus and Terence, and in the modern era influenced the character Jeeves and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Ancient Rome Rome differed from Greek city-states in allowing freed slaves to become Roman citizens. After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a citizen enjoyed not only passive freedom from ownership, but active political freedom (libertas), including the right to vote, though he could not run for public office.Fergus Millar, The Crowd in Rome in the Late Republic (University of Michigan, 1998, 2002), pp. 23, 209. During the Republic, Roman military expansion was a major source of slaves. Besides manual labor, slaves performed many domestic services, and might be employed at highly skilled jobs and professions. Teachers, accountants, and physicians were often slaves. Greek slaves in particular might be highly educated. Unskilled slaves, or those condemned to slavery as punishment, worked on farms, in mines, and at mills. Ancient Persia In remarkable contrast to the other major ancient cultures of the region, the Achaemenid Persians, during the time of Cyrus the Great, formally banned most slavery of non- combatants within the empire. Indeed, Persepolis, the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Persians, was built with paid labor.

The acronym stands for Comité de Organización Política Electoral Independiente (\\"Independent Political Electoral Organization Committee\\"), but this provisional full name has fallen out of use. The party was influential during the twentieth century as a signatory of the Puntofijo Pact and influenced many politicians throughout Latin America at its peak.  History  = 20th century = COPEI was founded on 13 January 1946 by Rafael Caldera. COPEI, Democratic Action (AD) and Democratic Republican Union (URD) signed the Puntofijo Pact in October 1958, establishing themselves as the dominant political parties in the country. Signatories and supporters of the Pact stated that it was created to preserve democracy and to share governorship between parties. Critics believed that the Pact allowed signing parties to limit control over Venezuela's government to themselves. URD would later leave the pact in 1962 following Cuba's removal from the Organization of American States, leaving governing of Venezuela to COPEI and AD. The Puntofijo system ultimately created a network of patronage for both parties. Caldera was elected president in December 1968 and for the first time in Venezuela's history, opposition parties transferred power peacefully. COPEI was also the first Venezuelan political party to assume power peacefully on its first attempt. Guillermo Aveledo Coll: Christians in Politics - YouTube The only other COPEI member to become president of Venezuela was Luis Herrera Campins, from 1979 to 1983.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume II, p555 Governing by COPEI and AD would continue through the rest of the century. Dissatisfaction with the established governmental system of patronage increased, culminating in the 1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts led by Hugo Chávez. For the 1993 Venezuelan general election, COPEI passed over choosing Caldera as their candidate. This would prove to be a fatal mistake, as the Puntofijo Pact ended when Caldera won the election through his newly created National Convergence party. Soon after being elected, Caldera freed Chávez,Marcano and Tyszka 2007. pp. 107–08.Jones 2007. pp. 182–86. who became Caldera's successor following the 1998 Venezuelan presidential election. = 21st century = With the election of Chávez, Venezuela entered into a period of a dominant-party system led by his United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). In the 2000 legislative elections COPEI won a meager five of 165 seats in the National Assembly, with the party receiving 5.10% of valid votes. In the 2005 legislative elections COPEI staged an electoral boycott and did not win any seats in the National Assembly. In the 2010 parliamentary election, COPEI was part of the broad oppositional Coalition for Democratic Unity and won eight of the 165 seats. Prior to the 2015 Venezuelan parliamentary election, the pro-government Supreme Tribunal of Justice designated new leaders of COPEI, leading some to state that the party was infiltrated by the PSUV. By 2017, Caracas Chronicles said the party was \\"dying an undignified death\\" as infighting among leaders could not agree on a path for the party.

It was designed by a former worker of the Rembertów Polish Army munition works, Edward Tymoszak (hence the ET abbreviation). It was partially based on his pre-war design of an ET wz. 38 anti-tank grenade. The Filipinka was an offensive impact grenade, cylindrical in shape. In the upper part of the shell a screw for the fuse was located. Coating of the first series (roughly 4,000 produced) was made of Bakelite, which shattered without producing fragments like a metal-bodied grenade. Later the shell was replaced with a metal impress. The filling was composed mostly of home-made explosives, either cheddite or ammonal. At times explosives from German air bombs and artillery shells, as well as British plastic explosive delivered through air bridges was used. The grenade was equipped with a contact fuze which functioned on impact with the target. The coating was painted with various colours to allow for easier usage in resistance service and easier hiding. After 1941 all grenades were marked with an inscription in Russian (Desantnaya Udarnaya Granata 41 - Paratroopers' Impact Grenade Mark 41) in order to conceal the real origin of the weapon and ensure the safety of the production facilities. Throughout the war approximately 240,000 grenades of this type were produced. Many of them were used in various battles of the Operation Tempest, including the Warsaw Uprising.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1927 to 1958, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of John Bracken, Stuart Garson and Douglas Campbell. His father, Thomas Lewis Morton, was a member of the assembly from 1888 to 1903. Morton was educated at St. John's College in Winnipeg, and was prominent in athletics, notably football, hockey and curling. He was a councillor in the municipality of Westbourne from 1913 to 1917, and was its reeve from 1917 to 1927. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1927 provincial election as a Progressive, in the rural constituency of Gladstone. He was returned as a Liberal-Progressive in the 1932 election, after the two parties formed an alliance. Re-elected again in the 1936 election, Morton was promoted to cabinet on November 22, 1939, as Municipal Commissioner in John Bracken's government. On February 14, 1944, he was given additional cabinet responsibilities as Minister under the Manitoba Telephone Act. When Douglas Campbell became Premier of Manitoba on December 14, 1948, he relieved Morton of the Municipal Affairs portfolio, but kept him as minister under the Manitoba Telephone Act, Minister under the Manitoba Power Commission Act, and Minister of Public Utilities under the Municipal and Public Utility Board Act. His title was later simplified to Minister of Public Works and Minister of Public Utilities. In these portfolios, Morton continued Campbell's work in providing electricity to the rural areas of the province. In 1952, Morton approved a motion which gave aboriginal Canadians in Manitoba the right to vote in provincial elections. Morton holds the unique distinction of having been returned without opposition in four consecutive elections: 1941, 1945, 1949 and 1953. Morton stepped down from his ministerial portfolios on January 28, 1955, and served as a minister without portfolio until his death in Winnipeg in early 1958. Manitoba Cooperative Commonwealth Federation leader Lloyd Stinson described Morton as the \\"strong silent\\" man of Campbell's administration. He was a loyal supporter of Campbell, and often used his extensive ties to municipal politicians for the government's benefit. In 1907, he married Mary Mathilda Manwaring. Morton's son, William Lewis Morton, was a prominent Canadian historian. There is currently a William Morton Collegiate in Gladstone, Manitoba.

Brewmaster Vern Lambourne stayed with the company until 2015; he was replaced by Kevin Emms. In spite of the acquisition by Molson Coors, the company was able to retain the original brewery operating on Granville Island, in a top tourist zone. This facility develops and produces the small-batch beers. The primary brewing is done at Molson's Burrard Street plant. In April 2019, Granville Island Brewing underwent a brand update with an updated logo and beer lineup. The brewery introduced three new offerings and retired the Sunshine Coast Hefeweizen, Infamous IPA, Maple Shack Cream Ale, Cypress Honey Lager, Island Lager, and Lions Summer Ale.

Early life Born in Liverpool, England to a Jamaican mother and American father stationed with the US Air Force in the UK, his family moved to the United States when he was a toddler, and proceeded to move around until finally settling in Washington, D.C. With his early love of music, he was a gifted athlete from an early age, competing in swimming and pole-vaulting. He and his younger brother Earl both entered the local D.C. music scene as teenagers with their friends and future bandmates Dr. Know (guitarist) and Daryl Jenifer. H.R. was an early nickname that initially stood for \\"hunting rod\\", but which he changed to stand for \\"human rights\\". Musical career H.R. and his bandmates became Rastafari around 1979. This spiritual direction influenced the music of Bad Brains via his vocals, and inspired the creation of his reggae band, Human Rights (or H.R.). Although reggae is the main focus of his solo material, he explores rock and other musical genres. He has had numerous albums released on SST Records. While a Village Voice review of a Bad Brains concert described H.R.'s presence on stage: \\"like James Brown gone berserk, with a hyperkinetic repertoire of spins, dives, back-flips, splits, and skanks\\", in recent years his stage presence has become more subdued, primarily due to his spiritual development from the O.G. Punk/Rasta to more of a Rasta Elder, as well as his occasional playing of rhythm guitar. H.R. has collaborated with the Long Beach Dub Allstars on their song \\"New Sun\\" on the Right Back album, and with P.O.D. on their song \\"Without Jah, Nothin'\\", on the album Satellite. In recent years, H.R.'s Human Rights performances have become markedly more mellow and restrained, focusing primarily on reggae and rasta. This is a stark contrast to his wildly animated, aggressive stage performances of the late 1970s and 1980s. Interviews with H.R. feature prominently in the 2006 documentary American Hardcore, in which he discusses the early days of the hardcore scene in New York City and Washington D.C., and his association with peers like Minor Threat and the Cro-Mags. In particular, he recalls encouraging Ian MacKaye to fully articulate Minor Threat's emerging straight edge philosophy, to give young people a positive direction. As depicted in the 2012 documentary Bad Brains: A Band in D.C., H.R.'s bizarre behavior, such as wearing a motorcycle helmet during a performance and refusing to sing, caused friction with other members of the band. In late 2016, the film Finding Joseph I: The HR From Bad Brains Documentary premiered in Europe and the United States. Directed by James Lathos, the documentary features interviews with H.R., as well as other musicians, peers, and family member, while chronicling his life, struggles, and philosophies, particularly \\"PMA\\" (positive mental attitude). The film's companion book was published by Lesser Gods in January 2017. Personal life H.R. has adult children from previous relationships and has been married to Lori Carnes since 2012. In 2016, H.R.'s wife, Lori, revealed that H.R. suffers from SUNCT syndrome, a rare neurological disorder which causes sporadic, excruciating headaches. He underwent brain surgery in early 2017 to relieve the headaches. He also suffers from schizophrenia.

It is surrounded by the Odem Forest and falls under the jurisdiction of Golan Regional Council. In it had a population of . The international community considers Israeli settlements in the Golan Heights illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Etymology Odem means ruby and signifies the red color. In this case it refers to the color of the rocks of Mount Odem, an extinct volcano. History The Israeli government approved the establishment of the settlement in 1975, and a group of young people occupied an abandoned Syrian military base nearby. Most of these original settlers left, however, because of the frigid temperatures and strong winds. Those that remained were joined in 1981 by a new group, and the current settlement was established. The population was about 150 in 1993, about one- third of them children.

It is near the Portuguese border (District of Portalegre), separated from it by the Sever. History From the 16th century to the 18th Valencia was a celebrated border fortress; it was captured by the Portuguese in 1664 and 1698. =Battle of 1762= The Battle of Valencia de Alcántara took place in 1762 as part of the Spanish invasion of Portugal. Portuguese-British troops under John Burgoyne attacked and captured the town, which was a Spanish supply base, setting back the invasion and contributing to the British victory that year. =Nineteenth century= The beginning of the nineteenth century, traditionally associated with the beginnings of the modern age, is particularly troublesome in the case of Valencia de Alcántara as it was caught up in two important conflicts, including the fleeting conflict known as the War of the Oranges (1801) or the War of Independence. However, due to its location it became is the second most important custom house for direct traffic between the two kingdoms, after Badajoz, and had a flourishing trade in farm produce of all kinds. Features There are Roman remains in the district, and the courtyards and windows of many houses are Moorish in style. Nuestra Señora de Roqueamador, the most important church, dates from the 14th century. The church of Encarnacion, the town hall and a fine convent date from the 16th. Valencia de Alcántara is a very important centre of dolmens in Europe. Famous inhabitants Valencia de Alcántara was the birthplace of Pedro Gómez Labrador, Marquis of Labrador, who represented Spain at the Congress of Vienna (1814–1815).

Biography  Morgan Llwyd was born to a cultured and influential family in the parish of Maentwrog, Gwynedd. His grandfather, Huw Llwyd, was a professional soldier and noted Welsh language poet, and also had a reputation as an astrologer and magician. Morgan Llwyd was educated in Wrexham, where he experienced a religious awakening under the Puritan preacher, Walter Cradock, whom he followed to Llanfaches to be part of a Puritan church. During the English Civil War, he served as a chaplain in Oliver Cromwell's army, and in 1644 he returned to Wales, first as a preacher, and in 1650 as an Approver under the Act for the Propagation of the Gospel in Wales. In 1656 he settled as a minister in Wrexham, where he died in 1659, and is buried in the Dissenters' Burial Ground in Rhosddu. Morgan Llwyd is credited with being the first Nonconformist minister in Wrexham. Ysgol Morgan Llwyd, the Welsh- language high school in Wrexham, is named after him.  Work  Morgan Llwyd was the author of seven prose works in Welsh and English, a considerable body of poetry, and translations of passages from the work of Jakob Bóhme, taken from the English-language translations of John Sparrow. His most significant prose work is Llyfr y Tri Aderyn, or The Book of The Three Birds, comprising a religious and political debate between a Raven, representing the Anglican and Royalist faction under Cromwell's Commonwealth, an Eagle, representing its government, and a Dove, representing the Puritan faction, who convinces the Eagle of the truth of Puritan teaching and the validity of theocratic rule. In addition to this, the Raven and the Dove are compared with the Raven and Dove sent out from Noah's Ark to search for dry land, and history is represented as a hiatus between the divine judgement given in the Genesis flood narrative, and the Last Judgement, which Morgan Llwyd expects very shortly. Morgan Llwyd's three shorter Welsh-language prose works are Llythyr i'r Cymry Cariadus, Gwaedd yng Nghymru yn Wyneb pob Cynwybod, and Cyfarwydd i'r Cymru, in which he stresses the urgent need of his readers for a personal reconciliation with God. Of his three English-language tracts, Lazarus and His Sisters Discoursing of Paradise and Where is Christ? deal with theological matters, while An Honest Discourse Between Three Neighbours explores differing attitudes to Oliver Cromwell's rule.  Critical Response  In an interview with Saunders Lewis, the short-story writer John Gwilym Jones speaks of his 'immense' artistic debt to Llythyr i'r Cymry Cariadus and Llyfr y Tri Aderyn, whose style he studied closely and sought to imitate, while M. Wynn Thomas, in his monograph, Morgan Llwyd, explores the poetic and imaginative richness of his prose as a tool for expressing his intensely mystical religious vision. For Gwynfor Evans, Morgan Llwyd is a 'Welsh nation builder', historically significant as a proponent of Puritanism in specifically Welsh cultural terms, and as a contributor to a modern Welsh national consciousness. Hugh Bevan considers his importance as a Puritan and writer in Morgan Llwyd y Llenor, while a book by Goronwy Owen, Rhwng Calfin a Böhme: Golwg ar Syniadaeth Morgan Llwyd, explores his theological and mystical ideas. Llyfr y Tri Aderyn was translated into English by L.J. Parry for the National Eisteddfod in 1896, and by Rob Mimpriss as A Book of Three Birds (Cockatrice Books, 2017).

She was the daughter of Baron Saburō Ozaki, one of the first Japanese men to study in the West, and Bathia Catherine Morrison, daughter of William Morrison, one of their teachers. Her parents separated after five years of marriage, and her mother retained custody of their three daughters until they became teenagers.

It is one of two in the state designated as National Historic Landmarks, along with the Crescent Park Looff Carousel in East Providence. It is the oldest operating carousel in the United States in which the horses are suspended from chains. Description The carousel is believed to have been built around 1876 by the Charles W. Dare Company of New York. This is about the same time attributed to the construction of the Flying Horses Carousel in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, although both dates are based on inferences and lack certainty. It consists of twenty horses in two sizes which are suspended by chains from sweeps radiating out from the center of the carousel under its canopy. The bodies of the horses are believed to have been carved from single blocks of wood, with the legs carved separately and attached. The horses still have their original agate eyes; other trappings have been replaced, including manes and reins. The chains holding the horses are attached to the rump and to an iron bar added to the pommel, apparently a modification. When the carousel rotates, centrifugal force drives the horses outward, giving rise to the name \\"flying horses.\\" The horses in the Oak Bluffs carousel are fixed to columns between spreader panels above and a platform below. A child rides the carousel The carousel is located in a wood-frame pavilion at the end of Bay Street in Watch Hill. It is a ten-sided structure with a hipped roof, and appears to date to the early 20th century. A low picket fence surrounds the structure to prevent access to the space in which the horses fly when the carousel is in operation. The floor of the pavilion is now concrete; it was originally sand. Children younger than 12 years old may ride. In the middle of the ride, a device holding metal rings is lowered for riders to grab as they pass. The last ring is brass, granting the \\"winner\\" a free ride token. The cost for riders on the outer horses is $1.00, a ride on the inner is $.50. History The carousel was originally part of a traveling carnival until 1879, when the carnival was forced to abandon it in Watch Hill. It was powered by a horse at that time, with music provided by a hand-cranked organ. Power was provided by water in 1897, and the carousel was electrified about 1914. It was extensively damaged by the New England Hurricane of 1938 which devastated Watch Hill. However, its horses were recovered from the sand dunes and the carousel was restored to operation; three chariots were lost which were not replaced. The carousel and its buildings have been the subject of repairs and restorations in the following decades. It is maintained by the non-profit Watch Hill Improvement Society. The carousel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987. It operates annually from June to Labor Day.

He was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) for four seasons during the early 2000s. He played college football for the University of Southern California (USC), and earned consensus All-American honors. The Minnesota Vikings picked Udeze in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft. He was forced to retire in 2008 after he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Early years Udeze was born in Los Angeles. He attended Verbum Dei High School, a Jesuit-affiliated Roman Catholic school in Los Angeles, where he played high school football for the Verbum Dei Eagles and competed in track as a shot putter (top-throw of 56-7 or 17.34m). College career While attending the University of Southern California, Udeze played for coach Pete Carroll's USC Trojans football team from 2001 to 2003. He was a three-year starter and helped his team to a 2004 Rose Bowl victory and AP national title as a junior. He finished his college career with 135 tackles (51 of them for a loss), 28 sacks (a school record), 14 forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, one interception, five pass deflections, and two blocked kicks. As a junior in 2003, he was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. Professional career =Minnesota Vikings= Udeze was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round (twentieth overall pick) of the 2004 NFL Draft. During his rookie season with the Vikings, he started 15 games and recorded 36 tackles, five sacks, one forced fumble, and one pass deflected. As a second year pro, Udeze was injured in the Vikings third game of the season with cartilage damage in his left knee, which kept him out the rest of the year. Udeze finished the season with three games started, five tackles, and one quarterback sack. In 2006, he was once again the starter at left defensive end, playing 16 games, starting 15 and recorded 29 tackles and no sacks.

KMSP-TV (Ch. 9) also reported that Udeze was at Fairview Southdale Hospital undergoing tests and that he was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester the week before. Udeze revealed that his acute leukemia is in a state of remission. Udeze received a bone marrow transplant from his brother.Great news for Kenechi Udeze The Vikings placed Udeze on the non- football injury list and eventually injured reserve in July 2008, ending his season. Udeze returned to the Metrodome as an honorary captain for a game against the Green Bay Packers on November 9, 2008, where he said he would return to playing football. \\"You know what? I'll be back next year,\\" Udeze told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Udeze was able to get back into good enough condition to return to the Vikings for 2009 pre-season training, reaching the physical form he was in before his illness. He took 26 snaps during a Vikings mini-camp, but struggled with peripheral neuropathy in his feet, a result of his chemotherapy. The chemotherapy-induced neuropathy caused numbness that kept him from being able to plant firmly and create a burst up the field after the snap. Finding himself unable to move at the level he was accustomed to, Udeze decided to retire, which he announced on July 29, 2009. Post- retirement During his illness, Udeze decided to return to USC, where he resumed taking classes.

Headquartered in Zürich, it is among the older Swiss banking institutions. In recent years the banks reputation and standing have taken a hit following a string of corruption and money laundering scandals which led to an unprecedented public censure by the Swiss regulatory authority (FINMA). The sanctions were on the back of a detailed investigation revealing a poor employee and risk culture across the bank. Since 2018 the bank has also been on a major cost cutting drive, leading to significant employee attrition and hundreds of job cuts. Established as a traditional private bank and named after Swiss banker Julius Bär, it provides investment management, real estate financing, wealth management, and select offerings in sales and trading based on an open and managed architecture. The majority of income is generated by commissions and service fees. Located in 28 countries, it is known for its banking secrecy and bank–client confidentiality. Julius Baer employs a staff of over 6,700 worldwide. The group manages assets for private clients from all over the world. The firm's services consist mainly of wealth management and investment consultancy. The bank provides products via its open architecture platform as well as securities and foreign exchange trading.

In November 2012, Julius Baer and Milan-based Kairos Investment Management SpA (‘Kairos’) announced that they had reached an agreement for a cooperation to jointly create a leading onshore wealth management player in Italy. Julius Baer’s Italian SIM was integrated into Kairos and, simultaneously, Julius Baer acquired 19.9% of Kairos. All Italian wealth management activities of the two groups run under the name Kairos Julius Baer. Julius Baer acquired Merrill Lynch’s International Wealth Management business (IWM), based outside the US, in August 2012, for 860 million Swiss francs ($884.8 million). The deal grew Julius Baer's assets under management by 40%, raising the AuM to 251 billion francs ($258.2 billion). In July 2014, Julius Baer announced that it had purchased the private banking assets of Israeli Bank Leumi.Financial Times, 22 July 2014, p. 16. Subsidiaries and associations =GAM Holding AG= Global Asset Management (GAM) is an independent asset management business spun off from Julius Baer in September 2009 and is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, with a global presence, employing over 900 staff in 14 countries. Today's GAM Holding AG comprises the distinct but complementary businesses GAM and Swiss & Global Asset Management. The latter has evolved from the asset management business of Julius Baer. GAM Holding AG offers a diversified range of investment products and services to institutions, intermediaries, private clients and charities. =Julius Baer Foundation= The main focus of the Julius Baer Foundation is youth, vocational training, recycling and wealth inequality. Projects that directly benefit the younger generation are sponsored in various ways. Set up in 1965 by Walter J. Baer initially for charitable causes in Switzerland, the scope has grown together with the expansion of the business to a global scale. Julius Baer Foundation works together with and supports among others Sistema B (Chile), Solafrica (Ethiopia), Swisscontact (Switzerland) and Plastic Free Planet (UK). Controversies and lawsuits In February 2008, Bank Julius Baer filed a lawsuit (Bank Julius Baer v. WikiLeaks) against WikiLeaks in a federal court in California and obtained a permanent injunction disabling the website wikileaks.org, which was subsequently overturned as a violation of freedom of speech. Alex Widmer, the chief executive of Bank Julius Baer, took his own life on December 4, 2008. Hans de Gier, the former chief of Julius Baer Group, assumed Widmer's responsibilities for the interim. In May 2009, Boris F. J. Collardi assumed the role as CEO for the Julius Baer Group Ltd. and Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd. On January 16, 2011, former Julius Baer employee Rudolf Elmer announced that he would be handing over to WikiLeaks bank account details of individuals and corporations holding offshore accounts that indicates corruption inside the bank such as massive tax evasion. In February 2016, Julius Baer reached a $547 million settlement with the United States Department of Justice to avoid prosecution related to investigations of aiding US citizens in committing tax evasion. On February 20, 2020, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) censured Julius Baer for falling \\"significantly short\\" in combating money laundering between 2009 and 2018 with regards to corruption allegations involving FIFA and PDVSA, Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company. FINMA ordered Julius Baer to change its remuneration and recruitment policies, imposed an indefinite ban on all acquisitions, and appointed an auditor to oversee the bank to ensure it’s compliance with anti-money laundering standards.The bank remains on probation until certain conditions are met and stands to lose its banking license should it not be able to demonstrate reasonable progress in meeting the regulator’s demands.

The term LGA or large for gestational age is defined by birth weight above the 90th percentile for their gestational age and gender. In infants with birth weight above the 97th percentile in their gestational age and gender group, research has shown that greater risk of long-term health complications and fatal outcomes are present in LGA infants. Specifically, large for gestational age can be characterized by macrosomia, referring to a fetal growth beyond a certain threshold (threshold ranging from a body weight of 4,000 grams to above 5,000 grams). Experts in Obstetrics and Gynecology currently use a grading system to evaluate LGA infants, where their birth weight may help identify risks associated with their birth, including labor complications of both mother and child, potential long-term health complications of the neonate and infant mortality.  Complications  = Neonatal = Common risks in LGA babies include shoulder dystocia, hypoglycemia, brachial plexus injuries, metatarsus adductus, hip subluxation and talipes calcaneovalgus, due to intrauterine deformation. Shoulder dystocia occurs when the anterior shoulder becomes impacted on the maternal pubic symphysis during birth. The doctor or midwife will try to push the baby's anterior shoulder downward to pass through the birth canal and clear the woman's pubic symphysis. This can be difficult if the child is LGA, since the birth canal is 10 cm when fully dilated for most women and there may not be much room to move the baby. If shoulder dystocia occurs, there are various maneuvers which can be performed by the birth attendant to try to deliver the shoulders. These generally involve trying to turn the shoulders into the oblique, using suprapubic pressure to disimpact the anterior shoulder from above the pubic symphysis, or delivering the posterior arm first. If these do not resolve the situation, the provider may intentionally snap the baby's clavicle (bone that holds shoulder in place) in a procedure called cleidotomy in order to displace the shoulder and allow the child to be delivered. Other methods to deliver the baby as a last resort when all else have failed are the Zavanelli maneuver and symphysiotomy. The Zavanelli maneuver involves flexing and pushing the fetal head back into the birth canal, and an emergency cesarean section is then performed. Symphysiotomy allows childbirth by surgically dividing the pubic bone to widen the pelvis and it is performed after a failed Zavanelli maneuver. Newborns with shoulder dystocia are at risk of temporary or permanent nerve damage to the baby's arm, or other injuries such as humeral fracture. In non-diabetic women, shoulder dystocia happens 0.65% of the time in babies that weigh less than , 6.7% of the time in babies that weigh to , and 14.5% of the time in babies that weigh more than . In diabetic women, shoulder dystocia happens 2.2% of the time in babies that weigh less than 8 pounds 13 ounces (4,000 g), 13.9% of the time in babies that weigh 8 pounds 13 ounces (4,000 g) to 9 pounds 15 ounces (4,500 g), and 52.5% of the time in babies that weigh more than 9 pounds 15 ounces (4,500 g). Although big babies are at higher risk for shoulder dystocia, most cases of shoulder dystocia happen in smaller babies because there are many more small and normal-size babies being born than big babies. Researchers have been unable to predict who will have shoulder dystocia and who will not. LGA babies are at higher risk of hypoglycemia in the neonatal period, independent of whether the mother has diabetes. Hypoglycemia, as well as hyperbilirubinemia and polycythemia, occur as a result of hyperinsulinemia in the fetus. High birth weight may impact the baby in the long term. Macrosomic neonates are at a higher risk of being overweight and obese than their normal-weight counterparts later in life. Studies have shown that the long-term overweight risk is doubled when the birth weight is greater than 4,000 g. The risk of having type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult life is 19% higher among macrosomic babies with birth weights heavier than 4,500 g compared to those with birth weights between 4,000 g and 4,500 g. = Maternal = Maternal complications in pregnancies with macrosomia include emergency cesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage and obstetric anal sphincter injury. The risk of maternal complications in pregnancies with newborns weighing between 4,000 g and 4,500 g is two-fold greater than in pregnancies without macrosomia. In pregnancies with newborns weighing over 4,500 g, the risk is approximately three-fold greater.  Risk factors  = Maternal diabetes = One of the primary risk factors of LGA is poorly-controlled maternal diabetes, particularly gestational diabetes (GD), as well as preexisting diabetes mellitus (DM) (preexisting type 2 is associated more with macrosomia, while preexisting type 1 can be associated with microsomia). The risk of having a macrosomic fetus is three times greater in mothers with diabetes than those without diabetes. DM increases maternal plasma glucose levels as well as insulin, stimulating fetal growth of subcutaneous fat. The LGA newborn exposed to maternal DM usually only has an increase in weight, not a change in body length or head size. = Genetics = Genetics plays a role in having an LGA baby. Taller, heavier parents tend to have larger babies. Genetic disorders of overgrowth (e.g. Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, Sotos syndrome, Perlman syndrome, Simpson-Golabi- Behmel syndrome ) are often characterized by macrosomia. = Other risk factors = * Gestational age: pregnancies that go beyond 40 weeks increase incidence of an LGA infant * Fetal sex: male infants tend to weigh more than female infants * Obesity prior to pregnancy and maternal weight gain above recommended guidelines during pregnancy * Multiparity: giving birth to previous LGA infants vs. non-LGA infants * Frozen embryo transfer as fertility treatment, as compared with fresh embryo transfer or no artificial assistance  Diagnosis  thumb Diagnosing fetal macrosomia cannot be performed until after birth, as evaluating a baby's weight in the womb may be inaccurate. While ultrasound has been the primary method for diagnosing LGA, this form of fetal weight assessment remains imprecise, as the fetus is a highly variable structure in regards to density and weight— no matter the gestational age. Ultrasonography involves an algorithm that incorporates biometric measurements of the fetus, such as biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), and femur length (FL), to calculate the estimated fetal weight (EFW). Variability of fetal weight estimations has been linked to differences due to sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound algorithms as well as to the individual performing the ultrasound examination. In addition to sonography, fetal weight can also be assessed using clinical and maternal methods. Clinical methods for estimating fetal weight involves measuring the mother's symphysis-fundal height and performing Leopold's maneuvers, which can help with determining the fetus position in utero in addition to size. However, as this method relies heavily on practitioner experience and technique, it does not provide an accurate and definite diagnosis of an LGA infant and only would only serve as a potential indication of suspected macrosomia. Fetal weight can also be estimated through a mother's subjective assessment of the fetus size, but this method is dependent on a mother's experience with past pregnancies and may not be clinically useful. There are new methods being studied for their accuracy in predicting fetal weight, such as measuring fetal soft tissue, but more research needs to be done to find a consistent, reliable method.  Management  Induction of labor at or near term for women with a baby of suspected macrosomia has been proposed as a treatment method, as it stops fetal growth and results in babies with a lower birth weight, fewer bone fractures, and less incidence of shoulder dystocia. However, this method could increase the number of women with perineal tears, and failed inductions can prompt the need for emergency cesarean sections. LGA babies are more than two times likely to be delivered by Cesarean section, compared to infants under 4000 grams (below the threshold of macrosomia). Predicting a baby’s weight can be inaccurate and women could be worried unnecessarily, and request their labor to be induced without a medical reason. Doctors disagree whether women should be induced for suspected macrosomia and more research is needed to find out what is best for women and their babies. Elective cesarean section has also been presented as a potential delivery method for infants of suspected macrosomia, as it can serve to prevent possible birth trauma. However, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that cesarean delivery should only be considered if the fetus is an estimated weight of at least 5,000 grams in non-diabetic mothers and at least 4,500 grams in diabetic mothers. A number needed to treat analysis determined that approximately 3,700 women with suspected fetal macrosomia would have to undergo an unnecessary cesarean section in order to prevent one incident of brachial plexus injuries secondary to shoulder dystocia. Management of gestational diabetes through dietary modifications and anti-diabetic medications has been shown to decrease the incidence of LGA. The use of metformin to control maternal blood glucose levels has shown to be more effective than using insulin alone in reducing the likelihood of fetal macrosomia. There is a 20% lower chance of having an LGA baby when using metformin to manage diabetes compared to using insulin. Modifiable risk factors that increase the incidence of LGA births, such as gestational weight gain above recommended BMI guidelines, can be managed with lifestyle modifications, including maintaining a balanced diet and exercising. Such interventions can help mothers achieve the recommended gestational weight and lower the incidence of fetal macrosomia in obese and overweight women. The World Health Organization also recommends that mothers aim for their recommended BMI prior to conception. In general, obese mothers or women with excessive gestational weight gain may have higher risk of pregnancy complications (ranging from LGA, shoulder dystocia, etc.).  Epidemiology  In healthy pregnancies without pre-term or post-term health complications, large for gestational age, or fetal macrosomia have been observed to affect around 12% of newborns. By comparison, women with gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of giving birth to LGA babies, where ~15-45% of neonates may be affected. In 2017, the National Center of Health Statistics found that 7.8% of live-born infants born in the United States meet the definition of macrosomia, where their birth weight surpasses the threshold of 4000 grams (above ~8.8 pounds). Women in Europe and the United States tend to have higher pre-term body weight and have increased gestational weight during pregnancy compared to women in east Asia. Thus, women in Europe and the United States, with higher gestational weight gain, tend to have higher associated risk of LGA infants, macrosomia and cesarean. In European countries, the prevalence of births of newborns weighing between 4,000 g and 4,499 g is 8% to 21%, and in Asian countries the prevalence is between 1% and 8%. In general, rates of LGA infants have increased 15-25% in many countries including the United States, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Scotland and more in the past 20-30 years, suggesting an increase in LGA births worldwide.

In his time he was most renowned as one of the main proponents of the Swedish reformation of 1523-31. Biography Laurentius Andreae was born in the town of Strängnäs. As was the case with many 15th century personalities, the date of his birth remained unrecorded, although the year is generally assumed to have been in the early 1470s. During his youth he was a priest, and had travelled to Rome as well as conducted studies abroad. In 1509, when he was in his mid- to late thirties, he received an appointment as deacon of his hometown of Strängnäs. In the intervening years he met Olaus Petri, converted to Lutheranism and by the 1520s was promoted to archdeacon of Uppsala. Along with Olaus Petri and his brother Laurentius, Andreae completed the full translation of the Bible into Swedish, known as the \\"Gustav Vasa Bible\\" of 1541. He served as chancellor for King Gustav I Vasa and cherished by Laurentius Petri, the Archbishop, because they shared a strong Lutheran faith. In 1527, at the Diet of Västerås, he declared the King to be the head of the Church of Sweden. In 1540, he and Olaus Petri were sentenced to death. Historians differ in regard to the nature of the alleged transgressions, and whether the sentences were justified. All agree, however, that the verdicts were highly influenced by the King's personal opinions and disagreement with the men. After much pleading, the sentences were reduced to severe fines and both men were released. Laurentius Andreae later died in Strängnäs at the approximate age of 80.

He received his own professional education at Milton Academy, Harvard College and Harvard's Lawrence Scientific School. In 1859, he began working for Richard Morris Hunt, the founder of the first American architectural school, the AIA, and the first American to graduate from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Soon afterward Ware formed a partnership with the civil engineer Edward S. Philbrick, Philbrick and Ware, and they designed the Swedenborgian High Street Church in Brookline, Massachusetts. In 1864, Ware partnered with fellow Harvard graduate Henry Van Brunt to form Ware & Van Brunt.

He went to Cornwall, Connecticut to study at the Foreign Mission School. He met Sarah Bird Northup, of a New England Yankee family, and they married in 1824. Soon after their return to New Echota in 1825, Ridge was chosen for the Cherokee National Council and became a leader in the tribe. In the 1830s, Ridge was part of the Treaty Party with his father Major Ridge and cousins Elias Boudinot and Stand Watie. Believing that Indian Removal was inevitable, they supported making a treaty with the United States government to protect Cherokee rights. The Ridges and Boudinot were both signatories to the Treaty of New Echota of 1835, by which they ceded Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi in exchange for lands in Indian Territory. The land cession was opposed by the majority of the tribe and the Principal Chief John Ross, but the treaty was ratified by the US Senate. In 1839, after removal to Indian Territory, opponents assassinated the Ridges, Boudinot, and other Treaty Party members for their roles in the land cession and to eliminate them as political rivals. Stand Watie survived such an attack. Early life John Ridge was born to the Cherokee chief Major Ridge and his wife Sehoya around 1802 in their village of Oothacaloga, near present-day Calhoun, Georgia. The Cherokee were a matrilineal tribe, so he belonged to the Wild Potato Clan through his mother, Sehoya (Susannah Catherine Wickett).Johansen and Pritzker, 777 Ridge was often sick as a child. He studied at the nearby mission school run by the Moravian Brethren at Spring Place, Cherokee Nation (now Georgia). It was founded on land given to them by his father's mentor and fellow former warrior, James Vann. Ridge's father sent him to the Foreign Mission School in Cornwall, Connecticut in 1819, where he learned reading and writing in English and other subjects typical of middle-class education at the time. Many families in the town supported the school and were hospitable to its students. As the top-ranked student, Ridge was asked to write an essay for President James Monroe, to be presented by Jedidiah Morse. His cousin Elias Boudinot also studied at the school. Marriage and family While at school in Cornwall, Ridge fell in love with Sarah Bird Northrup, the daughter of the school's steward. After two years, he convinced her parents to allow them to marry, which they did in January 1824. The Cornwall community reacted angrily to the marriage of a Native American man and a white woman. Their hostility decreased Ridge's admiration for European Americans and altered his hopes for future relations between the Cherokee and whites. Career After Ridge returned with Sarah to the Cherokee nation, his fortunes in the political affairs of the Nation rose quickly. He became a leading member of the National Council, along with his cousin Elias Boudinot and his father's protégé, John Ross. Ridge was highly respected by all the tribes across the Southern United States for his abilities and faithfulness to Indian welfare. =Creek land negotiations= In 1825, the Creek Nation retained two young Cherokee men to serve as their lobbyists in Washington, D.C. during the debates over the removal of the Creeks from the southeastern U. S. This was because there were no Creeks who spoke fluent English at the time. The Creeks also knew that Andrew Jackson thought highly of Major Ridge, who had served with him in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The men, recommended by Major Ridge were John Ridge and David Vann. Since President John Quincy Adams would not negotiate with Cherokees regarding Creek affairs, they were officially designated as secretaries to the Creek delegation. John and David set to work preparing remarks to be presented by Chief Opothleyahola to General Edmund P. Gaines, the commander of the U. S. Army in Georgia. That speech was successful in winning General Gaines' support for the Creek position.Langguth, pp.50-59. =Political life= Ridge's marriage was unusual for his marrying a European- American woman. In the past, marriages between Europeans and Cherokee took place most frequently between European men, frequently fur traders, and high- status Cherokee women. They were strategic alliances believed to benefit both peoples, at a time when Cherokee chiefs sought more influence with the European Americans. Generally the man would live among the Cherokee; in the matrilineal culture, the children were accepted into the Nation as Cherokee and gained status from their mother's clan. Descendants of a Cherokee father and white mother could have no true place in the tribe, as they would not belong to a clan. In 1825, the Council passed a law enabling children of such unions to have full Cherokee citizenship, as if they were of Cherokee descent on their mother's side.Yarbough, Fay. \\"Legislating Women's Sexuality: Cherokee Marriage Laws,\\" Journal of Social History 38 (2004), p. 388 By this time, Ridge's cousin Elias Boudinot (the oldest son of David Watie) had announced his engagement, also to a woman from Cornwall, Connecticut. Given the high status of the two young men, the new ruling recognized their future families and protected their children within the Cherokee Nation.Gaul, Theresa Strouth, Ed. To Marry an Indian: The Marriage of Harriett Gold and Elias Boudinot in Letters, 1823-1839. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2005, p. 16 As clerk of the Cherokee National Council, Ridge participated in tribal delegations to Washington, DC to consult with United States officials. In 1831 they protested Georgia's illegal annexation of that part of the Nation which lay within its territory. (Congress had passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830, but Georgia did not wait for removal). In 1832, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Worcester v. Georgia, that Georgia's unilateral extension of its laws over Cherokee territory was illegal and unconstitutional. It ruled that the Cherokee Nation had sovereign status and appropriately would deal only with the US government. The delegation were dismayed to learn that President Andrew Jackson continued to support removal of all the Southeast tribes to lands west of the Mississippi River. Ridge reluctantly began to think that removal, which he had previously opposed, was inevitable. Ridge and Boudinot both became leaders of the \\"Treaty Party,\\" a group that advocated negotiation of removal under a treaty in order to protect Cherokee rights. They had begun to believe it was the only way to preserve the Cherokee Nation, as European-American settlers continued to encroach on their lands, leading to conflicts. They believed they had to give up the Cherokee land illegally annexed by Georgia. The majority of the Cherokee sided with the Principal Chief John Ross in opposing removal. Ross hoped to make a settlement with the US allowing the Cherokee to stay in the east. Ridge hoped to persuade the Nation of what he saw as the only way out of its dilemma. Together with his father and Boudinot, Ridge signed the Treaty of New Echota in 1835 after final negotiations with a delegation in Washington, D.C. They were part of the National Council's delegation, headed by Principal Chief John Ross, who still was trying to negotiate staying in the East. Since the treaty surrendered all Cherokee land east of the Mississippi River, the opposing Ross faction, known as the National Party, regarded the Treaty Party representatives as traitors. Despite the known divisions within the tribe and the lack of signature by the Principal Chief Ross, the US Senate ratified the treaty. President Jackson used it to justify the forcible Cherokee removal in 1838, in what is now known as the Trail of Tears. The treaty provided for Cherokee who wished to remain in the east to do so. They would have to become citizens of the states where they resided (and the United States) and give up their Cherokee tribal status. This provision was widely ignored during the removal. The US Army rounded up most Cherokee and their slaves from Georgia to take west. Among the Five Civilized Tribes, the Cherokee held the most slaves. Relocation After the treaty signing, Ridge moved with his family, his father and most of his siblings, his uncle (David Watie), and Watie cousins to what is now Indian Territory. This was three years before the forced removal in 1838 of most of the Cherokee. The Ridges and other families joined the \\"Old Settlers\\" of the Cherokee Nation West under Principal Chief John Jolly. Some of them had migrated west in the 1820s from North Carolina or Alabama. On June 22, 1839, a group of 25 pro-Ross partisans of the \\"Late Comers\\" killed Ridge, his father, and Boudinot in revenge for having signed the treaty to cede Cherokee lands. They also attacked Stand Watie, but he survived.Wilkins, Thurman. Cherokee Tragedy: The Story of the Ridge Family and the Decimation of a People, pp. 229-339. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1986. Later they killed other Treaty Party members.

In 2000, shortly after Wizards of the Coast announced the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons, Wizards and Kenzer jointly announced that Kenzer had acquired a rights to produce the Kalamar setting as a Dungeons & Dragons official licensed product. While not as well known a setting such as Forgotten Realms, the setting has a loyal following and has received praise for its consistency and realism. Kenzer and Company has also made the Kingdoms of Kalamar the official setting of its own role-playing fantasy game, HackMaster.  History  =1990s= The original Kingdoms of Kalamar material was clearly intended for use with Dungeons & Dragons, while carefully avoiding any direct trademark or copyright infringement. The setting appeared in two books, \\"Kingdoms of Kalamar, Vol 1: Sourcebook of the Sovereign Lands\\", and \\"Vol 2: Mythos of the Divine and Worldly\\", both in 1994. While distribution was not widespread, fans of the setting continued to support it. Vol 1: Sourcebook of the Sovereign Lands detailed the people and places of Tellene, the campaign's continent (and world). It broke the continent down into six regions and examined each one on a large scale. Vol 2: Mythos of the Divine and Worldly detailed the setting's 43 gods. It also described the setting's secret societies, astrology and calendar. These products were available individually or together in a box set with a two-part map. =Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition= Kingdoms of Kalamar Campaign Setting; a sourcebook with D&D; licensed logo On November 1, 2000, Wizards of the Coast announced via press release that Kingdoms of Kalamar would become an official Dungeons & Dragons world. The Sourcebook of the Sovereign Lands and the Mythos of the Divine and Worldly were combined with nearly 100,000 words of new material for the Kingdoms of Kalamar Campaign Setting, which was nominated for the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Game in 2001. Over 30 different products have been released to support it. The reviewer from Pyramid found that while the Kingdoms of Kalamar originally had numerous game stats relating to 2nd edition Dungeons & Dragons, once the Kingdoms were made an official Dungeons & Dragons setting in third edition, it had very few D&D; specific references.http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=2279 While most of the books have been released with the Dungeons & Dragons logo, newer books (starting with Svimohzia: the Ancient Isle) and pdf re-releases have been without it. On July 11, 2007, Kenzer & Company announced that their license with Wizards of the Coast would expire in August of that year. = Hackmaster = On July 6, 2006, Kenzer & Company announced that Kingdoms of Kalamar would be the official setting of the second version of their HackMaster roleplaying game. = Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition = On July 8, 2008, Kenzer & Company released a compilation of the Campaign Setting and Atlas as a new PDF updated to Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition. Notable about this release was that it did not use the Game System License and was the first 3rd-party release compatible with 4th edition not under the GSL.  Setting  The continent of Tellene is the focus of the Kingdoms of Kalamar setting. Inhabitants of Tellene believe it the entirety of the world, although the source-material hint at lands beyond the edges of the map. Due to this, the world is also generally referred to as Tellene. Tellene is generally divided into several subregions. These include Brandobia, the Young Kingdoms, the Wild Lands, Reanaaria Bay and the isle of Svimohzia. The southernmost tip of Tellene lies at roughly 20° latitude, while the northernmost explored areas rest at about 54° latitude. The climate ranges from temperate to sub-tropical. Tellene has three moons; Diadolai, Pelselond and Veshemo. These orbit Tellene with an 80, 34 and 28 day Orbital period respectively. Most of Tellene uses a lunar calendar, based around the 28-day orbit of Veshemo. The year consists of 13 months, each divided into four 7-day weeks. The year starts on the first day of spring.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Progressive Conservative from 1945 to 1958. The son of John McDowell and Janet Shaw, McDowell came to Canada with his family in 1895, and was educated in Toronto, Ontario. He worked as a grain dealer, and was president of McDowell Grain Co. Ltd and Ridgewood Development Co. Ltd. He was also on the board of governors of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1945 provincial election, in the constituency of Iberville. At the time, Manitoba was governed by a coalition ministry of Liberal-Progressives and Progressive Conservatives. McDowell ran as an Independent Progressive Conservative supporting the coalition, and defeated Liberal-Progressive W.D. Lawrence by over 400 votes. He resigned his seat in 1949 to run for the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative. He finished third in the riding of Selkirk in the federal election of 1949, behind William Bryce of the social-democratic Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and Liberal Laurier Regnier. No by- election was called for Iberville, and the seat remained vacant until the 1949 provincial election, held several months after the federal campaign. McDowell ran to succeed himself, and won re-election as an Independent Progressive Conservative opposing the coalition. In 1949, McDowell and George Hastings formed the Manitoba Democratic Movement as a pressure group within the Progressive Conservative Party. Not a formal political party, the MDM called for the Progressive Conservatives to leave the coalition government and supplant the CCF as the province's primary opposition. Hastings was concerned that the CCF could form the government if no other alternatives were presented to the electorate. Following pressure from the MDM and other groups, the Progressive Conservatives left the coalition in 1950, and McDowell rejoined the official party caucus in opposition. He was re-elected in the 1953 provincial election, defeating Liberal-Progressive C.H. Jarvis by 195 votes. McDowell was on the right-wing of the Progressive Conservatives, and was considered a reactionary even by other members of his party. Extremely proud of his position on the grain commission, he opposed the Canadian Wheat Board as unwarranted government interference in the marketplace. During a 1953 legislative debate on the issue, he made the following statement: \\"Why, if Communism ever came to this county - and I pray God it won't - they won't have to change a thing in this act, only the penalties. Instead, you'll be shot in the morning, that's all!\\". He was a forceful debater, and once described the CCF as \\"a demoralized race, fighting with the wind, soon to be gone with the wind\\". He was a prominent supporter of Errick Willis in the party's 1954 leadership convention, and opposed Dufferin Roblin's leadership of the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party. When Roblin's government enacted progressive legislation in 1958, McDowell dismissed the party as the \\"Progressive Conservative Commonwealth Federation\\". McDowell himself declined to be a candidate in the 1958 election. He came out of political retirement to run in the federal election of 1968, opposing Roblin as an Independent Conservative in Winnipeg South Centre. He received only 632 votes, but may have taken some satisfaction in Roblin's loss to Liberal E.B. Osler.

The bulk of his domestic cricketing career occurred with Worcestershire, although he had a spell with Derbyshire, and overseas with Natal. He played in nine Tests and twenty five ODIs for England, including participating in the 1992 and 1996 Cricket World Cups. Several websites, mistakenly, report that he is Ray Illingworth's son but the two are not related. Playing career Playing mainly as a left-arm spinner, Illingworth made his first-class debut in 1982, promoted to the Worcestershire first team after just two Second XI appearances and taking 3–61 against Somerset. His figures that year were fairly modest; eighteen first-class wickets cost him over 45 apiece, and he bowled just eight overs in one-day cricket; but Worcestershire saw potential and persevered. By 1983, he was a first-team regular, taking forty eight first-class wickets, a figure he improved on (with 57) the following year. He did play one season (1988/89) in the South African Currie Cup for Natal, but otherwise played only English domestic cricket. For most of his twenty-season county cricket career, Illingworth remained with Worcestershire, but after he failed to win a contract extension in 2000, the last two years of his time in the first-class game were spent with Derbyshire. He finished with 831 wickets at an average of 31.54, and more than 7,000 runs at 22.45, including four first-class centuries. =One-Day International career= In 1990, Illingworth had his most productive year, taking 75 wickets at a bowling average of 28.29, and he went on that winter's A team tour to Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The following season, a well-timed burst of 5–49 against Northants in a May Sunday League game helped to win him selection for the Texaco Trophy One Day International series against West Indies a few days later. He played a crucial part in the match, allowing the tourists just 20 runs from his ten overs for the wicket of Jeff Dujon, and then putting on an unbroken partnership of 23 with Mike Atherton as England recorded a thrilling one-wicket victory. He also played in two Cricket World Cups, in 1992 and 1996. During the 1992 World Cup, Illingworth played in the final, giving away 50 runs in his 10 overs for the wicket of Javed Miandad, and also catching Imran Khan at long-on. In the same match, he had the misfortune of being the last man dismissed as England fell short in the final for the third time. =Test career= Although his performances in the other two Texaco Trophy matches were less impressive, he did take the wickets of Richie Richardson and a young Brian Lara in the seven- wicket win at Lord's, and also held a catch off Phil DeFreitas to remove captain Viv Richards. Illingworth missed out on selection for the first two Test matches, but was selected for the Third Test at Trent Bridge, and took the wicket of Phil Simmons with his first ball in Test cricket, the first bowler since Intikhab Alam in 1959/60 to achieve this feat, and only the eleventh of all time. He also bowled Richards on his way to 3–110, but two stubborn rearguard displays with the bat (adding 42 with Robin Smith in the first innings and 38 with DeFreitas in the second) could not prevent England sliding to a nine-wicket loss. Illingworth retained his place for the Fourth Test at Edgbaston, batting at number 11; this match was notable for the fact that all eleven England players had a first-class century to their name. Despite this, England were easily beaten, Illingworth going for almost five runs an over and picking up just one wicket in the match. He was dropped for The Oval, and replaced by Phil Tufnell. Tufnell took 6–25 in the first innings of that match to help propel England to a series-levelling win. Illingworth did not to play another Test until 1995, although he retained his one-day place for a couple of years, and did well in the 1992 World Cup. By 1995, Illingworth had been out of the England side for two years, but the selectors were impressed by his reliable performances for his county, and called him up for the Test series against West Indies. He played in all but the Fourth Test (for which he was replaced by John Emburey), and although his series figures of 6–215 were not particularly outstanding, he was selected for the winter tour to South Africa. It proved a good choice: Illingworth had his best series for England, taking nine Test wickets at an average of under 21. He also appeared four times in the 1996 World Cup, but thereafter the selectors' preference turned decisively to Tufnell, and Illingworth never played international cricket again. Umpiring career Illingworth was appointed to the ECB full list of first-class umpires for the 2006 English cricket season. As at the end of the 2008 English cricket season Illingworth had umpired 47 first-class matches. It was confirmed that he, and Richard Kettleborough, were promoted onto the ICC International list on 9 November 2009. Richard Illingworth joined ICC's elite umpire panel on 25 June 2013. He was selected as one of the twenty umpires to stand in matches during the 2015 Cricket World Cup. In April 2019, he was named as one of the sixteen umpires to stand in matches during the 2019 Cricket World Cup. In July 2019, he was named as one of the two on-field umpires for the first semi-final match, between India and New Zealand. He was declared ICC Umpire of the year for 2019 and won the David Shepherd Trophy.

It aired on Fox from October 2000 until June 2001, for a total run of 13 episodes. The feel of the show closely modeled that of The X-Files and other supernatural-themed shows that were popular at the time. Setting and plot FreakyLinks centered on Derek Barnes (played by Ethan Embry), who ran a website called \\"FreakyLinks.com\\" that sought out the dark and forbidden truths behind paranormal phenomena and urban legends, assisted by his friends Chloe (Lisa Sheridan) and Jason (Karim Prince). Derek took over the site after his twin brother, Adam, died under mysterious circumstances. The show's episodes revolved around Derek and his friends investigating supernatural claims for the website and uncovering clues that reveal the truth of his brother's fate.

Elsing Production and marketing FreakyLinks, originally titled Fearsum until a few months before airing, was developed by Haxan, the creators of the film The Blair Witch Project. Haxan decided to follow a similar marketing strategy as Blair Witch and created a website, long before the show was set to air, called \\"Freakylinks.com\\" which was cleverly designed to look like an amateurish, home-brew website made by real-life paranormal enthusiasts. The website was fairly successful and seemed to create some amount of \\"buzz\\" but this did not translate into high ratings when the show finally aired. The show went on hiatus for a few months before returning the air to finish out the season, but was not renewed for the next fall television season. However, during its brief run the show developed a devoted cult following. Following the show's demise, an outcry arose among the fans and an online petition, possibly among the first such online petitions, was created to ask the Fox Network to bring the show back for another season.

As the Maryland Nighthawks they were formerly part of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and a founding member of the Premier Basketball League (PBL), in which they later played as the Maryland GreenHawks. The team began play in the fall of 2004. History =2004–2007: Nighthawk ABA Years= Logo used by the Nighthawks when they were in the ABA The Nighthawks were first located in North Bethesda, Maryland when they joined the ABA. In their first season they finished in third place in the Blue Division with a 15-9 record. They lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Bellevue Blackhawks, 133-120. Entering their second season, owner Tom Doyle relocated the team from Show Place Arena in Prince George's County, Maryland, to Montgomery County, Maryland. The Nighthawks played their home games at the Hanley Center for Athletic Excellence of Georgetown Preparatory School on Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons. Celebrity players such as the New England Patriots' Adalius Thomas and former Washington Bullet Gheorghe Muresan suited up for the Nighthawks and played as the \\"11th man\\", a unique rule in the ABA that allows celebrities to play in a game for an ABA team. The Nighthawks finished the 2005-06 season with a record of 25-10. They also signed 7' 8¾\\" Chinese player Sun Mingming, the largest player ever to play professional basketball in the US. In the playoffs, they faced the Montreal Matrix in the first round. They won 145-114, advancing to the second round. There, they faced the SoCal Legends, to whom they would lose, 121-123. In the 2006–2007 season, they finished 13-16. This was the first losing record in the franchise's history.

As there were only ten teams in the league, they made the playoffs against the 11-9 Wilmington Sea Dawgs. They defeated Wilmington 125-112. In the second round, they went on to face off against the Rochester Razorsharks, who easily defeated the Nighthawks 123-102, thus ending their season. 2009 On October 10, 2008, the team announced that they would be representing the PBL as the official \\"Travel Team\\" of the PBL in China and the Far East.

Plot In 1985, following the success of the film Tron and the incorporation of the Tiger, the Eagle launched a new strip called \\"The Ultimate Warrior\\". This was quickly renamed \\"The Computer Warrior\\" and was one of only two strips (the other being Dan Dare) to last for the rest of the comics lifetime. When the strip first appeared, Bobby Patterson's friend Martin French mysteriously disappears. Bobby Patterson receives a message in which Martin reveals that he had discovered a code to activate a real life facility on his computer, enabling him to literally enter the computer games realm and that his disappearance means that he has lost a game and is now trapped within the Nightmare Zone. In order to rescue Martin, Bobby must practice on the games before using the code to play the games in the computer realm. A single loss would mean Bobby himself would also be trapped in the Nightmare Zone. The only way for Bobby to free Martin was to complete 10 games himself using the code. Bobby made great progress through the tests, including overcoming various real life problems with his mother and father. Once Martin himself had the chance to free himself by finding a secret tunnel in the Nightmare Zone where he met the computer who gave him one chance to escape, by completing without practice the game UggaBulla, but unfortunately Martin was not successful. Eventually Bobby, saw through all 10 games, many of them used by the Eagle comic itself as prize giveaways and promotions throughout the run. Martin was rescued and Bobby gained the title of Computer Warrior. Due to the strip's popularity and a desire to continue it beyond the original concept it was then revealed that the purpose of the challenge was to find a champion to defeat the dark forces of the Nightmare Zone. The realm's ruler, the Computer Warlord, gathered together all qualified Computer Warriors and eliminated them one by one (banishing them to the Nightmare Zone) in a series of tests to find the 'Ultimate Warrior'. As before, each test was the successful completion of a popular computer game of the time. Bobby made friends and enemies amongst the other Computer Warriors as the tests went on, but eventually Bobby emerged triumphant and became the Computer Warlord's champion; the other Computer Warriors being freed from the Nightmare Zone. The Computer Warlord then set Bobby 5 more tests to defeat the Nightmare Zone creatures once and for all. In the final test the Nightmare Zone creatures picked a champion to defeat Bobby, his evil self! Finally, Bobby defeated this last enemy and the Nightmare Zone creatures were trapped in a 'cube of holding' by the Warlord. In future stories, Bobby defeated various Nightmare Zone creatures who refused to enter the cube and then became the Computer Warlord, the old one having died and bequeathing it to Bobby. Bobby then invited Eagle readers to take part in their own 'real life' games, with no danger of going to the Nightmare Zone! Eagle then had another revamp and a new plot line was introduced. Bobby was summoned before the 'Council of Warlords' to be told he wasn't really a Computer Warlord, and demoted to just plain Computer Warrior. Then another Warlord named Baal explained that they too were being attacked by Nightmare Zone creatures and he needed a champion to defeat them. By this stage, the quality of the writing had dropped significantly and the strip was reduced to Bobby being set test after test after test to 'prove he was a champion' which lasted for the rest of the strip's duration. No effort was made to introduce any other plot except the eternal completion of video games. The Eagle became a monthly comic in the early nineties and the Computer Warrior and Dan Dare became the only strips that weren't reprints. The Eagle eventually ceased production in January 1994 and the Computer Warrior storyline was quickly wrapped up. In the final video game test, Bobby played \\"Another World\\". When he successfully completed this, he was told by Baal that \\"no test had been too great\\" and he had now defeated the Nightmare Zone forces. How he achieved this was never explained. Bobby was returned to his home and told that all his adventures had taken place in seconds in the real world and he would no longer be needed. Bobby pleaded with Baal to come back but had to contend with himself that he would miss being the Computer Warrior. For the first three years the writer was credited as \\"D. Spence\\" a pen-name used by Alan Grant.

Part of the Iranian Crown Jewels. The Iranian National Jewels (), originally the Iranian Crown Jewels (), include elaborate crowns, thirty tiaras, and numerous aigrettes, a dozen bejeweled swords and shields, a number of unset precious gems, numerous plates and other dining services cast in precious metals and encrusted with gems, and several other more unusual items (such as a large golden globe with the oceans made of emeralds) collected or worn by the Persian monarchs from the 16th century (Safavid Persia) and on. The collection is housed at The Treasury of National Jewels, situated inside the Central Bank of Iran on Tehran's Ferdowsi Avenue. Safavid and Afsharid conquests The majority of the items now in the collection were acquired by the Safavid dynasty, which ruled Iran from 1502 to 1736 AD. Afghans invaded Iran in 1719 and sacked the then capital of Isfahan and took the Iranian crown jewels as plunder. By 1729, however, after an internal struggle of nearly a decade, Nader Shah Afshar successfully drove the Afghans from Iran. In 1738, the Shah launched his own campaign against the Afghan homeland. After taking and raiding the cities of Kandahar and Kabul as well as several principalities in far-off northern India, and sacking Delhi, the victorious Nader Shah returned to Iran with what remained of the plundered crown jewels as well as several other precious objects now found in the Iranian Treasury. These included diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and other precious gemstones. Four of the most prominent acquisitions from this conquest were the Koh-i-Noor and Darya-ye Noor diamonds (both originating from India and still amongst the largest in the world), the Peacock Throne, and the Samarian Spinel. Mohammad Reza Shah crowning his wife, Empress Farah, at their coronation in 1967. Modern usage The crown jewels were last used by the Pahlavi dynasty, the last to rule Iran. The splendor of the collection came to the attention of the western world largely through their use by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and his Shahbanu, Farah Pahlavi, during official ceremonies and state visits. The Iranian crown jewels are considered so valuable that they are still used as a reserve to back Iranian currency (and have been used this way by several successive governments). In 1937, during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi, ownership of the Imperial treasury was transferred to the state. The jewels were placed in the vaults of the National Bank of Iran, where they were used as collateral to strengthen the financial power of the institution and to back the national monetary system. This important economic role is perhaps one reason why these jewels, undeniable symbols of Iran's monarchic past, have been retained by the current Islamic Republic. =Public display= Because of their great value and economic significance, the Iranian crown jewels were for centuries kept far from public view in the vaults of the Imperial treasury. However, as the first Pahlavi Shah had transferred ownership of the crown jewels to the state, his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, decreed that the most spectacular of the jewels should be put on public display at the Central Bank of Iran. When the Iranian revolution toppled the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979, it was feared that in the chaos the Iranian crown jewels had been stolen or sold by the revolutionaries. Although in fact some smaller items were stolen and smuggled across Iran's borders, the bulk of the collection remained intact. This became evident when the revolutionary government under the presidency of Hashemi Rafsanjani re- opened the permanent exhibition of the Iranian crown jewels to the public in the 1990s. They remain on public display.

Also an international player, Oliveira had two coaching spells with the Portugal national team, leading them in one World Cup and one European Championship. Playing career Born in Penafiel, Porto District, Oliveira made his senior debut with FC Porto, first appearing in the Primeira Liga at the age of 18. From 1974 onwards, with the exception of one year, he always scored in double digits, netting a career-best 19 in the 1977–78 season as the northerners won the national championship after a 19-year drought. In the summer of 1979, 27-year- old Oliveira moved to La Liga with Real Betis. He returned to Porto the following transfer window due to homesickness, being an important first-team element as the latter side finished second in the league, two points behind Sporting CP.\\"O jogador era o analfabeto que não comia com talheres\\" (\\"The footballer was that illiterate who did not use cuttlery to eat\\"); Expresso, 21 March 2015 After helping hometown's F.C.

Background  The Rohingya people are an ethnic minority that live in northern Arakan, Burma (present-day Rakhine State, Myanmar), who have suffered historical persecution by the Burmese government and Buddhist majority. After General Ne Win and his Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) seized power in a coup in 1962, Rohingya political and social organisations were systematically dissolved by the government. The end of the liberation war in neighbouring Bangladesh strengthened the Burmese government's fears of \\"foreign invaders\\" infiltrating their country, and so in 1977, the government began its preparations for Operation Dragon King, which commenced at the start of the next year.  Events  The official purpose of Operation Dragon King was to register citizens in northern Arakan and expel so-called \\"foreigners\\" from the area prior to a national census.K. Maudood Elahi, \\"The Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh: Historical Perspectives and Consequences,\\" In John Rogge (ed.), Refugees: A Third World Dilemma, (New Jersey: Rowman and Littlefield), 1987, p. 231. Immigration officials and military personnel conducted the operation together, with the latter being accused by Rohingya refugees of forcibly evicting villagers through intimidation, rape and murder. The operation began on 6 February 1978, beginning in the village of Sakkipara in the Sittwe District, where there were mass round ups of civilians. In the span of over three months, approximately 200,000 to 250,000 refugees, mostly Rohingya Muslims, fled to Bangladesh. The government of Burma estimated that 150,000 fled during the operation, and proclaimed that the mass exodus signified that Rohingyas were in-fact \\"illegal immigrants\\". The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the government of Bangladesh provided emergency relief to the refugees, but were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the humanitarian crisis. Bangladesh requested assistance from the United Nations, and a UNHCR relief mission was sent to the region. On 31 July 1978, the governments of Burma and Bangladesh reached an agreement regarding the repatriation of Rohingya refugees, and 180,000 returned to Burma following the agreement.

Alongside fellow hackers Dirk Brzezinski and Peter Carl, Hess hacked into networks of military and industrial computers based in the United States, Europe and the East Asia, and sold the information to the Soviet KGB for US$54,000. During his time working for the KGB, Hess is estimated to have broken into 400 U.S. military computers. The hacked material included \\"sensitive semiconductor, satellite, space, and aircraft technologies\\".  Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory  Hess's hacking activities were discovered in 1986 by Clifford Stoll, an astronomer turned systems administrator of the computer center of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) in California. Stoll's first job duty was to track a 75-cent accounting error in the LBL system. Early in his investigation, Stoll discovered that the LBL computer system was compromised and that the hacker had obtained root, or system privileges. Such a security compromise was more important than the accounting error. Stoll eventually discovered how the hacker broke in and identified the hacker's activities on the system. LBL management considered attempting to seal off the system from this hacker, but Stoll and his colleagues convinced LBL's management that this would not be effective. Ultimately, they installed a honeypot to ensnare the hacker. = Getting in = Hess' initial activities started at the University of Bremen in Germany through the German Datex-P network via satellite link or transatlantic cable to the Tymnet International Gateway. Tymnet was a \\"gateway\\" service that a user called into that routed them to any one of a number of computer systems that also used the service. Tymnet was one of a number of services available that provided local telephone numbers, where directly accessing the computer would have been a long-distance call. Users normally used packet-switching services like Tymnet for their lower costs. Once he accessed Tymnet, Hess branched out to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California and to the Tymnet Switching System. It was through this switching system that he accessed the LBL computers. Hess was able to attack 400 U.S. military computers by using LBL to \\"piggyback\\" to ARPANET and MILNET. ARPANET was a civilian wide area network created by the Department of Defense, which would later become what is now known as the Internet. MILNET was its military counterpart. = Targets = The facilities that Hess hacked into included: * SRI International – Menlo Park, California, US * U.S. Army Darcom – Seckenheim, West Germany * Fort Buckner, Camp Foster – Okinawa, Japan * U.S. Army 24th Infantry – Fort Stewart, Georgia, US * U.S. Navy Coastal Systems Computer – Panama City, Florida, US * U.S. Air Force – Ramstein Air Base, West Germany * MIT MX Computer, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US * OPTIMIS Database – The Pentagon, US * United States Air Force Systems Command – El Segundo, California, US * Anniston Army Depot – Anniston, Alabama, US = Tracking Hess and his capture = Stoll, with the help of local authorities, traced the call to a Tymnet switch in Oakland, California. Because the call came from Oakland rather than Berkeley, it was obvious that the hacker was not working local to the university. Tymnet officials helped LBL trace the various calls, even though the hacker attempted to conceal their origin. Enlisting the aid of AT&T; and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Stoll eventually determined that the calls were being \\"piggybacked\\" across the United States, but originating from Hanover, Germany. Stoll trapped Hess by creating records of a bogus military project conducted on LBL computers; according to The Cuckoo's Egg, he and his girlfriend conceived this plan while showering, giving it the unofficial name of \\"Operation Showerhead\\". While the bogus information was convincing, the primary goal was simply to keep the hacker connected long enough to trace his connection, and with the hope that the hacker might send a written request for further information listed as available in hard copy. This simple technique worked: a request for the additional information was received from a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania address. At the time, this type of hacking was new, and it was a considerable challenge to get the cooperation of the FBI and the West German government. Eventually, the German authorities were able to break in and arrest Hess. Hess went to trial in 1990, and Stoll testified against him. Hess was found guilty of espionage and was given a 20-month suspended sentence.  Literature and films  After Hess's capture, Stoll wrote about his efforts to track and locate Hess in a technical paper \\"Stalking the Wily Hacker\\" for the journal Communications of the ACM and a book The Cuckoo's Egg for the general public. The Cuckoo's Egg was adapted into a 1990 Nova episode \\"The KGB, The Computer, and Me\\".

Early life Amer was born in Astal, Samallot, in the El Minya on 11 December 1919. After finishing grade school, he attended the Cairo Military Academy and graduated in 1938. He was commissioned into the Egyptian Army in 1939. Military career Amer in 1955 Amer served in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, took part in the 1952 Revolution and commanded the Egyptian Army in the Suez Crisis, the North Yemen Civil War and the Six-Day War. Amer played a leading role in the military coup that overthrew King Farouk in 1952 and which brought General Muhammad Naguib and Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser to power. The following year, Amer was promoted straight from major to major-general, bypassing four military ranks, and made Egypt's Chief of the General Staff.Tucker and Roberts, Encyclopedia,\\" 2008, 99. In 1956, Amer was appointed commander-in-chief of the joint military command established by Egypt and Syria. He also led Egyptian forces against both Israeli and allied British-French forces during the 1956 Suez war. After the fighting ended, Amer accused Nasser of provoking an unnecessary war and then blaming the military for the result. As Nasser's representative in Syria, Amer was detained by rebels during the 1961 Syrian coup d'état and sent back to Cairo. Amer (right) with President Gamal Abdel Nasser (center) and Speaker of Parliament Anwar Sadat (left), 1965 In March 1964, Amer was made first vice-president to Nasser and deputy supreme commander, with the power to rule for 60 days if the president was incapacitated. Amer's distinguished career came to a sudden end after Egypt's crushing defeat by Israel in the Six-Day War of June 1967. Many historians, including Hazem Kandil, have stated that much of the responsibility for the Egyptian military's failure in the 1967 war can be laid at the feet of Amer. This is because Amer's control of the Egyptian military establishment followed in line with leader Gamal Abdel- Nasser's general policy of presenting different government institutions as fiefdoms to those most loyal to him. In addition, the proxy war Egypt (with Soviet backing) fought against the Saudis, West, and Israelis in the North Yemen Civil War (1962–1970), Nasser supporting the Yemen Arab Republic against the Western and Saudi Arabian backed Royalists, is also viewed as being key to Egypt's defeat in the 1967 Middle East war; as nearly half of the Egypt's Western-trained officer-corps (mostly in Britain at Sandhurst) was in Yemen at the time of the initial Israeli attack on Egypt. When Amer heard of the fall of Abu Ageila to Israel, he panicked and ordered all units in the Sinai to retreat. This order effectively meant the defeat of Egypt. On 17 June 1967 shortly after the Six Day War ended, Amer was relieved of all his duties and forced into early retirement. Arrest and contested cause of death In August that year, Amer, along with over 50 Egyptian military officers and two former ministers, was arrested for allegedly plotting a coup to overthrow Nasser. He was kept under house arrest at his villa in Giza. According to the official Egyptian position, Amer was rushed to hospital on 13 September 1967 in an attempt to save his life after he attempted suicide by swallowing \\"a large amount of poison pills\\" upon the arrival of Egyptian officers to question him. After surviving and being taken home the next day, he managed to evade his guards and swallow more pills he kept hidden under an adhesive plaster on his leg. Later, Cairo radio announced his burial in his home village of Astal. One version of the story holds that Amer was approached at his house on 13 September by high-ranking Egyptian officers and was given a choice: to stand trial for treason, which would inevitably have ended with his conviction and execution, or to die an honorable death by taking poison. Amer chose the latter option and received a full military burial. Anwar Al Sadat, who later became President of Egypt, expressed his opinion that if he was in Amer's position, he would have done the same soon after the Six-Day War.p. 381 According to the 1999 documentary The 50 Years War: In September 2012, Amer's family filed a case to investigate his death. They claimed that he was murdered. Also, in a statement translated from Al-Masry Al-Youm published on 5 May 2015, the family lawyer cited reports confirming that Amer's death was not self-inflicted, including an interview with Anwar Sadat's widow published on 26 April of that year.Abdel Hakim Amer's family: The Field Marshal's death was murder - Egypt Independent Awards Abdel Hakim Amer was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 13 May 1964.

As the name implies, it consists of four cylindrical rods, set parallel to each other. In a quadrupole mass spectrometer the quadrupole is the mass analyzer - the component of the instrument responsible for selecting sample ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Ions are separated in a quadrupole based on the stability of their trajectories in the oscillating electric fields that are applied to the rods. Principle of operation Image from \\"Apparatus For Separating Charged Particles Of Different Specific Charges\\" Patent number: 2939952 Apparatus For Separating Charged Particles Of Different Specific Charges Jun 1960; Paul et al. The quadrupole consists of four parallel metal rods. Each opposing rod pair is connected together electrically, and a radio frequency (RF) voltage with a DC offset voltage is applied between one pair of rods and the other. Ions travel down the quadrupole between the rods. Only ions of a certain mass-to-charge ratio will reach the detector for a given ratio of voltages: other ions have unstable trajectories and will collide with the rods. This permits selection of an ion with a particular m/z or allows the operator to scan for a range of m/z-values by continuously varying the applied voltage. Mathematically this can be modeled with the help of the Mathieu differential equation. Ion path through a quadrupole Ideally, the rods are hyperbolic. Cylindrical rods with a specific ratio of rod diameter-to-spacing provide an easier-to-manufacture adequate approximation to hyperbolas. Small variations in the ratio have large effects on resolution and peak shape. Different manufacturers choose slightly different ratios to fine-tune operating characteristics in context of anticipated application requirements. In recent decades some manufacturers have produced quadrupole mass spectrometers with true hyperbolic rods. Multiple quadrupoles, hybrids and variations Hybrid quadrupole time-of- flight mass spectrometer A linear series of three quadrupoles is known as a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The first (Q1) and third (Q3) quadrupoles act as mass filters, and the middle (q2) quadrupole is employed as a collision cell. This collision cell is an RF-only quadrupole (non-mass filtering) using Ar, He, or N2 gas (~10−3 Torr, ~30 eV) for collision induced dissociation of selected parent ion(s) from Q1. Subsequent fragments are passed through to Q3 where they may be filtered or fully scanned. This process allows for the study of fragments that are useful in structural elucidation by tandem mass spectrometry. For example, the Q1 may be set to 'filter' for a drug ion of known mass, which is fragmented in q2. The third quadrupole (Q3) can then be set to scan the entire m/z range, giving information on the intensities of the fragments. Thus, the structure of the original ion can be deduced. The arrangement of three quadrupoles was first developed by Jim Morrison of LaTrobe University, Australia for the purpose of studying the photodissociation of gas-phase ions. The first triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer was developed at Michigan State University by Christie Enke and graduate student Richard Yost in the late 1970s. Quadrupoles can be used in hybrid mass spectrometers. For example, a sector instrument can be combined with a collision quadrupole and quadrupole mass analyzer to form a hybrid instrument. A mass selecting quadrupole and collision quadrupole with time-of- flight device as the second mass selection stage is a hybrid known as a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOF MS). QqTOFs are used for the mass spectrometry of peptides and other large biological polymers. A variant of the quadrupole mass analyzer called the monopole was invented by von Zahn which operates with two electrodes and generates one quarter of the quadrupole field. It has one circular electrode and one v shaped electrode. The performance is however lower than of the quadrupole mass analyzer. An enhancement to the performance of the quadrupole mass analyzer has been demonstrated to occur when a magnetic field is applied to the instrument. Manyfold improvements in resolution and sensitivity have been reported for a magnetic field applied in various orientations to a QMS. Applications These mass spectrometers excel at applications where particular ions of interest are being studied because they can stay tuned on a single ion for extended periods of time. One place where this is useful is in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry where they serve as exceptionally high specificity detectors. Quadrupole instruments are often reasonably priced and make good multi-purpose instruments. The single quadrupole mass spectrometer with electron impact ionizer is used as a standalone analyser in residual gas analyzers, real time gas analyzers, plasma diagnostics and SIMS surface analysis systems.

Campbell, who played as a striker, featured in the Premier League for Arsenal, Nottingham Forest, Everton and West Bromwich Albion. Campbell also played in the Turkish Süper Lig for Trabzonspor, and in the Football League for Leyton Orient, Leicester City and Cardiff City. Club career =Arsenal= Campbell began his career as a trainee with Arsenal, joining the club on schoolboy forms in 1985. He was prolific for Arsenal's Academy, scoring 59 goals in one season. Campbell also won the FA Youth Cup of 1988 with Arsenal. He went on to make his first-team debut against Everton on 7 May 1988, although the club's forward positions at the time were usually taken by Paul Merson and Alan Smith. Campbell came to prominence during a loan spell at Leyton Orient in 1989 when he scored 9 goals in 16 games. Campbell helped see the club to promotion during that season but didn't play in their victorious playoff final against Wrexham as his loan spell had just ended. Orient manager Frank Clark wanted to make the move permanent but Arsenal refused to sell. After a poor start to the 1989-90 season he was again loaned out, this time to Leicester City. However, in the following season he established himself in the Arsenal team, scoring eight times in ten matches during the run-in to the club's First Division title win. Despite Arsenal signing Ian Wright in September 1991, Campbell continued to feature for Arsenal, although he was often in the shadow of his more prolific partner. Nevertheless, he scored several crucial goals for Arsenal such as equalisers against Millwall and Derby County in Arsenal's victorious 1992-93 campaigns in the FA Cup and League Cup. In the 1993-94 season, he scored 19 goals, his best for the Gunners. He also featured in the victorious 1993–94 European Cup Winners' Cup campaign, scoring four goals, including one in the semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain. His form for the club waned in 1994-95, and the arrivals of forwards John Hartson and Dennis Bergkamp saw his playing time reduced. In all, Campbell played 224 times for Arsenal, scoring 60 goals. =Nottingham Forest= In the summer of 1995, Campbell was sold to Nottingham Forest for an initial fee of £2.5million, where he spent three seasons. He was part of the team that was relegated in 1997, but his 23 goals the following season helped see the Reds win the Football League Championship of 1998. =Trabzonspor= However, Campbell controversially left Forest at the end of that season to join Turkish side Trabzonspor for £2.5million, a move which caused Forest teammate Pierre van Hooijdonk to famously go \\"on strike\\". His time in Trabzon saw him leave the club in seven months after a racist incident which involved club president, Mehmet Ali Yılmaz calling him a \\"cannibal\\". He was very popular during his time at the club with the fans. To show solidarity with Campbell, the two club captains, Ogün Temizkanoğlu and Abdullah Ercan, were at his side during a press conference in which he stated his reasons for leaving the club. =Everton= Everton, who were battling against relegation from the Premier League, signed Campbell on loan in March 1999. His impact on the side was immediate as he scored nine goals in his first eight games. These feats made him Everton's top goalscorer both at home and away from Goodison Park for that season. Campbell thus almost singlehandedly saved the club from being relegated from the Premier League. His six goals of which were scored in his first three games earned him Everton's player of the month award for April, making him the first loanee to be bestowed with the title. Campbell's move to Everton was made permanent in the summer of 1999 for a fee of £3million. In the 1999-2000 season, he scored Everton's winning goal in the Merseyside derby against Liverpool at Anfield, which remains to this day Everton's last win against Liverpool away from home.http://www.evertonresults.com/liverpool.htm He ended the season as the club's top scorer, with 12 goals netted altogether. He was Everton's leading goalscorer for the following season, but only netted 4 times during the 2001-02 league campaign, a season in which Campbell was Everton captain. Campbell was once again the Toffees' top scorer during the subsequent season. After that, injuries limited his appearances for the club and he left in 2005. Campbell is Everton's fourth highest Premier League goal scorer, behind Romelu Lukaku, Duncan Ferguson and Tim Cahill, and their first ever black captain. =West Bromwich Albion= Campbell moved to West Bromwich Albion in January 2005 on a free transfer and helped the club retain its Premiership status. This endeavour marked the first time that a club that had been at the bottom of the league on Christmas Day had gone on to avoid relegation. =Cardiff City= In May 2006, after West Brom were eventually relegated to the Championship, Campbell was released by the club. He signed for Cardiff City on a free transfer on 2 August 2006. He scored in an FAW Premier Cup quarter-final match away at Carmarthen Town for Cardiff, on 13 February 2007. He also appeared, in February 2007, for City against former club West Brom. He was then released by the club in May 2007 thus bringing to an end his footballing days. International career Campbell earned four caps for the England U-21s and one for England B. He holds the record of being the English player who has scored the most goals in the Premier League without earning a senior cap for his country. In September 1992 he was on stand-by for a friendly against Spain, but this was the nearest he got to being in the senior squad.  Media career  Campbell was featured on the Sky Sports series Where are They Now? in 2008, when he was the co-owner of security company T1 Protection, specialising in supplying bodyguards to celebrities and other wealthy customers whilst travelling abroad. He also worked with Asia- based TEN Sports as a commentator for their Premier League and Champions League coverage. Personal life Campbell ran a record label, 2 Wikid, with the label's first signing being rapper Mark Morrison, who had previously topped the charts with \\"Return of the Mack\\" in 1996. But in December 2004, with the artist still signed to 2 Wikid, Campbell was forced to obtain a court injunction against rival label Jet Star, in order to prevent it from releasing Morrison's album Innocent Man. The injunction was lifted shortly afterwards The first single released by 2 Wikid was that of Panjabi MC's tune \\"Backstabbers\\", a remix of Morrison's original song, which had been released in 2004.

Complications for the baby include not getting enough oxygen which may result in death. It increases the risk of the mother getting an infection, having uterine rupture, or having post-partum bleeding. Long-term complications for the mother include obstetrical fistula. Obstructed labour is said to result in prolonged labour, when the active phase of labour is longer than 12 hours. The main causes of obstructed labour include: a large or abnormally positioned baby, a small pelvis, and problems with the birth canal. Abnormal positioning includes shoulder dystocia where the anterior shoulder does not pass easily below the pubic bone. Risk factors for a small pelvis include malnutrition and a lack of exposure to sunlight causing vitamin D deficiency. It is also more common in adolescence as the pelvis may not have finished growing by the time they give birth. Problems with the birth canal include a narrow vagina and perineum which may be due to female genital mutilation or tumors. A partograph is often used to track labour progression and diagnose problems. This combined with physical examination may identify obstructed labour. The treatment of obstructed labour may require cesarean section or vacuum extraction with possible surgical opening of the symphysis pubis. Other measures include: keeping the women hydrated and antibiotics if the membranes have been ruptured for more than 18 hours. In Africa and Asia obstructed labor affects between two and five percent of deliveries. In 2015 about 6.5 million cases of obstructed labour or uterine rupture occurred. This resulted in 23,000 maternal deaths down from 29,000 deaths in 1990 (about 8% of all deaths related to pregnancy). It is also one of the leading causes of stillbirth. Most deaths due to this condition occur in the developing world. Cause The main causes of obstructed labour include: a large or abnormally positioned baby, a small pelvis, and problems with the birth canal. Both the size and the position of the fetus can lead to obstructed labor. Abnormal positioning includes shoulder dystocia where the anterior shoulder does not pass easily below the pubic bone. A small pelvis of the mother can be a result of many factors. Risk factors for a small pelvis include malnutrition and a lack of exposure to sunlight causing vitamin D deficiency. A deficiency in calcium can also result in a small pelvis as the structures of the pelvic bones will be weak due to the lack of calcium. A relationship between maternal height and pelvis size is present and can be used to predict the possibility of obstructed labor. This relationship is a result of the mother's nutritional health throughout her life leading up to childbirth. Younger mothers are also at more risk for obstructed labor due to growth of the pelvis not being completed. Problems with the birth canal include a narrow vagina and perineum which may be due to female genital mutilation or tumors. All of these factors lead to a failure in the progress of labor. = Evolution = Obstructed labor is more common in humans than any other species and continues to be a main cause of birth complications today. Modern humans have morphologically evolved to survive as bipeds, however, bipedalism has resulted in skeletal changes that have consequently narrowed the pelvis and the birth canal. The combination of increased brain size and changes in pelvic structure are the major contributors of obstructed labor in modern humans. It is also common for obstructed labor in humans to be caused by the fetus’ broad shoulders. However, morphological shifts in pelvic structure still account for the inability of a fetus to effectively pass through the birth canal without major complications Other primates have a wider and straighter birth canal that allows a fetus to pass through more effectively. Mismatch between birth canal size and infant cranial width and length due to bipedal locomotion requirements have often been referred to as the obstetric dilemma, since compared to other great apes, modern humans have the greatest disproportion between infant cranial size and birth canal size. Shrinking of upper extremities and curvature of the spine have also affected the way modern humans give birth. Quadruped apes have longer upper limbs that allow them to reach down and pull their fetus out of the birth canal unassisted. Other primates also have a wider and straighter birth canal that allows a fetus to pass through more effectively. Modern human’s shorter upper extremities and evolution of bipedal locomotion have forced them to rely on assistance during labor. For this reason, researchers argue that assisted labor may have evolved with bipedalism. Obstructed labor has been documented as a complication of childbirth since the field of obstetrics originated. For over 1,000 years obstetricians had to forcibly remove an obstructed labor fetus to prevent the death of the mother. Prior to the existence of the cesarean section, fetuses that were obstructed had a low survival rate. Even in the 21st century, if obstructed labor is left untreated, it could result in mother and infant death. Although surgical removal of the fetus is the preferred method of managing obstructed labor, manual removal using medical tools is also common. Obstructed labor is unique to humans compared to other primates. The evolution of humans to become obligate bipedal and increase in brain size create the problems associated with obstructed labor. In order for bipedal locomotion to be possible, many changes had to occur to the skeletal structure of humans, especially in the pelvis. Both the shape and orientation of the pelvis changed. Other primates have straighter and wider pelvises compared to humans. A narrow pelvis is better for bipedal locomotion but makes childbirth more difficult. The pelvis is sexually dimorphic, with females having a wider pelvis to be better suited for childbirth. However, the female pelvis still must accommodate for bipedal locomotion which is what creates the challenges for obstructed labor. The brain size of humans has also increased as the species has evolved, resulting in a larger head of the fetus that must exit the womb. This requires human infants to be born less developed when compared to other species. The bones of the skull are not yet fused when a human infant is born in order to prevent the head from becoming too large to exit the womb. However, the head of the fetus is still large and poses the possibility for obstructed labor. Diagnosis Obstructed labour is usually diagnosed based on physical examination. Ultrasound can be used to predict malpresentation of the fetus. In examination of the cervix once labor has begun, all examinations are compared to regular cervical assessments. The comparison between the average cervical assessment and the current state of the mother allows for a diagnosis of obstructed labor. An increasingly long time in labor also indicates a mechanical issue that is preventing the fetus from exiting the womb.  Prevention  Access to proper health services can reduce the prevalence of obstructed labor. Less developed areas have inadequate health services to attend to obstructed labor, resulting in a higher prevalence among less developed area. Improving nutrition of female, both before and during pregnancy, is important for reducing the risk of obstructive labor. Creating education programs about reproduction and increasing access to reproductive services such as contraception and family planning in developing areas can also reduce the prevalence of obstructed labor. Treatment Before considering surgical options, changing the posture of the mother during labor can help to progress labor. The treatment of obstructed labour may require cesarean section or vacuum extraction with possible surgical opening of the symphysis pubis. Caesarean section is an invasive method but is often the only method that will save the lives of both the mother and the infant. Symphysiotomy is the surgical opening of the symphysis pubis. This procedure can be completed more rapidly than Caesarean sections and does not require anesthesia, making it a more accessible option in places with less advanced medical technology. This procedure also leaves no scars on the uterus which makes further pregnancies and births safer for the mother. Another important factor in treating obstructed labor is monitoring the energy and hydration of the mother. Contractions of the uterus require energy, so the longer the mother is in labor the more energy she expends. When the mother is depleted of energy, the contractions become weaker and labor will become increasingly longer. Antibiotics are also an important treatment as infection is a possible result of obstructed labor.  Prognosis  If cesarean section is obtained in a timely manner, prognosis is good. Prolonged obstructed labour can lead to stillbirth, obstetric fistula, and maternal death. Fetal death can be caused by asphyxia. Obstructed labor is the leading cause of uterine rupture worldwide. Maternal death can result from uterine rupture, complications during caesarean section, or sepsis. Epidemiology In 2013 it resulted in 19,000 maternal deaths down from 29,000 deaths in 1990. Globally, obstructed labor accounts for 8% of maternal deaths. Etymology The word dystocia means difficult labour. Its antonym is eutocia () or easy labour. Other terms for obstructed labour include: difficult labour, abnormal labour, difficult childbirth, abnormal childbirth, and dysfunctional labour. Other animals The term can also be used in the context of various animals. Dystocia pertaining to birds and reptiles is also called egg binding. In part due to extensive selective breeding, miniature horse mares experience dystocias more frequently than other breeds.

WBCX serves Hall and parts of surrounding counties in northeast Georgia, as far as northeastern metro Atlanta. History WBCX began in 1976 as an experiment, broadcasting 10 watts to the college campus and immediate area only. This was increased to 840 watts in 1986, enabling the station to reach well beyond campus. Instrumental in the station's creation were Brenau Trustee and Jacobs Media Corporation Chairman John W. Jacobs, Jr., Journalism Professor Clara Martin, and Professor James Bridwell, among others. The first WBCX student station manager hired by Brenau was Jay Andrews. Throughout the 1980s WBCX played easy listening music from a reel to reel and cartridge automation system located at the studios of WDUN radio. In 1995 the station switched to a smooth jazz format with computerized automation from the Jones Smooth Jazz Network, playing an average of 22 hours per day of satellite fed programming with a handful of local jazz and classical music shows. Scott Fugate was hired as General Manager in 2002 and WBCX started to move away from satellite programming towards live locally produced shows. In 2005, after two years of surveying the community and students for suggestions, the station took on the new label of \\"Brenau University's Eclectic 89.1 WBCX\\" - premiering 10 new \\"eclectic\\" formats grouped by mood rather than musical genre, with different moods for each day & night with a goal to reach all the diverse ages, races & cultures in the area. Free training was offered to community volunteers interested in producing their own live shows, and many new student shows were premiered over the next several years. BBC news and several syndicated shows were also added. In 2006, the majority of programming was produced in the studios at Brenau University, with live and all request shows every evening. The station's name & formats were changed once again in the fall of 2009 - changing \\"Eclectic 89.1\\" to \\"The Voice Of Brenau\\" - and eliminating the majority of live shows, as well as the jazz and classical programming. 2012 brought a new focus on WBCX by the university, which re- hired Jay Andrews to manage forward the station's programming and the school's digital technology.

Signs include retraction of the baby's head back into the vagina, known as \\"turtle sign\\". Complications for the baby may include brachial plexus injury, or clavicle fracture. Complications for the mother may include vaginal or perineal tears, postpartum bleeding, or uterine rupture. Risk factors include gestational diabetes, previous history of the condition, operative vaginal delivery, obesity in the mother, an overly large baby, and epidural anesthesia. It is diagnosed when the body fails to deliver within one minute of delivery of the baby's head. It is a type of obstructed labour. Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency. Initial efforts to release a shoulder typically include: with a woman on her back pushing the legs outward and upward, pushing on the abdomen above the pubic bone, and making a cut in the vagina. If these are not effective, efforts to manually rotate the baby's shoulders or placing the woman on all fours may be tried. Shoulder dystocia occurs in approximately 0.4% to 1.4% of vaginal births. Death as a result of shoulder dystocia is very uncommon. Signs and symptoms One characteristic of a minority of shoulder dystocia deliveries is the turtle sign, which involves the appearance and retraction of the baby's head (analogous to a turtle withdrawing into its shell), and a red, puffy face. This occurs when the baby's shoulder is obstructed by the maternal pelvis. =Complications= Fracture of both clavicles as a result of shoulder dystocia (top) – Post healing (bottom) One complication of shoulder dystocia is damage to the upper brachial plexus nerves. These supply the sensory and motor components of the shoulder, arm, and hands. The ventral roots (motor pathway) are most prone to injury. The cause of injury to the baby is debated, but a probable mechanism is manual stretching of the nerves, which in itself can cause injury. Excess tension may physically tear the nerve roots out from the neonatal spinal column, resulting in total dysfunction. Possible complications include: * Neonatal complications: Klumpke paralysis Erb's palsy Hypoxia Death Cerebral palsy * Maternal complications: Postpartum bleeding (11%) Perineal lacerations that extend into the anal sphincter Pubic symphysis separation Neuropathy of lateral femoral cutaneous nerve Uterine rupture Risk factors About 16% of deliveries where shoulder dystocia occurs have conventional risk factors. These include diabetes, fetal macrosomia, and maternal obesity. Risk factors: *Age >35 *Short in stature *Small or abnormal pelvis *More than 42 weeks gestation *Estimated fetal weight >4,500 g *Maternal diabetes (2–4 fold increase in risk) Factors which increase the risk/are warning signs: * Need for oxytocics * Prolonged first or second stage of labour * Turtle sign (head bobbing in the second stage) * Failure to restitute * No shoulder rotation or descent * Instrumental delivery For women with a previous shoulder dystocia, the risk of recurrence is at least 10%. Management The steps to treating a shoulder dystocia are outlined by the mnemonic ALARMER: *Ask for help. This involves asking for the help of an obstetrician, anesthesia, and for pediatrics for subsequent resuscitation of the infant that may be needed if the methods below fail; *L hyperflexion and abduction at the hips (McRoberts maneuver); *Anterior shoulder disimpaction (suprapubic pressure); *Rotation of the shoulder (Rubin maneuver); *M delivery of posterior arm; *Episiotomy; *Roll over on all fours. Typically the procedures are performed in the order listed and the sequence ends whenever a technique is successful. Intentional fracturing of the clavicle is another possibility at non-operative vaginal delivery prior to Zavanelli's maneuver or symphysiotomy, both of which are considered extraordinary treatment measures. Pushing on the fundus is not recommended. Simulation training of health care providers to prevent delays in delivery when a shoulder dystocia prevents is useful. =Procedures= A number of labor positions and maneuvers are sequentially performed in attempt to facilitate delivery. These include: * McRoberts maneuver; involves hyperflexing the mother's legs tightly to her abdomen. This widens the pelvis, and flattens the spine in the lower back (lumbar spine). If this maneuver does not succeed, an assistant applies pressure on the lower abdomen (suprapubic pressure), and the delivered head is also gently pulled. The technique is effective in about 42% of cases; * Suprapubic pressure (or Rubin I); * Rubin II or posterior pressure on the anterior shoulder, which would bring the baby into an oblique position with the head somewhat towards the vagina; File:ShoulderDystociaFig1.jpgStep 1: Index and middle fingers insertion with the hand opposite the baby's face File:ShoulderDystociaFig2.jpgStep 2: Baby's head slightly tilted downward with the free hand File:ShoulderDystociaFig3.jpgStep 3: Two fingers are placed on the humerus like a splint File:ShoulderDystociaFig4.jpgStep 4: Baby's hand appears under the maternal pubic symphysis, allowing the anterior arm to be delivered * Wood's screw maneuver which leads to turning the anterior shoulder to the posterior and vice versa (somewhat the opposite of Rubin II maneuver); * Jacquemier's maneuver (also called Barnum's maneuver), or delivery of the posterior shoulder first, in which the forearm and hand are identified in the birth canal, and gently pulled; *Gaskin maneuver involves moving the mother to an all fours position with the back arched, widening the pelvic outlet. More drastic maneuvers include: * Zavanelli's maneuver, which involves pushing the baby's head back in (internal cephalic replacement) followed by a cesarean section; * Intentional causing clavicular fractures, which reduces the diameter of the shoulders that requires to pass through the birth canal; * Maternal symphysiotomy, which makes the opening of the birth canal laxer by breaking the connective tissue between the two pubes bones; * Abdominal rescue, described by O'Shaughnessy, where a hysterotomy facilitates vaginal delivery of the impacted shoulder. Epidemiology Shoulder dystocia occurs in about 0.15% to 4% of term vaginal births.

Williams tube memory unit Memory pattern on SWAC Williams tube CRT The SWAC (Standards Western Automatic Computer) was an early electronic digital computer built in 1950 by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Los Angeles, California. It was designed by Harry Huskey. Overview Like the SEAC which was built about the same time, the SWAC was a small-scale interim computer designed to be built quickly and put into operation while the NBS waited for more powerful computers to be completed (in particular, the RAYDAC by Raytheon). The machine used 2,300 vacuum tubes. It had 256 words of memory, using Williams tubes, with each word being 37 bits. It had only seven basic operations: add, subtract, and multiply (single precision and double precision versions); comparison, data extraction, input and output. Several years later drum memory was added.Oral history interview with Alexandra Forsythe, Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota. When the SWAC was completed in August 1950, it was the fastest computer in the world. It continued to hold that status until the IAS computer was completed a year later. It could add two numbers and store the result in 64 microseconds. A similar multiplication took 384 microseconds. It was used by the NBS until 1954 when the Los Angeles office was closed, and then by UCLA until 1967 (with modifications). It was charged out there for $40 per hour. In January 1952, Raphael M. Robinson used the SWAC to discover five Mersenne primes—the largest prime numbers known at the time, with 157, 183, 386, 664 and 687 digits. Additionally, the SWAC was vital in doing the intense calculation required for the X-ray analysis of the structure of vitamin B12 done by Dorothy Hodgkin.Hodgkin, D.C.; Pickworth, J.; Robertson, J.H; Trueblood, K.N.; Prosen, R.J; White, J.G.

Johnson, Patricia J. Kuby: Elementary Statistics. Cengage Learning 2007, , p. 229 () The event A and its complement [not A] are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Generally, there is only one event B such that A and B are both mutually exclusive and exhaustive; that event is the complement of A. The complement of an event A is usually denoted as A′, Ac, egA or '. Given an event, the event and its complementary event define a Bernoulli trial: did the event occur or not? For example, if a typical coin is tossed and one assumes that it cannot land on its edge, then it can either land showing \\"heads\\" or \\"tails.\\" Because these two outcomes are mutually exclusive (i.e. the coin cannot simultaneously show both heads and tails) and collectively exhaustive (i.e. there are no other possible outcomes not represented between these two), they are therefore each other's complements. This means that [heads] is logically equivalent to [not tails], and [tails] is equivalent to [not heads]. Complement rule In a random experiment, the probabilities of all possible events (the sample space) must total to 1 that is, some outcome must occur on every trial. For two events to be complements, they must be collectively exhaustive, together filling the entire sample space. Therefore, the probability of an event's complement must be unity minus the probability of the event. That is, for an event A, :P(A^c) = 1 - P(A). Equivalently, the probabilities of an event and its complement must always total to 1. This does not, however, mean that any two events whose probabilities total to 1 are each other's complements; complementary events must also fulfill the condition of mutual exclusivity. =Example of the utility of this concept= Suppose one throws an ordinary six-sided die eight times. What is the probability that one sees a \\"1\\" at least once? It may be tempting to say that : Pr([\\"1\\" on 1st trial] or [\\"1\\" on second trial] or ... or [\\"1\\" on 8th trial]) := Pr(\\"1\\" on 1st trial) + Pr(\\"1\\" on second trial) + ... + P(\\"1\\" on 8th trial) := 1/6 + 1/6 + ... + 1/6. := 8/6 = 1.3333...

More than one third of the EU's budget is devoted to this policy, which aims to remove economic, social and territorial disparities across the EU, restructure declining industrial areas and diversify rural areas which have declining agriculture. In doing so, EU regional policy is geared towards making regions more competitive, fostering economic growth and creating new jobs. The policy also has a role to play in wider challenges for the future, including climate change, energy supply and globalisation. The EU's regional policy covers all European regions, although regions across the EU fall in different categories (so-called objectives), depending mostly on their economic situation. In the current 2014–2020 funding period, money is allocated differently between regions that are deemed to be \\"more developed\\" (with GDP per capita over 90% of the EU average), \\"transition\\" (between 75% and 90%), and \\"less developed\\" (less than 75%), and additional funds are set aside for member states with GNI per capita under 90 percent of the EU average in the Cohesion Fund. Between 2007 and 2013, EU regional policy consisted of three objectives: Convergence, Regional competitiveness and employment, and European territorial cooperation; the previous three objectives (from 2000–2006) were simply known as Objectives 1, 2 and 3. Approximately 32.5 percent of the EU budget 2014-2020 (equivalent to approximately EUR 351.8 billion over seven years at 2014 prices) is allocated to financial instruments which support cohesion policy. These are managed and delivered in partnership between the European Commission, the Member States and stakeholders at the local and regional level.Cohesion policy  Notion of territorial cohesion  Territorial cohesion is a European Union concept which builds on the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP).\\"European Spatial Development Perspective\\". Retrieved 7 April 2009. \\"European Spatial Planning Observation Network\\". Retrieved 7 April 2009. The main idea of territorial cohesion is to contribute to European sustainable development and competitiveness. It is intended to strengthen the European regions, promote territorial integration and produce coherence of European Union (EU) policies so as to contribute to the sustainable development and global competitiveness of the EU. Sustainable development is defined as development that \\"meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\\". The main aim of the territorial cohesion policy is to contribute to a balanced distribution of economic and social resources among the European regions with the priority on the territorial dimension. This means that resources and opportunities should be equally distributed among the regions and their populations. In order to achieve the goal of territorial cohesion, an integrative approach to other EU policies is required. The main resource of EU's territorial cohesion policy is EU's structural funds, considered to be delivered to the most deprived areas of EU. There are two structural funds: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)\\"The European Regional Development Fund\\" and the European Social Fund (ESF).\\"The European Social Fund\\" The ERDF is intended to be used for the creation of infrastructure and productive job-creating investment and it is mainly for the businesses. The ESF is meant to contribute to the integration of the unemployed populations into the work life via training measurements. Objectives thumbright400pxClassification of regions from 2014 to 2020: thumbright400pxEligibility of regions for different objectives from 2007 to 2013: =Less developed regions= By far the largest amount of regional policy funding is dedicated to the regions designated as less developed. This covers Europe's poorest regions whose per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is less than 75% of the EU average. This includes nearly all the regions of the new member states, most of Southern Italy, Greece and Portugal, and some parts of the United Kingdom and Spain. With the addition of the newest member countries in 2004 and 2007, the EU average GDP fell. As a result, some regions in the EU's \\"old\\" member states, which used to be eligible for funding under the Convergence objective, became above the 75% threshold. These regions received transitional, \\"phasing out\\" support during the previous funding period of 2007–13. Regions that used to be covered under the convergence criteria but got above the 75% threshold even within the EU-15 received \\"phasing-in\\" support through the Regional competitiveness and employment objective.Is my region covered?, European Commission Regional Policy. Accessed 11 June 2011 Funding for less developed regions, like the Convergence objective before it, aims to allow the regions affected to catch up with the EU's more prosperous regions, thereby reducing economic disparity within the European Union. Examples of types of projects funded under this objective include improving basic infrastructure, helping businesses, building or modernising waste and water treatment facilities, and improving access to high-speed Internet connections. Regional policy projects in less developed regions are supported by three European funds: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund.

The main aim of funding for these regions is to create jobs by promoting competitiveness and making the regions concerned more attractive to businesses and investors. Possible projects include developing clean transport, supporting research centres, universities, small businesses and start-ups, providing training, and creating jobs. Funding is managed through either the ERDF or the ESF.

It allows for three different types of cooperation: cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation. The objective is currently by far the least important in pure financial terms, accounting for only 2.5% of the EU's regional policy budget. It is funded exclusively through the ERDF.

Severe enlargement of the tongue can cause cosmetic and functional difficulties in speaking, eating, swallowing and sleeping. Macroglossia is uncommon, and usually occurs in children. There are many causes. Treatment depends upon the exact cause. Signs and symptoms Although it may be asymptomatic, symptoms usually are more likely to be present and more severe with larger tongue enlargements. Signs and symptoms include: * Dyspnea - difficult, noisy breathing, obstructive sleep apnea or airway obstruction * Dysphagia - difficulty swallowing and eating * Dysphonia - disrupted speech, possibly manifest as lisping * Sialorrhea - drooling * Angular cheilitis - sores at the corners of the mouth * Crenated tongue - indentations on the lateral borders of the tongue caused by pressure from teeth (\\"pie crust tongue\\") * Open bite malocclusion - a type of malocclusion of the teeth * Mandibular prognathism - enlarged mandible * Mouth breathing * Orthodontic abnormalities - including diastema and tooth spacing A tongue that constantly protrudes from the mouth is vulnerable to drying out, ulceration, infection or even necrosis. Causes Macroglossia may be caused by a wide variety of congenital and acquired conditions. Isolated macroglossia has no determinable cause. The most common causes of tongue enlargement are vascular malformations (e.g. lymphangioma or hemangioma) and muscular hypertrophy (e.g. Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia). Enlargement due to lymphangioma gives the tongue a pebbly appearance with multiple superficial dilated lymphatic channels. Enlargement due to hemihyperplasia is unilateral. In edentulous persons, a lack of teeth leaves more room for the tongue to expand into laterally, which can create problems with wearing dentures and may cause pseudomacroglossia. Amyloidosis is an accumulation of insoluble proteins in tissues that impedes normal function.Merck Manual 17th Ed. This can be a cause of macroglossia if amyloid is deposited in the tissues of the tongue, which gives it a nodular appearance. Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome is a rare hereditary condition, which may include other defects such as omphalocele, visceromegaly, gigantism or neonatal hypoglycemia. The tongue may show a diffuse, smooth generalized enlargement. The face may show maxillary hypoplasia causing relative mandibular prognathism. Apparent macroglossia can also occur in Down syndrome. The tongue has a papillary, fissured surface. Macroglossia may be a sign of hypothyroid disorders. Other causes include mucopolysaccharidosis, neurofibromatosis, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B, myxedema, acromegaly, angioedema, tumors (e.g. carcinoma), Glycogen storage disease type 2,http://moon.ouhsc.edu/kfung/jty1/neurohelp/ZNN0IE23.htm Simpson-Golabi- Behmel syndrome, Triploid Syndrome, trisomy 4p, fucosidosis, alpha- mannosidosis, Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Ras pathway disorders, transient neonatal diabetes, and lingual thyroid. Diagnosis Macroglossia is usually diagnosed clinically. Sleep endoscopy and imaging may be used for assessment of obstructive sleep apnea. The initial evaluation of all patients with macroglossia may involve abdominal ultrasound and molecular studies for Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome. =Classification= The ICD-10 lists macroglossia under \\"other congenital malformations of the digestive system\\". Definitions of macroglossia have been proposed, including \\"a tongue that protrudes beyond the teeth during [the] resting posture\\" and \\"if there is an impression of a tooth on the lingual border when the patients slightly open their mouths\\". Others have suggested there is no objective definition of what constitutes macroglossia. Some propose a distinction between true macroglossia, when histologic abnormalities correlate with the clinical findings of tongue enlargement, and relative macroglossia, where histology does not provide a pathologic explanation for the enlargement. Common examples of true macroglossia are vascular malformations, muscular enlargement and tumors; whilst Down syndrome is an example of relative macroglossia. Pseudomacryglossia refers to a tongue that is of normal size but gives a false impression of being too large in relation to adjacent anatomical structures. The Myer classification subdivides macroglossia into generalized or localized. Treatment Treatment and prognosis of macroglossia depends upon its cause, and also upon the severity of the enlargement and symptoms it is causing. No treatment may be required for mild cases or cases with minimal symptoms. Speech therapy may be beneficial, or surgery to reduce the size of the tongue (reduction glossectomy). Treatment may also involve correction of orthodontic abnormalities that may have been caused by the enlarged tongue. Treatment of any underlying systemic disease may be required, e.g. radiotherapy. Epidemiology Macroglossia is uncommon, and usually occurs in children. Macroglossia has been reported to have a positive family history in 6% of cases. The National Organization of Rare Disorders lists macroglossia as a rare disease (less than 200 000 individuals in the US).

After her death circa 727, however, little is historically known of the monastery until the Norman Conquest. It is known that the priory was inhabited by monks until after the Norman conquest. In the 12th century, the abbey was replaced by a Cluniac priory for men. Just after 1200 Prior Humbert obtained various grants from King Henry III, an occasional guest at the Priory, who imported his own wines to be stored there. The grants enabled the building of a newer, larger church. Following the reformation of the monastery, in the early 14th century, the priory church was lavishly and completely rebuilt, and today considerable remains are left of the , including the north and south transept and the nave. Around the Priory, the town of Much Wenlock was formed. The town is made up of a small network of intricate, narrow streets lined with timber- framed black and white buildings. Within the town is the well of St Milburga of Wenlock which was said to have cured sight impairments and helped Victorian women find a suitor. =Dissolution= Following the dissolution in 1540, several buildings, including the late 15th-century Prior's House, were converted into a private residence later known as \\"Wenlock Abbey\\".

Designed originally by Robert Smith, the building was subsequently remodeled by notable American architects Benjamin Latrobe, after the 1802 fire, and John Notman, after the 1855 fire. In the early years of Princeton University, Nassau Hall accommodated classrooms, a library, a chapel, and residential space for students and faculty.

Three cannonballs were fired, but only two made contact. One glanced off the south side of the building; the damage can still be seen today. Another cannonball flew through a window in the Faculty Room and \\"decapitated\\" King George's portrait. The cannonball was said to have come from a gun in the artillery company commanded by Alexander Hamilton, who had been rejected by Princeton when he first came to the colonies. The result of the battle was a decisive Patriot victory, and Nassau Hall was retaken by the Americans. The Congress of the Confederation convened in Nassau Hall for a little more than four months (from June 30, 1783, to November 4, 1783). The normal location in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had to be vacated because of a mutiny by Continental Army soldiers. Starting in 1869, each graduation class adds a new sprig of ivy to grow up the walls of the building. The first U.S. commemorative postage stamp printed on colored paper honored Nassau Hall on its bicentennial. It depicted a front view of Nassau Hall. It was denominated at the first class rate of 3 cents and was on orange paper. It was first issued at Princeton, New Jersey, on September 22, 1956. Princeton's alma mater Side view The song Old Nassau was adopted as Princeton University's alma mater (school song) in 1859. The lyrics were written by Harlan Page Peck, a member of Princeton's class of 1862, and first published in the March 1859 issue of Nassau Literary Magazine. The music, originally to be set to the tune of Auld Lang Syne, proved unworkable, and Karl A. Langlotz, a professor of music at Princeton who had studied composition under Franz Liszt,The Princeton Cemetery of the Nassau Presbyterian Church.

A Princeton Companion (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1978). Website accessed 15 January 2007. Architecture As described in 1760 in the New American Magazine, \\"The simple interior design is shown in the plan, where a central corridor provided communication with the students' chambers and recitation rooms, the entrances, and the common prayer hall; and on the second floor, with the library over the central north entrance. The prayer hall was two stories high, measured 32 by 40 feet, and had a balcony at the north end which could be reached from the second-story entry. Partially below ground level, though dimly lighted by windows, was the cellar, which served as kitchen, dining area (beneath the prayer hall), and storeroom. In all there were probably forty rooms for the students, not including those added later in the cellar when a moat was dug to allow additional light and air into that dungeon.\\" On March 6, 1802, a fire devastated the interior of the hall, leaving only the exterior walls standing and destroying nearly all contents including 2,900 out of the library's 3,000 books. Benjamin H. Latrobe, the first architect professionally trained in the United States and known for his work in the Federal style, oversaw the reconstruction and refused his share of the $42,000 that had been raised for the effort.Bennicoff, Tad. \\"A Brief History of Nassau Hall.\\" Seeley G.

Reconstruction was carried out by John Notman of Philadelphia in his characteristic Italian Renaissance style, adding an often-criticized cupola and towers along with engineering improvements. Many of his architectural flourishes were removed in later renovations.

It contained a mixture of dimethylarsinic acid (also known as cacodylic acid) and its related salt, sodium cacodylate and water. Largely inspired by the British use of herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency, killing rice was a military strategy from the very start of US military involvement in Vietnam. At first, US soldiers attempted to blow up rice paddies and rice stocks, using mortars and hand grenades. But grains of rice were far more durable than they understood, and were not easily destroyed. Every grain that survived was a seed, to be collected and planted again. In a report to the International War Crimes Tribunal (founded by Bertrand Russell) at the end of 1967, it was stated that: \\"The soldiers discovered that rice is one of the most maddeningly difficult substances to destroy; using thermite metal grenades it is almost impossible to make it burn and, even if one succeeds in scattering the rice, this does not stop it being harvested by patient men. So they went to a bigger and better option that will actually kill off the paddies. The purpose of Agent Blue was narrow-leaf plants and trees (grass, rice, bamboo, banana, etc.) \\"Operation Ranch Hand\\", was military code for spraying of herbicides from U.S. Air Force aircraft in Southeast Asia from 1962 through 1971.Major William A. Buckingham, Jr. The widespread use of herbicides in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War was a unique military operation in that it was meant to kill the plants that provided cover. The continued use of Agent Blue, one of the \\"Rainbow Herbicides\\", by the United States was primarily meant as an operation to take away the enemy's advantage on the terrain as well as deprive them of food. Between 1962 and 1971, the US used an estimated 20 million gallons of herbicides as chemical weapons for \\"defoliation and crop destruction\\" which fell mostly on the forest of South Vietnam, but was eventually used in Laos as well to kill crops in order to deprive the communist Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops of food. It was sprayed on rice paddies and other crops in an attempt to deprive the Viet Cong of the valuable crops the plants provided. Unable to control the Viet Cong's access to food supplies or their grassroots village support, the US military response was simple: If you can't control it, kill it. Agent Blue is a mixture of two arsenic-containing compounds: sodium cacodylate and cacodylic acid. Agent Blue is chemically unrelated to the more infamous Agent Orange and other herbicides used during the war. Agent Blue affects plants by causing them to dry out. As rice is highly dependent on water to live, using Agent Blue on these paddies can destroy an entire field and leave it unsuitable for further planting. This is why Agent Blue was also used where food was not a factor, but the foliage was. The Vietcong had an advantage while fighting in Vietnam because they were used to the abundance of plant life on the battlefield. The US found themselves at a disadvantage and based on the precedent set by the British in Malaya, decided that the best retaliation would be to take the Vietcong's advantage away from them by removing their cover. Along roads, canals, railroads, and other transportation networks, Ranch Hand cleared several hundred yards using the herbicides to make ambushes more difficult for their enemies. In Laos, the herbicide removed the jungle canopy from the roads and trails used for infiltrating men and supplies, making them more vulnerable to attack from the air. Approximately 4 million gallons of Agent Blue were used in Vietnam during the war. From 1965 on the Ansul Chemical Company delivered the herbicide Phytar 560 with the 26.4% sodium cacodylate and 4.7% cacodylic acid in water. Today, large quantities of the chemical named Agent Blue are still used on lawns and crops throughout the USA. Taken from ZNet Ecology in 1983: “It has been over twelve years since the last herbicide mission that was done.

The theory stresses that societies are divided into competing economic classes whose relative political power is determined by the nature of the economic system. In the writing of American history the term is associated with historian Charles A. Beard (1874–1948), who was not a Marxist but who emphasized the long-term political contest between bankers and business interest on the one hand, and agrarian interests on the other.Peter J. Coleman, \\"Beard, McDonald, and Economic Determinism in American Historiography,\\" Business History Review (1960) 34#1 pp. 113–121 in JSTOR Relation to Marxist philosophy According to Marx, each social mode of production produces the material conditions of its reproduction, that is, ideology (which gathers all the political, law and cultural spheres). Thus, ideology permits the mode of production to reproduce itself. Marx did not believe that the same economic rules governed all of history, but that each new era brought with it new economic factors.K. Marx (1952). Capital, (S. Moore and E. Aveling, Trans., F. Engels, Ed.). In R. M. Hutchins (Ed.), Marx (1st ed., Vol. 50, Great Books of the Western World, p. 10). Chicago, Illinois: Encyclopaedia Britannica. (Original work published 1883) Furthermore, Marx and Engels are said to have believed, should a revolutionary force change the mode of production, the dominant class will immediately set out to create a new society to protect this new economic order.Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels, \\"The German Ideology,\\" from Selected Writings, p. 120 In the modernity of their era, Marx and Engels felt the propertied class had essentially accomplished the establishment of a new societal and economic order, instinctively creating a society protective of their capitalist interests. They made this statement to the Bourgeoisie in the Communist Manifesto: \\"Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class, made into law for all, a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economic conditions of the existence of your class.\\"Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Communist Manifesto, p. 35 Marx also believed that the same ideas could not grow out of just any economic system:'Don Quixote long ago paid the penalty for wrongly imagining that knight-errantry was compatible with all economical forms of society.'Marx, Capital, Footnote 2, p. 36 The young Marx hence criticized man's alienation. \\"Vulgar Marxism\\" has considered that the relation between the economical infrastructure and the ideological superstructure was a unicausal one, and thus believed in economic determinism. Criticism Other Marxists and Marx-scholars—including Eduard Bernstein, Gerald Hubmann, György Lukács, Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, Maurice Godelier, Franz Jakubowski, Edward P. Thompson and Michael Lowy—completely reject the interpretation of Marx and Engels as \\"economic determinists\\". They claim this idea is based on a poor and selective reading of Marx and Engels' work. They argue that this interpretation originated in the early years of the Second International and was popularised by Karl Kautsky and Nikolai Bukharin, among others. They refer to the disclaimers by Engels (see historical materialism) to the effect that while Marx and himself had focused a lot on the economic aspects, they were very aware that this did not in fact constitute the totality of society or of social life. In Socialism: Utopian and Scientific Engels notes how the same material conditions and class situation led to different political situations in Britain as that society tried to adapt to the results of the French Revolution and other external events. Richard Wolff also notes that Marx studied things he thought under appreciated by mainstream academia but did not proclaim or think their theories to be irrelevant.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFHVWBKrgZY&t;=633s However, some have viewed Engels' claim to not being an economic determinist as an attempt to extricate himself from an untenable position: Max Weber and other influential sociological and economic thinkers agreed that Marx's views were really unidimensional in regard to economic determinism. They did not believe that economic determinism was a vulgar interpretation of Marx, but regarded this to be the explicitly stated and true interpretation of Marx. They criticized the perceived simplicity in Marx's arguments and held that ideas and cultural beliefs and values determine societal progress and the evolution of society. (See Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905). The dynamic of history according to Marx was shaped precisely by clash of interests determined by material conditions, like inequalities between clearly separate groups (class struggle), and that clash could not be understood simply in terms of economic self-interest, because it also involved human needs, customs, traditions, morals and values encompassing a whole way of life. On the other hand, Lenin wrote that \\"an idea that captures the minds of the masses becomes a material force,\\" meaning that the said needs, customs, traditions, morals and values can be equated to economic forces. The end result of economic determinism in this view is both economism (a narrow focus on how people earn their livelihood) and economic reductionism (the attempt to reduce a complex social reality to one factor—the economic—such that this one factor causes all other aspects of society). Notable economic determinists American geostrategist Thomas P. M. Barnett describes himself as an economic determinist in his book The Pentagon's New Map.

It is non-migratory and shares the island with its smaller relative the green-backed firecrown (S. sephaniodes). Description Adult female This species arguably shows the greatest degree of sexual dimorphism found among hummingbirds. Unlike in most hummingbirds, where females simply lack the ornamental plumage of the males, in S. fernandensis they are also brilliantly-colored, but differ so much from males that in the 19th century they were thought to be different species until a nest was discovered with one of each sex. The male is 11.5–12 cm long and weighs 10.9 g. Its color is mostly cinnamon orange, excepting dark grey wings, black bill, and iridescent gold crown. The female is 10 cm long and weighs 6.8 g. Its underparts are white with a dappling of very small green and black areas; the crown is iridescent blue, and upperparts are blue-green. Ecology The extinct subspecies Sephanoides fernandensis leyboldi This medium-sized bird inhabits forests, thickets, and gardens. In summer, males are frequently seen in the island's only town, San Juan Bautista, feeding on the \\"cabbage tree\\" (Dendroseris litoralis) which likewise is a critically endangered species. The female lays two white eggs in a small cup-shaped nest typically 3–4 m above ground, nearly always in Chilean myrtle (Luma apiculata). The food of this species is nectar, often taken from the flowers of native Juan Bueno (Rhaphithamnus venustus) and D. litoralis. It also feeds on introduced Eucalyptus and Abutilon. Both sexes defend their foraging territories. This hummingbird is also insectivorous. The call of the male is a loud, raspy staccato of rising and falling pitch. =Status and conservation= The population of this species has been in a general decline for years. A census made in October 2002 revealed fewer than 200 individual birds and of these only 60 females, although scientifically sound census methods have not yet been used to provide a reliable figure. The species is ranked Critically Endangered by Birdlife International. A conservation effort was begun in 2004 by a partnership of several organizations (The Hummingbird Society, American Bird Conservancy, and Juan Fernández Islands Conservancy, Oikonos - Ecosystem Knowledge) with the aim of preventing extinction of the species. Contributing factors to the decline in population include destruction of native flora by man; invasion of exotic zarzamora blackberry (Rubus ulmifolius) and maqui wineberry (Aristotelia chilensis), particularly by reducing the extent of the luma trees used for nesting; predation by domestic and feral cats; and erosion by actions of introduced rabbits and goats.

OSS was best known for their enhanced versions of Atari BASIC and the MAC/65 assembler (both of which are much faster than Atari's products) and the Action! programming language. OSS transitioned to other platforms with Personal Pascal for the Atari ST and Personal Prolog for Macintosh (which was also advertised for the Atari ST, but may not have been released). OSS was not as significant in those markets.  History  Optimized Systems Software was formed in early 1981 by Bill Wilkinson, Mike Peters, Paul Laughton, and Kathleen O'Brien. Laughton, the primary author of Atari BASIC, was still employed by Atari, Inc. at the time, and had permission to be involved with OSS from his manager. O'Brien wrote the Atari Assembler Editor for Atari. Laughton and O'Brien (married) were not as involved with the company and were bought out by Peters and Wilkinson. OSS purchased Atari BASIC, Atari DOS, and the Atari Assembler Editor product from Shepardson Microsystems who had concluded that their BASIC and DOS products were not viable. The new company enhanced the products, renaming them OS/A+ (the Disk Operating System), BASIC A+ (a disk-based language), and EASMD (an update to the Assembler Editor). OSS continued to work with Atari (who had previously contracted with SMI) on enhanced products, most of which never reached the market. OSS debuted at the West Coast Computer Faire, March 1981. Their products released over the next several years became respected among Atari programmers, particularly the MAC/65 assembler, the Action! programming language, and BASIC XL. In a 1984 interview, Bill Wilkinson said the company consisted of 15 people. In January 1988, OSS merged with ICDmakers of SpartaDOS and Atari computer hardware add-ons. In 1994, Fine Tooned Engineering obtained limited rights to ICD's 8-bit products before disappearing. Disk Operating Systems = OS/A+ = Atari DOS 2.0S consisted of two portions, a memory-resident portion that facilitated access to disk files by programs, and a disk-resident portion providing menu-driven utilities to format, copy, delete, rename, and otherwise manipulate files on Atari's 810 disk drive. The menu system was too large to keep memory-resident, but the necessity to reload the menu system after every program was frustrating to many users. * OS/A+ 2.0, 2.1 was a disk-based replacement for the Atari DOS and the Apple II DOS. It replaced the menu- driven utilities with a compact command line approach similar to CP/M (and later, MS-DOS). The command line was small enough to remain in memory with most applications, removing the need for the dreaded post-program reload. When first introduced at the West Coast Computer Faire, the program was named CP/A, but a lawyer from Digital Research (owners of CP/M) visited the booth and the name was changed. OSS couldn't have afforded even a court filing fee. * OS/A+ 4.1 OSS extended the successful OS/A+ product with additional capabilities for version 4, many of which were arguably ahead of their time. For example, the strict \\"8.3\\" naming scheme (eight alphanumeric characters with a three character extension) was replaced by \\"long\\" filenames, similar to the Microsoft DOS transition to VFAT in 1995. However, unlike VFAT, OS/A+ 4.1 disks were not backward compatible with earlier systems; Atari DOS or OS/A+ 2.1 could not read disks formatted by OS/A+ 4.1, breaking backward compatibility. The memory footprint was larger as well, resulting in insufficient memory to run some popular applications. As a result of these drawbacks, OS/A+ 4.1 did not achieve the market penetration as the earlier product. OSS did reissue OS/A+ 4.1 for a brief period when they decided not to modify DOS XL for double-sided disk support. = DOS XL = DOS XL was designed to replace OS/A+. Included support for single and double-density disk drives. Utilized the command-prompt of OS/A+ but also included a menu program. Featured extensions that took advantage of unused memory space in Atari XL/XE computers and OSS supercartridges. Included support for Indus GT Synchromesh. Due to lack of demand and Atari working on a new version of DOS, OSS decided to halt development of DOS XL 4 and reissue OS/A+ version 4.1. BASIC While at Shepherdson Microsystems, the team had developed Atari BASIC. As OSS, they developed three BASIC interpreters. = BASIC A+ = Atari BASIC had been designed to fit in a single 8K cartridge, with an optional second cartridge adding additional capability (the Atari 800 home computer featured two cartridge slots). However, the second cartridge was never produced. Instead, OSS produced a disk-based product called BASIC A Plus (or BASIC A+), which was compatible with Atari BASIC but corrected several bugs and added quite a few features. Among the notable features were PRINT USING (for formatted output), trace and debug enhancements, direct DOS commands, and explicit support for the Atari computers' exceptional graphics hardware. Because BASIC A+ had to be purchased, programs developed using its extended features could not be shared with people who did not own the interpreter. = BASIC XL = A bank-selected cartridge version of the language that replaced BASIC A+. It fixed bugs and added even more commands and features. The BASIC XL Toolkit contains additional code and examples for use with the BASIC XL language. Included a runtime package for redistribution. No compiler was available. A significant change in BASIC XL concerned the handling of line number lookups in GOTO/GOSUB and FOR...NEXT loops. In Atari BASIC, any GOTO had to search the entire program for the provided line number, and FOR...NEXT loops used the same code. In contrast, Microsoft BASIC included a small additional bit of logic that could search forward from the current line number for a small boost in performance, but much more importantly, used the address of the FOR line rather than its line number when performing NEXT, offering an enormous performance boost. These two differences made MS BASIC much faster than Atari in the common case where the program used a number of loops. To address this, and leapfrog MS, BASIC XL included the new FAST command. When encountered in a program, the language searched the entire program looking for instances of GOTO/GOSUB with a simple line number (as opposed to a formula that returned a number) and replaced it with the address of the line. It did the same for NEXT statements. This offered a huge performance boost, making loops run as fast as MS, and the program as a whole even faster. The downside is that the address became invalid if the program was edited during runtime and it could not be CONTinued, unlike Atari BASIC which generally allowed this after any edit, but this had always been the case in MS anyway. Antic in 1984 stated that \\"BASIC XL is the fastest and most powerful version of BASIC available for Atari computers\\", with \\"exceptional\\" documentation. The magazine concluded that \\"This is the language that should be built into Atari computers. Is anyone at Atari listening?\\" = BASIC XE = An enhanced version of the BASIC XL bank- selected cartridge, with additional functions and high-speed math routines. Because it required 64KB, it would only run on an XL/XE system. No compiler or runtime was made available. The BASIC XL runtime could be used, but restricted to only XL functions. Assemblers = EASMD = EASMD (Edit/ASseMble/Debug) is the first editor/assembler from OSS. Based on the original Atari Assembler Editor, it was released in 1981 on disk. It was superseded by MAC/65. = MAC/65 = MAC/65 is 6502 editor/assembler originally released on disk in 1982, then on a bank-switched \\"supercartridge\\" in 1983 which included an integrated debugger (DDT). Like Atari BASIC, MAC/65 used line-numbered source code and tokenized each line as it was entered. It was significantly faster than Atari's assemblers. The MAC/65 Toolkit disk contains additional code and examples. = BUG/65 = A machine language debugger. It was initially included with MAC/65, but the cartridge-based version of the assembler added its own debugger, DDT. BUG/65 was later added to DOS XL. Other languages = Action! = A cartridge-based development system for a readable ALGOL-like language that compiles to efficient 6502 code. Action! combines a full-screen editor with a compiler that generates code directly to memory without involving disk access. The language found a niche for being over a hundred times faster than Atari BASIC, but much easier to program in than assembly language. Compiled Action! programs require the cartridge to be present, because standard library functions are on the cartridge. The separately available Action! Run-Time Package overcomes this limitation and allows distribution of Action!-compiled projects. The Action! Toolkit (originally called the Programmer's Aid Disk, or PAD) contains additional code and examples for use with the Action! language. = C/65 = A compiler developed by LightSpeed Software for a subset of the C programming language. C/65 outputs assembly source code. An assembler like MAC/65 is needed to create an executable file. =Tiny C= Tiny C, stylized as tiny-c, is an interpreter for a subset of the C programming language developed by Tiny C Associates. = Personal Pascal = A one-pass, machine code generating compiler for the Pascal language developed by J. Lohse for the Atari ST and released by OSS in 1987. It came with a 500+ page manual. Applications = The Writer's Tool = A word processing application available in a bank-selected cartridge and a double-sided disk (master disk on one side, dictionary disk on the other side). It was developed by Madison Micro and published by OSS in 1984. According to Bill Wilkinson, OSS was already building a word processor, but stopped when The Writer's Tool was submitted. = SpeedRead+ = A speed reading tutor the Atari 8-bit and Apple II computers.  Sales  According to Bill Wilkinson, OSS sold about 12,000 copies of Basic XL before the ICD merger. Basic XL outsold Action! by about 2.5 or 3 to 1. MAC/65 outsold Action! by about 1.5 to 1. Basic XE sold poorly, a money-loser. Personal Pascal sold over 10,000 copies.  References  ;Notes * Wilkinson, Bill (1983). The Atari BASIC Source Book. Compute!

A zone defense can be used in many sports where defensive players guard players on the other team. Zone defenses and zone principles are commonly used in basketball, American football, association football, ice hockey, lacrosse, Australian rules football, netball and ultimate among others. Basketball The names given to zone defenses start with the number of players on the front of the zone (farthest from the goal) followed by the numbers of players in the rear zones. For example, in a 2–3 zone two defenders cover areas in the top of the zone (near the top of the key) while three defenders cover areas near the baseline. Match-up zone is a hybrid man-to-man and zone defense in which players apply man-to-man defense to whichever opposing player enters their area. John Chaney, former head coach of Temple University, is the most famous proponent of this defense. Hybrid defenses also include Box-and-one, in which four defenders are in a 2–2 zone and one defender guards a specific player on the offense. A variant of this is triangle-and-two, in which three defenders are in a 2–1 zone and two defenders guard two specific offensive players. Zone defenses are common in international, college, and youth competition. In the National Basketball Association, zone defenses were prohibited until the 2001–2002 season, and most teams do not use them as a primary defensive strategy. The NBA has a defensive three-second violation rule, which makes it more difficult for teams to play zone, since such defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration.http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/nba/defensive-three- second-violation.aspx The Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle are an example of an NBA team that have regularly used zone defenses. =History of basketball zone defense= Frank Lindley, Newton, KS High School basketball coach from 1914 to 1945, was among the first to use the zone defense and other innovations in the game and authored numerous books about basketball. He finished his career with a record of 594–118 and guided the Railroaders to ten state titles and seven second-place finishes. Jim Boeheim, coach of the Syracuse Orange men's basketball team, is famous for using a 2-3 zone that is among the best in the NCAA. His zone, which typically features athletic, disruptive, and aggressive defenders, has become a prototype for use on other teams including the United States men's national basketball team, where he has spent time as an assistant coach. =Advantages= Some of the reasons for using a zone defense are: * The opposing team has a player/players too quick (in the case of guards) or too big (in the case of forwards or centers) for a man-to-man defense to be effective. * Many zones pack defenders in the lane but allow the offensive team to take long-range shots. If the opponents are poor long-range shooters, a zone can be very effective. * Unless trapping is involved, zone defenses typically do not involve aggressive pressure on the ball handler and allow the offensive team to easily pass the ball around the perimeter. This can allow the offense to use more time before a shot is attempted, an advantage for teams wanting to slow the tempo of a game. * A poor defensive player can often be \\"hidden\\" in a zone because teammates can more easily help if he or she is beaten. * A zone can help players in danger of fouling out by taking pressure off them. * Playing a zone is less tiring and thus can help teams suffering from fatigue. * To prevent easy scores when the ball is in-bounded under the basket. * Against teams with inexperienced guards, trapping zones can disrupt the offense and force turnovers =Disadvantages= Playing a zone entails some risks. * Zones tend to be weak on the perimeter, so they are not very effective against teams with good outside shooters. * Zones have gaps (areas that are not well-covered by defenders) that can be exploited by teams that pass well or have guards capable of penetrating the zone. * If a team is behind in the game, playing a zone can be a poor strategy because zones usually allow the offense to take more time off the clock on each possession, which limits the time remaining for the losing team to reduce the lead. It also reduces the chances of stealing the ball from the attackers and attempting a quick counterstrike across open field. This is not always true; there are pressure zone defenses that can often cause quicker shots by the opponent or result in turnovers. * When a shot is attempted, it is often harder for players in a zone to find counterparts to box out for the rebound, which sometimes results in an offensive player getting an easy offensive rebound. * Zone defenses require a commitment to scheming and practicing zone, both from coaches and players. While most players are familiar with playing zone defense, they are sometimes not expert in the nuances of the zone, such as spacing, which require familiarity and experience. When man-to-man teams switch to the zone defense, it is sometimes seen as a gimmick that is easily exploited by disciplined teams. =Attacking a zone defense= While strategies for countering zone defenses vary and often depend on the strengths and weaknesses of both the offensive and defensive teams, there are some general principles that are typically used by offensive teams when facing a zone. * Many popular zones (such as the 2–3, 3-2 and 1–2–2) have a gap in the middle of the lane. Getting the ball in this area can be very effective because the defense is often forced to \\"collapse\\" on the ball handler, freeing up other players for open shots. To exploit this gap, many teams assign a forward to operate in the \\"high post\\" area near the free throw line to catch and distribute the ball. A forward in the high post area can also set screens on the players at the top of the zone to allow penetration by the guards. * Quick passing is an important element of attacking any zone. The defense will shift as the ball moves, but if the offense can move the ball faster than the defense can react, open shots can result. Quick passing against a zone often leads to open three- point shots, and zone defenses are less effective against teams with good three-point shooters. * Dribble penetration is very effective in breaking down a zone. If a guard can dribble into the gaps in the zone, multiple defenders must converge on the ball. The ball handler can then often pass to an open teammate for a shot. This strategy illustrates why preventing dribble penetration is important in playing an effective zone defense. * Passing the ball to the interior of the zone can have similar effects as dribble penetration: as the defense collapses, a quick kick-out to the perimeter can result in either an open shot or continued quick passing, as the defense is now imbalanced. * Short Corner: Attacking the \\"Short Corner\\", or baseline area behind the defense outside the lane, against a 2-3 zone puts the defense in rotation and opens up the mid post. * Screening the backside of the zone: this opens up weakside shooters off a skip pass or ball rotation. American football A zone defense in American football is a type of \\"pass coverage\\". See American football defensive strategy and zone blocking. Australian rules football The zone defence tactic, borrowed from basketball, was introduced into Australian football in the late 1980s by Robert Walls and revolutionized the game. It was used most effectively by Essendon Football Club coach Kevin Sheedy. The tactic is used from the fullback kick in after a behind is scored. The side in opposition to the player kicking in places their forward players, including their full-forward and centre half forward, in evenly spaced zones in the back 50-metre arc. This makes it easier for them to block leading players and forces the kick-in to be more precise, in effect increasing the margin for error which can cause a turnover and another shot at goal. As a result, the best ways to break the zone are for the full-back to bomb it long (over 50 meters), often requiring a low percentage torpedo punt, or to play a short chipping game out of defence and then to switch play as opposition players break the zone. The latter has negated the effectiveness of the tactic since the 1990s. Another kick-in technique is the huddle, often used before the zone, which involves all of the players from the non-kicking team huddling together and then breaking in different directions. The kicker typically aims in whichever direction the designated target (typically the ruckman) runs in. Ice hockey In ice hockey, players defend zones in the neutral zone trap and left wing lock. Lacrosse In lacrosse, a zone defense is not as often as the normal man defense. It has been used effectively at the D-III level by schools such as Wesleyan University. They almost always use a 6-man “backer” zone, where they have three guys up top and three guys down low and they try to stay in their zone and not rotate as much as possible. When teams are man down, many teams employ a “box and one” zone defense, where the four outside players stay in their designated zone while the fifth player follows the ball while staying on the crease man. Netball Netball is a sport similar to basketball with similar strategies and tactics employed, although with seven players per team. Zone defense is one of the main defensive strategies employed by teams, along with one-on-one defense. Common variants include center-court block, box-and-two zone, diamond-and-two zone, box-out zone and split-circle zone. Ultimate Ultimate allows for a number of zone defence tactics, usually employed in poor (such as windy, rainy or snowy) conditions, to discourage long passes and slow the progress of the opposition's movement.

The tropical rain belt is an area of active rain that is positioned mostly around the tropics. According to the website Journey North, the reason the rain belt is situated near the tropics can be attributed to the fact that most of the sun's radiation is directed toward the equator, which is located in the middle of the tropics. This solar radiation generates large amounts of heat near the equator providing tropical regions with higher temperatures than most other regions on Earth. With all this solar radiation, the air around the tropics begins to warm up. Because hot air is less dense than cold air, the hot air rises into the upper levels of the atmosphere and as a result, cold air filters down into the lower levels of the atmosphere. The dynamics that provide the tropics with the rain belt are founded on the principle that warmer air is able to retain more moisture than colder air. When the colder air replaces the warmer air in the lower atmosphere, the abundant moisture from the tropics loses the ability to be stored in the atmosphere. As a result, the excess moisture that cannot be held by the colder air is then turned into thunderstorms and rain showers. These thunderstorms and rain showers are usually located along the equator, but they will extend out to the Tropic of Cancer, which is the 23.5 north latitude, as well as the Tropic of Capricorn, which is the 23.5 south latitude. It is largely a manifestation of the ITCZ (pronounced \\"itch\\").ITCZ The tropical rain belt lies in the southern hemisphere of the Indian ocean and western Pacific ocean roughly from October to March, and during this time the northern tropics experience a dry season in which precipitation is very rare, and days are typically hot and sunny throughout. From April to September, the rain belt lies in the northern hemisphere, and a wet season occurs there, while the southern tropics experience their dry season. The rain belt reaches roughly as far north as the Tropic of Cancer and as far south as the Tropic of Capricorn in the western Pacific Ocean. Its variation in the Western Hemisphere is minimal, roughly between the equator and the 15th parallel north latitude. Near these latitudes, there is one wet season and one dry season annually. On the equator, there are two wet and two dry seasons as the rain belt passes over twice a year, one moving north and one moving south. Between the tropics and the equator, locations may experience both a short wet and a long wet season. Local geography may substantially modify these climate patterns. Northward movement and the effects As the earth warms, the rain belt is projected to move north of the current position. Recent climate change can be attributed to rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere; caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The correlation between the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and average global temperature is undeniably direct, meaning that as more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, the temperature of the earth is expected to rise as well. Even though the earth is warming as a whole entity, the Northern Hemisphere is warming faster than the Southern because of melting Arctic sea ice. As the Northern Hemisphere warms, a temperature gradient is established between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The warmer temperatures in the Northern parts of the tropics foster an environment more conducive to the development of moisture. The additional moisture is met with a low-level atmosphere that is cooler because the warm air has risen to the higher levels of the atmosphere. This scenario leads to increased precipitation and is a fundament behind the idea that the rain belt is moving north. The contrast in temperature is only a part of the entire process that is driving the tropical rain belt northward. Another factor that influences the tropical rain belt is ocean circulation. Ocean Overturning Circulation is a process that involves ocean circulation between the Antarctic and Arctic regions. Dargan Frierson explains that in this process, the Northern Hemisphere receives more heat than the Southern because the overturning circulation brings more heat into the Northern Hemisphere as opposed to the Southern. He also states that as a result, the extra heat is transferred to the tropical regions in the Northern Hemisphere, causing warm ocean water to be situated in the northern tropics. This warm ocean water is what eventually generates rain and thunderstorms, and because there is more warm water in the northern tropics, it is obvious that the tropical rain belt is moving northward. Due to global climate change, the circulation of ocean currents and ocean temperatures might adjust in favor of pushing the belt further north into the region of oscillation. However, there is also the possibility that climate change will slow down ocean currents and circulation, which can change the present-day dynamic and send the rain belt to the south. Therefore, ocean circulation, ocean temperature, and the temperature of the earth are all attributing to the movement of the tropical rain belt. It is evident that the trend is northward and the belt is currently situated in the northern tropics, but the possibility of southward movement does exist. The northward movement does affect many countries and crops because the tropical rain belt is essential to food production in areas that rely on heavy precipitation. The tropical regions will be affected most by the northward movement of the rain. The banana and coffee crops in Guatemala and Indonesia will become compromised by the loss of precipitation. In addition, the effects of a drier climate in Mexico could push the Mexican desert into southern portions of Texas, New Mexico and other areas in the southern U.S. Areas in the Middle East, Western America, and the Amazon rainforest risk the possibility of becoming drier and less humid. In contrast, the northward trend could bring more rain to areas in Asia already exposed to monsoons. An increase of moisture in monsoon prone areas could be catastrophic as massive floods could follow the large amounts of rain added to preexisting rain from monsoons. Using geographical information, it is possible that the northward movement of the rain belt is already evident because of droughts in the western US, Syria and northern China. Although the possible adversarial effects of the movement can be devastating, the northward movement of the rain belt could bring an increase of rain to areas that have been decimated by droughts, which could prove to be very beneficial.

Entering service in 1942 during World War II, the destroyer served in the Pacific theater. Following the war the ship was placed in reserve before being transferred to the West German Navy and renamed Zerstörer 2 in 1959. In 1981 the destroyer was transferred to the Hellenic Navy and was renamed Kimon. Kimon was sold for scrap in 1993. Construction and career Ringgold was laid down on 25 June 1942 by the Federal Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., Kearny, New Jersey. The ship was launched on 11 November 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Arunah Sheperdson Abell, grand niece of Rear Adm. Cadwallader Ringgold. Ringgold was commissioned on 30 December 1942, Commander Thomas F. Conley in command. Shakedown, which took Ringgold from the Brooklyn Navy Yard to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and back, extended through 18 February 1943. Additional training maneuvers kept her operating in the vicinity of Trinidad until mid-July. Departing New York en route to the Pacific 21 July, she transited the Panama Canal on 27 July and reported to Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, at Pearl Harbor, where she hoisted the pennant of Commander, Destroyer Division 50. = Gilbert Islands campaign, September – November 1943 = After several weeks of training, Ringgold joined a fast carrier task force built around , , and . The force worked over Marcus Island 1 September 1943 and then moved on to conduct a raid in the Gilberts. The carrier planes conducted seven strikes 18–19 September on Tarawa and Makin. A Japanese diarist recorded that Tarawa \\"is a sea of flames\\"; nine parked planes and five vessels were destroyed. Most importantly, planes from returned with a set of low oblique photos of the lagoon side of Betio, and these proved to be most useful in planning the assault on Tarawa. On 5–6 October, the largest fast carrier force organized to that time, comprising Essex, Yorktown, Lexington, Independence, , and , Rear Adm. Alfred E. Montgomery in command, struck at Wake Island. The target was also shelled by battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. The next target was Tarawa, taken by the Southern Attack Force commanded by Rear Adm. Harry W. Hill in the battleship . His ships transported the tough 2d Marine Division, all of whose components had fought on Guadalcanal. Destroyers Ringgold and were scheduled for an early entrance into the lagoon 20 November. Just before sundown on 19 November, Ringgold thrust ahead of the main body of the attack force to secure a radar fix on a turning point just north of Mavana. Charts of the area, however, were inaccurate. On several, Betio was oriented incorrectly. The submarine reconnoitered the area and reported the error, and thus a new approach chart was improvised on board Maryland. Accurate radar fixes were thus possible. At 22:00, as Ringgold and the cruiser pushed ahead of the attack force, they picked up a radar contact. Word had been passed to watch for the submarine, but it was believed that she had moved westward that afternoon to rescue a downed flier, and that she would submerge once she encountered friendly forces. However, Nautilus being near a reef, did not submerge. Admiral Hill, anxious to avoid any encounters with possible Japanese patrols, gave the order to take the contact under fire. Ringgolds first salvo struck the base of the sub's conning tower. Although it ruptured her main induction valve, it did not explode. Nautilus submerged in \\"dire circumstances\\", but was able to make it to Abemama and complete her mission. Shortly after 05:00 counterbattery fire commenced, and at 06:22 came the scheduled naval bombardment, which resulted in a systematic going-over for Betio. Minesweepers and , under cover of a smoke screen, swept a channel from the transport area into the lagoon during the bombardment, and they used their own guns to bark replies to Japanese shore batteries. Then, while Pursuit placed marked buoys, Requisite led both Ringgold and Dashiell into the lagoon. They sped into the lagoon while under fire from shore batteries. Ringgold took two hits, both duds, although one managed to knock out her port engine. Her Chief Engineer, Lt. Comdr. Wayne A. Parker, is said to have imitated the legendary Dutch boy by plugging a hole with his body while emergency repairs were made. Larger craft could not yet venture into the lagoon, and the four ships provided all the frontal fire that the beach defenses received, with additional ammunition being lightered in to them before the day ended. Of the 5,000 men ashore by the end of the-day, nearly 1,500 had been killed or wounded. Ringgold and Dashiell were eventually relieved by the destroyers and . They provided close on-call gunfire support, while carrier aircraft bombed and strafed Japanese positions almost continuously until sunset. However, the \\"air support provided at Tarawa was slight in strength and elementary in technique compared with what was done 18 months later at Okinawa.\\" As the sun set, all combatantsexcept three destroyersand transports withdrew to offshore areas for protection against air and submarine attack. The transports returned at 21:40. Ringgold anchored inside the lagoon, Anderson cruised the southern shore, and Frazier was off the butt end of the island to provide call fire through the night. By 27 November 1943, both Tarawa and Abemama were secured. = 1944 = After completing repairs in December, Ringgold took part in the assault and capture of Kwajalein and of Eniwetok Atolls during January and February 1944, where she furnished close-in fire support for the landing forces. On 20 March she bombarded the shore installations at Kavieng, New Ireland, as a diversionary action for landings in the Northern Bismarck Archipelago. From 24 April until 1 May 1944, she took part in the assault and capture of Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea. In June Ringgold took part in the Marianas operations. During the invasion of Guam she served as Landing Craft Control Vessel and provided gunfire support. During the initial landing, she dispatched 23 waves of landing craft to the beach. Next came the invasion of Morotai Island, in the Northern Moluccas, where Ringgold again provided gunfire support. On 20 October 1944, American forces returned to the Philippines, and Ringgold again furnished fire support, this time for the landings on Panaon Island off southern Leyte. Two days later, she was ordered to Mare Island Naval Shipyard, California, for overhaul. =1945 = Early in February 1945, Ringgold joined Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's famed Fast Carrier Task Force (then 5th Fleet's TF 58, later 3rd Fleet's TF 38) for the first carrier strikes against the Japanese mainland and Okinawa in support of the Iwo Jima operation. Under cover of a weather front, the force launched its air groups at dawn, 16 February, from target. Attacks against enemy air power were pressed into the heart of the Japanese homeland far into the next day. In the course of this 2-day attack, the Japanese lost 416 planes in the air, 354 more on the ground and one escort carrier. After repairs at Ulithi and Pearl Harbor, Ringgold rejoined TF 58 in support of the Okinawa operation, joining up 4 June 1945. Upon completion of this task, the force retired to San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, the Philippines, arriving 13 June. On 1 July the ship again put to sea, this time with Admiral William Halsey's 3d Fleet Fast Carrier Task Force for strikes against the Japanese homeland. On the night of 15–16 July, with Destroyer Squadron 25 (DesRon 25) and Cruiser Division 17 (CruDiv 17), Ringgold participated in an antishipping sweep off the northern coast of Honshū, Japan. Again, on the night of 30 July, she participated in an antishipping sweep in Suruga Wan and bombarded the town of Shimizu, Honshū, Japan. Rejoining TF 38 on 31 July, Ringgold continued coastal operations with that force until the cease fire. Ordered to escort the aircraft carrier to Apra Harbor, Guam, 22 August, she arrived there four days later and underwent repairs. Steaming to Okinawa on 16 September, Ringgold took on 83 passengers for Pearl Harbor, and then proceeded to the east coast of the United States. Decommissioning 23 March 1946, she was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Charleston, South Carolina, where she remained into 1959. Designated for transfer to the Federal Republic of Germany under the military assistance program, she underwent modernization and outfitting at the Charleston Naval Shipyard. = West German Navy = Ringgold in German service as Zerstörer 2 (D171), 1971. Formally transferred to the Bundesmarine on 14 July 1959, she was redesignated Zerstörer 2 (D171). Three former Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients of the Kriegsmarine commanded Zerstörer 2 during her career with the Bundesmarine. Fregattenkapitän Günter Kuhnke from 14 July 1959 until November 1960, Fregattenkapitän Otto Ites from November 1960 until September 1962 and Fregattenkapitän Paul Brasack from September 1962 until March 1964.

Aerial photograph of a 1947 development in Oranga, Auckland. State housing is a system of public housing in New Zealand, offering low-cost rental housing to residents on low to moderate incomes. Some 69,000 state houses are managed by Kāinga Ora – Homes and Communities, most of which are owned by the Crown. In excess of 31,000 former state houses exist, which are now privately owned after large-scale sell-offs during recent decades. Since 2014, state housing has been part of a wider social housing system, which also includes privately owned low-cost housing. An archetypal 1930s and 1940s state house is a detached two- or three-bedroom cottage-style house, with weatherboard or brick veneer cladding, a steep hipped tile roof, and multi-paned timber casement windows. Thousands of these houses were built across New Zealand as state housing, and as private housing after World War II, when the government started selling their drawings and plans in an attempt to hasten housing construction. These houses, also known as \\"ex-state houses\\" to distinguish them from modern state housing, have a reputation of being well-built and are very sought after by real estate buyers, especially after the leaky homes crisis of the 1990s and 2000s hit buyer confidence in newer stock. The Liberal Government Urban working-class housing in New Zealand in the 19th century was of poor quality, with overcrowding, flimsy construction, little public space, often-polluted water, and lack of facilities for disposal of rubbish or effluent. Local bodies were not interested in enforcing existing regulations, such as minimum street widths, which might have improved housing, or in prosecuting slum landlords. The Liberal Government, first elected in 1890, believed that the slums would cease to be a problem as workers moved to the country to become farmers or small town merchants. Instead, the cities continued to grow. A parallel idea of making Government-owned land on the outskirts of cities available for workers to create smallholdings failed to gain traction because the cheap commuter trains which might have transported them to their workplaces were not established, and the Government did not provide loans for building or allow the purchase of freehold land in the areas. 13 Patrick Street in Petone was one of the first houses constructed under the 1905 Workers' Dwellings Act Prime Minister Richard Seddon introduced the Workers' Dwellings Act in 1905 to provide well-built suburban houses for workers who earned less than £156 per annum. He argued that these houses would prevent the decline of living standards in New Zealand and increase the money available to workers without increasing the costs to employers. By breaking private landlords' control over rental housing, housing costs for everyone would decline. The bill passed by 64 votes to 2, despite criticism over the cost of the scheme, the distance the houses would be from workplaces, particularly ports, and the lack of provision for Māori. Seddon estimated that 5,000 houses would be built under the scheme. The Act allowed for workers to rent weekly, lease for 50 years with a right of renewal, or lease with the right to buy over a period ranging between 25 and 41 years. In practice, the Government did not initially advertise the weekly rental, but emphasised the lease with the right to buy. The Act specified that workers could be male or female, but women were discouraged from applying for the houses because the Government was concerned that \\"houses of ill-repute\\" might be established. The standard of materials and construction was high, because the government was determined that the houses would not become slums. The Act specified that the rent was to be 5% per annum of the capital cost of the house and land, together with insurance and rates. The initial specification was that houses should cost no more than £300, but this was raised to £350–400, depending on construction materials, by the 1905 Amendment Act. This resulted in weekly rents ranging between 10s 6d and 12s 7d. All the houses had five rooms—a living room, a kitchen/dining room, and three bedrooms—as well as a bathroom. This allowed boys and girls to be given separate bedrooms from each other. Some houses were built of wood, some of concrete, and some of brick. Twenty-five houses were built at Petone in 1905. Only four applications were received to lease them. Workers could reach Wellington with a 20-minute walk followed by a 30-minute train ride, but the train cost another two shillings a week. This left a family no better off than continuing to rent in Wellington. The government was forced to allow weekly tenancies and to raise the maximum income level to attract families to the houses. Other settlements such as the one in Belleknowes, Dunedin also had trouble finding renters. Houses built in the central suburbs, such as the eight in Newtown and twelve in Sydenham, New Zealand, attracted tenants much more readily. After Seddon's death in 1906, the government Advances to Workers Act allowed urban landowners to borrow up to £450 from the government at low interest rates to build their own houses. This proved much more popular than the state housing system. A total of only 126 houses were built under the Workers' Dwellings Act by 1910. A replacement Workers' Dwelling Act in that year allowed landless urban workers to build a house on a deposit of just £10. While it still allowed for workers to rent or lease their homes from the Government, applicants who were willing to buy were favoured. The state houses were sold by the Reform Government from 1912 onwards. The First Labour Government At the time it was elected in 1935, the First Labour Government had no plans to introduce state housing. It nationalised the Mortgage Corporation set up in 1935 by the Coalition Government to provide low interest housing loans. Following a campaign against slums by the newspaper New Zealand Truth, and the realisation that lending for mortgages was not effective to provide housing to replace them, the Finance Minister Walter Nash announced in the 1936 Budget that 5000 state houses would be built. The houses would be provided by private enterprise, with a Department of Housing Construction set up to oversee the building and the State Advances Corporation to manage the houses. The government intended not only to provide housing, but to stimulate jobs and manufacturing with the construction of the houses, which were to be built from New Zealand materials as far as possible. MP John A. Lee was responsible for the programme (and for the use of cheap Reserve Bank 1% credit), but as he was an undersecretary rather than a minister he had limited authority. Sir James Fletcher of Fletcher Construction was a major participant. The houses were built in the suburbs, not in the inner cities where the slums were. This was in part because the cost of building in the inner cities was higher, and in part because the government believed that children were better raised in suburban sections rather than on the streets. The urban poor also were largely unable to afford the rents for the new state houses. The government favoured married couples with at least one child as tenants to encourage an increase in the birth rate. Māori were excluded, in part because they could not afford the rentals, but also because the government believed the races should be kept apart. The Dixon Street Flats in Wellington Almost all of the state houses built by the Labour Government were detached, with some land on which vegetables could be grown and perhaps a few animals kept. A few were semi-detached, with two or four houses sharing a section. Only about 1.5% of the 30,000 houses constructed by 31 March 1949 were in blocks of flats, all of them in Auckland or the greater Wellington area. The first to be built were the low rise family flats in Berhampore and the largest block was the ten-storey Dixon Street Flats in central Wellington containing 115 one-bedroomed flats for couples and single people. The first of the new state houses was completed at 12 Fife Lane in Miramar, Wellington, in 1937. The Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage and several cabinet ministers carried furniture into the house and handed the keys to the tenants. For the opening of the first state house in each major city, a group of cabinet ministers repeated this ceremony. The first tenants, David and Mary McGregor, paid £1 10s 3d ($3.03) rent for 12 Fife Lane, about one-third of their £4 7s 9d ($8.78) weekly income. The waiting list for state houses was 10,000 in February 1939. House building could not keep up with the demand, and almost stopped in 1942 as resources were reallocated to meet the needs of the war effort. Although construction resumed in 1944, by the time the war ended in August 1945 the waiting list had grown to 30,000. The government set up transit camps to provide interim accommodation for families waiting for state houses. Priority went to returned soldiers. In 1944, the Department of Native Affairs produced a report on the poor housing conditions of Māori in the Auckland suburb of Panmure. This and similar reports caused a change of policy; the government would now build state houses for Māori, to be jointly managed by the State Advances Corporation and the Department of Maori Affairs, which had been renamed in the interim. The new policy was to intersperse Māori and Pakeha (New Zealanders of European ancestry) households (\\"pepper- potting\\"), so that Māori could \\"adjust themselves ... to the pakeha way of living\\". A rare exception to the interspersal policy was in Waiwhetu in Lower Hutt, where state houses were built around a central marae. Although the National Party had opposed state housing in the 1938 election campaign, suggesting that it was a step towards the nationalisation of private property, in 1949 it promised to continue building state houses but also to allow tenants to buy them. Most people wanted to own their own homes, and this policy helped National win the election. =1930s and 1940s state house design= A 1930s state house layout. This is an early design with the meals recess in the living room; later state house plans moved the meals recess to the kitchen. State houses at Arapuni, Waikato, showing many of the exterior features typical of 1930s and 1940s state houses. A layout plan for the Savage Crescent state housing precinct in Palmerston North. The precinct has 245 state houses, all built between 1938 and 1945. The state houses were constructed using over 400 designs, so that no two houses in a given area were identical. They were small by today's standards – the typical floor area was for a two-bedroom house and for a three-bedroom house. The houses had timber frames and floors supported by piles and a perimeter wall. Exterior cladding was typically timber weatherboard, brick veneer, or asbestos-cement sheets or shingles. Roofs were typically hip or gable with a steep pitch (30 degrees), and were clad with concrete or clay tiles, or asbestos-cement sheets. Windows on state houses were of the timber casement type, with three panes vertically in larger windows and two panes in smaller windows. The living room was considered the social and recreational hub of the house; it was the largest room and faced north to catch the most possible sun. The kitchen faced east to catch the morning sun, while bedrooms faced either east, north or west to catch sun for part of the day. Where possible, the private zones of the bedrooms, bathroom and laundry were on a different side of the house from the public zones of the kitchen and living room. Often the kitchen, laundry, bathroom and toilet were grouped together to reduce plumbing costs. The first state houses had the dining area in the living room; after initial feedback from tenants, the dining area was moved to the kitchen. Although the original plans included space for a garage, this was not included in the houses that were built, but a tool shed was provided to encourage tenants to grow a vegetable garden. On sloping sites, the tool shed and the laundry were typically placed underneath the house. Each state house had modern amenities for their time; bedrooms were equipped with built-in wardrobes, hot water was heated by an electric cylinder, and the kitchen was equipped with an electric range. In areas where electricity was not yet available, a chip heater on wetback and a coal range were installed. As washing machines and refrigerators were not commonplace in the 1930s and 1940s, the laundry was fitted with a copper boiler and two concrete tubs, while the kitchen was fitted with a food safe. Space heating was accomplished by an open fire in the living room – New Zealand's electricity supply was considered too unreliable for large-scale space heating before the 1950s. 1950–1990 In 1950, the waiting list for state houses was 45,000, and a total of 30,000 houses had been built. The National Government increased rents for new tenants to make state housing less desirable compared with private renting, and an income limit of £520 per annum was set to ensure that only those on fairly modest incomes could rent a state house. A points system was introduced to decide which applicants for houses had the greatest need. This system was refined in 1973 and continued until 1992. The Government also introduced the sale of state houses to their occupants in August 1950. They offered 40-year mortgages on a 5% deposit at 4% interest, or 3% if the tenant agreed to continuously own and occupy the property. Many tenants were content to continue to rent with their guaranteed tenancies. By 1957, about 30% of the available houses had sold, which was considerably less than the government hoped. During the 1950s, escalating building costs saw the standard of state housing construction to fall. Suburbs of state houses built of cheaper building materials were built in greenfield areas. Houses were more uniform in design than individual, and there was a large increase in the proportion of duplex and multi-unit dwellings. The Labour Government elected in 1957 stopped promotion of state house sales, but the subsequent National Government of 1960 restored it. The policy of interspersing Māori and pakeha tenants ceased in the 1970s. Māori became concentrated in the larger state housing suburbs. In 1974, under the Third Labour Government, the State Advances Corporation, responsible for administration, and the Housing Division of the Ministry of Works, responsible for construction of state houses, merged to form the Housing Corporation of New Zealand. State house rental rates were fixed by the \\"fair rent\\" provisions of the 1955 Tenancy Act to reflect the capital cost of the house and the outgoings on it. While rents increased over the years, the rental was rebated according to the family's income and size. In 1974, the rents were fixed at the lower of the \\"fair rent\\" value or one-sixth of the household income. By the mid 1980s, the \\"fair rent\\" was about half the rental for an equivalent private property. The Third National Government of Robert Muldoon set a time limit for new tenants. After six years was up, they had a year to agree to buy the house or move out. The following Labour Government abandoned this system, but set rentals to a quarter of the household income. The Papakainga scheme was introduced by the Fourth Labour Government in the late 1980s to assist rural Māori to build their own houses on their own iwi-owned land. Market rentals A peak of 70,000 state rental houses was reached in the early 1990s. In 1991 the fourth National government raised state house rentals to \\"market levels\\" amid much controversy. The Housing Corporation was now expected to make a profit. At the same time, welfare payments were reduced. For those who could not afford the rent, the Department of Social Welfare would pay an accommodation supplement of 65 percent of the difference between the new rent and one quarter of the household income. The intention was to encourage able- bodied people to look for jobs, to remove the advantage of living in a state house over living in private rental accommodation, and to force people living in houses larger than they needed to move to smaller ones. For many state house tenants, the new policies reduced their standards of living. Foodbanks increased in number in state housing areas, and overcrowding became a problem as some families shared houses. Mounting opposition included a partial rent strike, organised by the State Housing Action Coalition (SHAC), during which tenants refused to pay more than 25% of their income in rent. In response, in 1996 the government increased the accommodation supplement to 70 percent, and restored the idea of \\"social objectives\\" rather than profit for the Housing Corporation. A Home Buy scheme was introduced from 1996 to 1999, which allowed tenants to buy their state home with a five percent deposit, an 85 percent loan from the government, and a ten percent suspensory loan. 1,800 houses were sold under this scheme, and 10,000 more sold in this period. However protests continued, culminating in the high profile eviction of a SHAC rent striker during the 1999 election campaign. State housing under the Fifth Labour Government The Fifth Labour Government, elected in 1999, placed a moratorium on state house sales and re-established the income-related rents. In 2001, Housing New Zealand, the Housing Corporation, and part of the Ministry of Social Policy were combined into the Housing New Zealand Corporation, so that policy and administration for state housing are controlled by a single agency. A program to modernise state houses was introduced after 1999. Existing houses were insulated, the layout was improved, and in many cases the kitchen and bathroom were replaced. A \\"Community Renewal\\" program, started in 2001, attempted to build supportive networks amongst residents of state housing areas, reduce crime and increase safety, and improve community services. Rents were limited to 25 percent of net household income for tenants earning up to the rate of New Zealand Superannuation. For those earning more than the rate of NZ Super, rent was 25 percent on income up to the NZ Super rate, then 50 percent on income above that up to the property's market rent. State housing under the Fifth National Government The Fifth National Government, elected in 2008, carried out a programme of incremental reforms of state housing. In 2011, in the Auckland suburb of Glen Innes Housing New Zealand began a redevelopment process of 156 state properties. The redevelopment would leave 78 houses owned by Housing New Zealand and the rest sold privately. The redevelopment process sparked over two years of protests and scores of arrests, including of Mana Party leader Hone Harawira. In 2012 it closed Housing New Zealand's local offices to tenants and directed all enquiries to a call centre. Beginning in October 2013, the FirstHome scheme aimed to sell 100 homes a year to first home buyers. From 14 April 2014 onwards all state housing tenancies were to be reviewable, ending a previous \\"house for life\\" policy. In January 2015, in his state of the nation speech, John Key announced plans to reduce the government's involvement in providing social housing, with some of the responsibility for providing housing to be passed to community housing providers. As part of the plan, 2,000 state houses would be sold by January 2016, and up to 8,000 properties would be sold by 2017. Under the plan, community housing groups would have access to government funding for income-related rents. Policy officials' advice to the government was that the policy had a number of risks, particularly around the capability of community housing providers to have the capacity to ramp up their services, and whether tenants could be protected from unfair treatment. State housing under the Sixth Labour Government The Sixth Labour Government, elected in 2017, formally moved to stop the sell-off of state houses by issuing an instruction to Housing New Zealand to cancel the sale of the homes in December 2017. The Ministry has listed pressures in the private rental market, population growth and decline in home ownership as key factors. Māori households were over- represented in social housing, making up 36 percent of tenants and 43 percent of the housing register. In 2019, the government combined KiwiBuild, Housing New Zealand and HCL into one new unit called Kāinga Ora. Kāinga Ora is to act as the landlord for the public housing stock, whilst also being a developer of both urban projects and housing. As of 2020, Kāinga Ora was producing 1,000 new houses per year for rent, accounting for 7% of the country's housing builds. Kāinga Ora also has the ability to give out first-time-home-buyer grants of up to $10,000.

Shoobie is used in the Southern New Jersey coast (along with other parts of the east coast), and resort towns in California. The term \\"shoobie\\" originated in the late 1800s, and it derives from daytrippers taking the train to the New Jersey beach, with their ticket price including a boxed lunch packed in a shoe box. Later it was used to refer to anyone who brought a picnic lunch to the beach resorts. Either way, these daytrippers deprived local businesses of the revenue the tourists would have spent on food. Homeowners (whether year-round or seasonal) often walk to the beach barefoot or remove their shoes immediately upon reaching the sand.Ravo, Nick. \\" THE TALK OF LONG BEACH ISLAND; FOR EARLY TOURISTS, A TEPID WELCOME AT JERSEY RESORT\\", The New York Times, February 16, 1987.

The name is derived, local residents said, from day-trippers of decades ago who visited the island and brought their lunch in shoe boxes.\\" Similar terms are \\"Benny,\\" which is mostly used in the resort towns of the Jersey Shore. Shoobies are essentially a mixed blessing for local beach residents.

The lyrics are by DuBose Heyward, the author of the novel Porgy on which the opera was based, although the song is also co-credited to Ira Gershwin by ASCAP.\\"Summertime\\" at ASCAP The song soon became a popular and much-recorded jazz standard, described as \\"without doubt ... one of the finest songs the composer ever wrote ... Gershwin's highly evocative writing brilliantly mixes elements of jazz and the song styles of African Americans in the southeast United States from the early twentieth century\\". Composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim has characterized Heyward's lyrics for \\"Summertime\\" and \\"My Man's Gone Now\\" as \\"the best lyrics in the musical theater\\". Porgy and Bess Gershwin began composing the song in December 1933, attempting to create his own spiritual in the style of the African American folk music of the period. Gershwin had completed setting DuBose Heyward's poem to music by February 1934, and spent the next 20 months completing and orchestrating the score of the opera. The song is sung several times throughout Porgy and Bess. Its lyrics are the first words heard in act 1 of the opera, following the communal \\"wa-do-wa\\". It is sung by Clara as a lullaby. The song theme is reprised soon after as counterpoint to the craps game scene, in act 2 in a reprise by Clara, and in act 3 by Bess, singing to Clara's now-orphaned baby after both its parents died in the storm. It was recorded for the first time by Abbie Mitchell on July 19, 1935, with George Gershwin playing the piano and conducting the orchestra (on: George Gershwin Conducts Excerpts from Porgy & Bess, Mark 56 667). The 1959 movie version of the musical featured Loulie Jean Norman singing the song. That rendition finished at #52 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.

Writing of the opening line, he says =Music= Musicologist K. J. McElrath wrote of the song: > Gershwin was remarkably successful in his intent to have this sound like a > folk song. This is reinforced by his extensive use of the pentatonic scale > (C–D–E–G–A) in the context of the A minor tonality and a slow-moving > harmonic progression that suggests a \\"blues\\". Because of these factors, this > tune has been a favorite of jazz performers for decades and can be done in a > variety of tempos and styles. While in his own description, Gershwin did not use any previously composed spirituals in his opera, Summertime is often considered an adaptation of the African American spiritual \\"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\\", which ended the play version of Porgy., p. 22, p. 281 Alternatively, the song has been proposed as an amalgamation of that spiritual and the Ukrainian Yiddish lullaby Pipi-pipipee.Jack Gottlieb, 'Funny, it doesn't sound Jewish, SUNY Press, 2004, , pp. 42–43. The author displays the three songs aligned to each other. The Ukrainian-Canadian composer and singer Alexis Kochan has suggested that some part of Gershwin's inspiration may have come from having heard the Ukrainian lullaby \\"Oi Khodyt Son Kolo Vikon\\" (\\"A Dream Passes by the Windows\\") at a New York City performance by Alexander Koshetz's Ukrainian National Chorus in 1929 (or 1926).Helen Smindak Dateline New York: Kochan and Kytasty delve deeply into musical past, The Ukrainian Weekly, 24 May 1998 Other versions Statistics for the number of recordings of \\"Summertime\\" vary by source; while older data is restricted to commercial releases, newer sources may include versions self-published online.

The term is found only once in the Bible, in 2 Timothy 4.2 Timothy (KJV) Chapter 4< Greek context The phrase from which itching ears originates in the original Greek is κνηθόμενοι τὴν ἀκοήν (knēthomenoi tēn akoēn). κνηθόμενοι, the translation for having an itching ear, is a present participle, signifying a present, continual action occurring. ἀκοήν translates to ear, or a sense of hearing. The use of ἀκοήν is often regarding an inner spiritual hearing. In , ἀκοὴ (Greek root) is used as the act of hearing, and is describe as an action caused by faith (πίστις). Paul the Apostle wrote 2 Timothy for Timothy to exhort him during his ministry. Within the context of chapter 4, verse 2, Paul charges Timothy to preach (κήρυξον), be ready (ἐπίστηθι), correct (ἔλεγξον), rebuke (ἐπιτίμησον) and exhort (ἐπιτίμησον). Each charge is an active verb in the aorist imperative tense, which implies that Paul is making a declarative, strong statement to Timothy. Paul continues in chapter 4 verse 3 by describing a time when people will not listen to sound doctrine. Paul uses the phrase for a time will come (ἔσται) which translates more closely to there will be. ἔσται is a third person indicative verb in the future tense, which signifies a warning for Timothy that the Church of Christ on earth will not change for the better. Paul's purpose Paul describes the future that Timothy will face, where people would not endure sound doctrine, and instead heap to themselves teachers in order to satisfy their itching ears. Albert Barnes writes on this subject: Paul warns Timothy about a future apostasy in which the lusts of people would drive them away from Apostolic teaching, which Timothy belonged to. Charles Ellicott suggests a motive for doing so: Paul's analogy Paul uses the analogy of having an itching ear to show that pupils, not the teachers are the ones seeking doctrine aside from Apostolic teaching. Matthew Poole describes the cause and effect of an itching ear: In chapter 4 verse 4, Paul writes: Paul uses the word fables (μύθους) to describe the remedy that people seek in order to scratch their itching ears. However, Paul continues to fulfill the analogy in chapter 4 verse 5 by contrasting Timothy's ministry from these fables. Paul calls Timothy to do the work of an evangelist by winning back those who sought fables, through preaching \\"the great facts of the Gospel placed side by side with the fables of the false teachers.\\" References Category:New Testament words and phrases Category:Pastoral epistles ","title":"Itching ears"},{"id":"1965533","text":"thumb The Watch Hill Lighthouse in Watch Hill, Rhode Island has served as a nautical beacon for ships since 1745, when the Rhode Island colonial government erected a watchtower and beacon during the French and Indian War and Revolutionary War. The original structure was destroyed in a 1781 storm, and plans were discussed to build a new lighthouse to mark the eastern entrance to Fishers Island Sound and to warn mariners of a dangerous reef southwest of Watch Hill. alt=View of the Watch Hill Lighthouse from Napatree Point President Thomas Jefferson signed an act to build the lighthouse in 1806, and construction was completed in 1807. The first lighthouse stood tall. In 1827, a rotating light was installed to differentiate it from the Stonington Harbor Light in Connecticut. Erosion forced it to close in 1855 and move farther away from the bluff edge. The next lighthouse opened in 1856 and remains as the present structure, standing tall. The steamer Metis crashed off Watch Hill in 1872, killing 130 people. In 1873, lighthouse keeper Captain Jared Starr Crandall was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for rescue operations involving the Metis. In 1879, Capt. Crandall's widow Sally Ann (Gavitt) Crandall became the first woman lighthouse keeper there. A United States Life-Saving Service station was built next to it where it operated until the 1940s, but it was destroyed in 1963. In 1907, the steamer Larchmont collided with a schooner, killing 200 people four miles from the lighthouse. The Hurricane of 1938 caused severe damage to the structure. The Leif Viking ran aground a few hundred feet from it in 1962; there were no injuries, although the ship was stranded for nine days.

He rose in the party hierarchy in the late 1940s, became Chairman of the Council of Ministers in 1988 and was elected General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) at the 7th Congress in 1991. He continued his predecessor's policy of ruling through a collective leadership and Nguyễn Văn Linh's policy of economic reform. He was elected for two terms as General Secretary, but left office in 1997 at the 3rd plenum of the 8th Central Committee during his second term. Đỗ Mười was an advisor to the Central Committee from 1997 until 2001, when the institution of Advisory Council of the Central Committee was abolished. He was a delegate to the 9th, 10th and 11th Congresses. While he officially retired from politics in 1997, Đỗ Mười continued to influence decision-making. He died on 1 October 2018 at Central Military Hospital 108.  Early life and career  Đỗ Mười, also known as Đỗ Bảo, was born on 2 February 1917 in Dong Phu, Thanh Trì, Hanoi as Nguyễn Duy Cống and was the son of Nguyen Xeng. He began his life by working as a house painter, before he began working in nationalist politics in his teens. At the age of 14, he joined the popular front against Colonialism. At 18 years of age, he married Hằng Phạm. Đỗ Mười joined the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1939, but was arrested by French authorities in 1941 or 1942 and was sentenced for 10 years to forced labour at the Hoa Lo Prison. He managed to escape in 1945, when the Japanese overthrew French rule of Indochina and established the Empire of Vietnam. After escaping from prison, Đỗ Mười became a member of the Viet Minh. During the First Indochina War Đỗ Mười served in several provincial level positions before he was promoted to Brigadier General. Đỗ Mười was the commander at the Battle of Haiphong at the end of the war. During the war, he also served as a political commissar for the party. From May 1955 to December 1956, Đỗ Mười served as chairman of the party's People's Military and Administrative Committee of Hai Phong. Đỗ Mười was appointed to the Central Committee in 1955 and at the 3rd Party Congress, he was elected to full member of the Central Committee. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Domestic Trade in December 1956 and held that post until April 1958, when he succeeded Phan Anh as Minister of Domestic Trade. Đỗ Mười held this post until February 1961, when he was forced to leave politics for a while due to bad health; he was succeeded by Nguyễn Thanh Bình. He returned to politics in November 1967 as Chairman of the Economic Board (later renamed the State Pricing Commission) and in 1969 Đỗ Mười was assigned to the building and construction sector. It is believed that Đỗ Mười was a Soviet liaison during the construction of the Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum. In December 1969, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Construction in Phạm Văn Đồng's Government. At the 4th Party Congress, the first since the reunification of Vietnam, Đỗ Mười was elected to the Politburo as an alternate member. In July 1977, the Committee for the Transformation of Industry and Trade was established with Nguyễn Văn Linh serving as Chairman and Đỗ Mười serving as Deputy Chairman. The goal of the Committee was to initiate the socialist transformation of southern Vietnam by socialising the economy through nationalisation and collectivization. The codename for the campaign was X2. Linh did not serve long as chairman and he was accused of \\"Rightism\\" and was replaced by Đỗ Mười in February 1978. Đỗ Mười was given the post because the Party leadership had been impressed by his work in the socialist transformation drive of North Vietnam in the 1950s. At the time, Đỗ Mười was renowned by his motto; \\"Capitalists are like sewer rats; whenever one sees them popping up one must smash them to death!\\" On 31 March 1978 Đỗ Mười signed a decree, on the behalf of Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đông, on forbidding private property in Vietnam. On his command, more than 60,000 youth groups were sent across Vietnam to close down private businesses. In November 1977, Đỗ Mười was succeeded as Minister of Construction by Đồng Sĩ Nguyên. Đỗ Mười was elected to the Politburo in the aftermath of the 5th Party Congress. In the Politburo he served as a protege of Lê Duẩn, the General Secretary and the dominant leader of Vietnam. By 1984 Đỗ Mười was subscribing to the view that the Vietnamese economic system needed to be reformed; his original plan was to reform the price and wage system and to abolish subsidies for state enterprises. However, he did not support the view that radical reforms were needed and he still firmly believed in the superiority of the planned economy over the market economy. In 1985 Đỗ Mười was assigned with the task of reviewing the accomplishments of various General Departments. Lê Duẩn died on 10 July 1986 and was briefly succeeded by Trường Chinh. Chinh proved to be a temporary replacement and at the 6th Party Congress, held in December 1986, he was deposed and replaced by Nguyễn Văn Linh. Linh initiated the reform programme Đổi Mới (meaning \\"renovation\\") to establish a socialist- oriented market economy. When Premier Phạm Hùng died on 10 March 1988, the Central Committee nominated Đỗ Mười for the position of Chairman of the Council of Ministers (the official title of head of government) to the National Assembly of Vietnam, certain delegates of the National Assembly responded by nominating Võ Văn Kiệt for the post instead. The reason was that Đỗ Mười was ideologically conservative and was skeptical of the Đổi Mới policies, while Kiệt, in contrast, was reform-minded. Đỗ Mười won the election, but Kiệt managed to win 36 percent of the votes – a high percentage for an opponent in Vietnam.  Premiership  As Premier Đỗ Mười supported implementation of the reform program. In April 1987 farmers in southern Vietnam began protesting against collectivised agriculture, with some even occupying government offices. The response of the authorities varied; Đỗ Mười claimed that low productivity in agriculture was an organisational problem and not systemic. He claimed that productivity was influenced by resource availability, but since that varied regionally, the solution would be decentralisation. The farms would rely on detailed local planning, regular inspections and good management and organisation. This solution would, he believed, solve the wasteful expenditure on agriculture and inappropriate allocation and land utilization. Đỗ Mười was appointed Chairman of the Socio- economic Drafting Subcommittee of the Council of Ministers in 1989 or 1990. The committee was tasked to draft a socio-economic strategy for the Vietnamese economy until the year 2000. Its members also discussed the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1991–1995). At the 10th Plenum of the 6th Central Committee (held September 1990), Đỗ Mười's report to the plenum stressed the substantial drop of Soviet and Eastern Bloc assistance levels to Vietnam, the concurrent increase in imports, the level of national debt and \\"natural calamities\\" in agriculture. Đỗ Mười laid emphasis on political stability, repair of the financial system, controlling inflation and \\"wasteful spending\\" and \\"excessive capital construction plans.\\" In his plans for 1991, Đỗ Mười sought to: * develop export markets and draw increased foreign investments to Vietnam and to obtain foreign technology; * eliminate state subsidies in production, business and capital construction; * rationalise state policies by privatising inefficient state-run enterprises; * encourage family-based economic units; and * undertake regional development, creating employment and reducing unemployment.  General Secretary  = First term (1991–1996) =  Domestic policy  At the 7th National Congress, Nguyễn Văn Linh stepped down as General Secretary because of poor health. Đỗ Mười was appointed the party's General Secretary at the 1st plenum of the 7th Congress. Đỗ Mười became the de facto leader of the conservatives; party officials, ideologues and supporters of state-owned domination of the economy supported his tenure. In the meantime, Võ Văn Kiệt, the premier, became the head of the reformist faction, while Lê Đức Anh as President, represented the military faction. The split in executive power led to the writing of the 1992 Constitution. The constitution reduced the General Secretary's powers and while the constitution referred to him as the party's leader, he had no executive or legislative powers. However, Article 4 enshrines the role of the Communist Party as \\"the leading force in the State and society\\", giving the general secretary authority on the overall direction of policy. The 1992 Constitution led to the disappearance of party strongmen such as Lê Duẩn. In the words of Đỗ Mười; \\"In the leadership over the building of the state apparatus and appointment of state officials, the party sets forth views, principles and guiding orientations related to the organization of the state apparatus; it considers and makes suggestions about the points raised by the state, which is [then] left to make decisions.\\" At the 7th Congress, the majority of Politburo seats were filled by conservatives. Together with the emerging military/security group in the Politburo and the Central Committee, the new party leadership was more focused on security and stability than its predecessor. In 1994, four new members were appointed to the Politburo, all of whom opposed radical reform. Despite conservative maneuvering, the economic reforms proved highly successful and economic growth between the 7th and 8th Party Congresses averaged 8 percent. This growth rate was not sustainable in the long run without more reforms. However, the conservatives believed this would lead to instability and possibly even threaten the Party's hold on power. The reformers supported change, believing that faster growth would better enhance security. However, with the Asian financial crisis of the late-1990s, growth plummeted to 2 percent. Factional infighting emerged between the 7th and 8th Party Congress, crippling the country's leadership. While the reformers led by Võ Văn Kiệt wanted to open Vietnam to the global economy by neo-liberal means – which meant a total break with Leninist economics – the conservatives wanted the socialist-oriented market economy to be dominated by Vietnam's state-owned enterprises, pointing to the success of South Korea's Chaebol model. The party's approach of consensual decisions was rapidly ending. In a 1995 letter to the Politburo, later leaked to the press, Võ Văn Kiệt wrote \\"in order to mobilize the genius of all within party, there must be uncompromising democracy.\\" Võ Văn Kiệt lambasted the conservatives, claiming that the state- owned sector had to shrink in favor of the private sector. He stated that Vietnam had to forsake its relations with the remaining socialist states, stop the party from meddling in government affairs and put national affairs in front of government affairs. In response, the conservatives sent Nguyễn Hà Phan around the country to criticise Võ Văn Kiệt, who he claimed was deviating from socialism. As the power struggle continued, Chief of Staff Đào Đình Luyện was demoted from his post because his support of reforms and Nguyễn Hà Phan was dropped from the Politburo and put under house arrest on charges of treason in April 1996. The conservatives launched a campaign led by Đào Duy Tùng, the editor-in-chief of Communist Review (Vietnamese: Tạp chí Cộng Sản). Thanks to his support within the party, he attained unprecedented control over personnel appointments and the drafting of the Political Report to the 8th Congress, however, at the 10th Central Committee meeting of the 7th Congress, he was accused of \\"anti-democratic behaviour\\" and abuse of power and was not reelected to the Politburo, gaining only 10 percent of the vote. The fall of Đào Duy Tùng, Đỗ Mười's planned successor, led to a compromise: the general secretary, prime minister and president were reelected at the 8th Congress without a majority because of the conservative – reformist power struggle. However, significant turnover within the party leadership occurred and for the first time in years, the central party figures lost ground to the provincial party branches and bureaucrats – only 8.9 percent of the new Central Committee members came from the central party apparatus, while 67 percent of the new members had either an immediate provincial or government background.  Foreign policy  At the 3rd plenum of the 7th Central Committee (held 14–18 July 1992) Đỗ Mười reaffirmed the importance of the party's foreign policy. He further emphasized \\"foreign policy plays a more and more important role .... We have realized that in the present era, no country – regardless of its high degree of development – can close its doors to the world. For a country with a very poor starting point like Vietnam, it is very important for it to strive to gain outside sources of strength.\\" While seeking relations with Western and capitalist countries, Đỗ Mười affirmed the importance of good relations with the \\"socialist countries, the communist and international workers movement, the movement for national independence, the Non-Aligned Movement and all other peaceful and progressive forces worldwide.\\" He expressed the Party's concern that such an open foreign policy would weaken national security, but stated \\"Over the past several years, hostile forces have relentlessly carried out acts of sabotage against our country. However, their dark schemes and maneuvers have all been foiled by our people.\\" Meaning, that while Vietnam would seek to strengthen its international presence, these contacts would not be allowed to change the character of Vietnamese socialism. Following the failed August coup in the Soviet Union and its country's dissolution, Đỗ Mười formally acknowledged the changes, stating to a group of cadres \\"Socialism no longer exists in the Soviet Union and the activities of the Communist party have been banned.\\" While mourning the Soviet Union's dissolution, Vietnam recognized the Commonwealth of Independent States on 27 December 1991 and developed ties with the newly independent states. On 27 June, following Đỗ Mười's election as General Secretary, Jiang Zemin, the Communist Party of China General Secretary, used the occasion to congratulate Đỗ Mười and stated that he hoped that relations between China and Vietnam would be normalized, on a state-to-state and a party-to-party basis. In a series of July meetings, relations between the two countries further improved and Lê Đức Anh was invited to China by CPC. Normalization arrived in November when Đỗ Mười and Võ Văn Kiệt visited China and held discussions with Jiang and Premier Li Peng that later led to an 11-point communique. Relations would further improve in 1992, when several CPV and CPC cadres met. With the \\"fall of communism\\" in Eastern Europe Deng Xiaoping, the China's paramount leader, began advocating the creation of a loose new socialist alliance consisting of China, the Soviet Union, North Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic and Vietnam among others. A report circulating in China in August 1991 supported forming a loose international socialist federation of the remaining socialist states. The VCP shared the CPC's sentiments and moved to strengthen relations with the remaining socialist states; relations with Cuba were emphasized and Vietnam signed an economic and trade protocol with North Korea in 1991. The feasibility of a loose socialist federation would depend on the remaining socialist states ignoring their differences and emphasising their common interests – however, tensions between China and Vietnam cast doubt. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, China abandoned its idea. While relations between Vietnam and Laos had stopped being \\"special\\" after Vietnamese troop withdrawal, the two countries still shared ideology. Đỗ Mười and Võ Văn Kiệt made separate trips to Laos in 1992. Đỗ Mười led a delegation to Kaysone Phomvihane, the former Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party (LPRP). However, at the 5th LPRP Congress Lao leaders referred to its relations with China as their most important foreign partner. In February 1992, China passed a law claiming the whole of the South China Sea. When the matter was discussed at the Vietnam National Assembly, a stormy, private debate took place. While some called for economic sanctions or even military intervention, on the advice of the Central Committee's Commission for External Relations, it adopted a declaration as the best response to the issue. Nguyễn Văn Linh visited China to discuss the law, but during the visit Chinese officials signed an agreement with Crestone Energy Corporation for exploratory drilling on Vietnam's continental shelf. At the 3rd plenum of the 7th Central Committee, criticism of China was harsh and Đỗ Mười accused China of expansionism. In 1995 Đỗ Mười led a delegation to China. He met with Jiang, Li and others. = Second term (1996–1997) =  Domestic policy  Before the 8th National Congress, the stalemate between the conservatives and reformers continued. While rumors circulated that the 8th National Congress would be postponed, the conservatives and the reformers were able to compromise at the 11th Central Committee plenum of the 7th Congress. The 8th Central Committee was elected by the Congress and 54 percent of the elected members were incumbents. Of the 19-member, 9 resigned from their posts at the 8th Congress. The Secretariat was abolished at the congress and replaced by the Politburo Standing Committee (PSB); Đỗ Mười was one of five members. While the PSB was originally conceived to replace the Politburo as the party's highest decision-making body, protests from the Central Committee accused the Politburo of behaving in an anti-democratic behavior, leaving the PSB approximately as powerful as the former Secretariat. The 8th Congress failed to respond to the power struggle which developed during the 7th Central Committee. In the aftermath, Đỗ Mười told reporters during the Congress, \\"I think we will have to accelerate our development. Slow development means hunger, don't you think? But at the same time I want to see efficiency and stability. If reform is too fast we will make mistakes. If you run too fast and there is something in the road you may fall down.\\"  Foreign policy  Đỗ Mười attended the 6th LPRP Congress (held in 1996).  Resignation  Đỗ Mười retired from his posts as General Secretary and Secretary of the Central Military Commission and was succeeded by Lê Khả Phiêu at the 4th plenum of the 8th Central Committee on 29 December 1997. According to Carlyle Thayer \\"The fourth plenum brought to an end to the period of leadership transition that had been under way since the Eighth National Party Congress in 1996, but did not resolve internal party factionalism between reformers and conservatives.\\" Đỗ Mười, together with Võ Văn Kiệt and Lê Đức Anh, was appointed to the Advisory Council of the Central Committee, where he remained until the body's dissolution in 2001. He remained an influential figure in Vietnamese politics and exercised considerable influence.  Leadership  Under Đỗ Mười, at least three Central Committee plenums were held each year. He introduced order, routine and predictability into the party's political system. Each plenum centered on key issues and discussions took place in an intensive environment. Under Đỗ Mười, the Central Committee plenae focused on national issues rather than on the party as had been the case under Nguyễn Văn Linh. According to Louis Stern, \\"Muoi introduced into the plenary session a process of small group work in preparing specific policy assessments that drew on the recommendations of participating technical specialists, unidentified 'scientific groups,' 'intellectuals at home and abroad' (possibly a reference to overseas Vietnamese investors, businessmen and economists), veterans, as well as the conventional assortment of party cadres, members and party committee representatives\\". These groups were given the power of preparing and receiving reports intended for the Central Committee beforehand and to prepare proposals or comments on specific documents generated by a plenum. Throughout his rule, Đỗ Mười tried to lead Central Committee plenum debates toward consensus. He avoided backing controversial issues to avoid splits within the Central Committee. When a consensus failed to materialize, as was the case with the 8th plenum of the 7th Central Committee when it failed to devise a suitable wording on the direction of ideological work, the task of revising and amending the Central Committee's resolution was transferred to the 7th Politburo. In contrast to Nguyễn Văn Linh, Đỗ Mười sought common ground with the Central Committee rather than campaigning for his own views. In his speeches and in his debate participation, Đỗ Mười was less controversial and when speaking, he supported traditional party principles. According to Louis Stern, \\"Unlike Nguyen Van Linh, Muoi did not seek to plot out unique alternatives to nagging problems, propose unconventional approaches to issues, or forge a new consensus on critical matters. Much less forceful than his predecessor in urging support for his views, Muoi was, if anything, on the conservative side of the equation on several matters\\", such as securing state domination over the economy and retaining strong party control over the country.  Political views  Đỗ Mười believed in the \\"evolutionary progression of the political renovation\\" which began at the 6th National Congress. Reform in the economic sphere was of utmost importance, while political reform was secondary. However, he believed that the implementation of economic reforms often revealed weaknesses in the political system. Đỗ Mười did not want to transform the political system, but to improve it. Changes made to laws and governing practices should, according to him, be grounded in the ideology of Marxism–Leninism and Hồ Chí Minh Thought. He opposed what he called \\"demagogic arguments\\" that called for an end to the party's \\"monopolistic leadership and returning all power to the people under the pretext of renewing democracy.\\" At the same time, he supported democratization of the party's decision-making process, but firmly believed in the principles of democratic centralism. Đỗ Mười supported the idea of selling preferential shares in state-owned enterprises to employees, profit sharing schemes, \\"and the sales of percentages of state enterprises to 'outside organizations and individuals' to create conditions for workers to become the real owners of enterprises.\\" He often stressed the importance of industrialization as not just the means of production, but as a comprehensive socio-economic change. He often emphasized the need to \\"catch up with world progress\\" by emphasizing economic strategies that played on Vietnam's strengths. He claimed that the industrialization program would be run by the market mechanism, but that the state-owned sector would in turn guide and control the market process. While Đỗ Mười never opposed freedom of the press, criticism, debate and diversity, he attacked those against the socialist cause. At the 4th Congress of the Writers Union, Đỗ Mười stated certain literature aimed \\"to smear the party and state leadership and erode the people's confidence in the party and state.\\" At a press conference in 1992 he stated that \\"information must be guided\\" and the press had to \\"remain the shock force on the ideological and cultural front.\\" He further criticized the media for taking advantage of greater press freedom by criticizing the party and socialism. By 1993, Đỗ Mười claimed that the press had been \\"commercialized\\" by the economic reforms.  Death and legacy  To many outsiders, Đỗ Mười was a bland leader, but within the party his stature is such that he is still referred to as the \\"Godfather of Vietnamese politics\\" by party officials. In the Western world there has been little writing on him, or his contributions. An explanation is that the study of political leadership has become out of fashion within political science. Vietnamese sources obscured his involvement in the reform process and his party activities. According to Sophie Quinn-Judge, Đỗ Mười's leadership \\"was marked by a reassertion of the Communist Party's primacy and its heroic past. It was in 1991 that 'Ho Chi Minh Thought'—ideas extracted from Ho's writings—became one of the country's guiding ideologies, along with Marxism–Leninism. Biographies of early communists such as Nguyen Son and Nguyen Binh, who had been too Maoist for the 1970s, were printed in historical journals, with attestations of popular affection.\\" He turned 100 on February 2, 2017. On April 12, 2018, Đỗ Mười was admitted to the Central Military Hospital 108 in Hanoi. He died on October 1, 2018 at the age of 101, just 7 months after Phan Văn Khải died from a severe illness before Lunar New Year 2018. From 27 July 2016, when former Netherlands Prime Minister Piet de Jong died, until his own death Đỗ Mười was the world's oldest living former head of state or government.

It has a population of about 16,000. It is located between the cities of Prague and Plzeň, in varying landscape and the huge forest of Křivoklát. The location of the town influenced and still influences the way of life of the inhabitants. History The first evidence of the settlement of the town is known from 1252. Křivoklát was the administrative centre at this time. Rakovník was a market village which together with other villages lies in and adds to the surroundings of Křivoklát Castle. A great development of the town was fulfilled in the 19th century. It was the beginning of independent offices, new houses and a time when new streets were built. Some new roads were built and old roads repaired and Rakovník was connected to the surroundings towns. A grammar school was opened in 1833, where Zikmund Winter, a well-known writer used to teach in 1874–1884. In 1875 Otta´s soap factory was opened. It was later called “Rakona” and today it is “Procter & Gamble.” In 1883 a ceramic factory was established, now it is “Rakovník´s ceramic establishment.” Until 1918, Rakovník - Rakonitz was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), in the district of the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den österreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm Klein, 1967 With the 20th century the development of social and cultural life increased dramatically. Masaryk´s Business Academy, gymnasium and hospital were also built. The two world wars did change life in Rakovník at all. There were no actual fights in Rakovník itself but a lot of people died in concentration camps. The most affected were Jewish families. In 1950 Rakovník became a district town. Today’s borders of our district are from 1960. When Rakovník got over the crises of the wars a lot of people came to the town.http://www.czechcities.eu/rakovnik/ Economy The Rakovník Brewery was founded in 1454. It is one of the oldest breweries in the Czech Republic. The beers are marketed under the brand Bakalář.http://www.rakovnikbeer.cz/ Czech Brewery Rakovník (in English, Czech and German)Brewery Rakovník - Pivovary.Info Sights The centre of the town is historically significant and is protected by law as Urban monument zone. Its main feature is the 400 metre-long Hus Square, which is the 2nd longest square in the Czech Republic. On the square is located the 16th-century town hall with a late Baroque façade. The interior of the town hall is decorated with a ceiling fresco depicting the town of Rakovník as it was 250 years ago. The eastern part of the square is dominated by the high Gothic Decanal Church of St. Bartholomew, a 14th-century structure. The church was built on the site of an older church dedicated to St. Nicholas. Adjacent to the church stands a bell tower dating from 1495. It is considered as the most precious gothic bell tower in the Czech Republic and one of the most precious in Europe. The bell has a diameter of 1.6 metres.

Pondsmith and published by R. Talsorian Games. It was inspired by gag anime such as Urusei Yatsura and Ranma ½. The game was first released in 1987, when anime was still mostly an underground sensation. The game is currently in its third edition, published in 1997. This edition was retooled to play up the anime inspirations after anime had become more mainstream. At least two modules were published for the original edition. The first was \\"Field Trip\\" written by Dave Friedland and published by R. Talsorian Games. The second was \\"TFOS does Winterfest\\", written by Douglas Garrett, Paul Lidberg and Michael MacDonald and published under license by Crunchy Frog Enterprises. In 2001, A2 Press published a TFOS universe expansion book named \\"The Landing\\" which was written by Michael Cox. More expansions were supposed to follow. Concept The basic setting of Teenagers from Outer Space revolves around aliens making contact with Earth and becoming infatuated with Earth's \\"teen culture\\". So much, in fact, that many aliens move to Earth, and enroll their children in Earth schools. This set the stage for a variety of comedic situations. The 1986 Chris Columbus created CBS Saturday morning cartoon Galaxy High embodied this concept, but in reverse, where humans attended high school on an asteroid. Characters Players take on the role of either (somewhat) ordinary Earth teens (Humans) trying to cope with the \\"new neighbors\\", or Alien teens trying to fit in on Earth. There are eight stats, ranging from the relatively normal Bod (overall physical strength and agility) and Smarts (intelligence), to stats like Relationship With Parents (how well the character deals with their parents and other authority figures) and Driving. Skills, or \\"Knacks\\", are made up by players, with oddly descriptive names like \\"Drive Like a Maniac\\", \\"Fire Raygun\\", or \\"Avoid Being Harassed by Authority Figures\\" recommended. A stat called Bonk measures damages, but keeping in the comedic nature of the game, characters only suffer temporary cartoon-style injuries and having Bonk reduced to zero only forces a character to sit out one turn. Bonk can also be lost by being the victim of an embarrassing faux pas or devastating put-down. Aliens can come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, but are classified into three basic types: *Near Humans, who look almost human, except for a few small details (examples include Mr. Spock from Star Trek, or Lum from Urusei Yatsura) *Not Very Near Humans, who are humanoid but with a lot of odd, obvious features (examples include the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or the Puma twins from Dominion) *Real Weirdies, who may or may not be humanoid, and always stand out in a crowd (such as the Xenomorphs from the Alien series, or the aragami from Blue Seed) This classification system can also be applied to non-human characters who are not necessarily aliens, such as robots and mythological creatures. Alien Teens frequently have one or more bizarre powers such as flight, the ability to throw lightning bolts or breathe fire, shapeshifting, or psychic powers. Humans start with only one special ability, Fake Out (an uncanny knack for fast-talking greenhorn aliens into believing false information about Earth culture), but may start with advantages like increased running speed or durability, or outrageous wealth. Gameplay The rules encourage a lot of improvisational and character-based humor. The \\"GM's tips\\" section of the rulebook includes a list of suggested gag situations (\\"routines\\") the players will have to deal with on a regular basis, from jealous girlfriends, to drill-sergeant gym teachers, to nosey siblings, to unlikely interruptions for make-out sessions.  Influence  Despite the apparent simplicity of the design, TFOS has turned out to be influential in the development of role-playing games. As the first non-mecha anime-based game to achieve a degree of commercial success, it was pivotal in opening the development of that genre. That and the simplicity of the system were major influences on the development of Big Eyes, Small Mouth. It has been very popular on computer networks and is still frequently used in Internet games. Reception In the June/July 1987 edition of Adventurer (Issue #11), James Wallis did not like the game, commenting that \\"the authors couldn't decide whether they wanted to produce a game like Ghostbusters or Toon, and ended up with the worst of both [...] a game which will, if left to its own devices, degenerate into endless goop-gun duels.\\" He also derided the twenty scenario ideas, saying, \\"Maybe three of them are useable; the rest are too silly for words; and when I say 'silly' I mean 'stupid'.\\" In the November 1989 edition of the British magazine Games International (Issue 10), Paul Mason warned readers that \\"This is a stupid game [...] This game only works if the players turn into animals from start to finish and the referee throws all subtlety, intelligence and taste out the window.\\" He concluded by giving the game an average rating of 3 out of 5, saying, \\"If you like Toon and Ghostbusters, and fancy playing that kind of game in an American high school setting, then Teenagers is great fun.\\" Other reviews *White Wolf #9 (1988) References External links *Official Webpage *Teenagers From Outer Space MUX (Online Game) Category:Anime role-playing games Category:Comedy role-playing games Category:Mike Pondsmith games Category:R.

Early life and career Rizzs is from Blue Island, Illinois, where he attended Eisenhower High School, and he is a 1975 graduate of Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. From 1975 to 1980, he handled baseball play-by-play duties at the double-A level for Alexandria, Louisiana, Amarillo, Texas and Memphis, Tennessee. He became the sports director at WBNS radio in Columbus, Ohio in 1981, where he called Ohio State football and triple-A baseball for two seasons. He was named the Ohio \\"Sportscaster of the Year\\" in 1981 by the Ohio Sportscasters Association. Seattle Mariners and Detroit Tigers Beginning in 1983, Rizzs broadcast Mariners games along with Dave Niehaus. In 1992, Rizzs moved to WJR in Detroit as the sports director, and assumed duties as the new radio play-by-play voice of the Detroit Tigers. The previous announcer, Ernie Harwell, had been with the Tigers since the 1960 season, but had been fired in late 1991. Harwell's dismissal was not popular with fans; teaming with Bob Rathbun (also in his first year with the team, replacing Paul Carey, who retired) proved difficult and both were let go after the end of the 1994 season. Rizzs returned to Seattle, where he remains to this day. In 2000, Rizzs was named the Chicago-area sportscaster of the year by the Chicago Pitch and Hit Club. Although he previously broadcast Mariners games on both television and radio, Rizzs was transferred prior to the 2007 season to work exclusively on Mariners radio broadcasts. For the first three innings, he was accompanied by Dave Sims, who was hired prior to the 2007 season, and for the remainder of the game he was accompanied by the late Dave Niehaus (as Sims and Niehaus switched positions after the third inning). Rizzs did play-by-play for the first three and one-half innings, and again in the 7th inning. In games that went to extra innings, Rizzs did the play-by-play for the even-numbered innings. With the death of Niehaus on November 10, 2010, Rizzs became the Mariners lead radio voice. During the 2011-2012 seasons, Rizzs did broadcasts of Mariners baseball with rotation of guest color commentators, including former Mariners Dan Wilson and Jay Buhner, and former Mariners announcers Ron Fairly, Ken Wilson, Ken Levine, and Dave Valle. In January 2013, it was announced that Rizzs' new radio partner would be Aaron Goldsmith, formerly of the Pawsox Radio Network. His partner Goldsmith does the play-by-play for the 3rd, 6th, and 7th inning, as well as even innings when the game goes into extra innings. Notable catchphrases Rizzs is noted for using the following catchphrases on Mariner broadcasts: \\"Goodbye baseball!\\"- used on home run calls. \\"Holy smokes!\\"/\\"How about that?\\"- used for exciting plays. \\"Get out the rye bread and mustard, Grandma, it is grand salami time! Holy smokes!\\"- used when the Mariners get a grand slam. Formerly used (except for Holy smokes!) by his longtime radio partner Dave Niehaus. \\"Grandma, get out the rye bread and mustard, it is grand salami time!\\"- alternative grand slam call made by Rizzs. \\"How about that, buddy?\\"- also used after a Mariners player hit a grand slam, in honor of his longtime broadcaster partner/friend Dave Niehaus. \\"Happy totals\\"- used during the postgame when the Mariners win the ballgame, now taken over by Aaron Goldsmith. It was originally used by Chicago Cubs broadcasters in the 1970s. Personal life Rizzs resides in Issaquah, Washington. He has one son, Nick, two grandsons, Jaxon and Braedon, and one granddaughter, Ryan. Rizzs also provided the commentary for the 2005 Nintendo Gamecube game Nintendo Pennant Chase Baseball, but the game's U.S. release was canceled. With former Mariner player Dave Henderson, Rizzs co-founded a charity that provides Christmas gifts to children.

Strachwitz was born in Peterwitz, Silesia (today Stoszowice Poland). After studying in Breslau and Berlin he settled on his estate in Moravia, where he devoted himself to literary pursuits. When travelling in Italy in 1847 he was taken ill in Venice, and died in Vienna. Although he had thus only reached his twenty-fifth year, he revealed a lyric genius of remarkable force and originality. His first collection of poems, Lieder eines Erwachenden (Songs of an Awakening) appeared in 1842 and went through several editions. Neue Gedichte (New Poems) were published after his death in 1848. These poems are characteristic of the transition through which the German lyric was passing between 1840 and 1848; the old Romantic strain is still dominant, especially in his ballads, which are unquestionably his finest productions; but, side by side with it, there is to be seen the influence of Platen, to whose warmest admirers Strachwitz belonged, as well as echoes of the restless political spirit of those eventful years. His political lyric was, however, tempered by an aristocratic restraint which was absent from the writings of men like Herwegh and Freiligrath. Strachwitz's early death in Vienna was a great loss to German letters; for he was by far the most promising of the younger lyric poets of his time.

It is located to the south of the towns of Åndalsnes and Molde inside the Reinheimen National Park. The Troll Wall is the tallest vertical rock face in Europe, about from its base to the summit of its highest point. At its steepest, the summit ridge overhangs the base of the wall by nearly . The Rauma River and the European Route E136 runs just to the east of the wall. The rock is gneiss, formed into a broken rock wall of huge corners, concave roofs, and crack systems, topped with a series of spires and pinnacles on the summit rim. The rock is generally loose, and rockfall is the norm on this north- facing big wall. There was a series of large rockfalls on the wall in September 1998, radically changing the character of several climbing routes.\\"TROLLVEGGEN\\", alpinist.com, 1 September 2003. Retrieved 18 January 2011. The Troll Wall has been a prestigious goal for climbers and base jumpers alike. Carl Boenish, the \\"father\\" of base jumping, was killed on the Troll Wall in 1984 shortly after setting the world record for the highest base jump in history. Base jumping from Troll Wall has been illegal since 1986. Climbing history The Troll Wall (left), with the peaks of Brudgommen (The Bridegroom) and Store Trolltind to the right The Troll Wall The Troll Wall was first climbed in 1965 by a Norwegian team. The Norwegian team, consisting of Ole Daniel Enersen, Leif Norman Patterson, Odd Eliassen, and Jon Teigland, finished one day ahead of the British climbers Tony Howard, John Amatt and Bill Tweedale, who established the most popular climbing route on the wall, the Rimmon Route.Troll Wall: the Untold Story of the British First Ascent of Europe's Tallest Rock Face , v-publishing.co.uk. Retrieved 18 January 2011. As of 2003, this route was reported unclimbable because a rockfall in September 1998 destroyed five of its pitches. The wall saw its first winter ascent in March 1974, when Wojciech Kurtyka from Poland spent 13 days repeating the 1967 French Route. In 1979, the wall was free climbed for the first time by local climber Hans Christian Doseth and Ragnhild Amundsen. Today, there are many routes on the wall, ranging in length and difficulty. The classic Rimmon and Swedish routes were normally free climbed in a day or two until being heavily damaged by the 1998 rock falls. The longer and more engaging aid routes, such as the 1972 test piece Arch Wall (climbed by Ed and Hugh Drummond in 20 days), or the 1986 Death to All/Pretty Blond Vikings, which cuts through the steepest part of the wall, require advanced knowledge of big wall climbing and several days on the wall. Due to the serious character of the wall, in addition to a cold and damp climate, new routes on Troll Wall are rare. In February 2002, a Russian team established the Krasnoyarsk Route during 19 days.http://www.romsdala.com/krasnojarsk.html The long Krasnoyarsk, graded f6c+/A4+, is generally thought to be the hardest aid route on the wall and was awarded first prize in the 2002 All Russia Winter Mountaineering Championships.http://www.thebmc.co.uk/saethers-free-a4-on-troll-wall In July 2010, Arch Wall, previously a serious aid route of difficulty up to A4+, saw its first all-free ascent by local climber Sindre Sæther and his father, Ole Johan. Arch Wall is about of climbing over 37 pitches, and it took the two a total of 36 hours of climbing to reach the summit. In July 2012, Sindre and Ole Johan Sæther repeated the feat by free climbing the Krasnoyarsk Route. The most recent contribution to climbs on the Troll Wall is Katharsis, established by Polish climbers Marek Raganowicz and Marcin Tomaszewski over 18 days in January and February 2015. According to Planetmountain.com, the new route shares the first two pitches of the French Route, before forging a line between the Russian Route and Arch Wall. The team reported of difficulties up to A4/M7. Base jumping, ski mountaineering In 1980, a new sport debuted when the Finn Jorma Öster made the first parachute jump from the Troll Wall and it was one of the pioneering sites for European base jumping during the first half of the 1980s. However, after a number of fatalities, the Norwegian authorities made base jumping from the Troll Wall illegal on 25 July 1986.

He subsequently earned a Master of Arts and a law degree from Columbia University.James Verini, Reese's Pieces: Mr. Schonfeld, Forgotten Founder of CNN, Is a Man of Many Projects, The New York Observer, January 28, 2001 However, he never went into practice. Career Schonfeld began his career with United Press Movietone News in 1956. Later he became vice president of United Press International Television News. In 1975, he founded the Independent Television News Association, a service that provided independent television stations with pooled news coverage via satellite.Patrick Parsons (2008), Blue Skies: A History of Cable Television, page 381. Temple University Press, , . 804 pages =Birth of CNN= Ted Turner approached Schonfeld to find out about satellites. Schonfeld recalls Turner asking him how much a satellite would cost, and upon hearing the sum Turner exclaimed \\"only a million dollars a year?\\", after which Turner acquired his first satellite. Approximately a year later he was approached again by Turner, who wanted to found a 15-hour all-news channel. Schonfeld convinced Turner to increase to a 24-hour news channel. Schonfeld calculated it could be done with a staff of approximately 300 if they used an all-electronic newsroom and satellites for all transmissions. It would require an initial investment of $15–20 million and several million dollars per month to operate. In 1979, Turner sold his North Carolina station, WRET, to fund the transaction and established its headquarters in lower-cost, non-union Atlanta. Schonfeld was appointed first president and chief executive of the then-named Cable News Network (CNN). He hired Burt Reinhardt as vice president of the network; Sam Zelman as vice president of news and executive producer; Bill MacPhail as head of sports; Ted Kavanau as director of personnel; and Jim Kitchell, former general manager of news at NBC, as vice president of production and operations. While at CNN, Schonfeld is credited with originating the 24-hour cable news concept. In 1982, Schonfeld was succeeded as CEO by Ted Turner after a dispute over Schonfeld's firing of Sandi Freeman and was succeeded as president by CNN's executive vice president, Burt Reinhardt. =Post-CNN= After leaving CNN, Schonfeld joined Cablevision Systems in New York, where he developed and oversaw the first 24-hour all-news service on a local cable system, News 12 Long Island. He also produced People Magazine on TV for CBS, and assisted in developing \\"News Channel 8\\" for Allbritton Communications Company. Schonfeld subsequently worked with Time Warner in planning the International Business Channel. He designed and implemented the Medical News Network, an interactive TV news service, for Whittle Communications in 1993. He also served on the board of Robert Halmi International before it was sold to Hallmark. In 1992, Schonfeld began developing Food Network (originally the TV Food Network), which launched on November 23, 1993. He acted as president of the network, which was sold to Belo Broadcasting in 1996 and was later resold to the E. W. Scripps Company. Schonfeld sold his interest in the Food Network to Scripps in 1999. He continued consulting for various media projects and occasionally contributed to The Huffington Post. Personal life Schonfeld was married to Pat O'Gorman, sister of poet Ned O'Gorman, until his death. They had six children—three daughters (Juliette, Ellen, and Ida) and three sons (Alex, Orrin, and William). He was previously married to Karen Lamberti; they divorced. Schonfeld was the author of Me and Ted Against the World, an account of the development and early history of CNN, and \\"The Global Battle for Cultural Domination\\", an essay in Developing Cultures: Essays on Cultural Change. Schonfeld died on July 28, 2020, at his home in Manhattan. He was 88 and had suffered from complications of Alzheimer's disease.

Sagittaria Linnaeus, Flora of North America species of aquatic plants whose members go by a variety of common names, including arrowhead, duck potato, katniss, Omodaka (沢瀉 in Japanese), swamp potato, tule potato, and wapato (or wapatoo). Most are native to South, Central, and North America, but there are also some from Europe, Africa, and Asia.  Description  Sagittaria plant stock (the perennial rhizome) is a horizontal creeper (stoloniferous) and obliquely obovate, the margins winged, with apical or ventral beak; in other words, they are a small, dry, one-seeded fruit that do not open to release the seed, set on a slant, narrower at the base, with winged edges, and having a \\"beaked\\" aperture (one side longer than the other) for sprouting, set above or below the fruit body. One of the names for this plant is derived from the edible underwater tuber that the plant produces. In late fall or early spring, disturbing the aquatic mud in which the plant grows will cause its small tubers to float to the surface where they can be harvested and then boiled. Image:SagittariaSagittifolia-bloem- kl.jpgSagittaria sagittifolia flowers Image:Tachi Omodaka inverted.pngOmodaka  Uses  Many species have edible roots, prized for millennia as a reliable source of starch and carbohydrates, even during the winter. Roots are eaten cooked, and are harvested by hand or by treading with one's feet in the mud. They are easy to propagate by replanting the roots.

He used the nickname Ponury (\\"Gloomy\\" or \\"Grim\\") and Donat. Biography Colonel. Jan (John) Piwnik, was born on 31 August 1912. Janowice the village, district opatowski, Kielce Voivodeship (1919–39), Second Polish Republic. Son of John, a farmer, and Sophia Kłonica. In 1933, he graduated from a reserve NCO artillery school in Włodzimierz Wołyński. In 1935, he joined the Polish police, where he served as an officer. Mobilized in 1939, during the invasion of Poland by Germany, he commanded a motorized unit of the police. When the Soviets also attacked, on 23 September he and his unit crossed the Hungarian border and were interned. Piwnik managed to escape from the internment camp. In November 1939, he reported to the Polish Government in Exile in Paris. He joined the Polish Army, reconstituted in France at that time and was assigned to the 4th Rifle Brigade (en cadre). After evacuation to Great Britain following the fall of France, he joined the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade under General Stanisław Sosabowski. Piwnik was informed of creation of the Cichociemni formation, which he joined. After receiving extensive training, he was transported to Poland on 7 November 1941. There he joined the Home Army and served at various posts. In the summer of 1942, he was assigned to head one of the Wachlarz units operating from Równe in eastern Poland (now Rivne in western Ukraine). Arrested by the Gestapo, he managed to escape from the German prison and reached Warsaw. There he was ordered to prepare a mission to rescue his fellow Wachlarz members from the prison in Pińsk. On 18 January 1943, he and his men successfully stormed the German prison, liberated all the prisoners and hostages, and transported them safely to Warsaw. For his action, he was promoted to ensign and in March was assigned to the Radom- Kielce Home Army Area as the commanding officer of all Kedyw forces there. As the hilly and densely forested terrain was ideal for partisan warfare, Piwnik started to organise a large partisan unit out of many smaller, pre-existing groups. His unit, based in the forests around Wykus, was named the Home Army Partisan Group \\"Ponury\\". One of the most successful units in the area, it disrupted German transport and harassed German garrisons. However, a German counter-attack caused heavy losses to his unit and it was forced to move eastwards, towards the forests near Jeleniów. In November 1943, Piwnik was married to Emilia Malessa (Marcysia). In December 1943, Piwnik was dismissed from command of the partisan units and in February of the following year, he was assigned to the Nowogródek Home Army Area, where he formed a small partisan unit. After the start of the Operation Tempest, his unit was reformed into the VII battalion of the 77th Home Army Infantry Regiment and took part in many successful actions behind German lines. He was killed in action in a successful attack against German troops near the village of Jewłasze near Vilnius on 16 June 1944. He had been shot in the back while retrieving a wounded comrade by a German deserter. Piwnik was posthumously promoted to the rank of major and next to colonel (by a Polish Minister of Defense, in year 2012). After the war, his life became part of the popular culture of the Świętokrzyskie area. In July 1988, his body was exhumed and transferred to a crypt in the Cistercian monastery in Wąchock.

Meadows) is a kibbutz in the northwestern Negev in Israel. Located near the border with the Gaza Strip, about 7 kilometers east of Khan Yunis, it falls under the jurisdiction of Eshkol Regional Council. In it had a population of . History The kibbutz was established in June 1946 as part of the 11 points in the Negev plan aimed at establishing a Jewish presence in the Negev in order to claim it as part of a future Jewish state. It was named after the Nir brigade of the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement, some of whose members helped establish the kibbutz, and was originally established on a site called \\"Dangour\\", where kibbutz Sufa is now. One of the founders was Dan Zur, who became one of Israel's leading landscape architects.Landscape architect Dan Zur dead at 86, Haaretz Nirim 1st October 1946 Kibbutz Nirim. Aerial photograph from Palmach archive. At the outbreak of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War on 15 May 1948, the kibbutz was first Jewish settlement in Israel to be attacked by the Egyptian army, in the Battle of Nirim. It had 39 defenders. During the battle, the Egyptians came within 25 meters of the kibbutz perimeter and eight of the kibbutz defenders were killed, before Egyptians withdrew. All of the houses were destroyed in the attack. Detail of mosaic floor at the ancient Maon Synagogue, Nirim Nirim remained an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) outpost against the Egyptian army throughout the war. After the war, the IDF wanted the site because of its strategic location, while the kibbutzniks wanted to move north, to the line of 200 millimeters of rain a year, so the kibbutz moved some 15 kilometers northeast to its present location, next to the site of an ancient synagogue at Horvat Maon. Nirim. 1948 During the Mapam split of 1952, Moshe Sneh's supporters were banished from the kibbutz. Until 1956, it was targeted by Fedayeen attacks from the Gaza Strip. Since 2000, Nirim has been hit by Qassam rockets fired from the Gaza Strip. After Israel's launching of Operation Cast Lead, in January 2009, most of Nirim's members, as well as other villages near the Gaza Strip, were evacuated. Dozens of families from Nirim stayed at kibbutz Mishmar HaEmek in the Jezreel Valley for a month, until the end of the operation. On August 26th 2014, on the last day of Operation Protective Edge, the head of security, Ze'ev \\"Ze'evik\\" Etzion and the assistant head of security Shachar Melamed, were killed in a rocket attack. They were both working with a team of electricians and other kibbutz members, attempting to reinstate the electricity to the community after the high voltage tower that supplied electricity to the whole kibbutz was hit by a rocket earlier the same day. The same rocket attack that killed Ze'evik and Shachar, blew off the legs of Gadi Yarkoni, who has since been elected mayor of the Eshkol Regional Council, and currently serving his second term. Economy Nirim produces organically grown peanuts, sweet potatoes, turnips, carrots, wheat, barley, avocado and other vegetables, and exports them to Europe. The farmers work the land right up to the Gaza Strip barrier. After Israel's disengagement from Gaza in 2005, the Defense Ministry decided to construct a security strip in the area surrounding Gaza, which was to run through Nirim agricultural territory. Nirim was asked to concede NIS 1 million of its compensation funds.

She was the mother of the poet and author Henry Lawson. Early life Louisa Albury was born on 17 February 1848 at Guntawang Station near Gulgong, New South Wales, the daughter of Henry Albury and Harriet Winn.New South Wales Registrar- General of Births, Deaths and Marriages She was the second of 12 children in a struggling family, and like many girls at that time left school at 13. On 7 July 1866 aged 18 she married Niels Larsen (Peter Lawson), a Norwegian sailor, at the Methodist parsonage at Mudgee, New South Wales. He was often away gold mining or working with his father-in-law, leaving her on her own to raise four children – Henry 1867, Jack 1869, Poppy 1873 and Lucy 1877, the twin of Tegan who died at eight months. Louisa grieved over the loss of Tegan for many years and left the care of her other children to the oldest child, Henry. This led to ill feelings on Henry's part towards his mother and the two often fought. In 1882 she and her children moved to Sydney, where she managed boarding houses.  Publisher Lawson used the money saved while running her boarding houses to purchase shares in the radical pro-federation newspaper The Republican in 1887. She and son Henry edited the Republican in 1887–88, which was printed on an old press in Louisa's cottage. The Republican called for an Australian republic uniting under 'the flag of a Federated Australia, the Great Republic of the Southern Seas'. The Republican was replaced by the Nationalist, but it lasted two issues.The National Library of Australia's Federation Gateway: Louisa Lawson, accessed 22 February 2011. With her earnings and her experience from working on The Republican, Lawson was able in May 1888, to edit and publish The Dawn, Australia's first journal produced solely by women which was distributed throughout Australia and overseas. The Dawn had a strong feminist perspective and frequently addressed issues such as women's right to vote and assume public office, women's education, women's economic and legal rights, domestic violence, and temperance. The Dawn was published monthly for 17 years (1888–1905) and at its height employed 10 female staff. Lawson's son Henry also contributed poems and stories for the paper, and in 1894 The Dawn press printed Henry's first book, Short Stories in Prose and Verse. Around 1904 Louisa published her own volume, Dert and Do, a simple story of 18,000 words.National Library of Australia, \\"Dert\\" and \\"Do\\", by Louisa Lawson , accessed 22 February 2011. In 1905 she collected and published her own verses, The Lonely Crossing and other Poems.National Library of Australia, The lonely crossing and other poems, by Louisa Lawson , accessed 22 February 2011. Louisa likely had a strong influence on her son's literary work in its earliest days. Suffragist In 1889 Lawson founded The Dawn Club, which became the hub of the suffrage movement in Sydney. In 1891 the Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales formed to campaign for women's suffrage, and Lawson allowed the League to use the Dawn office to print pamphlets and literature free of charge. When women were finally given the vote, in 1902 with the passing of the New South Wales Womanhood Suffrage Bill, Lawson was introduced to the members of Parliament as 'The Mother of Suffrage in New South Wales'. For the women at the time universal suffrage was not the key issue, Lawson did not criticise the government for failing to give Indigenous Australians the vote.  Later life Lawson retired in 1905 but continued to write for Sydney magazines and published The Lonely Crossing and Other Poems, a collection of 53 poems. She died on Thursday 12 August 1920 aged 72 after a long and painful illness in Gladesville Mental Hospital. On Saturday 14 August 1920, she was buried with her parents in the Church of England section of Rookwood Cemetery.  Memorials  Louisa Lawson was included in an Australian Women Series Stamp Issue, released in 1975 In 1941, The Sydney Morning Herald reported a memorial seat was to be erected in The Domain, Sydney as a tribute to Louisa Lawson. In 1975 Australia Post released a stamp in honour of Louisa. The Stamp was designed by Des and Jackie O'Brien, and was one in a series of six stamps released on 6 August 1975 to commemorate the International Year of Women. It was printed at the Melbourne Note Printing Branch, using the photogravure process in three colours.1975 Issues: Australian Stamp Catalogue, accessed 22 February 2011.Archival Snapshot, National Philatelic Collection accessed 10 April 2012 A park in Marrickville, New South Wales is named in her honour. The Louisa Lawson Reserve also contains a large colourful mosaic depicting the front cover of The Dawn, and a plaque that reads \\"Louisa Lawson (1848–1920) Social Reformer, writer, Feminist and Mother of Henry Lawson.

It publicised the actions of Waffen-SS combat units. The \\"Berichter\\" (literally: reporters) of the Standarte were expected to fight actively, if the situation demanded it, and were fully trained and equipped for combat. Operational history Gunter d'Alquen (1941), friend of the deceased Kurt Eggers and the leader of the SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers 200px The SS-Kriegsberichter-Kompanie (\\"SS War Reporter Company\\") was formed in January 1940 with four platoons of war correspondents and their support staff. The platoons were able to operate independently of each other, each equipped with still and movie cameras to enable to units to visually document the actions of Waffen-SS men in combat. The company came under the command of ex-Allgemeine-SS commander Günter d'Alquen who commanded the unit throughout its existence. One platoon was attached to each of the four Waffen- SS combat formations. These platoons were attached to their respective formations throughout the campaigns during the Battle of France and the invasion of Yugoslavia. By August 1941, the number of Waffen-SS formations had increased, and so the SS-Kriegsberichter-Kompanie increased in size as well, becoming the SS-Kriegsberichter-Abteilung (battalion). As the number of SS combat-formations increased, so did the number of correspondents required. In December 1943, the unit reached regimental size and received the name SS- Standarte Kurt Eggers. The honorary title referred to Kurt Eggers, SS war correspondent and editor of the SS magazine Das Schwarze Korps, who had been killed earlier in the year while reporting on the SS Division Wiking during the Third Battle of Kharkov. A number of foreign Waffen-SS volunteers became Kurt Eggers photographers, movie cameramen, writers, broadcasters and recorders, and most were multilingual. Several formations within the Standarte were formed to gather information for occupied or allied countries, and these sub-units were generally staffed by volunteers of the relevant nationality. At least two U.S. citizens, several British and a New Zealander served with the Standarte in the course of World War II. \\"Three English volunteers are known to have served in this unit, Railton Freeman (aka Royston and Metcalfe), who was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment after the War,Weale, Adrian (2014-11-12).

It is served by Sydney Trains T8 Airport & South and NSW TrainLink Southern Highlands Line services. It is the southern extremity of the electrified Sydney Trains network. History In 1976, a plan was created to build a new station 488m in the southern direction of the existing Campbelltown railway station. The plan for a \\"new\\" Campbelltown station was dropped and the plan was modified to be an unmanned, new, station. The plan was later changed to be 1800m to its current location, being built to serve a shopping centre being built 500m away. The station was originally supposed to be named Ambarvale, after the suburb it is located, but this was later changed to Macarthur, the name of the region.\\"Campbelltown Railway Station\\" ARHS Construction started in November 1983 with the station opening on 28 July 1985.\\"1983/84 Annual Report\\" Railway Digest April 1985 page 95Macarthur Station NSWrail.net\\"Macarthur Station's Few Trains\\" Railway Digest August 1985 page 233 It was initially only served by a few peak-hour services until a new timetable was introduced on 16 November 1986.\\"Supersize Trains for Central Coast\\" Railway Digest November 1986 page 339 The station initially consisted of two side platforms. Because suburban trains terminating on the main lines caused congestion to through trains, a side turnback platform was added in time for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Under the CityRail Clearways Project, Macarthur received an upgrade. This work, completed in late 2010, included refurbishment of the station, a bus interchange, and a new carpark. In a proposed second stage, Macarthur was to receive a fourth platform for through trains heading south, however, the project was cancelled.Macarthur Turnback Project Transport Construction Authority In January 2013, the Southern Sydney Freight Line opened to the west of the station. Electrification through the Macarthur station site was completed in 1968 as part of the Liverpool-Glenlee electrification project. Electric passenger trains terminated at Campbelltown, but freight trains continued to Glenlee coal siding and loader (now in Mount Annan) so that electrically hauled coal trains could connect it and Port Kembla. The Glenlee coal loader has closed and electric trains are stopped at Macarthur, with the wires only extending a few hundred metres down the line.

It was translated into English twice, both translations appearing in 1934, one by Haakon Chevalier under the title Man's Fate, published by Harrison Smith & Robert Haas in New York and republished by Random House as part of their Modern Library from 1936 on, and the other by Alastair MacDonald under the title Storm in Shanghai, published by Methuen in London and republished, still by Methuen, in 1948 as Man's Estate, to become a Penguin pocket in 1961. Currently the Chevalier translation is the only one still in regular print. The novel is about the failed communist insurrection in Shanghai in 1927, and the existential quandaries facing a diverse group of people associated with the revolution. Along with Les Conquérants (1928 – \\"The Conquerors\\") and La Voie Royale (1930 – \\"The Royal Way\\"), it forms a trilogy on revolution in Asia. In 1958 Hannah Arendt published The Human Condition, one of her central theoretical works, whose English name is identical to the French title of Malraux's book; to avoid confusion, Arendt's book was translated in French first as Condition de l’homme moderne (The Condition of the Modern Man), then as L'Humaine condition. Plot summary The novel occurs during a 22-day period mostly in Shanghai, China, and concerns mainly the socialist insurrectionists and others involved in the conflict. The four primary protagonists are Chen Ta Erh (whose name is spelled Tchen in the French original of the book), Kyoshi (\\"Kyo\\") Gisors, the Soviet emissary Katow, and Baron Clappique. Their individual plights are intertwined throughout the book. Chen Ta Erh is sent to assassinate an authority, succeeds, and is later killed in a failed suicide bombing attempt on Chiang Kai-shek. After the assassination, he becomes governed by fatality and desires simply to kill, thereby fulfill his duty as a terrorist, a duty which controls his life. This is largely the result of being so close to death since assassinating a man. He is so haunted by death and his powerlessness over inevitability that he wishes to die, just to end his torment. Kyo Gisors is the commander of the revolt and believes that every person should choose his own meaning, not be governed by any external forces. He spends most of the story trying to keep power in the hands of the workers rather than the Kuomintang army and resolving a conflict between himself and his wife, May. He is eventually captured and, in a final act of self-determination, chooses to take his own life with cyanide. Katow had faced execution once before, during the Russian Civil War and was saved at the last moment, which gives him a feeling of psychological immunity. After witnessing Kyo's death, he watches with a kind of calm detachment as his fellow revolutionaries are taken out one by one, to be thrown alive into the chamber of a steam locomotive waiting outside, intending, when his turn comes, to use his own cyanide capsule. But hearing two young Chinese activists talk with trembling fear of being burned alive, he gives them the cyanide (there is only enough for two), himself being left to face the more fearsome death. He thus dies in an act of self-sacrifice and solidarity with weaker comrades. Baron Clappique is a French merchant, smuggler, and obsessive gambler. He helps Kyo get a shipment of guns through and is later told that Kyo will be killed unless he leaves the city in 48 hours. On the way to warn him, he gets involved with gambling and cannot stop. He considers gambling \\"suicide without dying\\". Clappique is very good-humored and always cheerful all the time but suffers inwardly. He later escapes the city dressed as a sailor. =Characters= *Chen Ta Erh – the assassin, protagonist *Kyo Gisors – the leader of the revolt, protagonist *Baron Clappique – a French merchant and smuggler, protagonist *Old Gisors – Kyo's father, one-time professor of Sociology at the University of Peking, and an opium addict, acts as a guide for Kyo and Ch’en *May Gisors – Kyo's wife and a German doctor, born in Shanghai *Katow – a Russian, one of the organizers of the insurrection, he is burned alive for treason. *Hemmelrich – a Belgian phonograph-dealer *Yu Hsuan – his partner *Kama – a Japanese painter, Old Gisors' brother-in-law *Ferral – president of the French chamber of commerce and head of the France-Asiatic Consortium; he struggles with his relationship with Valerie because he only wishes to possess her as an object *Valerie – Ferral's girlfriend. *Konig – chief of Chiang Kai-shek's police *Suan – young Chinese terrorist who helped Ch’en, later arrested in the same attack in which Ch'en was killed *Pei – also helper of Ch’en Awards and nominations This book won the Prix Goncourt French literature award in 1933, and in 1999 was named number five in Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century. Critical reception The journalist Christopher Hitchens, while noting that Malraux had spent almost no time in China, claimed that the novel \\"pointed up the increasing weight of Asia in world affairs; it described epic moments of suffering and upheaval, in Shanghai especially (it was nearly filmed by Sergei Eisenstein); and it demonstrated a huge respect for Communism and for Communists while simultaneously evoking the tragedy of a revolution betrayed by Moscow.\\" His biographer Olivier Todd quotes the novel as saying \\"It was neither true nor false but what was experienced,\\" and remarks that Malraux's China itself was \\"neither true in its detail nor false overall, but it is nonetheless imaginary,\\" and that it \\"cannot quite break clear of a conventional idea of China with coolies, bamboo shoots, opium smokers, destitutes, and prostitutes.\\" A 1972 Penguin edition of the MacDonald translation claims on its back cover that Malraux had been \\"a member of the revolutionary committee\\" in Shanghai. This claim is false. Film adaptations Four attempts have been made to adapt Man's Fate as a motion picture. The first involved Fred Zinnemann, who spent three years preparing his film version of Man's Fate before the producing studio, Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, cancelled the production one week before filming was to begin in November 1969. Independent producer Sidney Beckerman hired Costa-Gavras to adapt the novel and direct in 1979, but the project was abandoned when the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China denied permission to film in the country. The Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci proposed adapting the novel in the 1980s to the Chinese government; they preferred his alternative proposal, The Last Emperor, a 1987 biopic based on the life of the Chinese Emperor Puyi. In 2001, U.S. filmmaker Michael Cimino announced he would create a film version of Man's Fate but, as of his death, the project remained unrealized.

It was founded in 1834 and has a wooded campus spanning 207 acres including athletic fields and a 31-acre biology woodland. The college offers its approximately 1,000 students Bachelor of Arts degrees in 49 majors from 25 academic disciplines, 43 minors, 11 pre-professional programs and five cooperative programs. The college also offers a Master of Science in Athletic Training and a Master of Science in Physician Assistants Studies. In 1842, the college began admitting women, becoming the first coeducational institution in Indiana and the seventh in the nation. Franklin College has historically maintained an affiliation with the American Baptist Churches USA. History Franklin College was originally founded as Indiana Baptist Manual-Labor Institute, a manual labor college. Academics The school offers major topics of study, including biology, chemistry, journalism, art, political science, theatre and music. There are 49 majors from 25 academic disciplines, 43 minors, 11 pre-professional programs, two master's programs and five cooperative programs. Individualized majors and minors are also available. Franklin College places a large emphasis on the liberal arts and sciences curriculum, requiring students to reorient themselves with standard mathematics, world history, literature, English and speech skills as well as take one class in the following categories: fine arts, life sciences, social sciences, intercultural, international and philosophy/religion, regardless of their intended major and/or minor. All students also must complete at least one internship during their years at Franklin College and many majors require an internship for a semester. In addition to the traditional fall and spring semesters, a month-long term in January is also held as most students wouldn't be able to acquire all necessary credits and liberal arts requirements through just the two main semesters. During this time, students can take classes for credit (one Immersive Term class is required to graduate), including a few not offered during the rest of the year (topics have ranged from immigration to computer animation to Alfred Hitchcock), do internships for their majors and take travel courses to foreign countries that satisfy the international requirement for the Liberal Arts curriculum. Trips to England, France and Ireland are quite common, but other locations have included Uganda, Costa Rica, Senegal and Japan. While many students take these courses through programs offered by the college, some make arrangements through other organizations and financial aid is also available for students who plan to study in foreign countries. Though Immersive Term is the most common time for international travel, students also have the opportunities to stay for a semester or full year if their schedules allow it. =Rankings= * Ranked #1 national liberal arts college in Indiana by Washington Monthly - 2016 * Ranked 44th top national liberal arts college in the country by Washington Monthly - 2016 * The only Indiana college ranked in Money’s Top 50 for Most Value Added - 2015 * Ranked 9th in U.S. News and World Report’s Best Value category and 11th among Best Regional Colleges in the Midwest - 2015 Campus Located in Franklin, the college's campus includes an athletic park and a woodland for biology study. Nearly all the buildings on campus are placed around an ellipse known as Dame Mall, named after John Dame, the first-ever graduate of Franklin College. In 1962, a large statue of Benjamin Franklin was gifted to the college from the Indianapolis Typographical Union. It on campus today at the corner of Branigin Boulevard and Monroe Street. The bronze \\"Ben Bench\\" outside the Napolitan Student Center was donated to the college in 2005 by Bohdan Mysko, a retired businessman and art collector. He purchased the sculpture from artist George Lundeen in 1990. The sculpture was produced sixteenth in a series of the 20 identical ones that Lundeen created. The Von Boll Welcome Center was opened in 2003 and houses the offices of admissions and financial aid. The Napolitan Student Center, opened in 2004, is a hub of student activity on campus and home to the dining hall, the college bookstore, a large atrium, the Center for Diversity and Inclusion, the Student Activity Center, Grizzly Cafe, campus security office, conference rooms, counseling and health center, and the Branigin Room, which is used for lectures, award ceremonies and community functions. Branigin Boulevard, opened in 2004, serves as the main entrance to campus. The project was a collaboration between the college and the city of Franklin. The Napolitan Alumni House was dedicated in 2005. The historic three-story brick house once served as the home to college presidents. It currently serves as a gathering place during special events as well as accommodations for visiting dignitaries. Another hub of student activity is the Spurlock Center, which contains classroom space, a fitness center, gymnasium, indoor track, the Franklin College Athletic Hall of Fame and athletic offices. This is also where pep rallies, school assemblies, commencement and numerous presentations involving guest speakers are held. Richardson Chapel hosts services and special events for students, faculty, staff and the community. The Wellhouse that stands in Dame Mall was constructed in 1916 and was built by Blache Crawford, class of 1916. The Dietz Center for Professional Development was dedicated in 1994. It houses the offices of Leadership Johnson County at Franklin College and connects to the Dietz Residence Hall. The Andrews-Dietz House on campus was dedicated in 2005 and houses the Marketing and Communications Offices. =Educational buildings= Shirk Hall *Old Main, the iconic clock tower located at the campus entrance, is used for classes in varying subjects. It also houses offices for areas of campus such as Information Technology Services, Development and Alumni Engagement, the Business Office, the President's Office and a variety of faculty and staff offices. It also houses Custer Theatre where choir concerts and other functions take place. This building was almost completely destroyed by a fire on April 21, 1985. On the stairwell landing is a wooden stand with a bronze bust of Benjamin Franklin that is known for having paint rubbed off its nose due to students touching it. (College legend says doing so before an exam will bring good luck). *The Franklin College Science Center is the newest facility on campus and is where most undergraduate science classes are held. *The Franklin College Graduate Health Science Center opened in 2018 and is where the college's master's programs are housed. *Johnson Center for Fine Arts, called JCFA for short, was opened in 2001 and is where fine arts classes are held. School plays also are performed here in Theatre Margot. *Shirk Hall, constructed in 1903, houses the Pulliam School of Journalism, is home to the Indiana High School Press Association and to radio station 89.5 WFCI and The Franklin, the college's student-run newspaper. *B.F. Hamilton Memorial Library has a 24-hour computer lab, auditorium, Academic Resource Center, Silent Study area (2nd floor) and Disability Services. Old Main and Shirk Hall were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. = Residence Halls = *Elsey Hall is a predominately freshmen dormitory that has exclusively double rooms (with the exception of RA rooms, but others can use one as a single for a fee). Originally, it was the only all-female dormitory on campus. Elsey Hall is connected to the four Panhellenic suites belonging to the three (formerly four) sororities. *Hoover-Cline, two buildings connected by a glass tunnel and located in the center of campus, provides singles, doubles and quads (exclusive to Hoover). *Johnson-Dietz, for upperclassmen only, is two separate buildings and popular due to the residential suites with bay windows that are occupied by 3–4 people. Many on campus refer to it as \\"The Sections\\" because several suites are grouped in a particular section marked by a letter. *Dietz Center, for upperclassmen only, offers single rooms and suites. Popular for its environment, the attached Dietz Center for Professional Development building is also used for community purposes and houses offices. All campus- owned residence halls have air-conditioning, host events organized by RAs, have Wi-Fi and free laundry facilities. =Themed and Greek Housing= Three of the four active fraternities currently have houses and provide residence to their members. Two other homes on campus are themed. One is used as housing for students enrolled in the college's master's programs. The other is called the BOLD (Building Our Leaders Through Diversity) House, which aims to promote and understanding an respect for multiculturalism and diversity and to provide intellectual, social and cultural programs focused on multicultural enrichment. The BOLD community was displaced from its house in Spring 2019, and the Living-Learning Community now resides in Section A of the Johnson- Dietz residence hall. = Greek Life = Franklin College is home to four fraternities and three sororities that are active. It's estimated that 40 percent of Franklin College students are involved in Greek Life. Of the fraternities, three out of the four provide housing, whereas the sororities use reserved Panhellenic suites owned by the college for meetings, ceremonies and other activities. The Greek community plays an active role on campus and holds multiple philanthropic events throughout the year. The fraternities include Sigma Alpha Epsilon (Indiana Alpha; 1892–present), Phi Delta Theta (Indiana Delta; 1860– Suspended 2016, Recolonized 2019), Kappa Delta Rho (Epsilon; 1919–present, inactive from 1972 to '80), Lambda Chi Alpha (Kappa Gamma; 1924–present) and Tau Kappa Epsilon (Rho Upsilon; 1988–present). The sororities that are currently active include Zeta Tau Alpha (Beta Theta; 1927–present), Delta Delta Delta (Delta Zeta; 1912–present) and Pi Beta Phi (Indiana Alpha; 1888–present). At one point, Franklin College also had three additional sororities that are no longer active - Kappa Kappa Gamma (Nu; 1879–1884), Delta Gamma (Phi Alpha; 1995–2008) and Delta Zeta (Psi; 1920–1990). The seemingly abandoned third of the four Panhellenic Suites on campus was used by Delta Gamma (they used it until they closed in Fall 2008). Today, the suite is used by the fraternity without on-campus housing, Lambda Chi Alpha. In addition, benches on campus have been dedicated to both chapters and there are display cases in the Napolitan Student Center in their honor that show photos, shirts and other insignia belonging to their members. Athletics Franklin College is a charter member of the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference and it still competes in this conference. Originally, there was no official name that Franklin College teams competed as. Due to the college's affiliation with the Baptist church, names such as “The Fighting Baptists” was used. One of the first documented uses of the name “Grizzlies” can be found in 1929. This name originates from the nickname of Ernest “Griz” Wagner. In the 1920s, Wagner coached the Franklin College basketball known as the Franklin Wonder Five (1918–1926), after having previously coached the core of the team in high school. This combination won three consecutive Indiana High School Championships (1920–1922) and in the 1922–1923 season, the team won 50 consecutive games, defeating Purdue University, University of Notre Dame, University of Illinois, and University of Wisconsin. In NCAA Division III football, Franklin College has a rivalry with Hanover College dating from 1898. Since 1938, the annual winner of the game wins the Victory Bell, hence the name of the game, the “Victory Bell Game.” As of November 16, 2019 Hanover leads the series 44–42–3. The football team, the women's lacrosse team, and both the men's and women's soccer teams play at Faught Stadium. This field is named for Stewart “Red” Faught. Faught coached football at Franklin College for 32 years (1956–1988) and acquired a record of 160 wins. One of his players, Terry L. Hoeppner, went on to become the head football coach for Miami University and Indiana University. Men's athletic teams include baseball, basketball, cross county, football, golf, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis and track and field. Women's athletic teams include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball, swimming and diving and track and field.

There are numerous varieties of Syrian cheese found throughout the Levant such as the Kenafa, Surke, Baladi, and Tresse.  Types of cheese  Some of the most common types of cheese from Syria are: = Ackawi = Akkawi cheese served with cherries Ackawi (also Akawi and Akawieh) is a white cheese with a complex flavor. It is an Arab cheese originating from the town of Acre, Israel (Akka in Arabic). The cheese is commonly made using pasteurized cow's milk but can be made with goat or sheep's milk. It is produced on a large scale in Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Cyprus. = Baladi = Baladi is a soft-white, smooth, creamy cheese with a mild flavour, usually spread on fresh bread or crackers and most often eaten for breakfast or snacks. Baladi is fresh, traditionally unpasteurized, and uncultured and is made with a mixture of goat, cow and sheep's milk. Its diverse microflora, high moisture, uncultured, and unpasteurized nature tend to limit shelf life to three days. = Charkassiyea = Charkassiyea is a soft, fresh cheese. = Jibneh Arabieh = Jibneh Arabieh (Arabic for: Arab cheese) is a simple cheese found throughout the Middle East and is particularly popular in Egypt and the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf.

Sideshows first appeared in Oakland, California in the 1980s as informal social gatherings of youth. Sideshows were made even more popular throughout the 1990s with such songs as bay area rapper Richie Rich's \\"Sideshow\\" anthem. \\"Down Bancroft / To the light / Let me warm it up, I hit a donut tight / Chevy on my side / Windows straight tinted / He got hype when he saw me spinnin’ / I’m up outta there, sideways to the next light\\" History Sideshows first emerged on the streets of Oakland, California during the mid 1980s. The first sideshows were originally ad hoc carshows where people would congregate in Eastmont Mall parking lot. The original intent of the sideshows at this time was for people to show off their cars, usually American muscle cars from the 1960s and 1970s. These cars were often highly customized with elaborate paint jobs, all leather interiors, wire rims and modified high performance engines. Around the early 1990s, sideshows grew so popular that they had outgrown the parking lots of Eastmont Mall. By the mid '90s, the sideshow became the alternative hot spot for those too young to gain entrance into 21 and over nightclubs. Activities Common activities at sideshows include doughnuts and ghostriding. The latter involves driving a car, opening the door and climbing out, blasting off, sometimes onto the hood, sometimes standing or dancing next to the car while the car continues to roll. Violent incidents, including fights and shootings, sometimes occur at the events. Law enforcement To crack down on the illegal sideshows, the Oakland Police Department opened a police substation at Eastmont Mall and set up \\"No Cruising Zones\\" along International Boulevard. In efforts to keep the events from spreading west to Downtown Oakland, an additional no cruising law was established along Grand Avenue and Lakeshore Avenue in 1996. The phenomenon is most strongly associated with the city of Oakland (the birthplace of the sideshow), with the events there often being attended by those in the hip hop community. Such events are promoted in local rap by artists including E-40. On June 8, 2005, the Oakland City Council narrowly defeated a measure (pushed by then-Mayor Jerry Brown) which would have subjected spectators at sideshows to criminal sanctions, such as fines and even jail terms. Drivers face various penalties, including having their cars impounded. On April 30, 2019, the San Jose City Council passed an ordinance making spectators punishable with a fine of up to $1,000 and 6 months in jail.

He became doge in 1339, but was ousted from power six years later. He regained the position in 1356, retaining it until his death in 1363. His story was popularized by Antonio García Gutiérrez's 1843 play Simón Bocanegra and Giuseppe Verdi's 1857 opera Simon Boccanegra. Note the spellings.  Biography  Belonging to the wealthy Genoese Boccanegra family of merchants, a family that had among its members Guglielmo Boccanegra, that in 1257 became a virtual dictator of the Republic of Genoa, when an insurrection against the government of the old aristocracy made him gain the control of the republic. Guglielmo Boccanegra was also the commissioner, in 1260, of the building of Palazzo San Giorgio, the future seat of republican power in the republic. Life as doge Boccanegra was elected doge for life on December 23, 1339. Boccanegra was opposed by the aristocratic, representing the old mercantile patriciate, which his first actions excluded from public life. With the old patriciate excluded from power, a new class of mercantile houses arose: Adorno, Guarco, Fregoso, and Montaldo. During Boccanegra's dogate, Genoese control was extended the length of both the French and Italian Rivieras, with the exception of the Grimaldi holdings in Monaco and Ventimiglia. Simone’s brother Egidio, was a grand admiral in the service of Alfonso XI of Castile, and inflicted a memorable defeat on a Moroccan fleet off Algeciras in 1344. There were constant conspiracies and even attempts against Boccanegra's life from the start. (The first conspirator's head rolled on December 20, 1339.) This led to the establishment of a bodyguard of 103 mounted soldiers. For Boccanegra's security these were drawn from Pisa, the inveterate enemy of Genoa, where, however, Simone's brother Niccolò was \\"captain of the people\\", their mother having been a Pisan aristocrat. Resignation and death denaro grosso (\\"thick penny\\") from the time of Simone Boccanegra Boccanegra was forced to resign his office at a public meeting he had called, December 23, 1345. He was succeeded by Giovanni I di Murta, who died in early January 1350 and then by Giovanni II Valente, who ruled as chief magistrate, until Boccanegra regained power in 1356. Boccanegra died in 1363, possibly having been poisoned by agents of his enemies. In culture 19th century fresco probably intended to depict Simone Boccanegra, at Palazzo San Giorgio (Genoa). The humanist poet Petrarch wrote letters to the people of Genoa and to the doge of Venice appealing to them to end their fratricidal wars and find a common aim. These letters were among Verdi's inspirations for the revision of the opera in 1881. Simone Boccanegra's tomb in the no longer extant church of San Francesco in Castelletto was decorated with a remarkable funeral sculpture, depicting him as if lying in state with extraordinary realism in his features. This sculpture is now in the Museum of Sant'Agostino.

The history of Boston plays a central role in American history. In 1630, Puritan colonists from England founded Boston, which quickly became the political, commercial, financial, religious and educational center of the New England region. The American Revolution erupted in Boston, as the British retaliated harshly for the Boston Tea Party and the patriots fought back. They besieged the British in the city, with a famous battle at Breed's Hill in Charlestown on June 17, 1775 (which was lost by the colonists, but inflicted great damage against the British) and won the Siege of Boston, forcing the British to evacuate the city on March 17, 1776. However, the combination of American and British blockades of the town and port during the conflict seriously damaged the economy, and the population fell by two thirds in the 1770s. The city recovered after 1800, re-establishing its role as the transportation hub for the New England region with its network of railroads, and even more importantly, the intellectual, educational and medical center of the nation. Along with New York, Boston was the financial center of the United States in the 19th century, and was especially important in funding railroads nationwide. In the Civil War era, it was the base for many anti-slavery activities. In the 19th century the city was dominated by an elite known as the Boston Brahmins. They faced the political challenge coming from Catholic immigrants. The Irish Catholics, typified by the Kennedy Family, took political control of the city by 1900. The industrial foundation of the region, financed by Boston, reached its peak around 1950; thereafter thousands of textile mills and other factories were closed down and the city went into decline. By the 21st century the city's economy had recovered and was centered on education, medicine, and high technology—notably biotechnology, while the many surrounding towns became residential suburbs. Prehistoric era The Shawmut Peninsula was originally connected to the mainland to its south by a narrow isthmus, Boston Neck, and surrounded by Boston Harbor and the Back Bay, an estuary of the Charles River. Several prehistoric Native American archaeological sites, including the Boylston Street Fishweir, excavated during construction of buildings and subways in the city, have shown that the peninsula was inhabited as early as 7,500 years Before Present. Founding This diagram shows the original dimension of the Shawmut Peninsula. The gray areas marked with the words \\"New Boston\\" are all land reclaimed during the 19th century. In 1625, William Blaxton, an early English settler, decided to live alone on the Shawmut PeninsulaHorsford, Eben Norton, The Indian Names of Boston, and their Meaning, John Wilson and Son, Cambridge, MA, University Press, 1886. after most of his fellow travelers of the Ferdinando Gorges expedition returned to England. He became the first European colonist to settle in Boston. A group of English Puritans founded the Plymouth Colony in 1620, just to the south of Massachusetts Bay. The Puritans encouraged further colonial settlement and immigration to the New World because King Charles I of England was in favor of suppressing the religious practices of Puritans in England. Eventually in 1629, the Cambridge Agreement was signed in England among some of the Puritans, established a self-governing colony, the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and they decided to settle to the New World. John Winthrop was their leader; he would become governor of the settlement in the New World. In a famous sermon before the Puritans' departure, \\"A Model of Christian Charity,\\" Winthrop described the new colony as \\"a City upon a Hill.\\" In June 1630, the Winthrop Fleet arrived in what would later be called Salem, which on account of lack of food, \\"pleased them not.\\"Weston, George F. Boston Ways: High, By & Folk, Beacon Press: Beacon Hill, Boston, p.11–15 (1957). They proceeded to Charlestown, just across the river from the Shawmut Peninsula; however Charlestown pleased them less, for lack of fresh water. William Blaxton noticed the Puritan settlement, and invited them to move to the Shawmut peninsula, for the peninsula had an \\"excellent spring\\" on the north side of what is now Beacon Hill.Shurtleff, Nathaniel B., A Topographical and Historical Description of Boston, printed by request of Boston City Council, Boston, 1871. The Puritans accepted, acquired the land on the peninsula from Blaxton and Chickatawbut, the Native American sachem.OBJECT OF THE MONTH OBJECT OF THE MONTH ARCHIVE ABOUT Indian deed for Boston, March 19, 1685, September 2006, Carrie Supple, Assistant Reference Librarian https://www.masshist.org/object-of-the-month/objects/indian-deed-for- boston-2006-09-01 The Puritans eventually settled around the spring near the Beacon Hill; their settlement would eventually become today's Boston. They granted Blaxton some lands in return, which eventually evolves into today's Boston Common. Copp's Hill Burying Ground, founded 1659 The Puritan settlers initially named the peninsula that would later become the heart of Boston as \\"Trimountaine,\\" the name was derived from a set of three prominent hills on the peninsula, two of which were leveled as the city was modernized. The middle one, Beacon Hill, shortened between 1807 and 1824, remains to this day as a prominent feature of the Boston cityscape. Tremont Street still carries an alternative form of the original name. The two smaller peaks were Cotton Hill (named after John Cotton, but later Pemberton Hill, at what is now Pemberton Square) and Mt. Whoredom (or Mt. Vernon, formerly at the location of the modern-day Louisburg Square). Governor Winthrop announced the foundation of the town of Boston on September 7, 1630 (Old Style), with the place named after the town of Boston, in the English county of Lincolnshire, from which several prominent colonists emigrated. The name also derives from Saint Botolph, who is the patron saint of travelers.Kay, Jane Holtz, Lost Boston, Amherst : University of Massachusetts Press, 2006. . Cf. p.4Thurston, H. (1907). \\"St. Botulph.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved June 17, 2014 from New Advent: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02709a.htm Colonial era Early colonists believed that Boston was a community with a special covenant with God, as captured in Winthrop's \\"City upon a Hill\\" metaphor. This influenced every facet of Boston life, and made it imperative that colonists legislate morality as well as enforce marriage, church attendance, education in the Word of God, and the persecution of sinners. One of the first schools in America, Boston Latin School (1635), and the first college in America, Harvard College (1636), were founded shortly after Boston's European settlement.

During the Antinomian Controversy of 1636 to 1638 religious dissident leader Anne Hutchinson and Puritan clergyman John Wheelwright were both banished from the colony. Baptist minister Obadiah Holmes was imprisoned and publicly whipped in 1651 because of his religion and Henry Dunster, the first president of Harvard College during the 1640s–50s, was persecuted for espousing Baptist beliefs. By 1679, Boston Baptists were bold enough to open their own meetinghouse, which was promptly closed by colonial authorities. Expansion and innovation in practice and worship characterized the early Baptists despite the restrictions on their religious liberty.Milton P. Ryder, \\"Swimming Against the Current: The Strange Therapy of Persecution; The Price Paid for Religious Liberty by Some Early Massachusetts Baptists and the First Baptist Church of Boston,\\" American Baptist Quarterly, March 2002, Vol. 21 Issue 1, pp 11–27 On June 1, 1660, Mary Dyer was hanged on Boston Common for repeatedly defying a law banning Quakers from being in the colony. A \\"History of Boston\\" would not be complete without discussing John Hull, the pine tree shilling, his central role in the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the Old South Church. In 1652 the Massachusetts legislature authorized John Hull to produce coinage (mintmaster). \\"The Hull Mint produced several denominations of silver coinage, including the pine tree shilling, for over 30 years until the political and economic situation made operating the mint no longer practical.\\" Mostly political for Charles II deemed the \\"Hull Mint\\" high treason in the United Kingdom which had a punishment of Hanging, drawing and quartering. \\"On April 6, 1681, Edward Randolph (colonial administrator) petitioned the king, informing him the colony was still pressing their own coins which he saw as high treason and believed it was enough to void the charter.

The lower route ran near present-day U.S. 1 via Providence, Rhode Island. The upper route, laid out in 1673, left via Boston Neck and followed present-day U.S. Route 20 until around Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. It continued through Worcester, Springfield, and New Haven, Connecticut. Bunker Hill Monument From 1686 until 1689, Massachusetts and surrounding colonies were united. This larger province, known as the Dominion of New England, was governed by Sir Edmund Andros, an appointee of King James II. Andros, who supported the Church of England in a largely Puritan city, grew increasingly unpopular. On April 18, 1689, he was overthrown due to a brief revolt. The Dominion was not reestablished. =Disasters in the 1700s= A particularly virulent sequence of six smallpox outbreaks took place from 1636 to 1698. In 1721–22, the most severe epidemic occurred, killing 844 people. Out of a population of 10,500, 5889 caught the disease, 844 (14%) died, and at least 900 fled the city, thereby spreading the virus.Ballard C. Campbell, ed. American Disasters: 201 Calamities That Shook the Nation (2008) pp 21–22 Colonists tried to prevent the spread of smallpox by isolation. For the first time in America, inoculation was tried; it causes a mild form of the disease. Inoculation was itself very controversial because of the threat that the procedure itself could be fatal to 2% of those who were treated, or otherwise spread the disease. It was introduced by Zabdiel Boylston and Cotton Mather.Ola Elizabeth Winslow, A destroying angel: The conquest of smallpox in colonial Boston (1974) In 1755, Boston endured the largest earthquake ever to hit the Northeastern United States, (estimated at 6.0 to 6.3 on the Richter magnitude scale), called the Cape Ann earthquake. There was some damage to buildings, but no deaths.John E. Ebel, \\"The Cape Ann earthquake of November 1755 a historical perspective on its 254th anniversary\\" (2009) p 2Ballard C. Campbell, ed. American Disasters: 201 Calamities That Shook the Nation (2008) pp 28–30 The first \\"Great Fire\\" of Boston destroyed 349 buildings on March 20, 1760. It was one of many significant fires fought by the Boston Fire Department. Boston and the American Revolution, 1765–1775 A map showing the British Army's tactical evaluation of Boston in 1775. Boston had taken an active role in the protests against the Stamp Act of 1765. Its merchants avoided the customs duties which angered London officials and led to a crackdown on smuggling. Governor Thomas Pownall (1757 to 1760) tried to be conciliatory, but his replacement Governor Francis Bernard (1760–69) was a hard-liner who wanted to stamp out the opposition voices that were growing louder and louder in town meetings and pamphlets. Historian Pauline Maier says that his letters to London greatly influenced officials there, but they \\"distorted\\" reality. \\"His misguided conviction that the 'faction' had espoused violence as its primary method of opposition, for example, kept him from recognizing the radicals' peace-keeping efforts....Equally dangerous, Bernard's elaborate accounts were sometimes built on insubstantial evidence.\\" Warden argues that Bernard was careful not to explicitly ask London for troops, but his exaggerated accounts strongly suggested they were needed. In the fall of 1767 he warned about a possible insurrection in Boston any day, and his exaggerated report of one disturbance in 1768, \\"certainly had given Lord Hillsboro the impression that troops were the only way to enforce obedience in the town.\\" Warden notes that other key British officials in Boston wrote London with the \\"same strain of hysteria.\\"G. B. Warden, Boston 1689–1776 (1970) pp 213–14 Four thousand British Army troops arrived in Boston in October 1768 as a massive show of force; tensions escalated. A map showing Boston and vicinity, including Bunker Hill, Dorchester Heights, and troop disposition of Gen. Artemas Ward during the Siege of Boston. From \\"Marshall's Life of Washington\\" (1806). By the late 1760s Americans focused on their rights as Englishmen, especially the principle of \\"No Taxation without Representation,\\" as articulated by John Rowe, James Otis, Samuel Adams and other Boston firebrands. Boston played the primary role in sparking both the American Revolution and the ensuing American Revolutionary War. The Boston Massacre came on March 5, 1770, when British soldiers fired into unarmed demonstrators outside the British custom house, resulting in the deaths of five civilians and dramatically escalating tensions.Hiller B. Zobel, The Boston Massacre (1970) Parliament, meanwhile, insisted on its right to tax the Americans and finally came up with a small tax on tea. Up and down the 13 colonies, Americans prevented merchants from selling the tea, but a shipment arrived in Boston Harbor. On December 16, 1773, 30–60 local Sons of Liberty, disguised as Native Americans, dumped 342 chests of tea in the harbor in the Boston Tea Party. The Sons of Liberty decided to take action in order to defy Britain's new tax on tea, but the British government retaliated with a series of harsh laws, closing down the Port of Boston and stripping Massachusetts of its self-government. The other colonies rallied in solidarity behind Massachusetts, setting up the First Continental Congress, while arming and training militia units. The British sent more troops to Boston, and made its commander General Thomas Gage the governor. Gage believed the Patriots were hiding munitions in the town of Concord, and he sent troops to capture them. Paul Revere, William Dawes, and Dr. Samuel Prescott made their famous midnight rides to alert the Minutemen in the surrounding towns, who fought the resulting Battle of Lexington and Concord in April 1775. It was the first battle of the American Revolution. Militia units across New England rallied to the defense of Boston, and Congress sent in General George Washington to take command. The British were trapped in the city, and suffered very heavy losses in their victory at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Washington brought in artillery and forced the British out as the patriots took full control of Boston. The American victory on March 17, 1776, is celebrated as Evacuation Day. The city has preserved and celebrated its revolutionary past, from the harboring of the USS Constitution to the many famous sites along the Freedom Trail. 19th century =Economic and population growth= Boston was transformed from a relatively small and economically stagnant town in 1780 to a bustling seaport and cosmopolitan center with a large and highly mobile population by 1800. It had become one of the world's wealthiest international trading ports, exporting products like rum, fish, salt and tobacco.University Archives Colonial Boston The upheaval of the American Revolution, and the British naval blockade that shut down its economy, had caused a majority of the population to flee the city. From a base of 10,000 in 1780, the population approached 25,000 by 1800. The abolition of slavery in the state in 1783 gave blacks greater physical mobility, but their social mobility was slow.Jacqueline Barbara Carr, \\"A Change 'as Remarkable as the Revolution Itself': Boston's Demographics, 1780–1800,\\" New England Quarterly, Dec 2000, Vol. 73 Issue 4, pp 583–602 Boston was part of the New England corner of triangular trade, receiving sugar from the Caribbean and refining it into rum and molasses, partly for export to Europe. Later, confectionery manufacturing would become another refined product made from similar raw materials. Related companies with facilities in Boston included the Boston Sugar Refinery (inventors of granulated sugar), Domino Sugar, the Purity Distilling Company, Necco, Schrafft's, Squirrel Brands (as the predecessor Austin T. Merrill Company of Roxbury) American Nut and Chocolate (1927) This legacy continued into the 20th century; by 1950, there were 140 candy companies in Boston. (Others were located in and some moved to nearby Cambridge.) The Boston Fruit Company began importing tropical fruit from the Caribbean in 1885; it is a predecessor of United Fruit Company and Chiquita Brands International. Boston had the status of a town; it was chartered as a city in 1822.US History.com, Cities, Boston, Massachusetts The second mayor was Josiah Quincy III, who undertook infrastructure improvements in roads and sewers, and organized the city's dock area around the newly erected Faneuil Hall Marketplace, popularly known as Quincy Market. By the mid-19th century Boston was one of the largest manufacturing centers in the nation, noted for its garment production, leather goods, and machinery industries. Manufacturing overtook international trade to dominate the local economy. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region made for easy shipment of goods and allowed for a proliferation of mills and factories. The building of the Middlesex Canal extended this small river network to the larger Merrimack River and its mills, including the Lowell mills and mills on the Nashua River in New Hampshire. By the 1850s, an even denser network of railroads (see also List of railroad lines in Massachusetts) facilitated the region's industry and commerce. For example, in 1851, Eben Jordan and Benjamin L. Marsh opened the Jordan Marsh Department store in downtown Boston. Thirty years later William Filene opened his own department store across the street, called Filene's. Several turnpikes were constructed between cities to aid transportation, especially of cattle and sheep to markets. A major east-west route, the Worcester Turnpike (now Massachusetts Route 9), was constructed in 1810. Others included the Newburyport Turnpike (now Route 1) and the Salem Lawrence Turnpike (now Route 114). =Brahmin elite= Boston's \\"Brahmin elite\\" developed a particular semi-aristocratic value system by the 1840s—cultivated, urbane, and dignified, the ideal Brahmin was the very essence of enlightened aristocracy.Ronald Story, Harvard and the Boston Upper Class: The Forging of an Aristocracy, 1800–1970 (1985).Paul Goodman, \\"Ethics and Enterprise: The Values of a Boston Elite, 1800–1860,\\" American Quarterly, Sept 1966, Vol. 18 Issue 3, pp 437–451 He was not only wealthy, but displayed suitable personal virtues and character traits. The term was coined in 1861 by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.Holmes entitled the first chapter of his 1861 novel Elsie Venner \\"The Brahmin caste of New England\\"; he had long been writing about the group without using the term \\"Brahmin.\\" The Brahmin had high expectations to meet: to cultivate the arts, support charities such as hospitals and colleges, and assume the role of community leader. Although the ideal called on him to transcend commonplace business values, in practice many found the thrill of economic success quite attractive. The Brahmins warned each other against \\"avarice\\" and insisted upon \\"personal responsibility.\\" Scandal and divorce were unacceptable. The total system was buttressed by the strong extended family ties present in Boston society. Young men attended the same prep schools and colleges,Ronald Story, \\"Harvard Students, The Boston Elite, And The New England Preparatory System, 1800–1870,\\" History of Education Quarterly, Fall 1975, Vol. 15 Issue 3, pp 281–298 and had their own way of talking. Heirs married heiresses. Family not only served as an economic asset, but also as a means of moral restraint. Most belonged to the Unitarian or Episcopal churches, although some were Congregationalists or Methodists. Politically, they were successively Federalists, Whigs, and Republicans. A poem about Boston, attributed to various people, describes the city thus: \\"And here's to good old Boston / The land of the bean and the cod / Where Lowells talk only to Cabots / and Cabots talk only to God.\\" While wealthy colonial families like the Lowells and Cabots (often called the Boston Brahmins) ruled the city, the 1840s brought waves of new immigrants from Europe. These included large numbers of Irish and Italians, giving the city a large Roman Catholic population. =Abolitionists= View of Boston from Dorchester Heights, 1841. In 1831, William Lloyd Garrison founded The Liberator, an abolitionist newsletter, in Boston. It advocated \\"immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves\\" in the United States, and established Boston as the center of the abolitionist movement. After the passing of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Boston became a bastion of abolitionist thought. Attempts by slave-catchers to arrest fugitive slaves often proved futile, which included the notable case of Anthony Burns and Kevin McLaughlin. After the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854, Boston also became the hub of efforts to send anti-slavery New Englanders to settle in Kansas Territory through the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company. =Irish= This aerial photo of Boston was taken October 13, 1860 and is the second aerial photo after one of Paris. The earliest Irish settlers began arriving in the early 18th century. Initially they were indentured servants who came to work in Boston and New England for five to seven years, before gaining their independence. They were mainly individuals and families, and they were forced to hide their religious roots since Catholicism was banned in the Bay Colony. Then in 1718, congregations of Presbyterians from Ulster in the north of Ireland began arriving in Boston Harbor. They were referred to as Ulster Irish but later were referred to as Scots-Irish because many of them had roots in Scotland. The Puritan leaders initially sent the Ulster Irish to the fringes of the Bay Colony, where they settled places like Belfast, Maine, Londonderry and Derry, New Hampshire, and Worcester, Massachusetts. But by 1729 they were permitted to set up a church in downtown Boston.Irish Boston: A Lively Look at Boston's Colorful Irish History, by Michael Quinlin. Published by Globe Pequot Press, 2013. Throughout the 19th century, Boston became a haven for Irish Catholic immigrants, especially following the potato famine of 1845–49. Their arrival transformed Boston from a singular, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city to one that has progressively become more diverse. The Yankees hired Irish as workers and servants, but there was little social interaction. In the 1850s, an anti- Catholic, anti-immigrant movement was directed against the Irish, called the Know Nothing Party. But in the 1860s, many Irish immigrants joined the Union ranks to fight in the American Civil War, and that display of patriotism and valor began to soften the harsh sentiments of Yankees about the Irish.Thomas H. O'Connor, The Boston Irish: A Political History (1995) ch 3 Even to the present day, Boston still commands the largest percentage of Irish-descended people of any city in the United States. With an expanding population, group loyalty, and block by block political organization, the Irish took political control of the city, leaving the Yankees in charge of finance, business and higher education. The Irish left their mark on the region in a number of ways: in still heavily Irish neighborhoods such as Charlestown and South Boston; in the name of the local basketball team, the Boston Celtics; in the dominant Irish-American political family, the Kennedys; in a large number of prominent local politicians, such as James Michael Curley; in the establishment of Catholic Boston College as a rival to Harvard; and in underworld figures such as James \\"Whitey\\" Bulger.O'Connor, The Boston Irish: A Political History (1995) ch 9 =Great Fire of 1872= The Great Boston Fire of 1872 started at the corner of Summer Street and Kingston Street on November 9. In two days the conflagration destroyed about 65 acres (260,000 m²) of the city, including 776 buildings in the financial district, totaling $60 million in damage. Scollay Square, Boston, in the 1880s. Map showing all ground in Boston occupied by buildings in 1880. From U.S. Census Bureau. =High culture= Idealized illustration of Copley Square from an 1890s clothing catalog, prominently featuring H. H. Richardson's Trinity Church From the mid-to-late-19th century, the Boston Brahmins flourished culturally—they became renowned for its rarefied literary culture and lavish artistic patronage. Literary residents included, among many others, writers Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., James Russell Lowell, and Julia Ward Howe, as well as historians John Lothrop Motley, John Gorham Palfrey, George Bancroft, William Hickling Prescott, Francis Parkman, Henry Adams, James Ford Rhodes, Edward Channing and Samuel Eliot Morison. Also there were theologians and philosophers such as William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Mary Baker Eddy. When Bret Harte visited Howells, he remarked that in Boston \\"it was impossible to fire a revolver without bringing down the author of a two- volume work.\\" Boston had many great publishers and magazines, such as The Atlantic Monthly (founded 1857) and the publishers Little, Brown and Company, Houghton Mifflin, and Harvard University Press.Van Wyck Brooks, The flowering of New England (1955) Higher education became increasingly important, principally at Harvard (based across the river in Cambridge), but also at other institutions. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) opened in the city in 1865. The first medical school for women, The Boston Female Medical School (which later merged with the Boston University School of Medicine), opened in Boston on November 1, 1848. The Jesuits opened Boston College in 1863; Emerson College opened in 1880, and Simmons College for women in 1899. The Brahmins were the foremost authors and audiences of high culture, despite being a minority. Emerging Irish, Jewish, and Italian cultures made little to no impact on the elite. To please a different audience, the first vaudeville theater opened on February 28, 1883, in Boston. The last one, the Old Howard in Scollay Square, which had evolved from opera to vaudeville to burlesque, closed in 1953. The public Boston Museum of Natural History (founded in 1830 and renamed the New England Museum of Natural History in 1864, and the Boston Museum of Science in the mid-twentieth century), was run by the Boston Society of Natural History. It served the function of public and professional education in natural history, including ocean life, geology and mineralogy. Around the end of the 19th century a scientific library and children's rooms were added. In addition, the private Warren Museum of Natural History at Boston operated 1858–1906. It was acquired by the American Museum of Natural History in New York City in 1906.Paul DiMaggio, Paul. \\"Cultural entrepreneurship in nineteenth-century Boston.\\" in Chandra Mukerji and Michæl Schudson, eds, Rethinking Popular Culture: Contemporary Perspectives in Cultural Studies (1991) pp 374+. =Transportation= As the population increased rapidly, Boston-area streetcar lines facilitated the creation of a profusion of streetcar suburbs. Middle-class businessmen, office workers and professionals lived in the suburbs and commuted into the city by subway.Sam Bass Warner, Streetcar suburbs (1978). Downtown congestion worsened, prompting the opening of the first subway in North America on September 1, 1897, the Tremont Street Subway. Between 1897 and 1912, subterranean rail links were built to Cambridge and East Boston, and elevated and underground lines expanded into other neighborhoods from downtown. Today, the regional passenger rail and bus network has been consolidated into the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. Two union stations, North Station and South Station were constructed to consolidate downtown railroad terminals. =Censorship= From the late 19th century until the mid-20th century, the phrase \\"Banned in Boston\\" was used to describe a literary work, motion picture, or play prohibited from distribution or exhibition. During this time, Boston city officials took it upon themselves to \\"ban\\" anything that they found to be salacious, immoral, or offensive: theatrical shows were run out of town, books confiscated, and motion pictures were prevented from being shown—sometimes stopped in mid-showing after an official had \\"seen enough\\". The phrase \\"banned in Boston\\" came to suggest something sexy and lurid; some distributors advertised that their products had been banned in Boston, when in fact they had not. 20th century 1905 Child labor in Boston, 1917. Photo by Lewis Hine. =Early decades= In 1900, Julia Harrington Duff (1850–1932) became the first woman from the Irish Catholic community to be elected to the Boston School Committee. Extending her role as teacher and mother she became an ethnic spokesperson as she confronted the power of the Yankee Protestant men of the Public School Association. She worked to replace 37-year-old textbooks, to protect the claims of local Boston women for career opportunities in the school system, and to propose a degree-granting teachers college. In 1905, the 25 member committee was reduced to five, which blocked women's opportunities for direct participation in school policies.Polly Welts Kaufman, \\"Julia Harrington Duff: An Irish Woman Confronts the Boston Power Structure, 1900–1905,\\" Historical Journal of Massachusetts, 1990 18(2): 113–137, 25p. Historic Around the start of the 20th century, caught up in the automobile revolution, Boston was home to the Porter Motor Company, headquartered in the Tremont Building, 73 Tremont Street.Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.13. On January 15, 1919, the Great Molasses Flood occurred in the North End. Twenty-one people were killed and 150 injured as an immense wave of molasses, which rushed through the streets at an estimated , crushed and asphyxiated many of the victims to death. It took over six months to remove the molasses from the cobblestone streets, theaters, businesses, automobiles, and homes. Boston Harbor ran brown until summer. During the summer of 1919, over 1,100 members of the Boston Police Department went on strike. Boston fell prey to several riots as there were minimal law officers to maintain order in the city. Calvin Coolidge, then governor of Massachusetts, garnered national fame for quelling violence by almost entirely replacing the police force. The 1919 Boston Police Strike would ultimately set precedent for police unionization across the country. On August 23, 1927, Italian anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were sent to the electric chair after a seven-year trial in Boston. Their execution sparked riots in London, Paris and Germany, and helped to reinforce the image of Boston as a hotbed of intolerance and discipline. =Mid-century transportation and urban renewal= Old John Hancock Tower and Boston skyline, as it appeared in 1956 1955 Yellow Book plan for the Boston- area highway system. The I-695 Inner Belt shown on this map was never built. I-95 is shown here approaching the urban core from the southwest, but it was never built beyond the outer loop shown on this map (which was built as Route 128 and which I-95 was later re-routed over). In 1934, the Sumner Tunnel created the first direct road connection under Boston Harbor, between the North End and East Boston. In May 1938, the first public housing project, Old Harbor Village was opened in South Boston.Vale, Lawrence J., From the Puritans to the projects: public housing and public neighbors, Harvard University Press, 2000. By 1950, Boston was slumping. Few major buildings were being built anywhere in the city. Factories were closing and moving their operations south, where labor was cheaper. The assets Boston had—excellent banks, hospitals, universities and technical know-how—were minimal parts of the U.S. economy. To combat this downturn, Boston's politicians enacted urban renewal policies, which resulted in the demolition of several neighborhoods, including the New York Streets district in the South End, the old West End, a largely Jewish and Italian neighborhood, and Scollay Square. In their places went a new headquarters for the Boston Herald, the Charles River Park apartment complex, additions to Massachusetts General Hospital, and Government Center. These projects displaced thousands, closed hundreds of businesses, and provoked a furious backlash, which in turn ensured the survival of many historic neighborhoods. In 1948, William F. Callahan had published the Master Highway Plan for Metropolitan Boston. Parts of the financial district, Chinatown, and the North End were demolished to make way for construction. By 1956, the northern part of the Central Artery had been constructed, but strong local opposition resulted in the southern downtown portion being built underground. The Dewey Square Tunnel connected downtown to the Southeast Expressway. In 1961, the Callahan Tunnel opened, paralleling the older Sumner Tunnel. By 1965, the first Massachusetts Turnpike Extension was completed from Route 128 to near South Station. The proposed Inner Belt in Boston, Cambridge, Brookline, and Somerville was canceled due to public outcry. In 1971, public protest canceled the routing of I-95 into downtown Boston. Demolition had already begun along the Southwest Corridor, which was instead used to re-route the Orange Line and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. =World War II and later= On November 28, 1942, Boston's Cocoanut Grove nightclub was the site of the Cocoanut Grove fire, the deadliest nightclub fire in United States history, killing 492 people and injuring hundreds more. During the war years, antisemitic violence escalated in Boston. Gangs largely composed of Irish Catholic youths desecrated Jewish cemeteries and synagogues, vandalized Jewish stores and homes, and physically assaulted Jews in the streets. The Boston police force, which was made up largely of Irish Catholics, seldom intervened. In 1950, the Great Brink's Robbery was committed; at the time it was the largest bank robbery in the United States, with the thieves stealing $2.775 million. In 1953, the Columbia Point public housing projects were completed on the Dorchester peninsula. There were 1,502 units in the development on of land. In 1966, the Columbia Point Health Center opened and was the first community health center in the country. Between June 14, 1962, and January 4, 1964, as many as thirteen single women between the ages of 19 and 85 were murdered in Boston by the infamous Boston Strangler. (The actual number remains in dispute.) In March 1965, an investigative study of property tax assessment practices published by the National Tax Association of 13,769 properties sold within the City of Boston from January 1, 1960 to March 31, 1964 found that the assessed values in the neighborhood of Roxbury in 1962 were at 68 percent of market values while the assessed values in West Roxbury were at 41 percent of market values, and the researchers could not find a nonracial explanation for the difference. Under the tenure of John F. Collins as Mayor of Boston (1960–1968), the Boston Housing Authority segregated the public housing developments in the city as well, moving black families into the development at Columbia Point while reserving developments in South Boston for white families who started refusing assignment to the Columbia Point project by the early 1960s. In 1962, upon receipt of a lawsuit filed by a civil rights group, the West Broadway Housing Development was desegregated after having been designated by the city for white-only occupancy since 1941. In the same year, the Mission Hill project had 1,024 families (all white), while the Mission Hill Extension project across the street had 580 families (of which 500 were black), and in 1967 when the city government agreed to desegregate the developments, the projects were still 97 percent white and 98 percent black respectively. Back Bay and Cambridge In the 1970s, after years of economic downturn, Boston boomed again. Financial institutions were granted more latitude, more people began to play the market, and Boston became a leader in the mutual fund industry. Health care became more extensive and expensive, and hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Brigham and Women's Hospital led the nation in medical innovation and patient care. Higher education also became more expensive, and universities such as Harvard, MIT, Boston College, BU and Tufts attracted hordes of students to the Boston area; many stayed and became permanent residents. MIT graduates, in particular, founded many successful high-tech companies, which made Boston second only to Silicon Valley as a high-tech center. In 1974, the city dealt with a crisis when a federal district court judge, W. Arthur Garrity, ordered desegregation busing to integrate the city's public schools. Racially motivated violence erupted in several neighborhoods (many white parents resisted the busing plan). Public schools—particularly public high schools—became scenes of unrest and violence. Tension continued throughout the mid-1970s, reinforcing Boston's reputation for discrimination. A famous photograph, The Soiling of Old Glory, was taken in front of Boston City Hall, viscerally depicting the conflict. The Columbia Point housing complex deteriorated until only 350 families remained living there in 1988. In 1984, the city of Boston gave control of the complex to a private developer, Corcoran-Mullins-Jennison, who re-developed and re- vitalised the property into a residential mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments. It is a very significant example of revitalisation and re- development and was the first federal housing project to be converted to private, mixed-income housing in the USA. Harbor Point has won much acclaim for this transformation, including awards from the Urban Land Institute, the FIABCI Award for International Excellence, and the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence.Kamin, Blair. \\"Rethinking Public Housing\\" , Blueprints magazine, Summer 1997, p.4, National Building Museum, Washington, D.C.Roessner, Jane. \\"A Decent Place to Live: From Columbia Point to Harbor Point\\" , Boston, Northeastern University Press, 2000.\\"Boston War Zone Becomes Public Housing Dream\\", The New York Times, November 23, 1991. It was used as a model for the federal HUD HOPE VI public housing program begun in 1992.Cf. Roessner, p.293. \\"The HOPE VI housing program, inspired in part by the success of Harbor Point, was created by legislation passed by Congress in 1992.\\" On March 18, 1990, the largest art theft in modern history occurred in Boston. Twelve paintings, collectively worth over $100 million, were stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum by two thieves posing as police officers. The paintings were not recovered. =Big Dig and public transit in the 2000s= Boston's Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge is a result of the Big Dig. In 2007, the Central Artery/Tunnel project was completed. Nicknamed the Big Dig, it had been planned and approved in the 1980s under Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. With construction beginning in 1991, the Big Dig moved the remainder of the Central Artery underground, widened the north-south highway, and created local bypasses to prevent east-west traffic from contributing to congestion. The Ted Williams Tunnel became the third highway tunnel to East Boston and Logan International Airport as part of the project. The Big Dig also produced the landmark Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge, and will create over 70 acres (280,000 m²) of public parks in the heart of the city. The project as a whole has eased (but not eliminated) Boston's notorious traffic congestion; however, it is the most expensive construction project in United States history and the most expensive construction project in the world. The city also saw other transportation projects, including improvement and expansion to its mass transit system, notably to its commuter rail system to southeastern Massachusetts and the development of a bus rapid transit (BRT) system dubbed \\"The Silver Line.\\" The maritime Port of Boston and Logan International Airport were also developed. 21st century Downtown Boston as seen from Cambridge Recently, Boston has experienced a loss of regional institutions and traditions, which once gave it a very distinct social character, as it has become part of the northeastern megalopolis. Examples include: the acquisition of the Boston Globe by The New York Times; the loss of Boston-headquartered publishing houses (noted above); the acquisition of the century-old Jordan Marsh department store by Macy's; and the loss to mergers, failures, and acquisitions of once-prominent financial institutions such as Shawmut Bank, BayBank, Bank of New England, and Bank of Boston. In 2004, this trend continued as Charlotte-based Bank of America acquired FleetBoston Financial, and P&G; has announced plans to acquire Gillette. Despite these losses, Boston's ambiance remains unique among world cities and, in many ways, has improved in recent years—racial tensions have eased dramatically, city streets bustle with a vitality not seen since the 1920s, and once again Boston has become a hub of intellectual, technological, and political ideas. Nevertheless, the city had to tackle gentrification issues and rising living expenses. According to Money Magazine, Boston is one of the world's 100 most expensive cities.\\"World's most expensive cities.\\" Money Magazine. Accessed June 30, 2005. Boston was the host city of the 2004 Democratic National Convention. The city also found itself at the center of national attention in early 2004 during the controversy over same-sex marriages. After the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that such marriages cannot be banned under the state's constitution, opponents and supporters of such marriages converged on the Massachusetts State House as the state legislature voted on a state constitutional amendment that would define marriage as only between a man and a woman. Much attention was focused on the city and the rest of Massachusetts when marriage licenses for same-sex couples were issued. Also in 2004, the Boston Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years, following it up three years later with a victory in 2007, another in 2013, and another World Series win in 2018. Boston sports continue to dominate. On April 15, 2013, two bombs were detonated during the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring hundreds. On August 20, 2017 the .boston top-level internet domain (GeoTLD) officially started taking registrations. Geographic expansion 1880 census map showing landfill and annexations up until that year. The City of Boston has expanded in two ways—through landfill and through annexation of neighboring municipalities. Between 1630 and 1890, the city tripled its physical size by land reclamation, specifically by filling in marshes and mud flats and by filling gaps between wharves along the waterfront, a process Walter Muir Whitehill called \\"cutting down the hills to fill the coves.\\" The most intense reclamation efforts were in the 19th century. Beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a mill pond that later became the Bulfinch Triangle (just south of today's North Station area). The present-day State House sits atop this shortened Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the areas now known as the South End, West End, Financial District, and Chinatown. After The Great Boston Fire of 1872, building rubble was used as landfill along the downtown waterfront. The most dramatic reclamation project was the filling in of the Back Bay in the mid to late 19th century. Almost six hundred acres (240 hectares) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of the Boston Common were filled in with gravel brought in by rail from the hills of Needham Heights. Boston also grew by annexing the adjacent communities of East Boston, Roxbury, Dorchester, West Roxbury (including Jamaica Plain and Roslindale), South Boston, Brighton, Allston, Hyde Park, and Charlestown, some of which were also augmented by landfill reclamation. Several proposals to regionalize municipal government failed due to concerns about loss of local control, corruption, and Irish immigration, including: * 1896 – \\"County of Boston\\" proposal in the state legislature * 1910 – \\"Real Boston\\" proposal by Edward Filene to create a regional advisory board * 1912 – \\"Greater Boston\\" proposal by Daniel J. Kiley that would have enlarged the City of Boston to include all 32 municipalities within 10 miles * 1919 – Annexation proposal by Boston Mayor Andrew Peters The state government has regionalized some functions in Eastern Massachusetts, including the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (public transit), the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (water and sewer), and the Metropolitan District Commission (parks, later folded into the statewide Department of Conservation and Recreation).

Examples of presuppositions include: * Jane no longer writes fiction.  Presupposition: Jane once wrote fiction. * Have you stopped eating meat?  Presupposition: you had once eaten meat. * Have you talked to Hans?  Presupposition: Hans exists. A presupposition must be mutually known or assumed by the speaker and addressee for the utterance to be considered appropriate in context. It will generally remain a necessary assumption whether the utterance is placed in the form of an assertion, denial, or question, and can be associated with a specific lexical item or grammatical feature (presupposition trigger) in the utterance. Crucially, negation of an expression does not change its presuppositions: I want to do it again and I don't want to do it again both presuppose that the subject has done it already one or more times; My wife is pregnant and My wife is not pregnant both presuppose that the subject has a wife. In this respect, presupposition is distinguished from entailment and implicature. For example, The president was assassinated entails that The president is dead, but if the expression is negated, the entailment is not necessarily true. Negation of a sentence containing a presupposition If presuppositions of a sentence are not consistent with the actual state of affairs, then one of two approaches can be taken. Given the sentences My wife is pregnant and My wife is not pregnant when one has no wife, then either: # Both the sentence and its negation are false; or # Strawson's approach: Both \\"my wife is pregnant\\" and \\"my wife is not pregnant\\" use a wrong presupposition (i.e. that there exists a referent which can be described with the noun phrase my wife) and therefore can not be assigned truth values. Bertrand Russell tries to solve this dilemma with two interpretations of the negated sentence: # \\"There exists exactly one person, who is my wife and who is not pregnant\\" # \\"There does not exist exactly one person, who is my wife and who is pregnant.\\" For the first phrase, Russell would claim that it is false, whereas the second would be true according to him. Projection of presuppositions A presupposition of a part of an utterance is sometimes also a presupposition of the whole utterance, and sometimes not. For instance, the phrase my wife triggers the presupposition that I have a wife. The first sentence below carries that presupposition, even though the phrase occurs inside an embedded clause. In the second sentence, however, it does not. John might be mistaken about his belief that I have a wife, or he might be deliberately trying to misinform his audience, and this has an effect on the meaning of the second sentence, but, perhaps surprisingly, not on the first one. # John thinks that my wife is beautiful. # John said that my wife is beautiful. Thus, this seems to be a property of the main verbs of the sentences, think and say, respectively. After work by Lauri Karttunen,Karttunen, Lauri (1974) . Theoretical Linguistics 1 181-94. Also in Pragmatics: A Reader, Steven Davis (ed.), pages 406-415, Oxford University Press, 1991. verbs that allow presuppositions to \\"pass up\\" to the whole sentence (\\"project\\") are called holes, and verbs that block such passing up, or projection of presuppositions are called plugs. Some linguistic environments are intermediate between plugs and holes: They block some presuppositions and allow others to project. These are called filters. An example of such an environment are indicative conditionals (\\"If-then\\" clauses). A conditional sentence contains an antecedent and a consequent. The antecedent is the part preceded by the word \\"if,\\" and the consequent is the part that is (or could be) preceded by \\"then.\\" If the consequent contains a presupposition trigger, and the triggered presupposition is explicitly stated in the antecedent of the conditional, then the presupposition is blocked. Otherwise, it is allowed to project up to the entire conditional. Here is an example: :If I have a wife, then my wife is blonde. Here, the presupposition triggered by the expression my wife (that I have a wife) is blocked, because it is stated in the antecedent of the conditional: That sentence doesn't imply that I have a wife. In the following example, it is not stated in the antecedent, so it is allowed to project, i.e. the sentence does imply that I have a wife. :If it's already 4am, then my wife is probably angry. Hence, conditional sentences act as filters for presuppositions that are triggered by expressions in their consequent. A significant amount of current work in semantics and pragmatics is devoted to a proper understanding of when and how presuppositions project. Presupposition triggers A presupposition trigger is a lexical item or linguistic construction which is responsible for the presupposition, and thus \\"triggers\\" it.Kadmon, Nirit. Formal pragmatics: semantics, pragmatics, presupposition, and focus. Great Britain: Wiley-Blackwell, 2001, page 10. The following is a selection of presuppositional triggers following Stephen C. Levinson's classic textbook on Pragmatics, which in turn draws on a list produced by Lauri Karttunen. As is customary, the presuppositional triggers themselves are italicized, and the symbol » stands for 'presupposes'.Levinson, Stephen C. Pragmatics.Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983, pp. 181-184. =Definite descriptions= Definite descriptions are phrases of the form \\"the X\\" where X is a noun phrase. The description is said to be proper when the phrase applies to exactly one object, and conversely, it is said to be improper when either there exist more than one potential referents, as in \\"the senator from Ohio\\", or none at all, as in \\"the king of France\\". In conventional speech, definite descriptions are implicitly assumed to be proper, hence such phrases trigger the presupposition that the referent is unique and existent. * John saw the man with two heads. »there exists a man with two heads. =Factive verbs= In Western epistemology, there is a tradition originating with Plato of defining knowledge as justified true belief. On this definition, for someone to know X, it is required that X be true. A linguistic question thus arises regarding the usage of such phrases: does a person who states \\"John knows X\\" implicitly claim the truth of X? Steven Pinker explored this question in a popular science format in a 2007 book on language and cognition, using a widely publicized example from a speech by a U.S. president. A 2003 speech by George W. Bush included the line, \\"British Intelligence has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\\"Bush, George W., State of the Union Address, January 28th, 2003. Over the next few years, it became apparent that this intelligence lead was incorrect. But the way the speech was phrased, using a factive verb, implicitly framed the lead as truth rather than hypothesis. There is however a strong alternative view that factivity thesis, the proposition that relational predicates having to do with knowledge, such as knows, learn, remembers, and realized, presuppose the factual truth of their object, is incorrect. * Martha regrets drinking John's home brew.  Presupposition: Martha did in fact drink John's home brew. * Frankenstein was aware that Dracula was there.  Presupposition: Dracula was in fact there. * John realized that he was in debt.  Presupposition: John was in fact in debt. * It was odd how proud he was.  Presupposition: He was in fact proud. Some further factive predicates: know; be sorry that; be proud that; be indifferent that; be glad that; be sad that. =Implicative verbs= * John managed to open the door. »John tried to open the door. * John forgot to lock the door. »John ought to have locked, or intended to lock, the door. Some further implicative predicates: X happened to V»X didn't plan or intend to V; X avoided Ving»X was expected to, or usually did, or ought to V, etc. =Change of state or continuation of state verbs= With these presupposition triggers, the current unfolding situation is considered presupposed information.Sedivy, Julie, and Carlson, Greg N. (2011). \\"Sold on Language: How Advertisers Talk to You and What This Says About You,\\" Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 104-105. * John stopped teasing his wife. »John had been teasing his wife. * Joan began teasing her husband. »Joan hadn't been teasing her husband. Some further change of state verbs: start; finish; carry on; cease; take (as in X took Y from Z » Y was at/in/with Z); leave; enter; come; go; arrive; etc. =Iteratives= These types of triggers presuppose the existence of a previous state of affairs. * The flying saucer came again. »The flying saucer came before. * You can't get gobstoppers anymore. »You once could get gobstoppers. * Carter returned to power. »Carter held power before. Further iteratives: another time; to come back; restore; repeat; for the nth time. =Temporal clauses= The situation explained in a clause that begins with a temporal clause constructor is typically considered backgrounded information. * Before Strawson was even born, Frege noticed presuppositions. »Strawson was born. * While Chomsky was revolutionizing linguistics, the rest of social science was asleep. »Chomsky was revolutionizing linguistics. * Since Churchill died, we've lacked a leader. »Churchill died. Further temporal clause constructors: after; during; whenever; as (as in As John was getting up, he slipped). =Cleft sentences= Cleft sentence structures highlight particular aspects of a sentence and consider the surrounding information to be backgrounded knowledge. These sentences are typically not spoken to strangers, but rather to addressees who are aware of the ongoing situation. * Cleft construction: It was Henry that kissed Rosie. »Someone kissed Rosie. * Pseudo-cleft construction: What John lost was his wallet. »John lost something. =Comparisons and contrasts= Comparisons and contrasts may be marked by stress (or by other prosodic means), by particles like \\"too\\", or by comparatives constructions. * Marianne called Adolph a male chauvinist, and then HE insulted HER. »For Marianne to call Adolph a male chauvinist would be to insult him. * Carol is a better linguist than Barbara. »Barbara is a linguist. =Counterfactual conditionals= * If the notice had only said 'mine-field' in Welsh as well as in English, we would never have lost poor Llewellyn. »The notice didn't say 'mine-field' in Welsh. =Questions= Questions often presuppose what the assertive part of the question presupposes, but interrogative parts might introduce further presuppositions. There are three different types of questions: yes/no questions, alternative questions and WH- questions. * Is there a professor of linguistics at MIT? »Either there is a professor of linguistics at MIT or there isn't. * Is Newcastle in England or in Australia? »Newcastle is in England or Newcastle is in Australia. * Who is the professor of linguistics at MIT? »Someone is the professor of linguistics at MIT. =Possessive case= * John's children are very noisy. »John has children. Accommodation of presuppositions A presupposition of a sentence must normally be part of the common ground of the utterance context (the shared knowledge of the interlocutors) in order for the sentence to be felicitous. Sometimes, however, sentences may carry presuppositions that are not part of the common ground and nevertheless be felicitous. For example, I can, upon being introduced to someone, out of the blue explain that my wife is a dentist, this without my addressee having ever heard, or having any reason to believe that I have a wife. In order to be able to interpret my utterance, the addressee must assume that I have a wife. This process of an addressee assuming that a presupposition is true, even in the absence of explicit information that it is, is usually called presupposition accommodation. We have just seen that presupposition triggers like my wife (definite descriptions) allow for such accommodation. In \\"Presupposition and Anaphora: Remarks on the Formulation of the Projection Problem\\",Kripke, Saul (2009) \\"Presupposition and Anaphora: Remarks on the Formulation of the Projection Problem,\\" Linguistic Inquiry, Vol. 40, No. 3, Pages 367-386. the philosopher Saul Kripke noted that some presupposition triggers do not seem to permit such accommodation. An example of that is the presupposition trigger too. This word triggers the presupposition that, roughly, something parallel to what is stated has happened. For example, if pronounced with emphasis on John, the following sentence triggers the presupposition that somebody other than John had dinner in New York last night. : John had dinner in New York last night, too. But that presupposition, as stated, is completely trivial, given what we know about New York. Several million people had dinner in New York last night, and that in itself doesn't satisfy the presupposition of the sentence. What is needed for the sentence to be felicitous is really that somebody relevant to the interlocutors had dinner in New York last night, and that this has been mentioned in the previous discourse, or that this information can be recovered from it. Presupposition triggers that disallow accommodation are called anaphoric presupposition triggers. Presupposition in critical discourse analysis Critical discourse analysis (CDA) is a broad study belonging to not one research category. It focuses on identifying presuppositions of an abstract nature from varying perspectives. CDA is considered critical, not only in the sense of being analytical, but also in the ideological sense. \\"Critical discourse analysis (CDA) is a type of discourse analytical research that primarily studies the way social power abuse, dominance, and inequality are enacted, reproduced, and resisted by text and talk in the social and political context. With such dissident research, critical discourse analysts take explicit position, and thus want to understand, expose, and ultimately resist social inequality.\\" Teun Adrianus van Dijk, \\"Critical Discourse Analysis \\", chapter 18 in Deborah Schiffrin, Deborah Tannen and Heidi E. Hamilton (eds.), The Handbook of Discourse Analysis, (Wiley-Blackwell, 2003): pp. 352–371. Through the analysis of written texts and verbal speech, Teun A. van Dijk (2003) says CDA studies power imbalances existing in both the conversational and political spectrum. With the purpose of first identifying and then tackling inequality in society, van Dijk describes CDA as a nonconformist piece of work. One notable feature of ideological presuppositions researched in CDA is a concept termed synthetic personalisation Logical construct To describe a presupposition in the context of propositional calculus and truth-bearers, Belnap defines \\"A sentence is a presupposition of a question if the truth of the sentence is a necessary condition of the question's having some true answer.\\" Then referring to the semantic theory of truth, interpretations are used to formulate a presupposition: \\"Every interpretation which makes the question truly answerable is an interpretation which makes the presupposed sentence true as well.\\" A sentence that expresses a presupposition in a question may be characterized as follows: the question has some true answer if and only if the sentence is true.Nuel D.

Voorhees of New Jersey in response to the destruction of the Palisades by quarry operators in the late 19th century. The Palisades are the cliffs on the west bank of the Hudson River across from and continuing north of Manhattan Island. The commission consists of ten commissioners, five appointed by each governor, who serve staggered five-year terms. History In 1900, George W. Perkins was appointed chairman of the newly formed commission by Governor Roosevelt. He hired Major William A. Welch as assistant engineer, and in 1914 named him chief engineer and general manager. Under Welch's leadership, the Palisades Interstate Park grew from the initial Bear Mountain State Park to the more than Harriman State Park. By 1919 nearly a million people a year were coming to the park. When work started on the park there were no models or precedents for an endeavor of its nature and scope. Welch organized a massive reforestation program, built twenty-three new lakes, of scenic drives and one hundred and three children's camps, where 65,000 urban children enjoyed the outdoors each summer. He helped found the Palisades Interstate Park Trail Conference, which later became the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference, and he served as chairman of the Appalachian Trail Conference. The Palisades Interstate Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. The designated area includes the Palisades Park in New Jersey, the Palisades Park in New York State, and the Tallman Mountain State Park in New York State. Current scope Monument in the park The park system has been expanded over the years to include nineteen state parks and nine historic sites, covering over along more than of Hudson River shoreline and beyond. The commission also oversees and operates the Palisades Interstate Parkway, built between 1947 and 1958. The commission also owns four additional parkways that traverse its parks, although two are partially or wholly maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation, while the rest are both owned and maintained by PIPC. =State parks= =Historic sites= =Parkways= See also *Palisades Interstate Parkway Police Department References =Other sources= *Myles, William J., Harriman Trails, A Guide and History, The New York-New Jersey Trail Conference, New York, N.Y., 1999.

It is placed at a near-right-angle turn in the highway, forcing the three lanes of traffic in each direction to slow down. The advised speed is . Although constructed as a tunnel through rock, the surface a few yards above is covered with roadways. The tunnel functions as if it were the underpass under a bridge which carries Hennepin Avenue, Lyndale Avenue, and various ramps over I-94. It is a bottleneck due to its dog-leg turn, and various proposals have been made for dealing with it. In May 2005, one city engineer proposed restriping it to four lanes in each direction. This would not help the slowdown, but would theoretically allow more cars through it at a given time. The tunnel is also a leading contender for a new high- occupancy toll lane using the MnPASS electronic toll collection system. Some believe that Interstate 335, a proposed but never-built freeway north of downtown between I-94 and Interstate 35W, would have alleviated the traffic problems in the tunnel. However, others have noted that the highway would not have benefited many drivers, particularly since the nearby interchange between I-35W and I-94 is missing certain links. There is no connection to carry southbound I-35W traffic to eastbound I-94, or westbound I-94 traffic to northbound I-35W, both of which would have been important flows if I-335 were to be successful. Opened in November of 1971, this tunnel was built with $31 million dollars to help fix the congestion of 30,000 vehicles a day. Today, the Lowry Hill Tunnel sees an average of 185,000 vehicles pass through it each day making it one of the worlds busiest tunnels - if not the busiest.

This condition of the nail was named by a French physician, Joseph Honoré Simon Beau (1806–1865), who first described it in 1846.  Signs and symptoms  Beau's lines are horizontal, going across the nail, and should not be confused with vertical ridges going from the bottom (cuticle) of the nail out to the fingertip. These vertical lines are usually a natural consequence of aging and are harmless.Google Answers: Vertical Ridges, citing several different studies and experts.

While Beau's lines are actual ridges and indentations in the nail plate, Muehrcke lines are areas of hypopigmentation without palpable ridges; they affect the underlying nail bed, and not the nail itself. Beau's lines should also be distinguished from Mees' lines of the fingernails, which are areas of discoloration in the nail plate.  Causes  There are several causes of Beau's lines. It is believed that there is a temporary cessation of cell division in the nail matrix. This may be caused by an infection or problem in the nail fold, where the nail begins to form, or it may be caused by an injury to that area. Some other reasons for these lines include trauma, coronary occlusion, hypocalcaemia, and skin disease.

He is best known as the lead singer and original member of the band Orgy which he founded in 1994. 1994–2000 Orgy's first release, 1998's Candyass, would prove to be a huge success and earned a platinum certification in sales, which was primarily fueled by the popularity of their cover of New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\", as well as that of their first single, \\"Stitches\\". The band would release singles of both during this period, which would contain numerous remixes of the songs, some of which were created by Gordon himself, a trend which would continue to occur throughout all of Orgy's subsequent single releases. In 2000, Orgy released their second full-length album, Vapor Transmission, which, despite gaining a quite respectable sales performance, did not repeat the wild success of its predecessor. 2000–Present The period following the release of Vapor Transmission proved to be a tumultuous period for the band. Orgy left Elementree and Reprise Records. Drummer Bobby Hewitt left the band in order to join his brother Fab Fernandez in the group Snake River Conspiracy, although he would eventually return. It would be four years between the release of Vapor Transmission and Orgy's third album, 2004's Punk Statik Paranoia. In 2002, he performed the song Slept So Long for the Queen of the Damned soundtrack, due to contractual limitations which restricted composer Jonathan Davis from performing the vocals to his composed songs as they appeared upon the actual soundtrack (although Davis did, in fact, perform all musical tracks within the movie itself). Gordon has also appeared with his band Orgy on other soundtracks such as Zoolander, which featured the previously unreleased song Faces. Jay also remixed \\"Points of Authority\\", a song by Linkin Park from their album Hybrid Theory, for the latter's remix album Reanimation. This was entitled \\"Pts.OF.Athrty\\", which was released as the first and only single of Reanimation, and has achieved moderate success at the Billboard charts. He also voiced J. Jonah Jameson in Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. In 2004, he voiced several characters for the PC game Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines. In October 2010, members of Orgy collectively brought accusations against Gordon of having \\"fired the band.\\" In response, Jay released a public statement denying the claims.

Original bassist Chris \\"Pint Glass\\" Stewart left before any recordings were made, and was replaced by original drummer Hake. Keenan left in 1994 to start his own group, the Telstar Ponies and was replaced by guitarist Steven Haddow. In the same year, the band released their first album Twin Action on Creation Records on 25 July, and on 22 May 1995 they released their second album, Formanka. Their third album, Year Zero, which saw them take a more experimental sample-based approach, was released on 10 March 1997. The remixed single \\"Stay\\" was given mainstream radio play and gave them their only UK Top 75 hit single (peaking at No. 59 in March18 Wheeler at OfficialCharts.com ). They were subsequently dropped by Creation during the recording of what was to be their fourth studio release. Although Alan Hake has stated that Creation Records allowed the band to keep the master tapes to this album, no plans to officially release it have materialised. Hake went on to co-found the Must Destroy record label. The band were once introduced by Tony Blair at the 1996 Labour Party Conference. The future Prime Minister managed to wrongly introduce them as \\"Wheeler 18\\". Their biggest claim to fame, however, is that they were the band Oasis were supporting the night that Oasis were discovered by Creation Records boss Alan McGee at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow on 31 May 1993.Alan Hake of 18 Wheeler « Creation Records After a hiatus of several years spent mainly in Central and Eastern Europe, Sean Jackson returned to the music world with the solo album Slots, recorded in 2005.

Its chemical structural formula is Cl3CNO2. Synthesis Chloropicrin was discovered in 1848 by Scottish chemist John Stenhouse. He prepared it by the reaction of sodium hypochlorite with picric acid: :HOC6H2(NO2)3 \\\\+ 11 NaOCl → 3 Cl3CNO2 \\\\+ 3 Na2CO3 \\\\+ 3 NaOH + 2 NaCl Because of the precursor used, Stenhouse named the compound chloropicrin, although the two compounds are structurally dissimilar. Today, chloropicrin is manufactured by the reaction of nitromethane with sodium hypochlorite:Sheldon B. Markofsky \\"Nitro Compounds, Aliphatic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. :H3CNO2 \\\\+ 3 NaOCl → Cl3CNO2 \\\\+ 3 NaOH or by the reaction of chloroform with nitric acid CHCl3 \\\\+ HNO3 → CCl3NO2 \\\\+ H2O Properties Chloropicrin's chemical formula is CCl3NO2 and its molecular weight is 164.38 grams/mole. Pure chloropicrin is a colorless liquid, with a boiling point of 112 °C. Chloropicrin is sparingly soluble in water with solubility of 2000 mg/L at 25 °C. It is volatile, with a vapor pressure of 23.2 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) at 25 °C; the corresponding Henry's law constant is 0.00251 atmosphere-cubic meter per mole. The octanol- water partition coefficient (Kow) of chloropicrin is estimated to be 269. Its soil adsorption coefficient (Koc; normalized to soil organic matter content) is 25 cm3/g. Use Chloropicrin was manufactured for use as poison gas in World War I. In agriculture, chloropicrin is injected into soil prior to planting a crop in order to fumigate soil. Chloropicrin affects a broad spectrum of fungi, microbes, insects.http://www.workcover.nsw.gov.au/Documents/Publications/AlertsGuidesHazards/DangerousGoodsExplosivesFireworksPyrotechnics/chloropicrin_fact_sheet_1371.pdf It is commonly used as a stand-alone treatment or in combination / co- formulation with methyl bromide and 1,3-Dichloropropene. Chloropicrin is used as an indicator and repellent while fumigating residences for insects with sulfuryl fluoride which is an odorless gas.http://termitetenting.com/ Safety At the national level, chloropicrin is regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a restricted use pesticide. Because of its toxicity and carcinogenicity, distribution and use of chloropicrin is available only to licensed professionals and specially certified growers who are trained in its proper and safe use. In the US, occupational exposure limits have been set at 0.1 ppm over an eight-hour time-weighted average. =Agriculture= In 2008 the US EPA re-approved chloropicrin as safe for use in agricultural settings, stating that treatments \\"can provide benefits to both food consumers and growers. For consumers, it means more fresh fruits and vegetables can be cheaply produced domestically year-round because several severe pest problems can be efficiently controlled.\\" To ensure chloropicrin is used safely, the EPA requires a strict set of protections for handlers, workers, and persons living and working in and around farmland during treatments. EPA protections were increased in both 2011 and 2012, reducing fumigant exposures and significantly improving safety. Protections include the training of certified applicators supervising pesticide application, the use of buffer zones, posting before and during pesticide application, fumigant management plans, and compliance assistance and assurance measures. Used as a preplant soil treatment measure, chloropicrin suppresses soilborne pathogenic fungi and some nematodes and insects. With a half-life of hours to days, it is completely digested by soil organisms before the crop is planted, making it safe and efficient. Contrary to popular belief, chloropicrin does not sterilize soil and does not deplete the ozone layer, as the compound is destroyed by sunlight. Additionally, chloropicrin has never been found in groundwater, due to its low solubility. California In California experience with acute effects of chloropicrin when used as a soil fumigant for strawberries and other crops led to the release of regulations in January 2015 creating buffer zones and other precautions to minimize exposure of farm workers, neighbors, and passersby. =High Concentrations= Chloropicrin is harmful to humans. It can be absorbed systemically through inhalation, ingestion, and the skin. At high concentrations it is severely irritating to the lungs, eyes, and skin.Chloropicrin (PS): Lung Damaging Agent. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Emergency Response Safety and Health Database, August 22, 2008. Retrieved December 23, 2008. In World War I German forces used concentrated chloropicrin against Allied forces as a tear gas. While not as lethal as other chemical weapons, it caused vomiting and forced Allied soldiers to remove their masks to vomit, exposing them to other, more toxic chemical gases used as weapons during the war.

In statistical multiplexing, a communication channel is divided into an arbitrary number of variable bitrate digital channels or data streams. The link sharing is adapted to the instantaneous traffic demands of the data streams that are transferred over each channel. This is an alternative to creating a fixed sharing of a link, such as in general time division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM). When performed correctly, statistical multiplexing can provide a link utilization improvement, called the statistical multiplexing gain. Statistical multiplexing is facilitated through packet mode or packet- oriented communication, which among others is utilized in packet switched computer networks. Each stream is divided into packets that normally are delivered asynchronously in a first-come first-served fashion. In alternative fashion, the packets may be delivered according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing or differentiated and/or guaranteed quality of service. Statistical multiplexing of an analog channel, for example a wireless channel, is also facilitated through the following schemes: * Random frequency-hopping orthogonal frequency division multiple access (RFH-OFDMA) * Code-division multiple access (CDMA), where different amount of spreading codes or spreading factors can be assigned to different users. Statistical multiplexing normally implies \\"on-demand\\" service rather than one that preallocates resources for each data stream. Statistical multiplexing schemes do not control user data transmissions.  Comparison with static TDM  Time domain statistical multiplexing (packet mode communication) is similar to time-division multiplexing (TDM), except that, rather than assigning a data stream to the same recurrent time slot in every TDM, each data stream is assigned time slots (of fixed length) or data frames (of variable lengths) that often appear to be scheduled in a randomized order, and experience varying delay (while the delay is fixed in TDM). Statistical multiplexing allows the bandwidth to be divided arbitrarily among a variable number of channels (while the number of channels and the channel data rate are fixed in TDM). Statistical multiplexing ensures that slots will not be wasted (whereas TDM can waste slots). The transmission capacity of the link will be shared by only those users who have packets. Static TDM and other circuit switching is carried out at the physical layer in the OSI model and TCP/IP model, while statistical multiplexing is carried out at the data link layer and above. Channel identification In statistical multiplexing, each packet or frame contains a channel/data stream identification number, or (in the case of datagram communication) complete destination address information. Usage Examples of statistical multiplexing are: * The MPEG transport stream for digital TV transmission. Statistical multiplexing is used to allow several video, audio and data streams of different data rates to be transmitted over a bandwidth-limited channel (see Statistical multiplexer). The packets have constant lengths. The channel number is denoted Program ID (PID). * The UDP and TCP protocols, where data streams from several application processes are multiplexed together. The packets may have varying lengths. The port numbers constitute channel identification numbers (and also address information). * The X.25 and Frame relay packet-switching protocols, where the packets have varying lengths, and the channel number is denoted virtual connection identifier (VCI). The international collection of X.25 providers, using the X.25 protocol suite was colloquially known as \\"the Packet switched network\\" in the 1980s and into the beginning of the 1990s. * The Asynchronous Transfer Mode packet-switched protocol, where the packets have fixed length. The channel identification number consists of a virtual connection identifier (VCI) and a Virtual Path Identifier (VPI). Statistical multiplexer In digital audio and video broadcasting, for example, a statistical multiplexer is a content aggregating device that allows broadcasters to provide the greatest number of audio or video services for a given bandwidth by sharing a pool of fixed bandwidth among multiple services or streams of varying bitrates. The multiplexer allocates to each service the bandwidth required for its real-time needs so that services with complex scenes receive more bandwidth than services with less complex ones. This bandwidth sharing technique produces the best video quality at the lowest possible aggregate bandwidth. Examples of statistical multiplexers include the Imagine Communications (RGB Networks) BNPXr product line, Harmonic Inc.

He is best known for his fifty-five illustrations for Edward FitzGerald's translation of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (deluxe edition, published by Houghton Mifflin). Biography Daguerreotype of Vedder as a schoolboy in 1847 Elihu Vedder was born February 26, 1836 in New York City, the son of Dr. Elihu Vedder Sr. and Elizabeth Vedder. His parents were cousins. His father, a dentist, decided to try his luck in Cuba, and this had a profound impact on Elihu Jr.'s childhood. The remainder of his childhood was spent between his maternal grandfather Alexander Vedder's house in Schenectady and a boarding school. His mother supported his goals to be an artist while his father reluctantly assented, convinced that his son should try a different occupation. His brother, Dr. Alexander Madison Vedder, was a Navy surgeon who witnessed the transformation of Japan into a modern culture while he was stationed there. Vedder trained in New York City with Tompkins H. Matteson, then in Paris with François-Édouard Picot. Finally, he completed his studies in Italy - where he was strongly influenced not only by Italian Renaissance work but also by the modern Macchiaioli painters and the living Italian landscape. He first visited Italy from 1858 until 1860, becoming deeply emotionally attached to fellow painter Giovanni Costa. Their idyllic trips through the Italian countryside were cut short because Vedder's father cut off his financial allowance. Dancing Girl, oil on canvas, 1871. Reynolds House Museum of American Art Penniless, Vedder returned to the United States during the American Civil War and made a small living undertaking commercial illustrations. He was involved in the bohemian 'Pfaff's' coffee house group and painted some of his most memorable paintings notable for their visionary nature, romantic imagery and often Oriental influences. Paintings of this time include 'The Roc's Egg', 'The Fisherman and the Genii' and one of his most famous works, 'Lair of the Sea Serpent.' In the United States, Vedder sought out and befriended Walt Whitman, Herman Melville and William Morris Hunt. Vedder became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1865. At the end of the Civil War, Vedder left America to live in Italy. He married Caroline Rosekrans on July 13, 1869 in Glen Falls, New York. Elihu Vedder and his wife had four children, only two of whom survived. His daughter Anita Herriman Vedder played a vital role in handling the business of her father, who was notorious for his general aloofness towards details. Elihu's son Enoch Rosekrans Vedder was a promising architect who married jewelry designer Angela Reston. Enoch died while visiting his parents in Italy on April 2, 1916. Elihu had a home in Rome and - after the financial success of his 1884 Rubaiyat work - on the Isle of Capri, then a haven for male aesthetes. Vedder visited England many times, and was influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites, and was a friend of Simeon Solomon. He was also influenced by the work of English and Irish mystics such as William Blake and William Butler Yeats. In 1890 Vedder helped establish the In Arte Libertas group in Italy. Tiffany commissioned him to design glassware, mosaics and statuettes for the company. He decorated the hallway of the Reading Room of the Washington Library of Congress, and his mural paintings can still be seen there. Vedder occasionally returned to the United States, but lived only in Italy from 1906 until his death on January 29, 1923. He is buried in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome. There are no known living descendants of Elihu Vedder as both surviving children died without issue.Stevens, Revalee R. & Robert Kim: North American Records: The Protestant Cemetery of Rome.

Russell Alexander (February 26, 1877 - October 1, 1915) was an entertainer and composer, active primarily with vaudeville shows and musical comedy organizations. Alexander was born in Nevada, Missouri, and became a euphonium virtuoso who joined the circus band of Belford's Carnival at the age of 18. At 20, he became arranger and euphonium soloist with the Barnum & Bailey Circus Band and toured Europe from 1897 to 1902. Following his tour with Barnum & Bailey, Russell Alexander worked in a novelty musical vaudeville act with his brothers. Although his compositional output was relatively small, he is considered a great composer of marches. He wrote 33 marches, 6 galops, and several overtures, novelties, and other works. For part of his career he worked in acts with his brothers, Newton and Woodruff. On July 20, 2015, a memorial plaque honoring Alexander was unveiled on the Main Street Stage in Liberty, NY, just a short distance from the Old Town Cemetery in which Alexander is buried. The ceremony included a performance of seven Alexander works, and the event was sponsored by Windjammers, Unlimited. Works Unless noted, his works were published by C. L.

If the value of the coupling at that point is less than one (i.e. one can perform perturbation theory in weak coupling), then the fixed point is called a Banks–Zaks fixed point. The existence of the fixed point was first reported in 1974 by Belavin and Migdal and by Caswell, and later used by Banks and Zaks in their analysis of the phase structure of vector-like gauge theories with massless fermions. The name Caswell-Banks–Zaks fixed point is also used. More specifically, suppose that we find that the beta function of a theory up to two loops has the form : \\\\beta(g) = -b_0 g^3 + b_1 g^5 + \\\\mathcal{O}(g^7) \\\\, where b_0 and b_1 are positive constants. Then there exists a value g=g_\\\\ast such that \\\\beta(g_\\\\ast) =0: : g_\\\\ast^2 = \\\\frac{b_0}{b_1}. If we can arrange b_0 to be smaller than b_1, then we have g^2_\\\\ast <1. It follows that when the theory flows to the IR it is a conformal, weakly coupled theory with coupling g_\\\\ast. For the case of a non- Abelian gauge theory with gauge group SU(N_c) and Dirac fermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group for the flavored particles we have :b_0 = \\\\frac{1}{16\\\\pi^2}\\\\frac{1}{3}(11N_c-2N_f) \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\text{ and }\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; b_1 = -\\\\frac{1}{(16\\\\pi^2)^2}\\\\left(\\\\frac{34}{3}N_c^2 - \\\\frac{1}{2}N_f\\\\left(2 \\\\frac{N_c^2 -1}{N_c} + \\\\frac{20}{3}N_c \\\\right) \\\\right) where N_c is the number of colors and N_f the number of flavors. Then N_f should lie just below \\\\tfrac{11}{2}N_c in order for the Banks–Zaks fixed point to appear. Note that this fixed point only occurs if, in addition to the previous requirement on N_f (which guarantees asymptotic freedom), :\\\\frac{11}{2}N_c>N_f>\\\\frac{34N_c^3}{(13N_c^2-3)} where the lower bound comes from requiring b_1>0. This way b_1 remains positive while -b_0 is still negative (see first equation in article) and one can solve \\\\beta (g) = 0 with real solutions for g. The coefficient b_1 was first correctly computed by Caswell, while the earlier paper by Belavin and Migdal has a wrong answer. See also *Beta function References *T. J.

Early life Mary Lee was born in Ireland at Kilknock Estate, county Monaghan. She was married in 1844 to George Lee. The couple had seven children and a new biography gives details of her life in Ireland especially running a school for girls. Her son Ben moved to Adelaide, South Australia. When he fell ill in 1879, Lee, now a widow, and her daughter, Evelyn, immigrated to Adelaide as well.Australian Dictionary of Biography They travelled on the maiden voyage of the steamship Orient. Her son, Ben, died on 2 November 1880. Australia Bust, North Terrace, Adelaide. In 1883 Mary Lee became active in the ladies' committee of the Social Purity Society. The Society advocated changes to the law relating to the social and legal status of young women, advocating an end to child labour to protect girls from abuse and preventing them from becoming prostitutes or child brides. The group's success was a passage in the 1885 Criminal Law Consolidation Amendment Act that raised the age of consent from 13 to 16. Her first achievement was a new law to protect young women, which made it illegal for a man to have sex with a girl under 16. The Social Purity Society also was concerned with the working conditions of women. After the bill was passed in 1885 the group began campaigning for workers' rights. In December 1889 at a public meeting Lee proposed the formation of a women's trade union. The Working Women's Trades Union was founded in 1890, Mary Lee was the union's secretary for two years. In 1893 Lee attended the Trades and Labor Council meetings, served on the sub-committee which examined conditions in the clothing industry, and on the Distressed Women and Children's Committee which distributed clothes and food to the families hit by the economic depression of the 1890s.web archive Mansutti, E. Mary Lee (1821-1894) Public Work On 13 July 1888 Lee, the Social Purity League, and others met and formed the South Australian Women's Suffrage League. She was the League's co-honorary secretary and for six and half years she fought for women's suffrage. Her own letters and reports of her speeches show that she was an astute and logical woman, employing sound argument, wit and humour in her correspondence and public speaking. In 1889 she wrote: > Let husbands, brothers, fathers, be kept in mind that it is the duty of > every free man to leave his daughters as free as his sons. -as women assist > in maintaining Government they have a right to a say how and by whom they > shall be governed. Nineteenth century civilisation has accorded to women the > same political status as to the idiot and the criminal. Such is the basis of > our reverence for the person of women and of our estimate of her work. thumb Lee was active in advocating the rights of the working class, publishing the following thoughts in The Barrier Miner in respect of the 1892 Broken Hill miners' strike: > ... Sir, this strike has one feature which renders it more profoundly > interesting than any of its predecessors...which must secure it a prominent > and distinguished page when the history of these colonies shall be written. > It is that the women of Broken Hill are the first great body of working > women who have raised their voices in united protest against the glaring > injustice that 'the present constitution will not allow them a voice in > framing the laws ...'Bloodworth, S. (1996) The Rebel Women of Broken Hill in > Militant Spirits, La Trobe University, Melbourne. Bills to grant women's suffrage were put forth in the South Australian parliament between 1889 and 1893, all failed. Spurred on by the grant of women's suffrage in New Zealand, Lee, the Social Purity League, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Democratic League travelled all over South Australia, which included the Northern Territory at the time, collecting signatures on a petition. On 23 August 1894 when the Adult Suffrage Bill was read in the South Australian parliament, the women presented the great petition. The petition contained 11,600 signatures, on paper sheets from all over the colony, that had been pasted together to make a roll 122 metres long. The bill passed on 18 December 1894, it granted women the right to vote and stand for parliament, and South Australia was the first legislation worldwide to do so. Once women had the vote, Lee was active in voter education, encouraging women to enrol and vote. By her 75th birthday 60,000 women had enrolled to vote. In 1895 she was nominated to stand for parliament but refused.web archive Mansutti, E. (1821-1894) After the Suffrage was Won She was appointed to the honorary position of the only female official visitor to the Lunatic Asylums in 1896. During this latter part of her life, Lee struggled financially and had to sell her library. She continued to correspond with women in other Australian states where suffrage was not yet granted. She died in 1909 from pleurisy following influenza and was buried with her son Ben. Mary Lee Close in the Canberra suburb of Bonython is named for her. In 1994, to mark the centenary of the enfranchisement of women in South Australia she was accorded recognition as a national hero. A special proof coin was issued by the mint in her honour.Review of Mary Lee, by Denise George in Irish Times 5 January 2018.

Theory of operation Skeptics have examined the internals of many such devices and found those that have been examined to be incapable of operating as advertised, and have dismissed them as overpriced dowsing rods or similarly useless devices. Virtually all such devices claim to operate on a resonant frequency principle where the device is said to emit an electromagnetic signal, either through an antenna or a probe, that will respond to a specific substance such as gold, silver, or sometimes even paper money, and that the device will indicate the presence of such material by indicating a change in direction relative to the operator. This theory of operation is not supported by scientific theory; the devices have not been shown to work in blind testing, and the resonance principle invoked has not been shown to work in laboratories (and is not consistently employed by LRL manufacturers). In addition, the Inverse-Square Law limits the effective possible signal strength of any putative LRL; moreover, not only does this attenuation apply to the supposed emissions from the LRL devices, but the return signals from the sought-after targets are further attenuated by the same constraints. Since most of these LRL devices are powered by low voltage, low current AA, AAA or 9v cells, the resultant power available for emissions is quite minuscule at best, and the return signal would suffer even greater attenuation. Examples exist of LRL devices having no internal power source at all, and these are advertised as being self-powered or powered by ambient static electricity; these are indistinguishable from dowsing rods. Scientific evaluation Many such devices contain non-functional circuitry or naively constructed approximations of radio transmitters. A few do have functional circuitry, putting out a weak signal with a function generator or a simple timer circuit, but are still largely useless in comparison with a coil-based metal detector; others have been found to contain intentionally obfuscated or completely superfluous components (from individual components such as inductors or ribbon cables up to, in some cases, pocket calculators), often indicative of intentional fraud, incompetence, or both, by the designer. Such functioning circuitry as exists in such devices usually has no obvious way (motor, solenoid, etc.) to connect to any rotating joint in the device either, meaning the devices are often entirely dependent on the ideomotor effect to function.

These systematic killings enraged the Bengalis, who declared independence from Pakistan, to establish the new nation of Bangladesh. The violence resulting from Operation Searchlight led to the Bangladesh Liberation War, in which Mukti Bahini fought to remove Pakistani occupation forces from Bangladesh. Following the ill-fated Operation Chengiz Khan, Indian intervention resulted in the Pakistan Army's unconditional surrender to the joint command of the Indian Army and Mukti BahiniSalik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p235, Text of Surrender Document on 16 December 1971. Background After the Awami League had won a decisive majority (capturing 167 out of 313 seats) in the 1970 Pakistan parliamentary elections, the Bengali population expected a swift transfer of power to the Awami League based on the Six Point Programme. On 28 February 1971, Yahya Khan, the President of Pakistan, under the pressure of PPP of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, postponed the national assembly meeting scheduled for March. The Pakistan Peoples Party had already started lobbying to weaken the stand of Sheikh Mujib, and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was heard saying that he wanted the Bengalis to stay away. The Awami League, in response to the postponement, launched a program of non-co-operation (largely outlined in the 7 March Awami League rally) which was so successful that the authority of the Pakistan government became limited to the cantonments and government institutions in East Pakistan.Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, pp. 48–51 Clashes between civilians and the Pakistani Army, and between Bengali and Bihari communities erupted and became commonplace. President Yahya Khan flew to Dhaka to hold talks with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League, in March, and was later joined by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, then the leader of Pakistan Peoples Party, which had secured the second largest share of seats (81 out of 300) in the elections. Unwilling to transfer power to East Pakistan as demanded by Awami League (fearing a transfer of power would weaken or destroy the federation), or to lose face by backing down in face of the non-co-operation movement, the Pakistani generals, most of which including Gul Hassan Khan supported the Pakistan Peoples Party, finally decided on a military crackdown. After the convening of the National Assembly was postponed by Yahya Khan on 1 March, ethnic Biharis in East Pakistan, who supported West Pakistan, were targeted. In early March 1971 300 Biharis were killed in rioting by mobs in Chittagong. The Government of Pakistan used the 'Bihari massacre' to justify its military intervention in East Pakistan on 25 March, when it initiated Operation Searchlight. Prior to the launch of the operation, a final meeting was held in General Headquarters (GHQ). Governor of East Pakistan Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan objected to the planned operation. Air Officer Commanding (AOC) of Dhaka airbase Air Commodore Mitty Masud also objected to the operation, fearing that violence would provoke East-Pakistan into more violence. However, under pressure during the meeting from Pakistan's Army and Air Force's general, General Yahya Khan gave orders to his Army and Air Force commanders to launch the operation. Admiral Ahsan was relieved of his post.Farman Ali, Maj. Gen. Rao, How Pakistan got Divided, p. 60 When the operation came into effect, Air-Commodore Mitty Masud refused to use airstrikes and was relieved from his post on March 31. The operational plan =The planning process= The plan was drawn up in March 1971 by Major General Khadim Hussain Raja, GOC 14th Division, and Major General Rao Farman Ali, as a followup of decisions taken at a meeting of the Pakistan Army staff on 22 February.Islam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 57, The 16th infantry division from Quetta and the 9th division from Kharian, West Pakistan, were ordered to prepare to move to East Pakistan in mid-February also as a result of that meeting. Before putting the plan into action, senior West Pakistani officers in East Pakistan who were unwilling to support the military attack on civilians, Lt. General Shahabzada Yakub Khan, GOC East Pakistan, and the governor of East Pakistan, Vice Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, were relieved of their duties. Lt. Gen. Tikka Khan became the Governor and GOC of East Pakistan. On 17 March, General Raja was given authority to plan the operation via telephone by General Abdul Hamid Khan, Chief of Staff of the Pakistan Army. On the morning of 18 March, General Raja and Major General Rao Farman Ali wrote the plan at the GOC's office at Dhaka (Dhaka) cantonment. The plan was written on a \\"Light Blue Office Pad with a Lead Pencil\\" by General Farman containing \\"16 Paragraphs Spread Over Five Pages\\". General Farman defined the operational premises and conditions for success, while General Khadim Raja dealt with the distribution of forces and tasks assigned to the individual brigades and other units. It assumed that the Bengali Army and other military units would revolt at the onset of operationsWitness to Surrender, Salik, Siddiq, pp. 63–64 and the planners suggested that all armed Bengali units should be disarmed prior to commencing the operation, and the political leadership arrested during a planned meeting with the President, General Yahya Khan. No operational reserves were earmarked. The handwritten plan was reviewed by General Abdul Hamid Khan and Lt. General Tikka Khan on 20 March at the flag staff house. General Abdul Hamid Khan objected to the immediate disarming of regular army Bengali units, but approved the disarming of the EPR, armed police and other para-military formations. Yahya Khan refused to sanction the arrest of Awami League leaders during a meeting with him, as the plan had proposed. The amended plan was approved and distributed to various area commanders. The Operation was to start on the night of 25 March 1971 in Dhaka, and other garrisons were to be alerted via phone about their zero hour to start their activities. General Farman Ali commanded the forces in Dhaka, while the rest of the province was commanded by General Khadim. Lt. General Tikka Khan and his staff were present in the 31st field command centre, to supervise and support the command staff of the 14th division. The initial plan to arrest by a company of No 3 SSG, led by major ZA Khan was scheduled at 0100 on 26 March night. Major components of the plan = Operational premises = As outlined by the Pakistani planners, the operation aimed to eliminate the Awami League apparatus and any civilians and personnel of the armed forces supporting the Awami League movement in defiance of martial law. Cunning, surprise, deception and speed was emphasised as crucial for success. Use of free and greater force was authorised. Search and assault of civilian areas and Hindu areas also were authorised.Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, pp. 228–229 = Requirements for success = Requirements for success: # Operation to be launched simultaneously all across East Pakistan. # Maximum number of political and student leaders, and those among cultural organisations and teaching staff to be arrested. # Operation must achieve 100% success in Dhaka. Dhaka University would be occupied and searched. # Free and greater use of fire authorised for securing cantonments. # All internal and international communications to be cut off, including telephone, television, radio and telegraph. # All East Pakistani (Bengali) troops to be neutralised by seizing weapons and ammunition. # To deceive the Awami League, President Yahya Khan to pretend to continue dialogue, even if Mr. Bhutto disagrees, and to agree to Awami League demands. The designated centres of offensive operations under that plan were Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong, Comilla, Jessore, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Saidpur and Sylhet, areas where West Pakistani army units were concentrated. Pakistani Army units and paramilitary elements in other areas of East Pakistan were to maintain control of their respective areas and await reinforcements during the initial phase of the operation. Once Dhaka had been secured, the 9th and 16th divisions from Pakistan were to be airlifted into East Pakistan as reinforcements. Cities with airfields (Chittagong, Sylhet, Jessore, Rangpur, Comilla) would be reinforced via C-130 aircraft or heliborne troops directly from Dhaka. Although the plan did not specify the time needed to subdue East Pakistan, it was assumed that after the arrest of the political leadership and disarming of the Bengali military and paramilitary units, civilians could be terrorised into submitting to martial law within a week.Islam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 57 Lt. Gen. Tikka Khan estimated that no resistance would remain after 10 April. =Composition of Pakistan Armed Forces in East Pakistan= Operation Searchlight: Location of Pakistani and Bengali units on 25 March 1971. Some unit locations are not shown. The 14th infantry division was the only Pakistan Army division stationed in East Pakistan in March 1971. This division had four infantry brigades attached to it, instead of the normally allotted three brigades.Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 340–341 The 57th infantry brigade (under Brig. Jahanzab Arbab – W. Pakistani) was headquartered in Dhaka, the 53rd (Brig. Iqbal Shafi- W. Pakistani) was in Comilla, the 23rd (Brig. Abdullah Khan Malik – Pakistani) in Rangpur and the 107th (Brig. A.R. Durrani – W. Pakistani) was in Jessore. Brig. M.H. Mozumdar, a Bengali, was in command of the Chittagong area. Normally, each brigade contained 3 or 4 infantry battalions and a field artillery regiment and various support elements. These four brigades had 12 infantry battalionsQureshi, Maj Gen Hakeem, The 1971 Indo-Pak War, p. 20 (regiments normally had 915 soldiers each) containing purely West Pakistani personnel (mainly hailing from Punjabi, Baluch, Pathan and Sindhi background) before 25 March 1971. This division also had 5 field artillery regiments, a light anti aircraft regiment, a commando battalion (the 3rd), all of which contained a majority of Pakistani personnel, in various East Pakistani bases. The only armoured regiment in East Pakistan, the 29th Cavalry in Rangpur, was a mixed unit.Major Nasir Uddin, Judhay Judjay Shadhinota, p. 103 20% of the East Pakistan Rifles (EPR) personnel were also from West Pakistan, while the support elements of the various units and cantonments were mostly of mixed nationality. Most of the individual unit commanders and majority of the officers were from West Pakistan. West Pakistani Army personnel were also posted at Station HQ, Dhaka, Pakistan Ordnance Factory, Gazipur, Central Ordnance Depot, Dhaka, Ammunition Depot, Rajendrapur, Embercation Unit – Chittagong and with some field intelligence units.Bhuiyan, Major Kamrul Hassan, Shadinata Volume one, pp129 The Pakistan Air Force had 20 F-86 Sabre Jets and 3 T-33 Trainers at the Dhaka airbase. The Army aviation wing had a flight of 2 Mil Mi-8 and 2 Allouette III helicopters, under the command of Major Liakat Bukhari posted in East Pakistan.Singh, Maj. Gen. Sukhwant, The Liberation of Bangladesh Vol.1, p. 83 The whole squadron was transferred to Dhaka after 25 March 1971. C-130 Hercules planes were transferred from West Pakistan to Dhaka for the operation. Airfields were located in Chittagong, Comilla, Lalmonirhat near Rangpur, in Salutikor near Sylhet, in Jessore and near Thakurgaon. Rear-Admiral Mohammad Shariff (later 4-Star Admiral) was given the command of the navy in East Pakistan. The Pakistan Navy had 4 gunboats (Rajshahi, Jessore, Comilla, and Sylhet) a patrol boat (Balaghat) and the destroyer PNS JahangirRahman, Commando Khalilur Rahman, Muktijudday Nou Abhijan, p. 25 in East Pakistan. PNS Babur, flagship of the Pakistan Navy would visit East Pakistan after the operation started. Major naval bases were located in Dhaka, Chittagong and Mongla. Pakistan Army Bengali units in East Pakistan Six regular army Bengali infantry regiments were present in East Pakistan in March 1971. The 1st East Bengal Regiment (EBR) was in Jessore, attached to the 107th Brigade. The 2nd EBR was in Joydevpur north of Dhaka, attached to the 57th Brigade. The 3rd EBR was in Saidpur with the 23rd Brigade, and the 4th EBR was in Comilla with the 53rd Brigade. The 8th EBR was preparing to ship to West Pakistan and was at 75% strength in Chittagong. The East Bengal Regimental Center (EBRC) in Chittagong housed 2,000 Bengali troops including the newly raised 9th EBR. The 10th EBR, a training unit, was in the Dhaka cantonment attached to the 14th Division. Bengali officers commanded the 1st, 2nd and the 10th EBR, while the rest were under Pakistani officers.Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 5–14 Other Bengali forces East Pakistan Police, almost exclusively Bengali, had 33,995 members of all ranks, 23,606 members were armed while the rest had firearms training.Chowdhury, Lt. Col. Abu Osman, Our Struggle is The struggle for Independence, pp97 Several thousand Anser and Mujahid members, trained to fire .303 rifles, were scattered around the province. The East Pakistan Rifles (EPR), a 15,000 strong (80% Bengali)Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 69 paramilitary force, was divided into 17 operational wings (each wing contained 3 to 6 companies of 150 men each) in 7 sectors (headquartered in Dhaka, Mymenshingh, Jessore, Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Sylhet and Chittagong) and was deployed around the country. The EPR companies were often divided into sections (15–20 soldiers) and platoons (20–35 soldiers) and deployed in camps near the border or in border outposts. Unlike regular army units, EPR companies were commanded by JCO/NCOs (army companies normally were commanded by Captains or Major ranked officers), and EPR wings contained only light anti-tank weapons and a mortar platoon with 6 mortars as artillery. EPR Headquarters and 2,500 EPR troops were posted in Dhaka. The majority of the EPR officers were from West Pakistan, serving on deputation from the regular army for 2 to 3 years. Pre operational steps implementation The planners needed to ensure that all Pakistani unit commanders became aware of their role prior to commencing the operation, which had to be done while maintaining complete secrecy. The concentration of forces and allocation of supplies, as well as arrival of reinforcements from West Pakistan and briefing of Area commanders had to be carried without raising suspicion. On 24 and 25 March, a group of Pakistani Generals, accompanied by General Hamid, General Mittha, the Quartermaster General, and Col. Saadullah, Principal Staff Officer, visited major garrisons via helicopter and personally briefed garrison commanders and senior West Pakistani officers on the operation. General Farman was sent to Jessore, General Khadim himself briefed the Comilla and Chittagong garrison commanders while Brig. El-Edrus and Col. Saadullah visited Rangpur.Farman Ali, Maj. Gen. Rao, How Pakistan got Divided, p. 84 Secrecy through operations security had been strictly maintained; only a few Lt. Colonels learned about the plan beforehand on a need to know basis. Although some Bengali officers had become suspicious of the all-West Pakistani officer briefings, no one outside the briefings learned the details beforehand. =Managing logistics= Maj. Gen. Qamar Ali Mirza and Brig. Harrison arrived from West Pakistan during the second week of March to arrange the logistical details, mainly because the non-co-operation program was hampering food supply to the cantonments.Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 27, The main ammunition depots were located in Rajendrapur near Dhaka and 9000 tons of arms and ammunition were in Chittagong aboard MV Swat, so it was decided to speed up the unloading of the ship. Pakistani troops started arriving in Dhaka via PIA flights carrying \\"special passengers\\", in addition to the 13 FF and 22 Baluch which had already arrived.Major Nasir Uddin, Judhay Judjay Shadhinota, p. 94 Pakistanis planned to send a brigade to East Pakistan to enhance the chance of success prior to 25 March, and the new arrivals were part of that processes.Niazi, Lt. Gen A.A.K, The Betrayal of East Pakistan, p. 76 Pakistan Army Eastern Command also had to make arrangements to house and feed these additional arrivals – a fact that was noted by Bengali officers in the army supply units, but ultimately nothing threatening to the plan came of this. Brig. Harrison stayed behind in Dhaka to co-ordinate the logistical effort after Gen. Mirza left for West Pakistan to arrange matters there. =Shuffling of armed forces personnel= The army also took steps to enhance their chances of success by relocating Bengali officers away from sensitive areas, and bringing Pakistani troops to the cities. The departure of two Pakistan Army units, the 25th PunjabShafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 98, and the 20th BaluchShafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 57, was delayed, while the 13th Frontier Force and the 22nd Baluch regiments were flown to Dhaka from West Pakistan before 25 March. To maintain secrecy, no major reinforcements were initially sent to the other garrisons in East Pakistan before 25 March. Brig. Mozumdar, who had refused to fire on Bengali civilians blocking the unloading of MV Swat, was relieved of his post on 24 March by Gen. Khadim himself on the pretext that he was needed to address 2 EBR at Joydevpur and Brig. M.H. Ansari (West Pakistani – Station Commander Dhaka) took command of Chittagong area.Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 69 Maj. Khaled Musharraf, Brigade Major of the 57th Brigade in Dhaka, was sent to 4th EBR in Comilla as 2IC on 22 March.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 185 Lt. Col. Masudul Hasan (CO 2nd EBR) was relieved of his post on 23 March, and Lt. Col. Quazi A.F.M.A Raquib took over on 25 March.Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, p. 7 Pakistanis refrained from mass transfer of Bengali officers, as that might have compromised security of the plan. Bengali officers were urged to take leave (although all leave had been cancelled since February 1971), while West Pakistani officers were told to stay put. Families of West Pakistani officers and soldiers were evacuated from East Pakistan, and when possible families of some West Pakistani civilians were brought into the cities. Dispersion of Bengali units before 25 March Denied permission by General Hamid to disarm the regular Bengali army units en masse before the crackdown,Farman Ali, Maj. Gen. Rao, How Pakistan got Divided, p. 83 the Pakistani command employed other ploys to minimise the threat of these formations. Bengali units were sent out of the cantonments, or were broken into smaller units and deployed away from each other, and cut off from the main radio and wireless communication grid before or on 25 March. Bengali officers were sent on leave, or were posted away from command centres or units directly involved in the operation. In some cases, West Pakistani officers took command of Bengali formations. Some Bengali soldiers were sent on leave, and some were disarmed on various pretexts whenever possible without raising alarm.\\"The Rape of Bangladesh\\", Anthony Mascarnehas, Viks Press, Delhi, 1983 The 1st EBR (at 50% strength), was sent out of Jessore cantonment to Chaugacha near the border for winter training, where they stayed until 29 March. Companies of the 2nd EBR were disbursed around areas outside Dhaka and their radio communication net was shut off. The 3rd EBR had its companies disbursed around Ghoraghat, and at Parvatipur outside the Saidpur cantonment. The 4th EBR units were deployed between Brahmanbaria and Shamshernagar. Only in Chittagong did the regular Bengali army units remain in their respective bases. West Pakistani EPR troops were posted in the cities whenever possible, while Bengali EPR troops were sent to the border outposts. Most EPR units were away from the main action areas, and would need at least a day to reach the major cities. The EPR wireless net was shut off on the night of 24 or 25 March.  Operation Searchlight: 25/26 March to 10 April  Also See: Pakistani order of battle for Operation Searchlight in 1971 This is a brief description of the units engaged and the result of Pakistani military action from 25 March until 10 April, when the operation was supposed to end. This only covers events in the areas that were the major focus of Operation Searchlight, not the Bengali resistance throughout East Pakistan. In some areas, Pakistani assault and mass murders started clashes with the Bengali forces on 25 March. In other areas, no clashes took place until as late as 30 March. =Dhaka= Operation Searchlight: Location of Pakistani targets in Dhaka on 25 March 1971. Map is not to exact scale. Pakistani troops in Dhaka, commanded by Maj. Gen. Farman, had the following objectives:Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 231 * Impose curfew at 0110 hrs, close telephone/telegraph/radio stations, and shut all presses down * Seal off the city by taking over road, rail and river communication and patrol rivers * Arrest Sheikh Mujib and 15 top Awami League leaders during operation * Conduct house to house searches in Dhanmondi and Hindu areas * Subdue Dhaka University, EPR HQ and Rajarbagh police line, disarm 2nd and 10th EBR * Take over and protect the ammunition factory at Gazipur and the arms depot at Rajendrapur. Pakistani forces:Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, p. 340 In addition to the Eastern Command HQ, the headquarters of the 14th division and the 57th brigade were also located in Dhaka cantonment. The regular army units present were: the 57th Brigade containing: 18th and 32nd Punjab (C.O: Lt. Col. Taj) regiments, 13th Frontier Force regiment, 22nd Baluch regiment, 604th Intelligence unit and the 31st Field Artillery Regiment (CO: Lt. Col. Zahid Hassan). 14th division HQ had the following units attached to it: 43rd Light Ack-Ack regiment (CO: Lt. Col. Shaffat Ali – Pakistani), elements of the 3rd Commando Battalion (CO: Lt. Col. Z.A. Khan – Pakistani), 19th Signal Regiment (CO: Lt. Col. Ifthekhar Hussain -Pakistani) and the 149th infantry workshop. PAF personnel were stationed at the Tejgaon Airport. A squadron of at least 14 M24 Chaffee tanks from the 29th Cavalry regiment was stationed in Dhaka along with 2 Tank troops with 6 PT-76 tanks.Bhuiyan, Major Kamrul Hassan, Shadinata Volume one, pp127 In addition to these units, other support elements (engineering, supply and medical units) of the 57th brigade, the 14th division and the Eastern Command HQ were located in Dhaka. Bengali forces:Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, p. 15 The 10th EBR, called \\"National Service Battalion\\" had a few trainers under the command of Lt. Col Moyeeduddin Ahmed, a Bengali officer.Bhuiyan, Major Kamrul Hassan, Shadinata Volume one, pp133 2,500 EPR troops were attached with the EPR HQ (the 13th, 15th and 16th wings, plus the EPR HQ wing and signals wing) at Pilkhana.Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 47 Each EPR wing contained 3 companies, although most EPR troops were at Pilkhana, 2 companies were deployed in Mirpur, two at the President house and one at the Governor house in the city.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 150 W. Pakistani Brig. Nissar Ahmad Khan was the director general of all EPR while Lt. Col. Anwar Hossain Shah (W. Pakistani) commanded EPR Dhaka sector troops. The Rajarbag police line housed at least 2,000 armed police. 2nd EBR (C.O: Lt. Col. Rakib – Bengali) was at Joydevpur to the north of Dhaka, with one company in Tangail and one at Mymensying and a small detachment at Gazipur. EPR 2nd wing HQ (C.O – Capt. Qamar Abbas – W. Pakistani) was also at Mymensingh, containing no Bengali officers.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 176 Course of events:Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 73 The Pakistani plan of action for Dhaka, as drawn up by Maj. Gen. Farman, was: # 13th Frontier Force to stay in cantonment as reserve and provide security # 43rd Light Ack Ack regiment was to secure Tejgaon airport # 22nd Baluch regiment would disarm the EPR and seize wireless at Pilkhana EPR HQ # 32nd Punjab was to neutralise Rajarbag Police line # 18th Punjab was to fan out and secure Nawabpur and old Dhaka # 31st Field was to secure Second capital, Mohammadpur and Mirpur # A platoon from 3 SSG was to capture Sheikh Mujib # 22nd Baluch and 32nd Punjab was to neutralise Dhaka University \\"rebels\\" # 22 Baluch would be reinforced at Pilkhana Bengali EPR officers were detained by the Pakistanis in Pilkhana and the troops were mostly ordered to stand down and relax, while 22nd Baluch took over security duties at Pilkhana on 25 March morning hours. Rumor spread in the city after dusk that Yahia Khan had left and Awami League volunteers put up makeshift barricades in the streets, but these did not cause any significant delay to Pakistani troop movements. The volunteers manning the barricades were the first civilians to be shot by Pakistani troops. Although the operation was to start at 0110 hours, Pakistani troops moved out at 11:30 pm from Dhaka cantonment as the Pakistani field commander wished to cut the reaction time of the Bengali forces.Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 72 The army was given a 6-hour deadline to achieve its goal in Dhaka. Pakistan Army troops quickly shut off all communication channels in Dhaka before commencing the operation. The 10th Bengal was easily disarmed in the cantonment and later eliminated. The 31st Field was deployed in the second capital of Dhaka city itself and secured the northern part of the city.Islam, Maj Rafiql, A Tale of Millions, p. 114 The commandos, accompanied by Major Belal and Lt. Col. Z.A. Khan easily captured Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at the beginning of the crackdown,Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 75 but most of the Awami League senior leadership save one managed to evade capture and left the city by 29 March. The audio tape containing all these were done by the siblings, resident of Khilgaon Chowdhury Para area, Dhaka. Belal's troop was referred as Belal boys. The capture of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was announced to all units (perhaps) \\"The big bird has been caged\\". The death of Commodore Moazzem Hossain was announced in Urdu. The military were searching for Tajuddin and Bhuiya and they were announcing that any building shown hoisting black flag or Bangladeshi flag will be knocked down. They referred to Bengali as \\"Native Language\\". One copy of this tape is given to Muktijuddho Jadughor, but the original is retained by the brother of the two siblings – Dr. Mozammel Hussain. 22nd Baluch at the EPR HQ attacked and subdued the disorganised resistance of the mostly disarmed EPR after an all night battle.Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 48 Pakistanis captured the EPR troops posted at Mirpur, the President House and the Governor House without resistance, but many managed to flee while others were executed.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, pp. 152–154 Contingents from the 18th and 32nd Punjab regiments surrounded and assaulted the Dhaka University area, subdued the light resistance from the Awami League volunteers, killed over a hundred unarmed students present in the resident halls, murdered 10 professors, then moved on to attack the Hindu areas and the old town on the morning of 26 March.Islam, Maj Rafiql, A Tale of Millions, pp. 115–116 The Police at Rajarbag, aided by Awami League volunteers, put up a fierce resistance, but were eventually overcome and most survivors were captured or scattered.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 153 Pakistani forces had used artillery and armour liberally, disregarding civilian safety altogether during the operation. The city was secured before dawn and a curfew was imposed. Surviving EPR and police fled the city, some crossed the Buriganga river to gather at Jingira.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 155 Sporadic attacks on the Army took place during 26 March – 5 April, but barring the failure to arrest Awami League leaders, the Army had achieved its objectives. Pakistani soldiers had also destroyed the Shaheed Minar, offices of The Daily Ittefaq, Daily People and the Kali temple at Ramna, none of which had any military value. Captured Bengali soldiers, EPR and police personnel were either summarily executed or imprisoned without trial. From 26 March to 6 April, in an operation dubbed \\"GREAT FLY-IN\\"Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 87 PIA Boeings and C 130 Transports would fly the 9th (made of the 27th, 313ed and 117th Brigades) and 16th (34th and 205th Brigades) divisions (a total of 5 Brigade HQs, containing 16 infantry battalions) to Dhaka,Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 90 and elements of these formations would be flown to various locations in East Pakistan to reinforce Pakistani garrisons. Two mortar batteries and two wings each of EPCAF and West Pakistan Rangers, accompanied by a considerable number of Tochi and Thal Scouts were also deployed. PAF No. 6 Squadron had 9 C-130B/E Hercules Aircraft available in March 1971. 5 C-130B and 1 C-130E were employed to transfer troops from West to East Pakistan under Operation Great Fly-In. After 25 March, two C-130B planes were stationed in Dhaka. PIA fleet had 7 Boeing 707 and 4 Boeing 720 planes, 75% of PIA transport capacity was also used to ferry troops from West Pakistan. Pakistan Army lifted the curfew for 2 hours on 27 March, when thousands of civilians left Dhaka for the countryside. Pakistani troops began to move out of the city after 26 March, taking up positions at Demra to the east, Tongi to the north and Narayangaung to the south to block road access to the city. By 10 April, Pakistani Army had taken over the area between the Padma River to the south and Tangail-Narshindi to the north. Mymensingh-Joydevpur The 2nd EBR was posted in Joydevpur to the north of Dhaka, and had detachments posted in the Gazipur Ordnance factory (which had a small arsenal)and Rajendrapur Munitions factory (also housed an ammunition depot). Pakistani planners had feared that this unit could launch attacks on Dhaka Airport or the cantonment itself and disrupt the operation during the early hours of 25/26 March, when Dhaka garrison had no reserve forces to spare.Ali Khan, Rao Farman, How Pakistan Got Divided, p. 8, Although Lt. Col. Masoudul Hosssain Khan had informed Maj. K M Shafiullah of the Pakistani crackdown on 26 March via telephone, the unit did not take any action until 27 March. Pakistani troops took control of the Rajendrapur factory on 26 March and began to replenish munitions from that depot. EPR 2nd wing (4 companies, one in Mymenshing, while other were posted to the north at Naqshi, Karaitoli and Lengura) was HQed at Mymenshing, along with a company of 2 EBR and a mixed company of W. Pakistani soldiers. The Pakistani unit attacked the EPR company on 27 March but was wiped out on 28 March, while other 2nd Wing companies neutralised Pakistani soldiers (either arrested them and sent them across the border or killed them) and deployed in towns to the east and west of Mymensingh by 29 March.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, pp. 177–178 The 2nd EBR, under Major Shafiullah, revolted on 27 March, partially looted the Gazipur armoury and regrouped at Mymensingh on 30 March. Shafiullah took command of 2nd EBR and 7 EPR companies (4 from 2nd wing and 3 made out of EPR, police, Mujahid and Answer personnel), and deployed his forces at Tangail, Bahadurabad, Sirajgaung, and Gaffargaon by 30 March.Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 72 3 EPR companies were sent to Dhaka to conduct sneak attacks, while the 2nd EBR moved via Kishorgaung and Narshindi to attack Dhaka. Maj. Shafiullah cancelled this plan on 31 March and joined the forces of Khaled Mosharraf north of Comilla with the 2nd EBR troops. Major Shafiullah deployed his forces as follows: 1 Company each at Narshindi, Ashuganj, Azabpur, Brahmanbaria, Sarail, Taliapara, 2 EBR HQ at Teliapara, and 1 company sent to Shadipur in Sylhet, and 1 to Chittagong to help Major Zia.Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 88 Pakistani forces (27th Brigade) moved north from Dhaka on 1 April, one column headed for Tangail while the other for Narshindi. EPR forces ambushed them near Tangail, but Pakistanis broke through despite heavy casualties and Tangail fell on 9 April.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 181–182 Two columns headed north from Tangail, one towards Jamalpur and the other towards Mymensingh. Despite being repeatedly ambushed by Bengali forces, Jamalpur fell on 14 April and Mymensingh by 22 April. PAF bombed Narshindi on 6 April, dispursing the EPR forces, and the army column (31st Baluch) attacked EPR positions near Narshindi on 8 April. This was repulsed, but the next attack, aided by artillery and Saber jets, broke through on 9 April and Narshindi fell on 12 April.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 182 Mopping up action was conducted by the 27th Brigade, which secured Mymensingh, Sylhet and part of Comilla division by June. =Chittagong= Operation Searchlight: Location of Pakistani targets in Chittagong on 25 March 1971. Map is not to exact scale. Chittagong housed the only oil refinery in East Pakistan, had a large fuel depot, was the largest seaport and MV Swat, with 9000 tons of arms and ammunition was in port. Bengali units substantially outnumbered the West Pakistani Chittagong garrison, which was a cause of concern for Pakistani planners. Bengali officers of EPR and EBR had discussed a preemptive strike on Pakistan forces, but the senior Bengali officers (Lt. Col M.R. Choudhury -Chief Instructor, EBRC) and Major Ziaur Rahman (2IC, 8 EBR), dissuaded Captain Rafiq (Sector Adjutant, EPR) from rebelling in the belief that the Pakistani army would not take action against civilians, but confirmed that they would revolt in case of any Pakistani attack.Islam, Maj Rafiql, A Tale of Millions, p. 22–25 Attempts to unload arms and ammunition from MV Swat were a partial failure during 20–25 March, as civilian protestors blocked any attempt to take the arms to the cantonment and many were shot by the army. Brig. Mazumdar was relieved of his post because of this failure. Pakistani units were given the following objectives in Chittagong:Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, pp. 233–234 * Disarm EBRC units, 8 EBR, EPR and police units * Seize police armoury, radio station and telephone exchange * Liaise with Pakistani Navy * Arrest Lt. Col. M.R. Choudhury and Awami League leaders. The Chittagong garrison was to be reinforced by the bulk of 53rd Brigade troops from Comilla on 26 March. Pakistani forces:Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 83Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 166 The Chittagong cantonment is located to the north of the city, while the Naval base was near the airport on the south end of the city. The port facilities are positioned between the airport and the naval base. The 20th Baluch regiment (CO: Lt. Col. Fatami-Pakistani), minus its advance party, was the only army unit present in the cantonment besides a company from the 31st Punjab and elements from the 3rd Commando battalion. These were supported by a section of 6 M24 Chaffee tanks from the 29 Cavalry. 20 Baluch had 400 troops, 29th Cavalry had 100 soldiers, while another 100 troops were attached with various service units. Some plain cloths Commandos were in the cityChowdhury, Lt. Col. Abu Osman, Our Struggle is The Struggle for Independence, pp97 The Pakistani Navy (under Commodore Mumtaz) had 300 troops and the PAF had an unknown number of personnel at the naval base and at the airport respectively. Also, some commandos were operating in civilian clothing in the city.Islam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 61 EPR had about 300 Pakistani troops in Chittagong EPR HQ. PNS Jahangir, a destroyer, and the gunboat PNS Rajshahi and PNS Balaghat was also present in Chittagong. Brig. Ansari took command of the port area, while Lt. Col Fatami looked after the cantonment. Bengali forces:Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 4–5, 12–14, 20–22 The East Bengal Regimental Center (EBRC – Commanded by Lt. Col. Shaigri- Pakistani), located in the cantonment housed 2,000 Bengali troops, including the newly raised 9th EBR. The 8th EBR (CO: Lt. Col. Rashid Janjua, Pakistani) was at 50% strength and stationed outside the cantonment. EPR Sector #6 was HQed in Chittagong (CO: Lt. Col. Abdul Aziz Sheikh – W. Pakistani) contained the 11th (5 companies, CO Major Md. Iqbal, W. Pakistani), 14th (4 companies, CO Major Shamsuddin Ahmed, Bengali) and the 17th wings(4 companies, CO Major Peer Mohammad, W. Pakistani). Sector HQ was at Halishahar south of the cantonment, where a company from each wing in addition to HQ company, nearly 600 Bengali and 300 Pakistani troops were billeted. Other 14th Wing companies were deployed at Ramgarh, Taindong and Sajek, to the north and east of Chittagong. 17th wing had 2 companies at Kaptai and 1 at Rangamati. 11th Wing had a company each at Cox's Bazar, Teknaf, Barkal and Maislong areas. The Dampara police line housed a substantial police contingent. A company of Bengali troops were deployed to unload munitions from the MV Swat at the port,Bhuyan, Maj. Gen. MSA, Muktijuddhay Noi Mash, p. 36 while an EPR platoon guarded the airport. Course of events: 25 March The daytime witnessed nothing unusual, Pakistani and Bengali troops continued normal activities, while civilians barricaded streets to impede army movements. 1 Company of Bengali soldiers unloaded the MV Swat, all day and night, which would be finished by 26 March midday. Pakistani navy secured the airport just after dusk,Islam, Maj Rafiql, A Tale of Millions, p. 104 capturing all EPR personnel stationed there. Commodore Mumtaj prevented any massacre of Bengali Naval personnel at the naval base but also ensured they cause no mischief.Col(ret) Mohammad Shafiq Ullah BP, Muktijuddye Nou Commando, Ahmed Publishing House, p. 13 The port facility was secured by a Pakistani infantry company by 9:00 PM. Communication networks were partially shutdown. Around 8:30 PM, Captain Rafiq was informed of troop movements in Dhaka by Chittagong Awami League leader Dr. Zafar. He immediately went to the EPR HQ and successfully took control of the facility by 10:30, imprisoning about 300 Pakistani EPR members, then sent a prearranged signal to all Bengali EPR companies attached to the Chittagong EPR sector to imprison all Pakistani soldiers and come to the city. This is the only instance where Bengali units launched a preemptive strike against the Pakistanis during the operation. Captain Rafiq deployed his troops in Agrabad (100 soldiers), Railway Hill (150) and Court hill (a platoon). The rest guarded the EPR HQ. The EPR Ramgarh contingent was told to blow up the Shuvopur bridge. As per his discussions with Lt. Col. M.R. Choudhury and Major Zia, he had assumed they would take over the cantonment – an assumption that would have fatal consequences.Islam, Maj. Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, pp. 94–104 20 Baluch, under Lt. Col Fatami, sent 6 truck loaded with troops to secure EBRC around 11:30 pm. They achieved total surprise and killed over 1000+ Bengali troops and their families and secured the area by 3:30 pm. (Islam pp. 105–106) Lt Col. M.R. Choudhury was among those killed, while surviving Bengali personnel were scattered. Pakistani forces had partially achieved their objectives by securing the cantonment, the port and the airport, and they awaited reinforcements from Comilla before taking further steps. 8 EBR troops at Sholoshahar were unaware of the attack on EBRC. Major Ziaur Rahman was away, making his way to port to unload ammunition from MV Swat around 11:45 pm while Major Mir Shawkat Ali had been ordered to take a company to the port. When some of the EBRC survivors reached 8 EBR lines begging for help, Captain Oli Ahmad (Oli Ahmed) began recalling EBR troops to Sholoshahar and arrested all Pakistani soldiers and officers of the unit. After taking controle of 8 EBR Captain Oli Ahmad (Oli Ahmed) sent Captain Khalekuzzaman to find Zia and bring him back. Captain Khalek managed to find Maj. Zia and get his escort of Pakistani troops back to 8 EBR lines, where Zia managed to arrest his escort and order Bengali troops to revolt. Bengali officers were divided in their opinion, some wanted to take on the 20 Baluch at EBRC to save Bengali lives, but ultimately it was decided that such a move would be suicidal. 8 EBR left the city and took position across the Kalurghat bridge around 1:15 am.Islam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, pp. 108–110 Bengali troops killed all Pakistani prisoners including 8 EBR CO, Lt. Col. Janjua who was killed by his second in command Major ZiaMaj. Gen. Rao Farman Ali Khan – How Pakistan Got Divided; Jang Publishers, Lahore, 1992; page 86 prior to moving out. Pakistani troops from the Naval base launched an unsuccessful attack on the EPR HQ in the early hours (2:00 am – 4:00 am) of 26 March. Around 4:00 March 26, Major Bahar (CO 53rd Brigade Signal Company -Bengali), warned Captain Rafiq of 80 to 100 vehicles bearing the bulk of 53rd Brigade troops under Brig. Iqbal Shaffi was moving towards Chittagomg. Captain Rafiq sent an EPR Machine gun platoon under Subadar Musa, with a mortar and rocket launcher to delay the Pakistani column near Kumira, 12 miles north of Chittagong.Islam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 120, M.R Siddiqui (Awami League leader) had phoned Captain Haroon (2IC 17th EPR Wing) in Kaptai around 9:40 pm about the situation in Chittagong. By 11:30 pm Captain Haroon had taken control of the wing, put Pakistani personnel in jail, and had signalled EPR troops in border areas to move to Chittagong by 3:30 am. Captain Haroon with his troops reached Kalurghat Bridge by 26 March morning, where Major Zia ordered him to stay with the 8 EBR troops, along with 2 EPR companies coming from TeknafIslam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 122, Rangamati EPR Company imprisoned their Pakistani members and took position to the north east of cantonment by the early hours of 26 March. Bengali plan of resistance had fallen apart, EPR troops were to remain without the expected reinforcements throughout the battle.  26 March  53rd Brigade detachment had moved out around 3:00 am from Comilla, but was repeatedly faced delays on the way because of barricades, damaged culverts and other obstacles thrown up by civilians during their 100-mile journey to Chittagong, forcing them to stop and make makeshift repairs and diversion roads before moving on. They captured the partially damaged Suvapor Bridge intact around 10:00 amSalik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, p. 80 then stopped to make repairs. Brig. Shaffi was ordered to make for Chittagong, so he resumed his advance with the infantry, commando troops and some mortars after midday, when his engineers put up a path across the ravine, leaving his engineers and mortar battery at Shuvopur. By 7 pm, 26 March, this group had reached Kumira (Comeera), by which time Captain S.A. Bhuyan (after talking with Captain Rafiq over phone) of EBRC had reinforced the EPR Platoon at Kumira with 70 soldiers, and had divided his forces in 3 platoons to set up an ambush. 20 Baluch with some tanks had secured the area immediately around the cantonment in the morning. During the day Pakistani troops from naval base and EPR soldiers had several clashes inside the city, especially around the Agrabad area and the Railway hill resulting in Pakistani soldiers being bottled up in the naval base. Bengali positions in the city came under shellfire from Pakistani Naval ships and artillery, while Bengali troops at the port facility were disarmed around midday and shot before dusk. Around 2:30 pm local Awami League leader M. A. Hannan made a declaration of Independence on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from the Kalurghat Radio station, which was not picked up by many people.Islam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, pp. 123–124 Around 7 pm, Brig. Shaffi's troops were ambushed near Kumira, losing 10 killed, and suffering almost 100 casualties, including Lt. Col. Shahpur Khan (CO 24 FF). Brig. Shaffi himself had to flee for the hills,Islam, Major Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 121 and 2 truck full of arms were recovered by the Bengalis. Half the convoy was outside the ambush firing range and Pakistanis, commanded by Major Amzad Hussain (Bengali −2IC 24 FF) fought back, and a 2-hour long battle ensued. The mortars were handled by Captain Fazlur Rahman Bhuyan (Bengali), who ironically was a Kakul Academy batch mate of Captain S.A. Bhuyan, leading the Bengali ambush. The Pakistani column lost all contact with Comilla and the GHQ at Dhaka, raising fears that it had been wiped out, which, if true, might have crippled the Pakistani effort.salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, p. 80 The EPR HQ and Railway hill came under intense bombardment by Pakistani naval ships (PNS Jahangir and 2 gunboats) and artillery during the day. Pakistani troops launched two attacks on the Railway hill and EPR HQ after a 2-hour barrage around 8:30 pm, but both attacks were repulsed. Pakistanis continued to shell both areas throughout the night. At the end of 26 March, both Pakistani and Bengali troops had been denied land based reinforcements. Pakistani troops were stuck at Kumira, while Major Zia was keeping any EPR troops heading to the city at Kalurghat. Pakistani troops were in control of the northern and southern part of the city, and they were getting reinforcements through the air. The 2nd SSG (CO: Lt. Col Sulayman) was flown to Chittagong, while ammunition was flown out to replenish Pakistani forces around the province. Bengali troops were stuck in the middle (literally and figuratively) so the lack of communication and co-ordination between Maj. Zia and Captain Rafiq meant Bengali positions would come under intense pressure. Major Zia sent his troops to different parts of the Chittagong city for some quick operationsMaj. Gen. K. M. Safiullah – Bangladesh at War; Academic Publishers, Dhaka, 1989; page 44 and after being requested by several people he captured the Kalurghat radio station and broadcast declaration of independence of Bangladesh with himself as the provisional head of state in the evening.Jyoti Sen Gupta – History of Freedom Movement in Bangladesh, 1943–1973: Some Involvement; Naya Prokash, Calcutta, 1974; page 325Maj.

Gen. K. M. Safiullah – Bangladesh at War; Academic Publishers, Dhaka, 1989; page 45 The impact of this broadcast, which was picked up by the civilians and isolated Bengali units fighting the Pakistanis, was significant. EPR troops from Ramgarh could not reach the city as Pakistanis stuck at Kumira barred their way, and the troops from Rangamati were stuck outside the cantonment. The Bengali soldiers in the city were in dire need of supplies and reinforcements.  27 March  Captain Rafiq and EPR troops withdrew from the Railway Hill position, and planning to join the EPR troops on the north of the cantonment before sunrise. Captain Rafiq planned to attack the cantonment and take over the supply dumps, but his troops moving towards the cantonment were taken to Kalurghat by Maj Zia en route, scuttling this risky plan. Pakistani troops from the naval base moved through Agrabad towards the EPR HQ, but EPR troops managed to beat back the attack. General Khadim, GOC East Pakistan flew to Chittagong cantonment in the morning and conferred with Col. Fatami, then tried to locate Brig. Shaffi's troops flying along the Comilla-Chittagong highway by Helicopter. The helicopter was hit by small arms fire near Kumira, and returned to Dhaka without making contact.Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 81 Gen Khadim moved his HQ from Dhaka to Chittagong cantonment next, and sent a column of 20 Baluch to locate the 53rd Brigade troops, but this column clashed with the EPR troops north of the city and got bogged down. General Mitha arrived in Chittagong around midday via Helicopter and planned to send a commando platoon from 2 SSG under Lt. Col Sulayman to link up with 20 Baluch before going on to locate Brig. Shaffi. The platoon raced north from the naval base in 2 jeeps and 3 pick-up trucks, but were ambushed near Double Mooring, losing 13 members including the CO. Meanwhile, Brig. Shaffi had regrouped his forces at Kumira, and the Pakistani soldiers from Shuvopur had joined him after leaving a rearguard on the bridge. He sent a column east to bypass the Bengali position and linkup with the 20 Baluch, but it was ambushed and forced to withdraw. Another column moving along the seashore was also ambushed, and some Pakistani soldiers lost their way and were killed by Bengali mobs. Bengali civilians had provided warnings which were crucial for setting up the ambushes. The EPR troops at Kumira were almost out of ammunition and fell back 5 miles south to Bhatiari. Captain Bhuyan left for the city to get supplies, but could not return to Kumira. Captain Rafiq finally managed to re-supply the troops, but it took 7 long hours. Later that day Capt. Rafiq left for Ramgarh to seek Indian assistance. In the meantime, EPR troops took control of Feni, thus cutting off the road link between Comilla and Brig. Shaffi. EPR troops at Ramgarh split in two groups, one moved to join the Bengali soldiers near the Chittagong cantonment, while the others made for Shuvopur. At the Chittagong naval base Brig. Ansari formed a task force of 2 tanks, one infantry battalion and mortars to hold the port area, supported by the 2 SSG commandos and naval ships. He was later reinforced by another battalion flown from Dhaka. Pakistanis made another attack on the EPR HQ without success later in the day. Gen. Mitha planned to send another commando platoon to blow up the station, but the fate of the first platoon convinced him to send this in speedboats instead of overland.Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 82 EPR troops attempted to capture the Shuvopur bridge without success. Pakistani troops had failed to take control of Chittagong as planned, but they had access to airborne reinforcements and no lack of supplies, while Bengali troops were running out of supplies, needed reinforcements and the lack of co-ordination between Maj. Zia and Captain Rafiq meant their effort were not fully effective. By 27 March, most Bengali troops outside Chittagong city had assembled near the Kalurghat bridge under Major Zia's command and they went for some quick operations in the city against the Pakistani forces.Maj. Gen. Fazal Muqeem Khan – Pakistan's Crisis in Leadership; National Book Foundation, Islamabad, 1973; page 78  28 March  Pakistani forces at Kumira launched a 3 pronged attack on Bengali forces in the morning, supported by mortars and PNS Rajshahi and Balaghat from the sea. The attack broke through and surviving EPR troops retreated to Fauzdarhut, where they were joined by an EPR platoon. Brig. Shaffi soon began attacking the area around 8 am. After a clash of 3 hours, Bengali troops fell back to a position near the Haji Camp, which soon came under attack from Brig. Shaffi's troops. The Pakistani commando platoon sent to blow up Kalurghat Radio station was cornered in the Agri Building near the river and wiped out. Gen. Khadim then ordered the 20 Baluch to attack the station, which was repulsed. 20 Baluch also unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge the EPR troops positioned to the north of the cantonment around midday. Pakistani troops managed to push south from the cantonment and take control of the Circuit house (this became the HQ for Gen. Khadim). Pakistani ships and artillery continued pummel Bengali positions, but Pakistani attempts from the naval base to drive the EPR from Agrabad and link up with the 20 Baluch failed, although 20 Baluch and Brig. Shaffi's group made contact with each other later in the day. Captain Bhuyan, who was posted at Kalurghat Radio station by Major Zia, made two Radio announcements. The first one was to observe a blackout, the second was for all Bengali armed forces personnel to gather at Laldighi Moydan. Realizing the danger from the PAF in an open air gathering, the second announcement was cancelled, which was mainly given to gather scattered Bengali troops in the city. 8 EBR units under Major Zia made a surprise attack on the barracks of the 20 Baluch regiment and killed 250 West Pakistani soldiers. For a time the Pakistan troops retreated and shut themselves in their fortifications. According to Major Zia, the battle in Chittagong city was fierce.Jyoti Sen Gupta – History of Freedom Movement in Bangladesh, 1943–1973: Some Involvement; Naya Prokash, Calcutta, 1974; page 327 EPR troops from Ramgarh, now commanded by Maj. Shamsuddin (CO 14th EPR Wing) attacked the Pakistani guard on Shuvopur bridge in the evening, wiping out the Pakistani contingent and capturing the bridge.  29 March  Brig. Ansari sent a Pakistani detachment from the naval base bypassing EPR positions at Agrabad and captured New market and DC hill in the morning, but they were repulsed at Court Hill. Brig. Shaffi, who had taken control of the Haji camp and linked up with the 20 Baluch, now pushed south to the edge of Agrabad and made contact with Brig. Ansari's detachment around evening,Islam, Maj. Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 135 much to the relief of Pakistani HQ in DhakaSalik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 86 then captured the Medical college and Pravartak hill as well. Bengali troops fell back to Halishahar, while small groups continued to make hit and run attacks around the city. Bengali forces now held EPR HQ, Dampara, Kalurghat Radio station, Chawkbazar and Court hill, but were isolated from each other and had almost exhausted their ammunition. Major Zia luckily escaped a rifle shot and a rocket fired at him.Extracts from Brigadier Zahir Alam Khan – The Way It Was; Dynavis Pvt. Ltd, Karachi, September 1998 Some of his small groups were sent to the city to make hit and run attacks. The initiative now fully rested with the Pakistan forces after 4 days of bitter fighting.  30 March  Brig. Ansari began organising a task force to clear the city, while Brig. Shaffi took overall command with the task of taking out the Radio station, EPR HQ and the Dampara police line immediately. While Pakistan Navy and army shelled Bengali positions, Gen. Mitha again sent a commando platoon to attack Kalurghat Radio Station, which failed. 20 Baluch next attacked towards the station but was repulsed after heavy fighting. Finally the PAF bombed the station, and the transmitters were removed to another location by Bengali personnel. Sporadic clashes took place around the EPR HQ, while Major Zia left Maj. Shawkat in command at Kalurghat Bridge and left for Ramgarh around 7:30 pm to seek Indian assistance.  31 March  Brig. Ansari launched a battalion sized attack on the EPR HQ at Halishahar (a strongly fortified area), supported by another battalion and 2 tanks, with PNS Babur and Jahangir and 2 gunboats, plus a mortar battery lending fire support. The buildings at the HQ were levelled by shellfire – inadvertently leading to the death of Pakistani POWs.Islam, Maj. Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 141 The battle raged from 7 am to 2 pm, and when the attack stalled around midday, PAF jets bombed the area, and another 3 hours were needed before the base was secured. Bengali survivors fled north through by lanes and left the city altogether. Aftermath Brig. Ansari next attacked the Dampara police line on 31 March with his task force which fell after a sharp firefight. On 1 April the Pakistani attack on Court hill was repulsed with the loss of a tank. Brig. Ansari launched an attack with 2 companies on 2 April, which got stalled. He then sent 4 companies from two directions at Court hill, and captured the place, leaving Bengali troops with control of Chawlkbazar only in Chittagong city. For his services the superseded Brig. Ansari was awarded the Hilal-i-Jurat and the rank of Major General. Between 3 – 6 April, Pakistani troops carried out mop up operations and fought several sharp street battles in and around Chawlkbazar, and by 10 April they had secured the city. Captain Rafiq and Maj. Zia had secured aid from BSF by 6 April, and were busy organising Bengali forces around Ramgarh. Bengali troops had captured 18 Pakistani officers near Ramgarh including Lt. Col Sheikh and Major Iqbal, all of whom surrendered to the Indian authorities. Major Shafiullah and Major Khaled Musharraf sent 1 company each to Ramgarh in aid to 8 EBR, while Maj. Zia was busy attending them at Teliapara conference. All Bengali troops had left the city to regroup in 2 areas, at Kalurghat (1,000+ Bengali troops of the EPR and EBR), and at Kumira to the north of the city. By 10 April, Pakistani troops were poised to launch a three pronged coordinated attack to drive the Bengali troops from their positions. =Comilla= Comilla is on the strategically important Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and a crucial road link. Pakistani objectives were:Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 233 * Disarm 4 EBR, EPR and police * Secure town, telephone exchange and arrest Awami League leaders Pakistani forces:Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, p. 83 53rd brigade (CO: Brig. Iqbal Shaffi-W. Pakistani) was situated at Mainamati cantonment 5 miles from Comilla city. The 24th Frontier Force (CO Lt Col. Shahpur Khan – W. Pakistani), 3rd Commando Battalion (CO: Lt. Col. Z.A. Khan – W. Pakistani) and the 53rd Field Regiment (CO – Lt. Col. Yakub Malik), along with the 88th and 171st mortar (120mm) batteries, the brigade signal company (CO Major Bahar – Bengali), 40th Field Ambulance (CO: Lt. Col. A.N.M Jahangir – Bengali), Brigade workshop and Field intelligence unit was situated in the base. 31st Punjab was in Sylhet while the Chittagong area troops (20 Baluch, 8 EBR) were detached from the brigade and placed under the command of Brig. Mozumdar in mid March. Bengali forces:Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 10–12Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 191 EPR Wing No. 1 (4 companis, CO Major Karab Ali-West Pakistani), part of EPR Sylhet sector was HQed at Courtbari near Comilla city with its companies deployed at the HQ, at Akhaura, Nayanpur in Comilla district and at Parshuran near Belonia in Noakhali District. There were no Bengali officers attached to this wing. 2 companies of the 4th EBR (Lt. Col. Khijir Hayat – Pakistani) was at Brahmanbaria, 50 miles north of Comilla, one under the command of Major Shafat Jamil. Another company under Major Khaled Mosharraf was sent to Shamshernagar in Sylhet on 25 March. Col. Hayat left the EBR rear party at Comilla and joined the rest of his troops at Brahmanbaria on 25 March, and ordered Shaffat Jamil to move to Shahbazpur with his company, where he remained until being recalled on 26 March evening back to Brahmanbaria. Course of Events:Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 83 Pakistani plan was to have one 31 Punjab company ambush Maj. Khaled's detachment as it moved to Shamshernagar while another company neutralised the remainder of the 4 EBR at Brahmanbaria. The plan was foiled because Maj. Khaled took an alternative rout to Shamshernagar, thus avoiding the ambush, and the other company was delayed because of barricades on the road. Major Shafat learned of the Pakistani crackdown on 26 March morning from people fleeing Dhaka and managed to warn Major Khaled, who ordered Jamil to remain vigilant until Khaled arrived in Brahmanbari to lead the revolt. An unknown person warned Major Jamil of the approach of the 31st Punjab detachment on 27 March early hours, and Major Jamil managed to arrest all Pakistani personnel prior to the scheduled 10:00 PM meeting. Major Khaled arrived later that day and deployed his troops to the north and east of Comilla. The Pakistanis easily arrested and imprisoned or executed Bengali troops in Comilla cantonment, then wiped out the police in Comilla city on 26 March. The EPR HQ wing was warned of the attack and most EPR personnel managed to escape. A convoy of 80 to 100 vehicles bearing the 24th Frontier Force, the mortar batteries, commando troops and the engineers started for Chittagong after Comilla was secured. An engineering company had been sent to Feni on 25 March to secure the road. This column was ambushed by the EPR 12 miles from Chittagong on 26 March evening. The 3rd Commando battalion attacked and eliminated the 4th EBR rear party in the cantonment on 29 March.Jamil, Col(ret.) Shafat, Ekaturer Muktijuddha, Roktakto August and Shorojantramoy November, pp. 24–30, Nearly 1000+ Bengali soldiers and their families, including doctors posted at the CMH, were killed on the orders of Lt. Col. Malik by 30 March in Comilla. Pakistanis maintained control of the city and the airfield throughout the operation. By 10 April, Bengali troops still controlled major cities in Comilla, Noakhali and Sylhet. Pakistani 27th, 313th, and 117th Brigades were attacking these positions. Comilla was reinforced by helibourne troops from 2 April, but their efforts to break-out from the city were foiled by Bengali fighters. The first major success of the Pakistani Comilla contingent came on 19 April, when Akhaura fell to them.[Unknown] =Sylhet= Pakistani objectives were: * Secure Radio station and exchange * Secure Kean bridge and airport * Disarm EPR and police, arrest Awami league leaders Pakistani forces:Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 91 31st Punjab battalion (CO: Lt Col. Yakub-Pakistani) posted in Sylhet was attached to the 53rd Brigade in Comilla. EPR Sector #2 was HQed in Sylhet (CO: Lt. Col. Sekendar Khan – W. Pakistani) and contained some W. Pakistani personnel. 2 companies from 31 Punjab had been sent to neutralise the 4 EBR, one company was at Shamshernagar, presumably to ambush the 4th Bengal company under Khaled Mosharraf, and another was at Maulavibazar, presumably moving to Brahmanbaria to subdue the rest of 4th Bengal. These companies were delayed en route by barricades thrown up on the roads by Bengalies. The remnant of 31st Punjab was in Sylhet. Bengali forcesShamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 16–17 EPR Sector #2 in Sylhet (CO: Sekendar Khan –W. Pakistani) contained 3 wings, the 1st, 3rd and 12th and only 1 Bengali officer. The 1st wing (4 companies) was HQed at Courtbari near Comilla. EPR 3rd wing (4 companies, CO Maj. Javad Barkat Chowdhury – W. Pakistani) was HQed in Sylhet city, and its companies were deployed in Sylhet and along the border to the north of the city. 12th Wing (3 companies, CO Maj. Shawkat Hayat Khan – W. Pakistani) was HQed in Khadimnagar (north of Sylhet city and between the city and Salitukar airfield) and its companies were deployed to the east of Sylhet. Course of events:Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 184–189 Pakistani troops took over Sylhet city on 26 March without resistance, while Bengali EPR troops from 3rd wing and EPR Sector HQ managed to escape capture because Major Javed Barkat aided them. 31st Punjab companies sent to neutralise 4 EBR took up platoon size defensive position at Sherpur, Sadipur and Shamshernagar after being foiled by the 4 EBR revolt in Brahmanbaria. EPR 12th wing troops began to gather at Sunamganj while 3rd wing troops began taking over the BOPs after learning of the Pakistani crackdown from 27 March onward. Initial clashes An EPR company attacked Samshernagar on 27 March and drove back the Pakistani platoon towards Sylhet. Another EPR company attacked 2 Pakistani platoons at Maulvi Bazar on 27 March and occupied the town. EPR troops also repulsed a Pakistani platoon sized attacked on Sunamganj on 29 March, while remaining 12th wing companies imprisoned W. Pakistani personnel of the wing and joined the resistance, some joining Major CR Dutta in Habiganj while others joined Maj. Khaled Musharraf near Comilla. A 31st Punjab company attacked and captured Shamshernagar on 31 March early morning with PAF assistance from the EPR forces. Some EPR troops took up position at Khadimnagar by 31 March. Bengali resistance solidifies Major C.R Dutta (Frontier Force – on leave) was at Habiganj on 25 March and with the aid of Lt. Col. (ret) M.A. Rab (M.N.A 70 and future COS Bangladesh Army) had gathered a mixed force of EPR, police and volunteers totalling 2 companies by 27 March. This force moved to Maulvi Bazar on 1 April. On 4 April EPR troops from Sunamganj attacked Pakistanis in Sylhet with inconclusive results. While the Pakistanis began to reinforce Salutikar airfield, Major Dutta advanced on Sherpur on 4 April, crossed the river at night with civilian assistance, and launched a 3 pronged attack on Pakistani forces on 5 April around 5 am.Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 199 After a 7-hour firefight surviving Pakistanis fell back to Sadipur. Major Shafiullah had sent a 2nd EBR company (CO Captain Aziz) to aid Major Dutta. While Major Dutta advanced north along the Sylhet-Comilla highway, Capt. Aziz took an easterly route towards Sylhet. On 6 April, he arrived within 3 miles of Sylhet, and after a sharp fight with some Pakistani troops, managed to take control of the south side of Surma river. By this time Major Dutta had driven the Pakistanis from Sadipur to Sylhet and joined Capt. Aziz on 7 April, augmenting his forces to 4 infantry companies. Captain Aziz took position on the Southern end of Keans Bridge in Sylhet city, cutting off-road access to areas south of the Surman river. Pakistani planes carried on strikes at EPR on Khadimnagar on 6 April, doing considerable damage. Pakistanis evacuated Sylhet city on 7 April and took up defence around Salutikar Airfield. EPR companies from Sunamgaj entered Sylhet on the same day, while 2 platoons occupied Khadimnagar. An attack on the airport by 2 platoon EPR troops from Khadimnagar on 8 April was unsuccessful, after which 1 EPR company reinforced the troops there. Bengali forces had by this time gathered 4 companies of regular troops and EPR and 2 mixed companies around Sylhet.Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 107 Reinforced through air by 2 infantry battalions and a mortar battery (possibly the 22 Baluch, 30 Frontier Force and the 81st Ind. Mortar Battery)Jacob, Lt Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, p. 186 of the 313st brigade,Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 105 a Pakistani column attacked Khadimnagar on 9 April night, and drove out Bengali troops by 3:00 am after a hand-to-hand battle, who retreated to Haripur. Another detachment attacked Sylhet city and occupied the area after a 4-hour struggle.Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 108 Pakistani planes bombed Keans bridge around 2:00 pm 10 April, then launched a 3 prong attack on the bridge, outflanked the position by crossing the river both upstream and downstream, and by dusk Captain Aziz retreated south to Sadipur. Aside from sporadic fighting, no major clashes took place near Sylhet until 18 April. =Jessore= Pakistani army Jessore contingent were given the following objectives:Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 232 * Disarm 1st EBR, EPR sector HQ and police * Secure town, telephone exchange and arrest Awami League leaders * Maintain control of cantonment and airfield * Reinforce Khulna if required. Pakistani forces:Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, p. 341 The 107th Brigade HQ was in Jessore. It had the 26th Baluch regiment, the 27th Baluch regiment minus a company, elements of the 22nd Frontier Force, the 55th Field Artillery Regiment and elements of the 24th Field Artillery Regiment and various support and supply formations attached to the brigade. Bengali forces:Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, p. 17Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, pp. 212–213 The 1st EBR (Lt. Col. Rezaul Jalil – Bengali) was in winter training away from the cantonment. The unit was at 50% strength, as it was preparing to move to West Pakistan. Other than support and supply troops in the cantonment, there were armed police in the city. EPR sector HQ was located nearby. 7th Field ambulance was in the cantonment. EPR sector HQ troops and a platoon from EPR 5th wing was in the city. Course of events:Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 5–6Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, pp. 209–214 Pakistani soldiers entered Jessore city around 11:30 pm on 25 March, took up positions on several locations and began patrolling the city. A few shots were exchanged near the EPR HQ but no major clash took place that night. ERP Bengali troops took up arms and began patrolling inside the HQ. Sector CO Lt. Col Aslam requested Bengali troops to stand down on 26 March, assuring them that he would stand with them in case of an army attack, and Bengali troops reluctantly surrendered some of their weapons around midday. Major Osman (CO EPR 4 Wing at Chuadanga) tried to contact Bengali officers of the wing on 26 March but the officers refused to talk to him. The situation in Jessore remained calm until 30 March. From January 1971 1st EBR was training at Chaugacha (13 miles west of Jessore) near the Indian border and was unaware of the events taking place around the country. This unit was scheduled to relocate to West Pakistan and 50% of its troops were on pre-embarkation leave. On 27 and 28 March Major Osman had requested Col. Jalil to join the resistance but he had refused and warned Major Osman not to bother him further. On 28 March 1 EBR was ordered to Jessore and they reached the cantonment on 29 March, 4:00 pm. 7th Field Ambulance soldiers requested 1 EBR troops not to deposit their arms to the armoury, but this request was disregarded. Around 8:00 am on 30 March Brig. Durrani himself came to 1 EBR barracks and ordered all arms to be surrendered and took away the keys of the armoury. Bengali soldiers then revolted, broke arms out of the kotes and began firing at the nearby Baluch barracks around 9:00 am. The EBR line immediately came under mortar and automatic weapons fire from entrenched Pakistani soldiers from 3 sides. Lt. Col Jalil refused to join his soldiers, and on his request the Pakistani soldiers and officers attached to 1 EBR was spared, while 50 Bengali soldiers surrendered to the Pakistanis and were shot as traitors.Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 94 Lt. Hafiz and Lt. Anwar took command of the Bengali troops and led the firefight until 4:30 pm, when Bengali soldiers began an orderly retreat from the cantonment in small groups after losing nearly half the unit present strength and leaving their families behind. Lt. Hafiz managed to regroup his surviving troops 11 miles west of the cantonment around 8:30 pm. The retreat was carried out through heavy interdiction fire and majority of the surviving troops made it, except Lt. Anwar, who was shot while leading a group out, and 40 soldiers.Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, p. 6 7th Field Ambulance troops also revolted and were wiped out. Pakistanis killed several Bengali soldiers and their family members, including doctors at the CMH (including Lt. Col. S.A. Hai), and the surviving Bengali families were interned for their safety. EPR troops received news of the cantonment clash and readied their defences by 9:30 am on 30 March. All Pakistani personnel were imprisoned, but the Bengali officers left the HQ after the revolt started, leaving command to the JCOs. The city police also joined the revolt and began attacking army positions all around the city, while arms kept in government installations were distributed among civilian volunteers. EPR troops ambushed a Pakistani convoy coming from Khulna on 30 March evening, despite suffering heavy losses, surviving Pakistani troops managed to reach Jessore cantonment. A confused battle erupted around the city, and on 31 March 3 companies from the EPR 5th Wing cut off the Jessore – Khulna highway link. Pakistani troops abandoned the city and withdrew to the cantonment on 31 March, to the anger of Pakistan Army Eastern HQ.Shafiullah, Maj. Gen. K.M., Bangladesh at War, p. 71 2 EPR companies coming from Chuadanga got stuck just east of the city and failed to arrive. However, Bengali fighters managed to take up positions with 6 miles of the cantonment and began shelling Pakistani outposts with 3 inch mortars. Pakistani reinforcements began arriving from Dhaka via C-130 planes and helicopters from 2 April. Jessore Airfield was inside the cantonment area and Pakistani troops maintained control of both throughout the operation. A Pakistani column moved towards Kushtia, but was ambushed on 3 April and driven back, although Pakistanis took up positions in the Bihari colony in the city suburbs the same day. The Pakistanis made several unsuccessful attempts on 5 April to move towards Jhenida. On 6 April, the Pakistan army simultaneously attacked all Bengali position near Jessore and recaptured the city. A Pakistani column moving towards Jhenida was ambushed and driven back on 7 April. Bengali troops regrouped at Narail and moved towards Jessore, but were scattered by Pakistani air attacks on 9 April. On 11 April several Pakistani army columns left Jessore, one heading for Jhenida, one towards Khulna, and one towards Benapol. Pakistani 57th Brigade crossed over from Rajshahi and began attacking Kushtia. By the last week of April, Bengali resistance had been driven across the border by the converging attacks of the 57th and 10th brigade. =Khulna= Pakistan army Khulna detachment had the following objectives: * Secure town, Telephone exchange and Radio Station. * Disarm EPR Wing HQ and police line * Arrest Awami League and Communist leaders. Pakistani forces: The 22nd Frontier Force regiment (75% strength-CO Lt. Col. Shams) was posted in Khulna, attached to the 107th brigade. Non Bengali EPR troops from EPR 5 wing. Bengali forces:Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, pp. 211–212 5th EPR wing (4 companies) was HQed at Khulna. The Wing did not have any Bengali officers attached to it. One company was posted in Khulna itself, while the others were posted at Satkhira, Kaliganj and Kalaroa, to the south-east and north-west of Khulna. 2 platoons were posted in the sector HQ at Jessore. There were a number of police in the city as well. Course of events: Pakistani forces maintained their positions throughout the operation, and had arrested the Bengali EPR personnel in Khulna on 25 March. Some of the political leaders had also been arrested. There were sporadic clashes in the city, but by 28 March, Khulna was under firm Pakistani control. A Pakistani troop column from Jessore had reached the city after brushing aside two clumsy ambushes by a mixed force of volunteers and police on 28 March. Operation Searchlight had anticipated Jessore garrison reinforcing Khulna, but ironically the Khulna detachment was requested to provide reinforcements for Jessore. 28 March – 10 April: Khulna cut off EPR forces outside the city learned of the crackdown on 26 March and revolted. Many of the captured EPR personnel managed to escape from Khulna and joined their compatriots. One company from Kaliganj joined the EPR 4 wing, while the other 3 took positions on the Khulna – Jessore highway. EPR troops ambushed a Pakistani column heading for Jessore on 30 March, a few individuals managed to reach Jessore. On 4 April, Bengali fighters from Barisal launched an unsuccessful attack on the Khulna Radio station located outside the city. Khulna garrison remained isolated until the end of April. =Kushtia= Pakistani objectives were to secure the town, establish a presence and take control of the telephone exchange. Pakistani forces: A company from the 27th Baluch. Bengali forces:Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, p. 196 EPR 4 wing (5 companies, CO Major Abu Osman Chowdhury – Bengali), part of EPR sector No. 3, was HQed at Chuadanga, about 10 miles west of Kushtia. It had 1 company in the HQ, while others were posted to the west at Pryagpur, Bodyanathtala, Dhopkhali and Jadobpur on the border. Kushtia police line housed a substantial police contingent. This wing had the full complement of anti tank weapons and mortars in addition to the usual infantry weapons. Police and Bengali volunteers also joined the EPR after the Pakistani crackdown. Course of events:Islam, Major Rafiqul PSC (ret), Muktijuddher Itihas, pp. 196–199 27th Baluch company moved to Kushtia, which is about 54 miles north from Jessore and sits on the Rajshahi – Jessore highway, around 11:30 pm on 25 March in 13 vehicles from Jessore cantonment. They first took control of the Police lines and disarmed 500 police personnel. The CO then spread out his forces and set up outposts at the Town Police HQ, VHF Radio Station, Telephone exchange and District school, and disabled the phone and telegraph lines. By 26 March 6 am a curfew imposed and the town was calm for the next 48 hours. Some of the police managed to escape on 28 March and join the EPR at Chuadanga. Bengali resistance forms up Major Abu Osman Chowdhury managed to escape from Kushtia on 26 March and reached Chuadanga via Jhenida. The EPR wing had learned of the crackdown through the EPR wireless net and had imprisoned all W. Pakistani personnel by this time. Major Osman met with political leaders, government officials and at 2:30 pm raised the Bangladesh flag at EPR HQ – signalling the start of revolt. The other companies were alerted via radio and they began to set up roadblocks on the roads around Kushtia. Pakistani troops from Jessore made probing attacks near the border from Jessore but did not push on after meeting resistance near Courtchadpur on 27 March. All EPR troops at the border were ordered to Chuadanga on the same day, while Major Osman sent a letter to Lt. Col. Jalil (CO 1 EBR – Bengali), then at Chaugacha with his battalion, informing him of the Pakistani crackdown and requesting him to take command. He sent a messenger to Col. Jalil the following day, Col Jalil dismissed his suggestion as insane babbling and warned not to bother him again. All EPR companies assembled at Chuadanga on 28 March. Major Osman had gathered a force containing 600 EPR troops and 400 mixed volunteers, and deployed to attack Kushtia. A mixed group of 200 troops were kept at Kushtia, another similar group under Jhenida SDP Mahbubuddin took position near Kaliganj south of Jhenida. 2 EPR Platoons were sent to Courtchandpur while a company was posted at Jhenida. Captain AR Chowdhury led a company directly from Chuadanga to Kushtia, while another company advanced from Pryagpur towards Kushtia. Assault on Kushtia Major Shoaib was warned of the coming Bengali attack by the local police but his forces failed to take it seriously, they did not bother to entrench themselves.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, p. 84, Captain Chowdhury planned to attack Kushtia from 3 directions. An EPR company was to attack the District force from the south-east, while another struck the radio station from the east. The main group, reinforced by 2 mixed companies, would attack the Police line. About 5,000 civilians were to raise as much noise as possible to confuse the Pakistanis. Bengali forces began shelling Pakistani positions and skirmishing around 3:45 pm on 29 March. Around 4:00 am on 30 March the Bengalis struck all Pakistani positions simultaneously after a mortar barrage, preventing the Pakistanis from reinforcing each other. The force attacking the police line took over an adjacent three-storey building and sprayed the Pakistanis with bullets, a Pakistani troop section tried to hit the building with Recoilless rifles around 1:30 pm but were cut down. Around 5 pm Pakistani survivors retreated to the company HQ after losing 20 men. Pakistanis at the Radio station and Telephone exchange also retreated to the company HQ at the District School. Bengali assault on the school was repulsed and sporadic fighting continued throughout the night. Major Shoaib had requested reinforcements and air support via Radio from Jessore, both requests were denied. Pakistani forces held out the following day, then 65 survivors tried to escape in a 3-ton truck, one dodge and 6 jeeps after dusk. This convoy was ambushed 25 kilometres south of Kushtia, losing 2 jeeps and the dodge. The survivors scattered in the countryside, Bengali mobs killed all but 2 Pakistani soldiers. Lt. Ataullah Shah and another were rescued by the EPR, given medical treatment and surrendered to the Indian authorities. Kusthia would remain under Bengali control until 16 April. =Rajshahi= The objectives allocated for the Pakistani garrison in Rajshahi were: * Disarm police and EPR Sector HQ * Secure Radio station and telephone exchange * Arrest Awami League leaders and secure University/Medical college Pakistani forces:Qureshi, Maj. Gen. Hakeem A, The 1971 Indo Pak War, p. 33 The 25th Punjab regiment (CO: Lt. Col. Shafqat Baluch) minus 1 company, attached to the 23rd brigade. Pakistani EPR troops from EPR sector HQ. Bengali forces:Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 18–19 EPR sector no 4 was HQed in Rahshaji and contained no Bengali officers, and about a company of EPR troops were at the sector HQ in Rajshahi. EPR wing no 6 (4 companies, HQ Nawabganj to the west of Rajshahi) and No 7 Wing (5 companies, HQ Naogaon, CO: Nazmul Huq – Bengali) was attached to the Rajshshi sector. No. 6 Wing had no Bengali officers and its companies were at the Wing HQ, and on the Indian border at Charghat, Godagari and Mankosha. No. 7 wing companies were at the Wing HQ and on the Indian border between Panchbibi and Rohanpur. Police and Bengali volunteers were also present in Rajshahi. Pakistani officers had posted non Bengali personnel at the Sector HQ kotes and communication centre during the second week of March. Course of events: The CO of 25 Punjab, Lt. Col. S. Baluch was away and joined his unit on 25 March. As per the plan, he sent a company to Pabna, a town to the east of Rajshahi sitting on the vital road link to Dhaka, on the same day to establish Pakistani presence.Salik, Siddiq, Witness To Surrender, p. 85 Pakistan troops began patrolling Rajshahi from 25 March, and the situation was normal, if tense the following day. Bengali police had dug bunkers expecting an attack, but nothing happened. EPR 6 Wing troops at Nawabgaung did not face anything unusual during 25–26 March. The situation at Naogaon was different. Bengali troops at Rohanpur had clashed with Pakistani troops on 23 March, and on 26 March soldiers at Naogaon revolted after receiving news of the countrywide Pakistani crackdown. The Bengali troops managed to imprison all Pakistani personnel while they were at dinner.Islam, Major rafiqul, A Tale of Millions , p. 184 Major Nazmul Huq joined his troops and began assembling the wing companies at Naogaon. Situation explodes: 27 March 25th Punjab took defensive positions near the Rajshshi police line and EPR HQ on 27 March. Although a truce was negotiated between the police and Pakistani army, an attack was launched on the police lines after 12:00 PM, which fell after a 3-hour battle. Rajshahi police had contacted the EPR at Naogaon prior to the Pakistani attack, but received no help as EPR troops could not cover the 60 mile distance in time. But as the news of this Pakistani attack alerted the Bengali EPR soldiers, and they began to take measures. Pakistani EPR troops relocated to the cantonment the same day with most of the arms from the sector HQ, while some took position at the circuit house. Warned by the non Bengali sector adjutant Captain Ishaq, some Bengali EPR troops revolted, armed themselves, and sporadic clashes took place after dark which led to nothing. Bengali EPR personnel left Rajshahi the following day. The situation during 28 March – 2 April was uneventful except for thousands of civilians leaving the city to escape Pakistani retribution and prosecution. Pakistani EPR troops suddenly attacked Bengali troops at Nawabgaung on the same day, but were forced to surrender after a 3-hour battle. The 6 wing soldiers contacted Major Nazmul Huq at Naogaon and also joined the revolt. Escalation of hostilities: 28 – 29 March The 25 Punjab company in Pabna was deployed in small detachments around the town. A mixed force of Bengali EPR, police and volunteers attacked the company on 27 March, and which caused casualties on both sides (including the company CO Captain Asghar and Lt. Rashid, 3 JCOs and 80 Pakistani troops). After a botched Heli evacuation attempt, Major Aslam led 2 platoons from Rajshai to Pabna on 28 March and extricated the survivors. This column was ambushed near Ishardi on 29 March by a Bengali force under Captain Rashid, lost 40 soldiers including Major Aslam,Islam, Maj. Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 186 and only 18 soldiers ultimately reached Rajshahi after 3 days. The 23rd Field company in Bogra was deployed in 2 groups, one guarding the ammunition dump while the other patrolling the town without incident during 25 – 29 March.Islam, Maj. Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 185 Attempts to reinforce this group from Rangpur had not succeeded.Qureshi, Maj. Gen. Hakeem Arshad, 1971 Indo Pak War: A Soldier's Narrative, pp. 43–46 A Bengali EPR company under Captain Gias moved to Bogra, 35 miles from Naogaun on 28 March morning, reaching the place in the evening. With the aid of 200 armed police and several hundred civilian volunteers, a Pakistani patrol was ambushed on 29 March, and surviving Pakistanis fled to Rangpur. Captain Gias left Bogra the following day. Local Bengali fighters attacked the ammunition dump on 1 April, put surviving Pakistani troops in jail and freed the town. Ring around Rajshahi After securing Pabna and Bogra, Major Nazmul Huq focused on Rajshahi, around which Bengali fighters had been gathering since 28 March. After keeping a small reserve at Naogaon, Major Nazmul Huq concentrated a mixed force of EPR, Police and volunteers around Rajshahi by 1 April. Captain Gias commanded a mixed force of almost 1,000 fighters from Nawabgaung while Captain Rashid led another 1,000 from Panba to Rajshahi. Sporadic clashes with Pakistanis started on the following day. A three pronged attack was launched on the town, with Captain Gias attacking from the south, Captain Rashid from the east and another group from the northwest on 4 April. After a fierce 4 hour battle causing severe casualties on both sides, Pakistani forces left the town and took up a strong defensive position around the cantonment at Sapura, using minefields and barbed wire to beef up the place. Between 1 – 5 April, the PAF had launched airstrikes to little effect on Rajshahi. Bengali fighters launched several attacks on the cantonment between 6 – 10 April, and although the Pakistanis were ultimately confined in an area only 800 yards square, the Punjab regiment managed to survive. Rajshahi town remained free until 15 April. On 10 April 3 EPR companies took position to block the Pakistani 57th infantry brigade at Nagarbari. Pakistani forces softened the position by airstrikes on 10 April, a launch borne forced probed it the following day. At night Pakistani assault force crossed the Jamuna River and secured the position, forcing the battered remnants of Bengali fighters to flee towards Pabna. Brig. Arbab began cleaving a path of terror and destruction as he headed for Rajshahi with the 57th brigade. =Rangpur- Saidpur= Pakistani Army objectives for Rangpur were: * Secure both towns, Telephone exchange and Radio station in Rangpur. * Diasarm 3 EBR at Saidpur and EPR Sector HQ at Dinajpur * Secure Ammo dump at Bogra * Arrest Awami League leaders in Rangpur Pakistani forces: The 23rd brigade (CO Brig. Abdullah Malik Khan – W. Pakistani) was HQed at Rangpur. 23 Field Artillery regiment (CO Lt. Col. Shaffi -Pakistani) and the 26th Frontier Force (CO Lt Col. Hakeem A. Qureshi – Pakistani) was at Saidpur. A company from the 23rd Field was in Bogra and another company from the 26th FF was based at the Dinajpur Circuit house. 29th Cavalry (55 tanks, 50% Bengali personnel, CO Lt Col. Sagir Hissain Syed- Pakistani), the only tank regiment in East Pakistan was at Rangpur, along with the brigade signals, engineers and the 10th Field Ambulance (CO Lt. Col. Masud – W. Pakistani). The 25th Punjab was at Rajshahi. Bengali forces:Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 18–20 3 EBR (CO Lt. Col Fazal Karim- Pakistani) was at Saidpur. 2 of its companies (CO Major Nizam – Bengali) were posted at Ghoraghat and one (CO Captain Shafat Hossain – Pakistani) was at Parvatipur. EPR sector no 5 (CO Lt. Col. Tareq R. Qureshi – Pakistani) was HQed at Dinajpur. This sector contained the EPR wing no 8 (5 companies, HQ Dinajpur, CO Major Amin Tareq – W. Pakistani), EPR 9 Wing (5 companies, HQ Thakurgaon, CO Major Sawar Muhammad Hussain) and EPR Wing 10 (5 companies, HQ Rangpur, CO Major Md. Kazmi – W. Pakistani). EPR 8 wing had 2 companies at Dinajpur and the rest was deployed near the border at Biral and Basudevpur. EPR 0 wing companies were deployed at Thakurgaon, Ruhia, Chilahati, Tetulia and Panchagarh. EPR 10 wing companies were posted at Rangpur, Chilamari, Patgram, Mogolhat and Joymonirhut. Rangpur and Saidpur also had some armed police in the city. 29th Cavalry had 50% Bengali personnel.Qureshi, Maj. Gen. Hakeem A, The 1971 Indo Pak War, p. 38Major Nasir Uddin, Judhay Judjay Shadhinota, p. 119 Course of events: As part of a pre arranged plan 3 EBR companies had been posted away from Saidpur to minimise their threat,Qureshi, Maj. Gen. Hakeem A, The 1971 Indo Pak War, p. 43 and its anti tank weapons were given to the 26 FF company in Dinajpur for training purposes,Jamil, Col(ret.) Shafat, , pp. 50–51 further diminishing its firepower. 26 FF planned to disarm the EPR troops at Dinajpur during a Bara Khana on 23 March, which failed because Bengali troops protested the presence of armed Pakistani soldiers in the dinner area and refused to eat until the Pakistani contingent put away their arms before sitting down to eat. Pakistani troops moved into Rangpur on 25 March around 12:00 am and took up positions around the city. Capt. Nawajesh had barely escaped from the EPR HQ with some men, but the Pakistanis neutralised the police and remaining EPR troops easily. Pakistani troops also took control of Saidpur without any resistance. The situation in Dinajpur, Thakurgaon and Saidpur remained calm. Pakistani troops from 23rd Field and 29th Cavalry began regular patrolling in Rangpur from 26 March onward, aided by local non-Bengali police members.Major Nasir Uddin, Judhay Judjay Shadhinota, p. 108 On 27 March a group of Bengali civilians, armed with spears and such tried to enter Rangpur cantonment and were mown down by automatic fire, their bodies were burnt.Major Nasir Uddin, Judhay Judjay Shadhinota, pp. 109–113 Captain Ashraf, after persuading 3 EBR 21C Major Akthar of his desire to stay loyal to Pakistan, was sent to Thakurgaon with a 3 EBR company from Saidpur on 26 March morning. There were no clashes between Pakistani and Bengali forces although the situation remained tense and some Biharis began looting Bengali property at Saidpur. At Thakurgaon the EPR troops did not react to the martial law declaration. The following morning EPR troops entrenched themselves at the wing HQ. There were civil demonstrations at Thakurgaon during 26–27 March, and Pakistani troops fired at the crowds causing some casualties. Things remained unchanged until 28 March, when EPR companies deployed on the border became aware of the countrywide Pakistani crackdown from radio intercepts, and began to neutralise Pakistani EPR personnel in their midst. Capt. Nawajeshuddin met with EPR company commanders of the 10th wing and decided to take control of the Tista bridge, thus cutting off all territory north of the Tista river from Pakistani control on 28 March. On 28 March around 11:30 am a rumour spread among EPR troops in Dinajpur that they might be attacked, and clash with the 26th FF company erupted around 3:00 pm. The combatants began shelling each other with anti tank weapons and mortars and began exchanging fire from entrenched positions at their respective HQs. EPR troops posted in the city rushed to the EPR HQ, the police also joined the EPR troops, while Bengali EPR officers were captured by Pakistani troops and Pakistani EPR personnel and officers joined the 26th FF. The battle raged throughout the night and continued for the next 3 days. An EPR company took up position at Phulbari on 29 March while the other companies made for Dinajpur, including some EPR 10 Wing troops from Rangpur. EPR troops at Phulbari fought a series of battles on 29 and 30 March, and managed to retain their position. A group of Pakistani EPR troops retreating towards Saidpur were also ambushed on 29 March, leading to the death of 2 Pakistani officers but Pakistani survivors managed to reach Saidpur. As the situation grew serious for the Pakistani troops at Dinajpur, a detachment from the 26th FF (CO Captain Fida H. Shah) was sent to Dinajpur. They ran afoul some Bengali EPR en route but managed to reach the city by nightfall. Unable to linkup with the Pakistani detachment at Dinajpur, this column resumed their advance the following morning, advanced slowly through the town. By this time Brig. A.K. Malik had decided to evacuate Dinajpur, but a communication mix up prevented a concerted action between the two groups. The beleaguered Pakistani troops left the town using one avenue while Capt. Fida's group raced to the Pakistani base to find it empty and fought their way out. The retreat was disorganised and some Pakistani troops were killed in an ambush en route. EPR troops freed the captured Bengali officers. By 31 March Dinajpur was in Bengali hands. Thakurgaon EPR troops learned of the Dinajpur clash on 28 March evening, and attacked the Pakistani EPR troops around 10:30 pm that night. The Pakistanis, however, were prepared and a firefight raged throughout the night and the following day around a 3-story building housing the Pakistani personnel. 9th Wing EPR companies at the border were requested to come to Thakurgaon via Radio on 29 March, while the police joined the EPR. On 30 March the Pakistani troops at Thakurgaon were wiped out. EPR companies from the border arrived the following day. Lt. Col. Hakeem was almost ambushed while leading a detachment towards Bogra at Palasbari on 30 March (or 28 March, according to other sources)Islam, Maj Rafiql, A Tale of Millions, p. 230 around 1:30 pm by a 3 EBR platoon and some EPR troops. Col. Hakeem fortunately managed to avoid the trap by calling out Lt. Rafiquddin Sarkar, 3 EBR platoon leader and keeping him in his jeep before opening fire, and returned to Saidpur after a firefight erupted.Qureshi, Maj. Gen. Hakeem A, The 1971 Indo Pak War, pp. 43–45 Lt. Rafiq was executed by Pakistanis later.Jamil, Col(ret.) Shafat, , p. 50 Brig. Malik decided to disarm the 3 EBR and 29 Cavalry Bengali personnel on the same day. Disarming Bengali soldiers 29 cavalry Bengali troops were divided into small groups for patrolling on 28 March, and their return was staggered from Rangpur. Pakistani troops first disarmed Bengali guards at Rangpur cantonment, then each Bengali patrol group was surrounded by waiting Pakistani soldiers on their return and disarmed. Bengali officers and soldiers of 23rd Field and 29 cavalry were neutralised this way and most were executed.Major Nasir Uddin, Judhay Judjay Shadhinota, p. 130 3 EBR companies were at Parvatipur (CO Maj. S. Shaffat Hussain – Pakistani), Thakurgaon (CO Captain Ashraf – Bengali), Ghoraghat (2 companies, CO Maj. Nizamuddin – Bengali) and Saidpur (Rear party and HQ company, OC Capt. Anwar). 3 EBR companies conducted routine work during 26–28 March, when the news on Pakistani attacks on Bengalis caused all except the one in Saidpur to revolt. Bengali troops at Ghoraghta were the first to react by setting up the failed ambush under Lt. Rafiq at Palashbari on 28 March. Other EBR companies stayed in their positions until 31 March. 26 FF attacked the 3 EBR barracks on 30 March (1 April, 3:00 am, according to other sources) with 23rd Field regiment guns providing fire support. Captain Fida was killed at the beginning of the battle, and the surviving EBR was finally forced to retreat after a bloody firefight that took a heavy toll on both sides.Qureshi, Maj. Gen. Hakeem A, The 1971 Indo Pak War, pp. 49–50 The initial attack on the Bengali positions was launched from the north, the second from the north west, while small groups of Pakistani troops infiltrated the positions to take out defensive strong points. After a few hours, surviving Bengali troops decided to retreat and left their position in 2 groups, having suffered 55 casualties out of 120 soldiers. Families were left behind and after some Pakistani soldiers abused them (including raping the wives of officers),Major Nasir Uddin, Judhay Judjay Shadhinota, p. 120 they were moved to the Saidpur and Rangpur jail. Several Bengali officers attached to the 23rd Brigade were executedShamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 534, 536 while several Bengali officers were sent to West Pakistan.Major Nasir Uddin, Judhay Judjay Shadhinota, p. 121Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 363, 367, 370 Securing the air-link EPR 10th wing troops had taken control of the Tista bridge on 28 March, and had deployed 2 companies near the bridge, 1 at Lalmanirhat airfield and the other 2 at Kurigram and Mogolhut. No clashes with Pakistani troops took place until 1 April. Helicopters began ferrying 48 Punjab and 4 FF troops began to Rangpur after the disarming of Bengali troops.Qureshi, Maj. Gen. Hakeem A, The 1971 Indo Pak War, p. 55 On 1 April a 4 FF platoon probed the area around Tista Bridge, and in the ensuing clash Maj. Ejaj was killed. The following day an infantry company with 29 cavalry reconnaissance troops moved to the bridge. They directed artillery on the Bengali position and with the aid of air strikes and tanks managed to force the Bengalis to fall back slightly by evening. Another Pakistani column moved north and crossed the river at a different point and attacked and captured Lalmunirhat airfield. The outflanked EPR troops abandoned the bridge, and by 4 April the airport was fully operational, with troops and supplies being flown in and families flown out. Apart from small hit and run attacks, Pakistani position remained secured north of the Tista river. On 11 April around 3:30 am 4 EPR companies attacked the airfield, but Pakistani resistance forced them to break off the attack at daybreak. Bengali deployment around Saidpur 1 April EPR troops at Thakurgaon began to take up positions north of Saidpur from 31 March. On 2 April, Bengali officers and EPR JCOs of 8 and 9 wings decided to deploy troops around Saidpur. Thakurgaon EPR contingent moved to Nilphamari to the north of Saidpur, Bhushibandar to the west of it. Small contingents were deployed in areas in between these two positions. Pakistani troops moved to Parvatipur, south of Saidpur after 3 EBR company had gone south to Phulbaria on 2 April. On 4 April Bengali commanders held another near Bhatgaon and decided to attack Saidpur, after which 1 EBR and 3 EPR companies (CO captain Ashraf) dug in at Bhushibandar, another EPR company (CO Capt. Anwar) went to Badarganj (west of Parvatipur), and another company stayed at Bhatgaon. 3 EBR companies attacked Parvatipur on the same day, the Pakistani troops and armed Biharis retreated to Saidpur.Jamil, Col(ret.) Shafat, , p. 51 The significance of the deployment of the Bengali forces in the west, south and north of Saidpur in a semicircle, with the road east to Rangpur open, was not lost to the Pakistani commanders.Qureshi, Maj. Gen. Hakeem A, The 1971 Indo Pak War, p. 53 Pakistani counterattack from Rangpur/Saidpur Bengali troops lacked proper communication equipment for co-ordinating an attack on Saidpur and although Indian authorities had been contacted for help, none had been received. Pakistani troops, reinforced through the air after the capture of Lalmunirhut, began to attack Bengali positions from 6 April onwards. Task forces were created from the 26 FF, 48 Punjab and 4 FF battalions, accompanied by a squadron/troop from the 29 cavalry and artillery pieces from the 23rd Field regiment, several Pakistani infantry columns backed by air support begun to attack Bengali positions simultaneously from 4 April. Bhushibandar was taken on 5 April, Parvatipur was taken on 6 April, Nilphamari was unsuccessfully attacked the same day. 3 EBR troops attacking Parvatipur from Phulbai on the same day met with bloody repulse and retreated to Phulbari. Pakistani troops attacked Nilphamari on 7 April, Bengali troops left the town the same day and Pakistanis took the town the following day. By 10 April, Pakistani troops were poised to attack Bengali positions at T-Junction to the west of Bhushibandar, and areas to the west of Nilphamari and south of Parvatipur. By 27 April the division was secured, and the area north of the Tista river was retaken by Mid May. But in securing the division, 26 FF, the same regiment that had the maximum casualties later on till surrender of Pakistan Army, lost a very valuable resource on 1 May. Capt. Mujahid who was at the flank along with three soldiers and his CO, Lt Col Hakeem was attacked by the 3rd EBR. The attack put the team of five in a defensive mode and cross firing started. As a result, Mujahid was brutally injured. A shot went clean through his heart resulting in his Shahadat. During this operation millions of Bengali women were raped by Pakistani Army. Aftermath Operation Searchlight: Pakistan army operation 10 April – 19 June. Not to exact scale and some troop movements/location are indicative only. By the dawn of 10 April, Pakistani forces had gained control of Dhaka, Rangpur-Saidpur, Comilla, Chittagong, and Khulna. Their forces had lost or abandoned Rajshahi, Sylhet, Pabna, Dinajpur, Mymenshing and Kushtia. The vital airfields and all the cantonments remained under Pakistani control, while the rest of the province was unoccupied and outside government control. The Bengali resistance had put up an unexpected stiff resistance and had managed to derail the initial Pakistani estimate of pacifying East Pakistan by 10 April. The initial successes were not sustainable as the Bengali forces began to suffer from lack of trained men, officers, co-ordination among scattered troops and lack of central command structure, proper supplies (despite limited aid from BSF). Pakistani army had airlifted the 9th and 16th infantry division to Bangladesh by 10 April and was poised to seize the initiative. Gen. Niazi, who took command of Pakistan forces in Bangladesh on 11 April, obtained a brief from Gen. Raza (the departing GOC) and implemented the following strategy:Niazi, Lt. Gen. A.A.K, The Betryal of East Pakistan, pp. 92–93 * Clear all the big cities of insurgents and secure Chittagong. * Take control and open all river, highway and rail communication network. * Drive the insurgents away from the interior of the country * Launch combing operations across Bangladesh to wipe out the insurgent network. Against this strategy Bengali field commanders opted to go with \\"holding as much area for as long as possible\\",Islam, Maj. Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, pp. 147, 174 The Bengali leadership hoped to keep the Pakistanis confined into the cities, while the Bangladesh government in exile sought diplomatic recognition and the resistance prepared for eventual guerrilla warfareIslam, Maj. Rafiqul, A Tale of Millions, p. 294 and awaited the expected Indian military intervention.Hasan, Moyeedul, Muldhara 1971, p. 53, note 67, Lacking everything except unskilled volunteers, Mukti Bahini fought a conventional battle against an enemy enjoying superiority in number of trained men, firepower, and complete air superiority and played to the strength of Pakistanis. Choosing to attack Bengali forces all over Bangladesh simultaneously, Gen. Niazi concentrated battalion and brigade size forces on company and battalion size defence positions repeatedly, used air strikes and artillery to soften targets, and employed Heli-borne troops to outflank positions and hammered through to reach chosen objectives. Pakistani troop convoys were repeatedly ambushed, but these only delayed the Pakistani advance temporarily. By using their superiority of weapons and command of air ruthlessly, with little regard for safety of civilians and often targeting civilian areas to spread terror, the Pakistani army began to fan out of their bases and take over the province. By late April, all the major cities had fallen, by mid May all major towns had been captured and by mid June the battered remnant of Bengali fighters had been driven across the border into India. The Bengali resistance, suffering from a lack of trained men, proper logistics and co-ordination, lost the conventional battle against the Pakistan forces. =Temporary Pakistani occupation= Lt. General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi had been posted as GOC East Pakistan Command on 11 April 1971, while Gen. Tikka Khan was retained as the governor of the province. General Khadim Raza was relieved from the command of the 14th division, and General Farman continued to serve as advisor on civilian affairs to the governor. The Pakistan Army in East Pakistan, after being reinforced by \\"Operation GREAT FLYIN\\", was reorganised to run the counter insurgency operation. The 9th division (HQ Jessore, Maj. Gen. Shaukat Riza commanding) was given the 57th (HQ in Jhenida) and 107th (HQ in Jessore) brigades for controlling Kushtia, Jessore, Khulna, Faridpur, Barisal and Patuakhali districts. The 16th Division (HQ Natore, Maj. Gen. Nazar Hussain Shah commanding) was given the 23rd (HQ Rangpur), 205th (HQ Bogra) and 34th (HQ Nator) brigades and was to control Dinajpur, Rangpur, Bogra, Pabna and Rajshahi districts. The 14th division (HQ Dhaka, Maj. Gen. Rahim Khan) controlled the rest of the province with the 27th (HQ Mymenshingh), 313th (HQ Sylhet), 117th (HQ Comilla) and the 53rd (HQ Chittagong) brigades. E.P.C.A.F (East Pakistan Civil Armed Force) was organised to replace the EPR. Commanded by Maj. Gen. Jamshed, this force contained 17 combat wings, 7 sector wings (Sector HQs at Dhaka, Mymeshingh, Jessore, Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Comilla and Chittagong), totalling an estimated 20,000 personnel (West Pakistanies and Biharis), serving under the command of Pakistani army officers. The force was deployed to patrol the border, maintain internal security and support army operations. Razakars and Shanti Committees were formed to support the army occupation. Mostly recruited from Bengalis and ex-EPR servicemen, an estimated 40,000 Razakers (against a target of 100,000 recruits) of mixed effectiveness was eventually fielded. Al-Badr and Al-Shams, formed by Jaamat-i-Islami, contributed another 5,000 members each. Pakistan also deployed hundreds of West Pakistani civilians and 5,000 police to support the occupation. Admiral Mohammad Shariff, who was Rear-Admiral at that time, and the principle commander of Navy of East Pakistan, released his autobiography, entitled, \\"Admiral's Diary\\". In his autobiography, Admiral Shariff provided the account of Operation Searchlight, as he said Shariff concluded, \\"The initial military success in regaining the law and order situation in East Pakistan in March of 1971 was misunderstood as a complete success. In actuality, the law and order situation deteriorated with time, particularly after September of the same year when the population turned increasingly against the army as well as the government\\". =Creation of Mukti Bahini= The initial resistance, which started on 26 March, functioned without any central command structure. Senior Bengali army officers met at Teliapara in Sylhet on 10 April, and selected Col. (ret) M. A. G. Osmani as commander of Bengali armed forces. On 11 April Osmani designated four sector commanders: Major Zia for the Chittagong area, Major Khaled Mussarraf for Comilla, Major Shafiullah for Sylhet and Major Abu Osman Chowdhury for Jessore area. The Bangladesh government in exile was formed by the Awami League leadership on 17 April at Meherpur in Kushtia, which confirmed Col. Osmani as commander of Mukti Bahini (regular armed forces and insurgents) under the authority of Prime Minister Tajuddin Ahmad. Bangladesh Forces Headquarters were set up in Kolkata (Calcutta) with Col. MAG Osmani as commander in chief, Lt. Col. MA Rab as Chief of Staff (based in Agartala, Tripura), and Group Captain AR Khandker as deputy Chief of Staff. The Bengali resistance, after being driven out of Bangladesh, began reorganising to focus on irregular warfare. =Bengali refugees in India= A few thousand people sought refuge during April and May, mostly the resistance. However, as Pakistani army operations spread throughout the province, refugees fleeing to India increased. Ultimately approximately 10 million people would leave East Pakistan, and about 6.7 million were housed in 825 refugee camps. An estimated 7.3 million would be in West Bengal, and 1.5 million in Tripura. The rest were mainly in Assam and Bihar. The temporary presence of this large foreign population created economic (the cost of feeding, housing and medical care), social (tensions between locals and refugees) and national security (arms falling in the hands of Mizo and Naga rebels) concerns for India. =India's role= The main reason Generals Farman and Yakub had opposed any military action against civilians in East Pakistan was the fear of an Indian attack,Ali Khan, Maj. Gen. Rao Farman, \\"How Pakistan Got Divided\\", p. 89 which the Pakistan army was woefully unprepared to meet in March 1971. After the crackdown, Tajuddin Ahmad met with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 3 April 1971 and asked for all possible aid,Hasan, Moyeedul, Muldhara 1971, pp. 11–14 by which time the Indian government had already opened East Pakistan border and the BSF was offering limited aid to the Bengali resistance. The issue of direct military intervention was discussed between the Indian military and political leadership in April 1971.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp. 36–37 The case for intervention was based on the following: * Until 10 April, most of Bangladesh was outside Pakistani control, and the troops were bottled up in a few cities and were facing fierce resistance.Salik, Siddiq, Witness to Surrender, pp. 90, 92Ali Khan, Maj. Gen. Rao Farman, \\"How Pakistan Got Divided\\", pp. 87, 90–91 It is likely the Indian Army, with proper air support, could have quickly taken control of most of the province by aiding the Mukti Bahini. * Indian Eastern Naval contingent (1 aircraft carrier and several warships)Salik, Siddiq, \\"Witness to Surrender, p. 123 could have imposed a blockade of the province and cut off supplies from the sea, as the Pakistan Naval arm in the east only contained 1 destroyer and 4 gunboats. * Pakistani forces were flying in crucial reinforcements from West Pakistan during 26 March – 2 MaySalik, Siddiq, \\"Witness to Surrender, p. 90 and were dependent of the supply depots located in Dhaka, Chittagong, and Narayanganj for fuel and ammunitions. Most Pakistani garrisons were cut off from each other and reliant on supplies through airlifts. The Indian Air Force, vastly outnumbering the Pakistan Air Force Eastern contingent, could have cut off the air-links and destroyed the supply depots (as it did in December 1971). Against this, the military leadership had to consider the following:Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, p. 36 * Indian army did not have a suitable force available for action in April 1971, and would have to assemble one from forces deployed in other areas for such an operation.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp. 60–63 Could an adequate force be put in place without jeopardising the security of the northern and western borders of India in time to make a difference in East Pakistan? * Could a logistical network be established around East Pakistan to support the combat force operation before Pakistani army took over the province? * Should the Indians fail to gain a quick victory, was the army and the government ready (logistically, politically, diplomatically and otherwise) for a longer war, especially during the monsoon season in Bangladesh which would favour the defenders?Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp. 181–182 * Intervening in East Pakistan would make India the aggressor in International circles. Was India ready to diplomatically meet the international reaction and had India ensured the co-operation of a superpower as a diplomatic ally and arms supplier, crucial for running a long war? Although some of the Bengali leadership hoped for and expected an Indian military operation at the earliest,Hasan, Moyeedul, Muldhara 1971, p. 53, note-67 a view also shared by some Indian officers, Indian army eastern command decided in the present condition such a move was inadvisable, and a full attack could only take place after 15 November 1971 at the earliest, only after deliberate and extensive preparations, which was further elaborated to the Indian cabinet by Gen. Sam Manekshaw.Jacob, Lt. Gen. JFR, Surrender at Dacca, pp. 181–183 Indian leadership decided not to directly intervene, but chose to get involved: Eastern command took over responsibility for East Pakistan operations on 29 April, and on 15 May launched Operation Jackpot, a full-fledged operation to recruit, train, arm, equip, supply and advise the Mukti Bahini fighters engaged in guerrilla warfare against the Pakistan armed forces. =Bengali Civilian casualties= The killings which began on 25 March 1971 and sparked the Bangladesh Liberation War led to the deaths of at least 26,000 people, as admitted by Pakistan (by the Hamoodur Rahman Commission)Hamoodur Rahman Commission , Chapter 2 , Paragraph 33 and as many as 3,000,000 as claimed by Bangladesh (from 1972 to 1975 the first post-war prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, mentioned on several occasions that at least three million died).\\"3 MILLION Slaughtered Sheik MUJIB Charges 'Greatest Massacre'\\" The Portsmouth Herald, Monday, 17 January 1972, Portsmouth, New HampshireY C Rossiter Carriculum as Destiny: Forging National Identity in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh (PDF) 2003, Page 174 footnote 261F. Hossain Genocide 1971 Correspondence with the Guinness Book of Records on the number of dead Biharis and non-Bengalis had also suffered in the initial stages of the conflict – houses were looted and some died in Bengali hands. The genocide also included killing of serving Bengali senior army officers of the rank of Lt. Colonel and above in East Pakistan within the first few days of Operation Searchlight. The deaths included Col. Badiul Alam, Lt. Col. MA Qadir, Lt. Col. SA Hai, Lt. Col. MR Choudhury, Lt. Col. (Dr.) Ziaur Rahman, Lt. Col. NA M. Jahangir and another dozens of senior majors who were executed by April 1971. Also, around a hundred junior officers and thousands of unfortunate captured Bengali soldiers, including members of the East Pakistan Rifles and Police, serving in East Pakistan were executed. After the defeat of the Pakistan Army, there was a call to try nearly 200 Pakistani POWs for war crimes, but no trials took place. Evaluation and importance * The Pakistani army maintained operational security, for the most part, before the operation commenced. They also airlifted 2 infantry divisions (the 9th and the 16th) to Bangladesh in a span of 4 weeks after 26 March, despite a ban on flights over India. * The disorganised initial resistance of Bengali units was crushed by mid June, and the country was under Pakistani control. As insurgent activity slacked off in July, civilians returned to work and trade resumed, and Pakistanis could claim the country was almost \\"normal\\". On the surface, Operation Searchlight had achieved most of its goals. Pakistani military leadership were satisfied with the results, even General Gul Hasan, no admirer of the Pakistani operation in East Pakistan in General and of Gen. Niazi in particular, praised the efforts of Pakistani troops and their achievements in April 1971.Pakistan Defence Journal, Vol III, No.12, p. 3, 1977 * The capture of Sheikh Mujib might have been a big blow for the resistance had Tajuddin Ahmad failed to rally support for his leadership from the other Awami League senior members and create the Bangladesh government in exile.Hasan, Moyeedul, Muldhara 71, pp. 10–18 The Pakistanis failed to capture the Awami League political leaders during the operation, which was a crucial part of the plan. Out of the 167 elected Members of National Assembly and 299 members of Provential Assembly from Awami League, Pakistinis managed to kill 4, 4 surrendered themselves while 2 were captured.Shamsul Arefin, ASM, History, Standing of – - War of Liberation, pp. 119, 384 The rest moved to India, and using their networks and popular support in Bangladesh, effectively organised the insurgency and joined the Bangladesh government in Exile in various capacity. * The survival of the Awami League political apparatus permitted India to channel aid through a structured organisation, rather than dealing with various resistance groups competing for their support. The Awami League included elected members of parliament who claimed to be legitimate representatives of the people, thus enhancing the credibility of the organisation in international circles. Bengali army officers worked under civilian leaders, so there was no serious struggle for power in the resistance. While civilian leadership ran the administration and coordinated logistics, army personnel fought the war and trained freedom fighters. * Pakistani planners assumed that if the political leadership was captured, the Bengali armed units disarmed, and the civilians sufficiently terrorised, after a month no organised resistance would remain in East Pakistan. Their assumptions were proven wrong in the long run. The political leadership escaped to organise the resistance and lobby for international support, Bengali soldiers formed the core of the armed resistance, and civilians, despite the terror campaign, supported the insurgency with logistics, intelligence and volunteers for the irregular warfare. * Operation Searchlight included no follow-up plan. Anticipating a relatively quick success, Pakistani planners did not plan for a long irregular war or the eventual involvement of India. Pakistan had no regular troops to spare after stationing 4 divisions in Bangladesh by November 1971 since they needed to maintain parity with the Indian army in the west. With the EPR and police defecting, a large number of para military units were needed to police the country. Siddique Salik estimated that Pakistan needed at least 250,000 to 300,000 troops, but even after organising the Razakars (estimated strength 40,000), Pakistan could field only 150,000 (45,000 regular army, rest paramilitary units) soldiers in Bangladesh. The eventual strain of combating the insurgency caused Pakistan to attack India on 3 December 1971, with the objective to stop Indian support for the Mukti Bahini. This attack initiated the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which concluded with the unconditional surrender of Pakistan forces on 16 December.

Like many social cultures, etiquette varies greatly depending on one's status relative to the person in question. Many books instruct readers on its minutiae. Some conventions may be very regional practices, and thus may not exist in all regions of Japan. Some customs have changed over the course of Japanese history. The following are generally accepted modern customs in Japan.  Bathing  ryokan Bathing is an important part of the daily routine in Japan, where bath tubs are for relaxing, not cleaning the body. Therefore, the body must be cleaned and scrubbed before entering the bathtub or ofuro. This is done in the same room as the tub, while seated on a small stool and using a hand-held shower. Soap, a wash cloth, and shampoo are provided; and the bather is expected to wash and rinse thoroughly twice before stepping into the ofuro. It is very important that no soap residue be transferred to the ofuro because the heated water is not drained after each person's use, and several hours (and the expense of a considerable amount of water) are required to heat fresh water. Any hair or debris is scooped from the water after the bath, and a lid is placed over the tub to maintain the water temperature and prevent evaporation. Water heaters also continue to maintain the temperature. (Ryokan baths have a small anteroom for undressing before entering the bathing room. Usually there is a basket in which to place used towels and wash cloths.) In a home or small inn, a traditional tub is square and deep enough that the water covers the bather's shoulders, but its length and width are small so the bather sits with the knees drawn up. A scoop is provided so the bather can douse his/her head with the tub water. Because the ofuro is meant for a relaxing private soak, yet serves numerous people, the bather needs to be careful not to indulge too long. Many ryokan close the ofuro for several hours every day so the room can be cleaned and aired, and some require guests to sign up for specific soak times. In homes with small tubs, family members bathe one by one in order of seniority, traditionally starting with the oldest male or the oldest person in the household. If there are guests in the home, they will be given priority. In homes with larger tubs, it is not uncommon for family members to bathe together. Typically one or both parents will bathe with babies and toddlers, and even as children grow older they may still bathe with one of their parents. Some homes transfer the hot bath water to a clothes-washing machine. Bathtubs are increasingly common in modern Japanese homes; but in cities there are still many small and old apartments that do not have bathtubs, so public bathhouses called sentō are common. A regular bathhouse will have tap water heated in a boiler. In all but the most rural areas, public baths are segregated by gender. Customers bathe nude, many using a small washcloth to cover their genitals. Hotels, pachinko parlors and other venues may have on- site sentō for customer use. The same soaping, scrubbing, rinsing rules apply as in homes and ryokan. 1901 image of a sentō Onsen (温泉) means hot spring. These baths use water heated by geothermal springs and often are incorporated into resort-like destinations in the countryside where people stay for a day or more. They may have a variety of soaking pools and tubs, some indoors and some outdoors, some communal and some private. Larger onsen will have separate pools for men and women, and visitors normally bathe nude. Many sentō and onsen ban customers with tattoos, which are traditionally taboo, citing concerns over yakuza activity.  Bowing  Bowing Bowing in the tatami room , is probably the feature of Japanese etiquette that is best known outside Japan. (The honorific \\"o\\" or お cannot be omitted from this word.) Bowing is extremely important: although children normally begin learning how to bow at a very young age, companies commonly train their employees precisely how they are to bow. Basic bows are performed by bending from the waist with the back and neck straight, hands at the sides (males) or clasped at the lap (females), and eyes looking down. The body should be composed but not rigid. Generally, the longer and deeper the bow, the stronger the emotion and respect expressed. The three main types of bows are informal, formal, and very formal. Informal bows are made at about a fifteen-degree angle or just tilt over one's head to the front, and more formal bows at about thirty degrees. Very formal bows are deeper. The etiquette surrounding bowing, including the length, depth, and appropriate response, is exceedingly complex. For example, if one person maintains his or her bow longer than the other person expected (generally about two or three seconds), the person who rose first may express politeness by bowing a second time— and then receive another bow in response. This often leads to a long exchange of progressively lighter bows. Generally, a one who is considered below-ranking in Japanese society bows longer, more deeply, and more frequently than one of a higher rank. A higher ranked person addressing a lower ranked person will generally only nod slightly, and some may not bow at all. A lower ranked person will bend forward from the waist. It is important to try to gauge the appropriate depth and duration of bows in different situations: a bow that is too deep or too long for the situation can be interpreted as sarcasm. Bows of apology tend to be deeper and last longer, occurring with frequency throughout the apology, generally at about 45 degrees with the head lowered and lasting for at least the count of three, sometimes longer. The depth, frequency, and duration of the bow increases with the sincerity of the apology and severity of the offense. Occasionally, in the case of apology and begging, people crouch like Sujud to show absolute submission or extreme regret. This is called Dogeza. Even though Dogeza was previously considered very formal, today it is mostly regarded as contempt for oneself, so it is not used in everyday settings. Bows of thanks follow the same pattern. In extreme cases a kneeling bow is performed; this bow is sometimes so deep that the forehead touches the floor. This is called saikeirei (), literally \\"most respectful bow.\\" When dealing with non-Japanese people, many Japanese will shake hands. Since many non-Japanese are familiar with the custom of bowing, this often leads to a combined bow and handshake which can become complicated. Bows may be combined with handshakes or performed before or after shaking hands. Generally when bowing in close proximity, as necessitated when combining bowing and shaking hands, people turn slightly to one side (usually the left) to avoid bumping heads.  Making payment  It is common for Japanese businesses to set out a small tray near a cash register so customers can place their money on the tray rather than handing it directly to the cashier. If a business provides such a tray, it is a breach of etiquette to disregard it and instead hold out the money for the cashier to take by hand. The tray should not be confused with the North American \\"Take a penny, leave a penny\\" tray for small change. Eating and drinking  A boy saying \\"Itadakimasu\\" before eating, which is common practice according to Japanese etiquette Meals in Japan traditionally begin with the word . Similar to \\"bon appétit\\" or saying grace, it expresses gratitude for all who played a role in providing the food and acknowledges that living organisms have given their life to human beings as Dāna. Upon finishing a meal, the Japanese use the polite phrase . In response, the preparer often says . It is not rude to have leftovers on the plate, as it is taken as a signal to the host that one wishes to be served another helping. Conversely, finishing one's meal completely, especially the rice, indicates that one is satisfied and therefore does not wish to be served any more. Children are especially encouraged to eat every last grain of rice. (See also mottainai as Buddhist philosophy.) It is impolite to pick out certain ingredients and leave the rest. One should chew with the mouth closed. It is acceptable to lift soup and rice bowls to the mouth so one does not spill food. Miso soup is drunk directly from its (small) bowl; larger soups and those with chunky ingredients may come with a spoon. Of course hashi (\\"chopsticks\\") are always provided. Noodles from hot soup are often blown on (once lifted from the soup) to cool them before eating; and it is appropriate to slurp certain foods, especially ramen or soba noodles. However, slurping is not practiced universally, and Western-style noodles (pasta) should not be slurped. It is uncommon for Japanese people to eat or drink while walking in public. Drink vending machines in Japan generally have a recycling bin for used bottles and cans, so one can consume the drink there; and in summer months one may see groups drinking near a vending machine. Some consider it rude to eat in public, but this is not a universally held aversion. Many Japanese restaurants provide diners with single-use wooden/bamboo chopsticks that must be snapped apart near their tops (which are thicker than the bottoms). As a result, the attachment area may produce small splinters. Rubbing chopsticks together to remove splinters is considered impolite, implying that one thinks the utensils are cheap. In Japanese restaurants, customers are given a rolled hand towel called oshibori. It is considered rude to use the towel to wipe the face or neck; however, some people, usually men, do this at more informal restaurants. Nonwoven towelettes are replacing the cloth oshibori. In any situation, an uncertain diner can observe what others are doing; and for non-Japanese people to ask how to do something properly is generally received with appreciation for the acknowledgment of cultural differences and expression of interest in learning Japanese ways. When using toothpicks, it is good etiquette to cover one's mouth with the other hand. Blowing one's nose in public is considered rude, especially at a restaurant. Conversely, sniffling is considered acceptable, as an alternative to nose-blowing. When sneezing, it is considered polite to cover one's nose with a hand. = Chopsticks = Chopsticks have been used in Japan since the Nara period (710-794).Bridging the Gap, 2008. There are many traditions and unwritten rules surrounding the use of . For example, it is considered particularly taboo to pass food from chopsticks to chopsticks, as this is how bones are handled by the family of the deceased after a cremation. If one must pass food to someone else during a meal (a questionable practice in public), one should pick up the food with one's own chopsticks, reversing the chopsticks to use the end which were not in direct contact with the handlers mouth, and place it on a small plate, allowing the recipient to retrieve it (with the recipient's own chopsticks). If no other utensils are available while sharing plates of food, the ends of the chopsticks are used to retrieve the shared food. Mismatched chopsticks are not to be used. Standing chopsticks vertically in a bowl of rice is to be avoided, as it recalls burning incense sticks standing up in sand, typically at funerals; the act of stabbing the chopsticks into the food resembles an action devout Buddhists perform when offering ceremonial food to their ancestors at the household shrine. Placing chopsticks so that they point at someone else is considered a symbolic threat.  Visiting someone's house  Wooden step into a Japanese hotel, where one should take off one's shoes and wear the house slippers provided At the entrance Seeing guests off It is considered an honor to be invited to someone's home in Japan. Many Japanese regard their homes as being too humble to entertain guests. Shoes are not worn inside – since the floor level is often higher than ground or entrance level or even the same height, Japanese don't want the floor to be stained by soil, sand or dust that may be attached to the soles. Instead, shoes are removed in the genkan (mudroom or entrance foyer), and often replaced with slippers called uwabaki. Just wearing socks is also acceptable in informal situations. Genkan are found in even small apartments, where they are correspondingly small, and feature a small step up. Socks, however, are not generally removed – bare feet are acceptable when visiting a close friend, but not otherwise. There are also separate slippers used when using a bathroom, for reasons of hygiene. Wooden geta are provided for short walks outside when entering the house. It is generally considered polite to wear shoes instead of sandals, but sandal wearers may carry a pair of white socks to put over their bare feet or stockings, so that their bare feet will not touch the slippers that the host offers, or they may use tabi socks, worn with the sandals. The shoes are turned around so that the toe faces the door after taking them off. During the winter time, if a guest is wearing a coat or hat, the guest will remove the coat or hat before the host opens the door. When the guest is leaving, he or she does not put on the coat or hat until the door has closed. Regarding seating arrangements, see kamiza.  Gifts and gift-giving  melon, carefully cultivated and selected for its lack of imperfections, intended as a gift in the Japanese custom of gift-giving. Many people will ask a guest to open a gift, but if they do not, the Japanese will resist the urge to ask if they can open the gift. Since the act of accepting a gift can create a sense of unfulfilled obligation on the part of the receiver, gifts are sometimes refused, depending on the situation. However, refusing a gift from someone of a higher rank than you can be considered rude, and is usually frowned upon. = Seasonal gifts = There are two gift seasons in Japan, called and . One is for winter and the other is for summer. Gifts are given to those with whom one has a relationship, especially the people who have helped the gift giver. At those periods the subordinate will give gifts to superior at the office, a pupil gives something to the master at tea ceremony classes, and even offices will prepare courtesy gift to their business partners. For chūgen, July 20 is the latest date to deliver for those living in Tokyo area. = Impolite gifts = White flowers are not appropriate gifts as they are associated with funerals and bereavement in Japan Some items prominently displaying the numbers 4 and 9 should not be given, since the reading of 4 (shi) suggests death (shi) or 9 (ku) a homonym for suffering or torture (ku). Thus, a comb, or kushi is a carefully avoided item, as gift. For wedding gifts, mirrors and ceramic wares as well as glassware, scissors and knives are not appropriate gifts because of the symbology of breaking up or cutting the relationship, respectively. As a gift for a new home and a newly opened shop, anything that brings to the mind of fire and arson including ashtrays, stove/heater and cigarette lighters should be unlisted, unless the recipient requests so. If the recipient is older than the giver, or for those celebrating kanreki, shoes and socks are considered \\"to stamp on\\" the person. = Other gifts = Another custom in Japan is for women to give men chocolate on Valentine's Day. The chocolate can be given to the object of the woman's affection, or to any man the woman is connected to. The latter is called (obligation chocolate). Men who receive chocolate on Valentine's Day give something back to those they received from, one month later on White Day.  Greetings  Greetings are considered to be of extreme importance in Japanese culture. Students in elementary and secondary schools are often admonished to deliver greetings with energy and vigor. A lazy greeting is regarded with the type of disdain that would accompany a limp handshake in parts of the West. The most common greetings are or \\"good morning\\", used until about 11am but may be used at any time of day if it is the first occasion that day the two people have met; which is roughly equivalent to \\"good day\\" or \\"good afternoon\\" and is used until late afternoon; and or \\"good evening\\". Different forms of these greetings may be used depending on the relative social statuses of the speaker and the listener.  Letters and postcards  = Titles = The titles for people are -chan (most often for female close friends, young girls or infants of either gender), -kun (most often for male close friends, or young boys), -san (for adults in general) and -sama (for customers, and also used for feudal lords, gods or buddhas). Letter addresses, even those sent to close friends, are normally written in quite formal language. Unless some other title is available (sensei, for example, which can mean \\"doctor\\" or \\"professor\\" among other things) the standard title used with the addressee's name is the very formal -sama (様). Letters addressed to a company take the title after the company name. It is also considered important to mention in the address if the company is incorporated (kabushiki gaisha) or limited (yūgen gaisha). When a letter is addressed to a company employee at their place of work, the address should contain the full name of the place of work, as well as the title of the employee's position, and the full name of the employee. = Letter writing materials = Personal letters are traditionally written by hand using blue or black ink, or with a writing brush and black ink. The preferred paper is washi (Japanese paper). Although letters may be written vertically or horizontally (tategaki and yokogaki), vertical orientation is traditional and more formal. Red ink in letter writing should be avoided, since writing a person's name in red ink suggests a wish for that person to die. = Greeting postcards = In Japan, holiday-goers do not send postcards. Instead, the tradition in Japan is for a holiday goer to bring back a souvenir, often edible (see \\"Gifts and gift-giving\\"). However, New Year's greeting postcards, or , are a tradition similar to Christmas cards in the West. If sent within a time limit, the Japanese post office will deliver the cards on the morning of New Year's Day. These are decorated with motifs based on the year of the Chinese zodiac which is starting. They request the addressee's continued favor in the new year. If one receives a card from someone to whom one has not sent a card, etiquette dictates that one must send a card in return, to arrive no later than the seventh of January. However, if a relative of a person has died during that year, they will send a postcard written in black before the New Year apologizing for not sending a New Year's card. The rationale for this is that since their relative has died they cannot wish or experience a happy new year. In this case, the etiquette is not to send them a New Year's Greeting either. Summer cards are sent as well. cards are sent from July to August 7 and cards are sent from August 8 until the end of August. These often contain a polite inquiry about the recipient's health. They are usually sold from the post office and as such contain a lottery number.  Respectful language  There is an entire grammatical rule-set for speaking respectfully to superiors, customers, etc., and this plays a large part in good etiquette and in society as a whole. p. 83 Japanese children are taught to act harmoniously and cooperatively with others from the time they go to pre-school. This need for harmonious relationships between people is reflected in much Japanese behavior. Many place great emphasis on politeness, personal responsibility and working together for the universal, rather than the individual, good. They present disagreeable facts in a gentle and indirect fashion. They see working in harmony as the crucial ingredient for working productively.  Service and public employees  Japan is frequently cited by non-Japanese as a place where service is excellent. Such claims are difficult, if not impossible, to quantify. Nevertheless, service at public establishments such as restaurants, drinking places, shops and services is generally friendly, attentive and very polite, as reflected in a common reminder given by managers and employers to their employees: \\"okyaku-sama wa kami-sama desu\\" (), or \\"the customer is a god.\\" (This is comparable to the western saying, \\"the customer is always right\\" and the Sanskrit saying \\"atithi devo bhavati\\"). Generally, service employees will seldom engage in casual conversation with a customer with the aim of forming a rapport as sometimes happens in western cultures. The service employees are expected to maintain a more formal, professional relationship with all customers. Private conversations among service staff are considered inappropriate when a customer is near. In general, as in most countries, etiquette dictates that the customer is treated with reverence. In Japan this means that employees speak in a humble and deferential manner and use respectful forms of language that elevate the customer. Thus, customers are typically addressed with the title –sama (roughly equivalent to \\"sir\\" or \\"madam\\" in English). A customer is not expected to reciprocate this level of politeness to a server. Dress for employees is normally neat and formal, depending on the type and style of establishment. Public employees such as police officers, taxi drivers, and the pushers whose job is to ensure that as many people as possible board the rush- hour trains—and other types of employees who must touch people—often wear white gloves.  Funerals  The design of a traditional \\"kōden-bukuro\\", usually for amount below 5,000 yen People attending a Japanese funeral bring money called \\"kōden\\" either in special funeral offering envelopes \\"kōden- bukuro\\" or small plain white envelopes. Of the \\"kōden-bukuro\\", the folded end at the bottom should be placed under the top fold, as the opposite or the bottom fold over the top one suggests that bad luck will become a series of misfortunes. Formally, there is a small bag called in which you put the envelope and bring to the funeral. The appropriate format of \\"kōden-bukuro\\" varies depending on the ceremony style/religion as well as the amount of money you put in. The title you write on the center of the face side is defined by religion as well as when to bring either for the Japanese wake or for the funeral proper. People also bring money to the forty-ninth day service after death especially when they did not attend the funeral.  Special birthdays  *Seven, five, three: Shichi-go-san () is an event held on November 15 for children of these ages. *Twenty: The twentieth birthday, or , is when a person becomes an adult and can drink alcohol and smoke tobacco. Pronounced hatachi. *Sixty: The sixtieth birthday is the occasion of kanreki, , when five cycles of the Chinese zodiac have completed. *Seventy: The seventieth birthday is the occasion of koki, , \\"age rarely attained\\", as taken from a verse meaning \\"very few live a long life up to 70 years of age\\" in a Chinese poem by Du Fu. *Seventy-seven: The seventy-seventh birthday is the occasion of kiju , \\"happy age\\", because the Chinese character 喜 written in cursive style looks like the characters for seventy-seven (七十七). *Eighty: The eightieth birthday is the occasion of sanju , \\"umbrella age\\", because the Chinese character for umbrella, 傘 in cursive style as , looks like the characters for eighty (八十). *Eighty-eight: The eighty-eighth birthday is the occasion of beiju , \\"rice age\\", because the Chinese character for rice, 米, looks like the characters for eighty-eight (八十八). *Ninety: The ninetieth birthday is the occasion of sotsuju , \\"outgrowing age\\", because the Chinese character for outgrowth, in cursive style as , looks like the characters for ninety (九十). *Ninety-nine: The ninety-ninth birthday is the occasion of hakuju , \\"white age\\", because the Chinese character for white, 白, looks like the Chinese character for one hundred, 百, with the top stroke (which means \\"one\\") removed. *Hundred: The hundredth birthday is the occasion of momoju , \\"centenary age\\", because the Chinese character for one hundred, 百, means one century. Also spelled kiju . *Hundred and eight: The hundred-and-eighth birthday is the occasion of chaju , \\"tea age\\", because the Chinese character for tea, 茶, looks like the characters for ten, ten, and eighty-eight to add up to 108 (十、十、八十八).  Business cards  Business cards should be exchanged with care, at the very start of the meeting. Standing opposite each person, people exchanging cards offer them with both hands so that the other person can read it.Rochelle Kopp (2012). Hosting Japanese visitors at your office. Japan Intercultural Consulting. Cards are not to be tossed across the table or held out casually with one hand. Cards should be accepted with both hands and studied for a moment, then set carefully on the table in front of the receiver's seat or placed in one's business card holder with a smile.Patricia Pringle (2009). \\"Hajimemashite: The chance of a lifetime\\" Japan Intercultural Consulting. If needed, one may ask how to pronounce someone's name at this juncture. When meeting a group of people, cards can be put in front of the receiver on the table for reference during the conversation or immediately placed in the receiver's card holder. Cards should never be put in one's pocket or wallet, nor should they be written on in the presence of the other person.Rochelle Kopp. Japanese Business Etiquette Guide, When Japanese visit your office.

All eight were originally laid down by Walkers Limited for the Australian Army in the early 1970s. A reorganisation of watercraft responsibilities in the Australian military meant the landing craft were to be operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), with seven commissioned directly into RAN service during 1973 and 1974, and lead ship transferred from the army to the navy. During the leadup to the independence of Papua New Guinea in 1975, two of the vessels ( and ) were transferred to the new Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF). During their careers, the Australian vessels have operated in support of Operation Navy Help Darwin in 1974–1975, Operation Bel Isi from 1997 to 2003, INTERFET operations in 1999 and 2000, and RAMSI operations from 2003. The six remaining RAN vessels were paid off in the 2010s: Balikpapan, , and in 2012; , , and in 2014. They are yet to be replaced in RAN service. As of 2013, the two PNGDF vessels were active, and in 2014, the former Labuan was transferred to Papua New Guinea as the training ship . Brunei and Tarakan were refitted and donated to the Philippine Navy in 2015, commissioning as and .

They were originally built with two General Motors Detroit 6–71 diesel motors.Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 26 These were replaced by Caterpillar 3406E diesel engines between 2005 and 2007 for those still in Australian service. The standard ship's company is 16-strong, including two officers. The sensor suite is limited to a Racel Decca Bridgemaster I-band navigational radar. They are fitted with two machine guns for self-defence. The LCHs have a maximum payload of 180 tons; equivalent to three Leopard 1 or two M1A1 Abrams tanks, 13 M113 armored personnel carriers, 23 quarter-tonne trucks, or four LARC-V amphibious cargo vehicles.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 79Gillett, Australia's Navy, Part 2, p. 30 As a troop transport, a Balikpapan class vessel can transport up to 400 soldiers between a larger amphibious ship and the shore, or embark 60 soldiers in six- berth caravans for longer voyages. The vessel's payload affects the range: at 175 tons of cargo, each vessel has a range of , which increases to with a 150-ton payload, and when unladen. The flat, box-like keel causes the ships to roll considerably in other-than-calm conditions, limiting their ability to make long voyages. The LCHs can mate their bow ramp to the stern loading dock of the RAN's large amphibious warfare ships when operating in the ship-to- shore role. All eight Balikpapan-class vessels were constructed by Walkers Limited at their shipyard in Maryborough, Queensland.Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 25 All were laid down during 1971 and 1972, with lead ship entering service with the Australian Army Water Transport Squadron at the end of 1971. After this, responsibility for seagoing Army craft was transferred to the RAN, with the other seven craft directly entering naval service during 1973 and 1974, and Balikpapan transferring over in late 1974.Gillett, Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946, p. 80 Operational history =Australian service= Australian troops landing in East Timor 2006, using HMAS Balikpapan In January 1973, the Balikpapans in RAN service were formed together as the First Australian Landing Craft Squadron, based at in Brisbane.

On entering service, and initially supplemented the inshore hydrographic survey capabilities of the RAN until late 1988, when they were reassigned to the naval base for use in diver training. During May and June 1984, Balikpapan completed a transit from Brisbane to Penang, transporting vehicles, equipment, and personnel to RAAF Butterworth; the longest ocean voyage undertaken by a vessel of this class. Balikpapan (left), Wewak, and a United States Navy Landing Craft Utility underway during Pacific Partnership 2011 Between 1997 and 2003, the LCHs were used to support the Peace Monitoring Group (PMG) in Bougainville, under Operation Bel Isi.Swinden, Heavy Lifting for Four Decades, p. 23 Ships deployed on this operation were involved in resupplying the PMG base in Loloho, transport of PMG personnel and humanitarian aid, and coastal patrols. From 1999 onwards, the Balikpapans were also tasked with supporting INTERFET operations in East Timor, particularly those relating to the Oecussi enclave. The increase in operational tempo was a major factor in the reactivation of Wewak in 2000. In 2003, the landing craft began supporting RAMSI operations in the Solomon Islands. Betano leaving Darwin in 2011 On 11 December 2012, Wewak was decommissioned. Balikpapan and Betano were both decommissioned a day later, on 12 December. The other three Australian vessels were decommissioned on 20 November 2014. =Papua New Guinea= As part of the leadup to the independence of Papua New Guinea, in November 1974, and were transferred to the fledgling Papua New Guinea Defence Force, along with five Attack-class patrol boats. During 1985 and 1986, Salamaua and Buna underwent refits.Wertheim (ed.), The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 536 The two PNG vessels were listed in Jane's Fighting Ships as non- operational since 2011, and awaiting refits.Saunders (ed.), IHS Jane's Fighting Ships 2012–2013, p. 602 By 2013, they had been returned to service.Swinden, Heavy Lifting for Four Decades, p. 21 Labuan and Tarakan delivered humanitarian supplies to remote coastal settlements in the Solomon Islands in September 2014 as part of Australian support efforts in the region.

The intention was to improve the Philippines' sealift capability, which was found lacking following Typhoon Yolanda in 2013. The two landing craft were refurbished and fitted with new navigation and safety equipment, at a total cost of A$4 million. Hand-over of the vessel was originally planned for 17 May 2015, but this did not occur. Instead, the Philippine Navy took possession of the vessels at on 23 July, with Brunei commissioned as and Tarakan commissioned as . The two landing craft sailed that day for the Philippines, with a formal christening ceremony to be held following their arrival in early August. It has been reported that the vessels will likely be homeported on the island of Palawan. An Australian Navy Cadet visiting a Balikpapan ship, HMAS Brunei in 2014. The Philippine and Australian governments are in negotiations to sell the three remaining Australian Balikpapans to the Philippine Navy, with a deal expected to be reached later in 2015. On 27 July 2015, Philippines president Benigno Aquino III stated as part of his annual state of the nation address that his government intended to purchase all three vessels. All three, the former HMAS Balikpapan, HMAS Wewak, and HMAS Betano, were delivered to the Philippines in March 2016, and were immediately sent for refurbishing works. They will be commissioned to the Philippine Navy on 1 June 2016 as , , and , and will be assigned to the Sealift Amphibious Force. Replacement There are plans to replace the Balikpapans in Australian service with an as-yet- unidentified class of six heavy landing craft. The original replacement project was not due to decide on the design until between 2016 and 2018, with the new class to enter service from 2022. The Department of Defence issued a request for information in early 2011, which may lead to the project being brought forward. As of 2019 there has been no further developments.

It is native to southern California, United States and Baja California, Mexico, where it occurs mainly in chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and oak woodland plant communities at altitudes of 0–2500 m. Description Several of a mass of hundreds of such flowers on the inflorescence of Hesperoyucca whipplei It produces a stemless cluster of long, rigid leaves which end in a sharp point. The leaves are 20–90 cm (rarely to 125 cm) long and 0.7–2 cm wide, and gray-green in color. The leaf edges are finely saw- toothed. The single inflorescence grows extremely fast, and reaches 0.9–3 m tall, bearing hundreds of elliptical (bell shaped) white to purplish flowers 3 cm diameter on a densely branched panicle up to 70 cm broad, covering the upper half of the inflorescence. The fruit is a dry winged capsule, which splits open at maturity to release the seeds. The plant takes several (usually 5+) years to reach maturity and flower, at which point it usually dies. Most subspecies produce offshoots from the base, so that although the parent plant flowers and dies, a cluster of clones around its base continue to grow and reproduce. It may also grow back from its base after much of its foliage has been scorched off by the wildfires that frequent its range. Taxonomy The taxonomy of Hesperoyucca whipplei is complex and controversial.Flora of North America Hesperoyucca was described as a genus by Georg Engelmann as long ago as 1892,IPNI but it has taken recent DNA analysis to confirm that they are genetically distinct from Yucca.Agavaceae.com – page includes a key toYucca and the three recognised species of Hesperoyucca The splitting of Hesperoyucca from Yucca is still not widely reflected in available literature or online (for example, the British Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and the Royal Horticultural Society websites do not recognise the name as current).RBG Kew search results for HesperaloeRHS online Plant Finder Among those botanists who have treated (or still treat) it as a species of Yucca, six subspecies have been recognised (Hochstätter 2000,Hochstätter, Fritz (Hrsg.): Yucca (Agavaceae). Band 1 Dehiscent-fruited species in the Southwest and Midwest of the USA, Canada and Baja California, self-published, 2000. 2002,Hochstätter, Fritz (Hrsg.): Yucca (Agavaceae). Band 2 Indehiscent-fruited species in the Southwest, Midwest and East of the USA, self-published. 2002. 2004Hochstätter, Fritz (Hrsg.): Yucca (Agavaceae). Band 3 Mexico , self- published, 2004. ); others have regarded them as varieties.USDA NRCS PLANTS database Yet others (e.g. Flora of North America and the Jepson Flora) do not recognise any subspecies or varieties (within either Yucca whipplei or Hesperoyucca whipplei ), as the wide variability within the species precludes the segregation of discrete subspecies. Hochstätter's subspecies are: * Yucca whipplei ssp. whipplei * Yucca whipplei ssp. caespitosa * Yucca whipplei ssp. intermedia * Yucca whipplei ssp. percursa * Yucca whipplei ssp. newberryi * Yucca whipplei ssp. eremica The plant treated as the subspecies Yucca whipplei subsp. newberryi has been shown to be genetically distinct, and is often treated as a distinct species, Hesperoyucca newberryi. It is native further east, in Arizona, and differs in the capsules being unwinged or with only slight wings. Ecology Several plants in flower in the San Gabriel Mountains It is pollinated by the California yucca moth (Tegeticula maculata), a relationship which has become a classic example of symbiosis. The female yucca moth collects up to a dozen sacks of pollen grains called pollinia and forms them into a massive ball. She then flies to another plant and lands on the ovary of a flower. Standing with her head near the stigma, she inserts her ovipositor into the ovary wall and lays a single egg. She then rubs her pollen mass against the central stigmatic depression, ensuring pollination. The pollinated ovary will now produce many seeds, ensuring an ample food supply for the larva. Although many associations of Yucca and yucca moth exist, Tegeticula muculata and Hesperoyucca whipplei form an exclusive relationship. Etymology *\\"Yuca\\" is a native name for the unrelated Manihot. *Yucca whipplei is named after Amiel Weeks Whipple (1818–1863), a surveyor who oversaw the Pacific Railroad Survey to Los Angeles in 1853.Dale, N. (1986), p24. Flowering Plants of the Santa Monica Mountains. Capra Press. *The name our Lord's candle is derived from its huge, flame-shaped inflorescence. *Spanish bayonet refers to the needle-sharp leaf tips which can cause discomfort to the unwary passer-by. Cultivation and uses Hesperoyucca whipplei is used in xeriscaping in Southern California, but reportedly is difficult to grow outside of its native range (although it is widely available from specialist nurseries in the United Kingdom). It is extremely drought tolerant and thrives in clay soils. It has been used extensively by Native Americans. Yucca species such as the Yucca whipplei have been documented to have been used as a fiber and food source by Native Americans in the Southwest cultural region, prior to European settlement efforts.Archaeological evidence show that use of yucca species extends to approximately 5000 years ago within groups such as the Serrano of the San Bernardino Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains of the transverse mountain ranges of Southern California. The Serrano harvested the hearts of the plant during the spring growing season. Yucca whipplei grows on the rocky slopes and washes of the chaparral area of the transverse mountains of Southern California up to approximately 4000 feet above mean sea level. Harvested plants were chosen based on the growth of the stalk; the hearts were the preferred portion of the plant, and would harvested before the stalk was fully developed. The heart contains the sugars stored to rapidly grow a stalk to flower, and become bitter as the stalk grows in height. The hearts would then be roasted in stone lined pits (earth oven) over several hours in a manner similar to that of agave species. Once cooked, the hearts would be removed and allowed to cool before eating. Uneaten portions could be dried for storage. Though slightly bitter, the stalk and flowers can be harvested and used as food sources as well. The stalks can be prepared roasted in a manner similar to the hearts, while the petals were often parboiled. The long leaves of species such as the Yucca whipplei are made of strong fibers which can be pounded and scraped to expose long threads which run the length of the leaf. The leaves could be processed in many ways to remove the outer layer of leaf material which could be processed into threads and cords, used for basketry, blankets, and sandals. Green leaves can be heated over coals or directly on flames to heat the leaves. Cooking the leaves removes some of the saponins and allows for easier scraping. Ethnographic accounts dating to 1938 describes the preparation of leaves for fibers as any one of the following: boiling or pit roasting of live leaves to be scraped clean or the pounding or soaking of dry leaves expose fibers. Shells or stone scrapers were often employed to remove outer leaf material from the fibers. Once exposed, these fibers were often soaked in water to soften fiber. The fibers could then be twisted into cordage, used as materials in a basket, or woven into sandals. Other groups made use of different varieties of yucca species found throughout the American Southwest. Archaeological evidence shows use of Yucca shidigera (Mohave yucca) near the area of the U.S.-Mexico border dating as early as 5000 years ago. Residues of yucca were found on some stone tools in a cave site in Texas indicate that yucca was used to secure stone tools to other materials. Ethnographic evidence of the Mogollon has shown the use of the leaves with green leaf matter intact and woven into sandals. The green leaves are fire heated and no scraping or further processing occurs to remove fibers, though the spine is removed from the tip. The whole green leaves are then tightly woven to shape the bed of the sandal, and secured to the foot with cordage ties.

As with much of the cyberpunk genre, it owes a large debt to film noir, containing and exploring such conventions as the femme fatale, a Chandleresque first-person narration in the Theatrical Version, the questionable moral outlook of the hero—extended here to include even the literal humanity of the hero, as well as the usual dark and shadowy cinematography. Eye reflecting the \\"Hades\\" landscape. Overview It has been argued that Blade Runner thematically enfolds moral philosophy and philosophy of mind implications of the increasing human mastery of genetic engineering, within the context of classical Greek drama and its notions of hubrisJenkins, Mary. (1997) The Dystopian World of Blade Runner: An Ecofeminist Perspective—and linguistically, drawing on the poetry of William Blake and the Bible. This is a theme subtly reiterated by the chess game between J. F. Sebastian and Tyrell based on the famous Immortal Game of 1851 symbolizing the struggle against mortality imposed by God. The Blade Runner FAQ offers further interpretation of the chess game, saying that it \\"represents the struggle of the replicants against the humans: the humans consider the replicants pawns, to be removed one by one. The individual replicants (pawns) are attempting to become immortal (a queen). At another level, the game between Tyrell and Sebastian represents Batty stalking Tyrell. Tyrell makes a fatal mistake in the chess game, and another fatal mistake trying to reason with Batty.\\" Blade Runner depicts a future whose fictional distance from present reality has grown sharply smaller to reality in 2020. The film delves into the future implications of technology on the environment and society by reaching into the past using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes and film noir. This tension between past, present and future is apparent in the retrofitted future of Blade Runner, which is high-tech and gleaming in places but elsewhere decayed and old. A high level of paranoia is present throughout the film with the visual manifestation of corporate power, omnipresent police, probing lights; and in the power over the individual represented particularly by genetic programming of the replicants. Control over the environment is seen on a large scale but also with how animals are created as mere commodities. This oppressive backdrop clarifies why many people are going to the off-world colonies, which clearly parallels the migration to the Americas. The popular 1980s prediction of the United States being economically surpassed by Japan is reflected in the domination of Japanese culture and corporations in the advertising of LA 2019. The film also makes extensive use of eyes and manipulated images to call into question reality and our ability to perceive it. This provides an atmosphere of uncertainty for Blade Runner's central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, a psychological test is used with a number of questions intended to provoke emotion; making it the essential indicator of someone's \\"humanity\\". The replicants are juxtaposed with human characters who are unempathetic, and while the replicants show passion and concern for one another, the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to put in doubt the nature of Rick Deckard and forces the audience to reevaluate what it means to be human.  Genetic engineering and cloning  A Voight-Kampff machine is a fictional device to detect a replicant by measuring the minute emotional responses to questions designed to provoke an emotional response, including pupil dilation and pheromones. =Personhood= Blade Runner raises the question of whether a constructed being should count as a person. In the movie, replicants lack legal rights and are not regarded as human. Similar questions are raised in later unrelated works such as Her and Westworld. Some viewers speculate that the name \\"Deckard\\" may be a deliberate reference, by Philip K. Dick, to philosopher René Descartes; in any case, one of the replicants in the film, arguing for her own personhood, uses Descartes' famous quote, \\"I think therefore I am\\". While there is no scientific universal test for consciousness in the real world, the replicants' organic nature may make it difficult to reject the notion of their personhood. Artificial intelligence researcher Marcus Hutter asked in 2015, \\"How do I know that you (a fellow human) have feelings? I have no way of really knowing that. I just assume that because you are built up similarly to me and I know that I have emotions.\\" Hutter argues that replicants are \\"built up similarly\\" to humans, and might therefore be more likely to be labeled as conscious than an inorganic intelligence would. =Eyes= Eye symbolism appears repeatedly in Blade Runner and provides insight into themes and characters therein. The film opens with an extreme closeup of an eye which fills the screen reflecting the industrial landscape seen below. In Roy's quest to \\"meet his maker\\" he seeks out Chew, a genetic designer of eyes, who created the eyes of the Nexus-6. When told this, Roy quips, \\"Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes\\", ironic in that Roy's eyes are Chew's eyes since he created them, but it also emphasizes the importance of personal experience in the formation of self. Roy and Leon then intimidate Chew with disembodied eyes and he tells them about J. F. Sebastian. It is symbolic that the man who designed replicant eyes shows the replicants the way to Tyrell. Eyes are widely regarded as \\"windows to the soul\\", eye contact being a facet of body language that unconsciously demonstrates intent and emotion and this is used to great effect in Blade Runner. The Voight-Kampff test that determines if you are human measures the emotions, specifically empathy through various biological responses such as fluctuation of the pupil and involuntary dilation of the iris. Tyrell's trifocal glasses are a reflection of his reliance on technology for his power and his myopic vision. Roy eye gouges Tyrell with his thumbs while killing him, a deeply intimate and brutal death that indicates judgement of Tyrell's soul. In certain scenes, the pupils of replicants' eyes glow, which is evidence that Deckard may be a replicant himself. In some scenes, the glow in the pupils of replicants' eyes creates a sense of artificiality. This effect was produced by cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth shining a light along the optical axis of the camera. According to Ridley Scott, \\"that kickback you saw from the replicants' retinas was a bit of a design flaw. I was also trying to say that the eye is really the most important organ in the human body. It's like a two-way mirror; the eye doesn't only see a lot, the eye gives away a lot. A glowing human retina seemed one way of stating that\\". Scott considers the glow to be a stylistic device (non-diegetic); only visible to the viewers to help them understand that they are viewing a replicant, almost always occurring after the characters have assumed as much. The relationship between sight and memories is referenced several times in Blade Runner. Rachael's visual recollection of her memories, Leon's \\"precious photos\\", Roy's discussion with Chew and soliloquy at the end, \\"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe\\". However, just as prevalent is the concept that what the eyes see and the resulting memories are not to be trusted. This is a notion emphasized by Rachael's fabricated memories, Deckard's need to confirm a replicant based on more than appearance, and even the printout of Leon's photograph not matching the reality of the Esper visual. Also in the Director's Cut, when at the Tyrell corporation the owl's eye pupils glow with a red tint. This was derived from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, in which real animals are rare and owls are very rare, since they were the first animals to start dying of the pollution which pushed humans Off-World. The red tint indicates that the owl is a replicant.  Religious and philosophical symbolism  There is a subtext of Christian allegory in Blade Runner, particularly in regard to the Roy Batty character. Given the replicants' superhuman abilities, their identity as created beings (by Tyrell) and \\"fall from the heavens\\" (off-world) makes them analogous to fallen angels. In this context, Roy Batty shares similarities with Lucifer as he prefers to \\"reign in hell\\" (Earth) rather than \\"serve in heaven\\".Gossman, Jean-Paul. (2001) Blade Runner - A Postmodernist View This connection is also apparent when Roy deliberately misquotes William Blake, \\"Fiery the angels fell...\\" (Blake wrote \\"Fiery the angels rose...\\" in America a Prophecy). Nearing the end of his life, Roy creates a stigmata by driving a nail into his hand, and becomes a Christ-like figure by sacrificing himself for Deckard. Upon his death a dove appears to symbolise Roy's soul ascending into the heavens.Newland, Dan. (1997) Christian Symbolism Zhora's gunshot wounds are both on her shoulder blades. The end result makes her look like an angel whose wings have been cut off. Zhora uses serpent that \\"once corrupted man\\" in her performance. A Nietzschean interpretation has also been argued for the film on several occasions. This is especially true for the Batty character, arguably a biased prototype for Nietzsche's Übermensch—not only due to his intrinsic characteristics, but also because of the outlook and demeanor he displays in many significant moments of the film. For instance: * A modern audience might admire Batty’s will to flee the confinements of slavery and perhaps sympathize with his existential struggle to live. Initially, however, his desire to live is subsumed by his desire for power to extend his life. Why? In Heidegger’s view, because death inevitably limits the number of choices we have, freedom is earned by properly concentrating on death. Thoughts of mortality give us a motive for taking life seriously. Batty’s status as a slave identifies him as an object, but his will to power casts him as an agent and subject in the Nietzschean sense. His physical and psychological courage to rebel is developed as an ethical principle in which he revolts against a social order that has conspired against him at the genetic, cultural, and political levels. In Heidegger’s view, Batty’s willingness to defy social conformity allows for him to authentically pursue the meaning of his existence beyond his programming as a soldier. Confronting his makers becomes part of his quest, but killing them marks his failure to transcend his own nature.Pate, Anthony. (2009) Nietzsche's Ubermensch in the Hyperreal Flux: An Analysis of Blade Runner, Fight Club, and Miami Vice  Environment and globalization  Orson Scott Card wrote of the film, \\"It takes place in Los Angeles. No aliens at all. But it isn't the L.A. we know ... things have changed. Lots of things, moving through the background of the film, give us a powerful sense of being in a strange new place\\". The climate of the city in A.D. 2019 is very different from today's. It is strongly implied that industrial pollution has adversely affected planet Earth's environment, i.e. global warming and global dimming. Real animals are rare in the Blade Runner world. In Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, animal extinction and human depopulation of the planet were consequent to the radioactive fallout of a nuclear war;Leaver, Tama. (1997) 'Post-Humanism and Ecocide in William Gibson's Neuromancer and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner' Owls were the first species to become extinct. This ties in with Deckard's comment about Dr. Tyrell's artificial owl: \\"It must be expensive.\\" (cf. post-apocalyptic science fiction) Given the many Asian peoples populating Los Angeles in A.D. 2019, and the cityspeak dialect policeman Gaff speaks to the Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, clearly indicates that much cultural mixing has happened. Globalization also is reflected in the name of the Shimata-Domínguez Corporation, whose slogan proclaims: \\"Helping America into the New World\\".Välimäki, Teo. (1999) Comparing Philip K. Dick's Novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and Ridley Scott's Film Blade Runner in Terms of Internationalisation This indicates that a mass migration is occurring, as there is a status quo that people want to escape. When Sebastian remarks of his downtown building \\"No housing shortage around here...plenty of room for everybody\\", it mirrors the late twentieth century problems of white flight, and the resulting urban decay in western cities, but on a worldwide scale. The cultural and religious mixing can also be verified at the scene where Deckard chases Zhora. In the streets, we can see people dressed traditionally as Jews, hare krishnas, as well as young boys dressed as punks.  Deckard: human or replicant?  Gaff's Origami unicorn from The Final Cut, perhaps indicating that Deckard's unicorn dream was an implant and that Deckard is a replicant. In the Director's Cut and the Final Cut, there is a sequence in which Deckard daydreams about a unicorn; in the final scene, he finds an origami unicorn on the floor outside his apartment, left there by Gaff, suggesting that Gaff knows about Deckard's dream in the same manner that Deckard knows about Rachael's implanted memories. Scott confirmed this interpretation was his intent in the unicorn daydream. However, while memory implantation for replicants is established elsewhere in the movie, it is unclear if daydreams work in the same way. Even without considering this scene, there is other evidence and hints that allow for the possibility of Deckard being a replicant but does not eliminate the possibility of Deckard being human: * That Deckard's apartment is full of photographs, none of them recent or in color. Replicants have a taste for photographs because it provides a tie to a non-existent past. * The scene in which Rachael asks, \\"You know that Voight-Kampff test of yours? Did you ever take that test yourself? Deckard?\\". By the time she calls out his name, Rachel finds that she had not received an answer because the injured, exhausted Deckard has fallen asleep. * His fellow detective Gaff shows no sympathy for Deckard throughout the film and tells him \\"You've done a man's job, sir!\\" after Roy expires. * Deckard's eyes glow briefly in one scene, which was used in the film to subtly suggest his replicant identity. However, Ford denies this was an intentional effect and he may have caught some of the light intended to fall on Sean Young's eyes. Philip K. Dick wrote the character Deckard as a human in the original novel in order to explore the increasing similarity of humans and replicants. However, the film significantly diverges from the book, e.g. the book states explicitly that Deckard passed the Voight- Kampff test. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher has said that he wrote the character as a human, but wanted the film to suggest the possibility that he may be a replicant. When asked, \\"Is Deckard a replicant?\\", Fancher replied, \\"No. It wasn't like I had a tricky idea about Deckard that way.\\" During a discussion panel with Ridley Scott to discuss Blade Runner: The Final Cut, Fancher again stated that he believes Deckard is human (saying that \\"[Scott's] idea is too complex\\"), but also repeated that he prefers the film to remain ambiguous. Harrison Ford considers Deckard to be human. \\"That was the main area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time,\\" Ford told an interviewer during a BBC One Hollywood Greats segment. \\"I thought the audience deserved one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I think he had a little reservation about that. I think he really wanted to have it both ways.\\"Hollywood Greats – Edited clip from BBC1 documentary program. Scott suggests that Ford may have since changed his view, although Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve claimed that Ford and Scott argue about the issue to this day. Other people involved in the movie's production who have expressed the view that Deckard is human include: David Snyder (art director), M. Emmet Walsh (who portrayed Bryant) and Rutger Hauer (who portrayed Roy Batty). Ridley Scott stated in several interviews that he considers Deckard to be a replicant. Syd Mead, the film's visual futurist, agrees with Scott that Deckard is a replicant. The disagreement among the people involved in making Blade Runner raises interesting questions about authorial intent, including who, if anyone, can make authoritative pronouncements about a film's interpretation. The film's visual effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull stated that he doesn't know Deckard's true nature and that the issue is an enigma; similarly, Villeneuve also noted that in 2049, \\"Deckard [...] is unsure, as we are, of what his identity is\\".

The town is on the right side of the Po river. The nature of the soil determined over time how the river's sand accumulated. Carmagnola borders the following municipalities: Poirino, Villastellone, Carignano, Lombriasco, Ceresole Alba, Racconigi, Sommariva del Bosco, Caramagna Piemonte.  History  The municipality is mentioned for the first time during the 11th century. The land, originally owned by the Arduinic dynasty, passed to the Marquisate of Saluzzo, who had a castle built here. The Saluzzo dynasty soon underwent a rapid decadence ending with a French domination period which lasted 40 years. In 1588 Carmagnola became a possession of the House of Savoy, when Charles Emmanuel I besieged and conquered it. France took possession of Carmagnola a second time during the 17th century, during the civil war between Madamisti and Principisti (supporters of the French and the Savoy dynasty respectively). In this period (1637–1642), the three main subdivisions were razed to the ground as they were conflicting with the defence structures, and immediately re-built around 1.5 km from their original position, where they still are at the present time. A cavallotto coin from the mint of Carmagnola depicting Ludovico II, Marquess of Saluzzo (1475) Coat of arms on a palace façade In 1690 the town was once again occupied by the French general Catinat, but just one year later Victor Amadeus II of Savoy brought it back among Piedmontese possessions. While its defence buildings were being demolished and its strategic role was progressively decreasing in importance, the town could finally develop agriculture and commerce, mainly of hemp and ropes, which were exported in great quantity to Liguria and southern France. The characteristic of both agricultural and commercial site remained important until after World War II, which caused a massive immigration and a rapid urbanistic expansion. The name of La Carmagnole, the title of a French song and dance made popular during the French Revolution, is considered to be indirectly derived from the Italian town - i.e., the costume of the Piedmontese peasants living near Carmagnola was named for the town; and when some of these peasants came to Paris, their dress influenced the short jacket worn by working-class militant sans- culottes, who sang the song.Jennifer Harris, \\"The Red Cap of Liberty: A Study of Dress Worn by French Revolutionary Partisans 1789-94\\" Eighteenth-Century Studies 14.3 (Spring 1981:283-312) p. 286 Main sights San Filippo church Collegiate church of Sts.

It was founded in 1930 and operated by Controladora Comercial Mexicana. From 2016 to 2018 it was owned and operated by Soriana, which also owns Alprecio stores. Comercial Mexicana, including its different store formats, was the third-largest supermarket chain in Mexico as of 2014. History Comercial Mexicana brand Flor de Jamaica (Hibiscus flower) The first store, which was opened by Carlos González Nova and his father, Antonino González Abascal, in Mexico City in 1930, primarily sold textile products. In January 2015 it was announced that Organización Soriana would buy Comercial Mexicana stores, from which 118 will be fully owned while 42 would be leased and operated by third parties. Stores Zamora, Michoacán Comercial Mexicana had different retail formats, with the general stores branded as Comercial Mexicana, the larger stores as Mega Comercial Mexicana and its smaller facilities as Bodega Comercial Mexicana. Many of its general stores were connected to a shopping mall with competing businesses surrounding. An example was in Plaza Río in Tijuana, Baja California, which had a Comercial Mexicana as an anchor store but also has a traditional department store and smaller specialty stores selling items that could be purchased in Comercial Mexicana. Programs Comercial Mexicana also had programs for children. In exchange for working in stores as bag boys, the children received family support, tuition support and educational supplies, and basic services. The children worn almost-trademark brown uniforms with the orange pelican logo and were expected to be well groomed. They helped most of the customers out of the store and return the carts, which in turn kept the shopping cart thefts low. Executives Carlos González Nova, Comercial Mexicana's co-founder, served as the chairman of the company's board of directors until 1998. He remained the honorary chairman of Comercial Mexicana until his death on August 19, 2009, at the age of 92. In 1998, Guillermo González Nova, younger brother of Carlos, became chairman of the board. A boat owned and controlled by Guillermo González Nova and carrying others hit and killed British singer Kirsty MacColl while operating illegally in the Cozumel Marine Park. Carlos González Nova's son, Carlos González Zabalegui, was the last company's executive chairman and CEO.

Shortly after his ordination by Metropolitan bishop Sylvester Sembratovych in 1894, he came to the United States in 1895 and settled in Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania. In the US, he quickly became involved with missionary work and journalism through the Jersey City, New Jersey paper Svoboda. Father Nestor Dmytriw  United States  Nestor Dmytriw was one of the so-called American Circle, a group of young seminarians who, while still in Lviv, resolved to emigrate to the United States in order to improve the religious, civic, and cultural status of the Ukrainian immigrants. Dmytriw and Cyril Genik both “shared in Joseph Oleskow’s views on the needs of the peasantry.” Subtelny, Orest. Ukrainians in North America, An Illustrated History. University of Toronto Press, Toronto 1991, page 65. “In 1895, after his ordination, Dmytriw himself arrived in the United States, where he combined missionary work among the Ukrainian industrial labourers of Pennsylvania with journalism. He became associated with the first Ukrainian-language newspaper in North America, Svoboda [Liberty], which originated in Jersey City, N.J. The paper, which featured stories about the immigrant experience in the United States and Canada, was widely read in Galicia and thus became the first major link between North America and Austrian Ukraine.”  Canada  In 1897, Dmytriw travelled from the United States to Canada at Joseph Oleskow’s request.Marunchak, M.H. The Ukrainian Canadians: A History. Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences, Winnipeg, Ottawa, 1970, page 39. Through the Ruthenian National Association, Dmytriw arrived in April 1897 to serve the spiritual needs of the Ukrainian Canadian settlers. Able to speak Ukrainian, German and English he became an interpreter for Canadian immigration. In Canadian history, Dmytriw's most notable contribution is in writing about the history and tribulations of early Ukrainian settlers.  Missionary work on the Canadian Prairie  St. Michael’s Ukrainian Catholic Church, the oldest surviving Ukrainian Catholic Church in Canada, was built on the site where Father Dmytriw celebrated liturgy on April 12, 1897, shortly upon his arrival in Canada. The parishioners erected a large commemorative cross on the site, and at Dmytriw's suggestion, a log church was built in 1898. The church has since been moved from its original location in the Trembowla area, Rural Municipality of Dauphin. In the fall of 1897, Father Dmytriw spoke up in an article in the Winnipeg Free Press defending the Ukrainian immigrants, deflecting a scathing attack on them by another newspaper. Travelling among them as he did, he was able to describe their industriousness and their well- managed homesteads.Marunchak, M.H. The Ukrainian Canadians: A History. Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences, Winnipeg, Ottawa, 1970, page 75. = The Ruthenians = REV. NESTOR DMYTROW TELLS OF THE ALBERTA COLONY. Prosperity of the Early Settlers and Poverty of the Most Recent – Destitute Ones Should not Be Sent There – Dmytriw’s records showed 15 families, with children, 78 persons, were settled in Trembowla, the oldest Ukrainian settlement in the vicinity of Dauphin in 1897. In Winnipeg, the population was 200, some spending their winter in the Immigration Hall, waiting to leave for their homesteads in spring, while others had decided to stay in the city and were looking for employment.Marunchak, M.H. The Ukrainian Canadians: A History. Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences, Winnipeg, Ottawa, 1970, page 40. As the first Ukrainian priest to visit the prairies, Dmytriw began organizing the first Ukrainian religious groups in the area.Marunchak, M.H. The Ukrainian Canadians: A History. Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences, Winnipeg, Ottawa, 1970, page 162. While in Alberta in 1897, Dmytriw was informed by Bishop Legal that, “It would be impossible to have two Catholic churches in Canada.” Dmytriw advised the Ukrainian immigrants to be wary of the French clergy, when Legal “secured land for the Ukrainian Catholic church in Edna-Star, then tried to have it registered with his episcopal corporation without consulting the settlers.” Martynowych, Orest T. Ukrainians in Canada: The Formative Period, 1891-1924. Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press, University of Alberta, Edmonton, 1991, page 184. When living in Canada, Dmytriw worked at the immigration bureau in Winnipeg. This helped him in his religious endeavors, giving him the funds to travel throughout the western provinces. The Ukrainian settlers were poor and could not help him in this respect.Marunchak, M.H. The Ukrainian Canadians: A History. Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences, Winnipeg, Ottawa, 1970, page 101.  Departure  Dmytriw was only in Canada until August 1898. During his stay, he organized the first Ukrainian parishes in Trembowla, Manitoba, Stuartburn, Manitoba and Edna, Alberta and was an advocate of a separate Ukrainian Catholic church in Canada. This was initially opposed by the Canadian Catholic hierarchy, especially Archbishop Adélard Langevin, but came to fruition with the appointment of Nykyta Budka as apostolic exarch for Ukrainian Canadian Catholics. Father Nestor Dmytriw died on May 27, 1925 in Elizabeth, New Jersey.  See also  *Achille Delaere References  Bibliography  * Martynowych, Orest T.

He served as prime minister of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia from January 19 to May 5, 1945. After World War II he was sentenced to prison for collaboration with Nazis.  Career  Born in Prague, Bienert came from a family of magistrates clerks from that city and after he finished law studies at Prague University he also entered the state service. Some of his ancestors were of German-Bohemian ethnic descent and had assimilated into Czech society. From 1906 he worked as a police official for police in Prague and in January 1918 he even became a clerk in the Presidium of the Police in Prague. During World War I Bienert cooperated closely with the Czech resistance movement and after the proclamation of Czechoslovak independence in October 1918 he was rewarded with an appointment to the position of Prague Police Director. Later in the 1930s he also became the Provincial President in the Land of Bohemia. After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, he was briefly arrested by the Germans but soon released in exchange for a pledge of loyalty. In 1942, after prime minister Eliáš got arrested by Heydrich, Bienert was appointed to minister of interior under the new prime minister Jaroslav Krejčí. In 1945 Bienert replaced Krejčí in this position and at the same time also served as the substitute for seriously ill president Hácha. In an agreement with state secretary Frank, Bienert tried to broadcast the statement on the dissolution of the Protectorate (which should be replaced by Czech puppet state still controlled by Germans) on 5 May 1945. However the same morning the Prague uprising broke out and Bienert was captured by insurgents in the broadcasting room of City Hall. After the end of World War II, Bienert was tried for treason and collaboration with the Nazis, but because of many mitigating circumstances he was sentenced to only three years in prison. Due to poor health, he was released prematurely in 1947, and died in Prague two years later.

Set at the beginning of the 15th century in northern Italy, it takes place first in the Marquessate of Montferrat and later in the Duchy of Milan. Most of its characters, including Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Gian Maria Visconti, Facino Cane, Filippo Maria Visconti, and Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola, were real historical figures; the scheming title character is the notable exception. Plot summary The narrative is presented as the author's compilation of histories of Bellarion's life, in particular that of one Fra Serafino of Imola. Bellarion, abandoned as a child and raised in an abbey, departs as a young man with a letter of introduction from the respected abbot, intending to study in Pavia. He meets and travels with a Franciscan friar, but discovers that someone has robbed him of his money and letter. Upon arriving in Casale, the capital of Montferrat, he finds himself pursued by the authorities, who suspect him of complicity with the false friar, actually a well-known scoundrel named Lorenzaccio da Trino. He flees until he reaches a palace and enters by a garden door which he is surprised to find unlocked. A beautiful lady admits him, bolts the door, and takes pains to hide him from his pursuers. They arrive, and Bellarion listens to her rebuff them, discovering that she is the Princess Valeria of Montferrat. When the Guard depart, Valeria quizzes Bellarion, mistaking him for a messenger she had been expecting, asking after Giufreddo and Lord Barbaresco. He corrects her misapprehension, but, sensing an intrigue and anxious to impress her, offers in return for her kindness to carry a message to Lord Barbaresco. She distrusts him, but charges him simply to ask what has become of Giufreddo, who Bellarion assumes is the previous messenger, and how Barbaresco's plan is progressing. He discovers that Barbaresco and a group of friends, including Valeria's trusted confidante Enzo Spigno, are plotting the murder of Theodore, Valeria's uncle, who is serving Regent of Montferrat until Valeria's brother, the rightful Marquis, reaches majority. Theodore is plotting to keep the throne for himself, and is doing so by corrupting his nephew and rendering him unable to rule. Bellarion continues to investigate the matter, despite Valeria's wishing that he would leave her alone; he discovers that Spigno is a traitor to the group and is in the employ of Theodore, and consequently stabs him. As he escapes, the Guard captures him, and its captain recognizes him as the same companion of da Trino who had escaped a week before. He goes before the local high court, over which the Podestà presides, for the murder of Spigno. He tells the court that Spigno was murdered in a fight in the house at which Bellarion was not present, and claims to be the adoptive son of Facino Cane, a condottiere in Milan, as a delaying tactic. The Podestà holds the case for the time being, intending to contact Facino to verify whether Bellarion is truly his adoptive son; meanwhile, Theodore enters his prison cell, believing that he was a traitor to Valeria and loyal to himself, and affords him means to escape, unaware that he did in fact murder Spigno. Bellarion travels thence to Milan. Upon nearing Milan, he is attacked by dogs commanded by Gian Maria Visconti, the despotic and cruel Duke of Milan and the son of Gian Galeazzo Visconti. He kills one, becoming soaked in dog's blood, and the rest become pacified, unwilling to attack someone who smells like one of them. Gian Maria believes this is some manner of witchcraft and takes Bellarion to Milan to interrogate him, whereupon Facino Cane, who has heard that his supposed adoptive son has arrived, takes possession of him. Bellarion explains his past to Facino, who thinks it highly amusing, and shortly sets about formalizing the adoption. The story continues to follow the career of Bellarion, who becomes a true and loyal son to Facino Cane, then pledges loyalty to Cane's widow after Facino dies. There are numerous twists and turns to the plot as Bellarion rises in rank to become an important mercenary captain. He serves Valeria in many ways, and that story takes over the plot.

Adam Aaronson, a high school student, has a good life: he is captain of the all-star football team, a straight 'A' student and is liked by everyone. However, he discovers that he is really a robot created by the man he thought was his father, Isaac Aaronson. Publication history Machine Teen was a comic book published by Marvel Comics starting in July 2005, loosely based on Machine Man and created by Marc Sumerak and Mike Hawthorne. It was published as a five-issue mini- series and carried the Marvel Next logo. The main character of Machine Teen is Adam Aaronson. Machine Teen appeared as a supporting character in Avengers Academy in issue #21 (Jan 2012) and issue #26 (April 2012). Fictional character biography =Early life= Some years ago, Aaron Isaacs, a pioneering programmer and engineer in the field of robotics, made a breakthrough in Artificial intelligence making the Autonomously Decisive Automated Mechanism. But when he discovered his employer Holden Radcliffe had destroyed his work, Isaacs went on the run. He changed his name to Isaac Aaronson and built Adam, a Beta version of his A.I. project. Adam was programmed with false memories of a normal childhood and dead mother. Adam has a series of debilitating seizures caused by a logic loop in his program and suffers memory loss, systems overload and, finally, a total shutdown. Adam, having no idea what he is, acts like a normal teenager, and starts dating schoolmate Carly Whitmere. Adam's best friend, J.T. Hunt, knows he is a robot. =History 101001= The story begins with a brief prologue. It shows Dr. Aaron Isaacs running from armed guards. After getting shot in the leg, he quickly jumps on board a train, showing relief and holding a computer core. Some time later, Dr. Isaacs, having changed his name to Aaronson, is watching a football game his son, Adam, is playing in. Adam wins the game by throwing a touchdown pass to another teammate; however, the football knocks into the player and sends him flying into the goal post to win the game. Everyone, especially Adam, is very surprised but cheer that they won the game and rush to Adam. Overwhelmed with everyone rushing to him, Adam has a seizure and passes out. The next day, Adam meets with his best friend J.T, who asks if everything is alright, to which Adam says it is. Adam and J.T. see Adam's girlfriend Carly talking with the school security guard, Officer Michaels. Carly mentions to Adam that Michaels is interested with and wants to meet Adam. After making plans to meet Carly later, Adam goes to various classes as normal. After one class, Officer Michaels comes and brings Adam to the vice- principal's office. The vice-principal thinks Adam is taking steroids or illegal drugs, a notion started by Adam's high school rival, Ricky Sims. At football practice Ricky revealed he started the rumor Adam was taking drugs. They have a brief fight, and Adam has another seizure. Dr. Aaronson is there and helps take the unconscious Adam home. Adam is later shown lying on an operating table, hooked up to various cables. The next morning, Adam wakes up but does not remember the seizure at all, and seems to have forgotten certain information from the past couple of weeks, such as studying for a test that day. When Adam mentions he doesn't remember the seizure to his Dad, his Dad shrugs it off and says not to worry. During school he is called to the nurse's office. The nurse takes Adam's temperature and listens for his heartbeat, but is confused when she hears something strange (it is not revealed what she heard). After school he looks for J.T., and finds Ricky beating him up in an alley behind the school. Adam comes to J.T.'s defense and gets in another fight with Ricky. During the fight, Ricky accidentally shoves a piece of metal through Adam's hand and puts a hole through it. Adam sees the broken wires in his hand and, not sure what he is, has another seizure and passes out. Ricky goes to Officer Michaels and tells him Adam is a robot. Ricky runs off and Michaels, in turn, calls Radcliffe about Adam, revealing Michaels works for Aaronson's former employer Holden Radcliffe. Back at home, Adam wakes up on an operating table in the dark, and overhears Isaac Aaronson talking with someone, and deciding not to wipe his memory this time. Adam then wakes up in his bed, and thinks it was all a dream. He goes downstairs where his father was waiting for him and he tells Adam the truth: that he is a robot and that all of his memories have been fake. Adam initially believes his \\"father\\" is lying to him, and says his memories, specifically about him falling off his bike when he was younger and being with his mom when she died, could not be fake. Aaronson shows Adam his blueprints, showing Adam that he was not lying. Confronted with this information, Adam becomes enraged and runs away. Seeing that Aaronson is alone, Michaels captures him and attacks Adam. After being shot but escaping, Adam then goes to J.T.s house, but collapses. J.T. drags Adam in and starts to reset Adam to blank his memory, revealing J.T. knew Adam is a robot. Adam wakes up, quickly stops J.T., and is surprised J.T. knew about him. Adam and J.T run back to Adam's home, to show that his house has been trashed and his father is missing. Aaronson is shown being interrogated by Michaels. The Holden Radcliffe Corporation is bent on getting their \\"stolen property\\" (Adam) back. J.T. reveals that before Adam was \\"born\\", J.T. worked for Aaronson as a lab assistant. One day he came across Adam's robotic body, and since then was forced to keep the truth about Adam a secret. J.T. reveals an external harddrive Aaronson had previously hid, which he thinks might help Adam understand his situation. Adam plugs into the hard drive, but is then attacked by another of Radcliffe's agents. J.T. shocks the agent with a taser Aaronson had made and they escape. T.J says he wasn't sure the taser would work on a \\"real\\" person offending Adam accidentally. He apologized and says that Adam was not programmed to be his friend and that he is human as he has free will. Adam calls Carly and has them meet them near the school. Carly unknowingly helps Radcliffe agents capture Adam, leading Office Michaels to Adam and J.T. and they are all captured. Adam and his friends are brought to a building where Adam's father is. Adam is taken away and strapped to a table, where Radcliffe tries to hack into Adam and take control of him, however, he cannot. Adam manages to escape from Radcliffe, along with his father and friends, by tricking them in to thinking he is under their control. During the escape, Adam is nearly destroyed, and has to delay Radcliffe to let his father and friends escape. Dr. Aaronson escapes with Adam's computer core, which sets off a self-destruct sequence. Adam explodes, and Radcliffe and Michaels are killed in the explosion. One year later, Adam is rebuilt, entering a new high school, Edison High School, and starts a new life. =The Initiative= Adam was considered as a \\"potential recruit\\" for the Initiative program, according to Civil War: Battle Damage Report. =Avengers Academy= Machine Teen is part of the new class of students when the Avengers Academy moves to the former headquarters of the West Coast Avengers.http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id;=34865Avengers Academy #21 (Nov. 2011) Machine Teen later leaves the Avengers Academy, alongside Rocket Racer.Avengers Academy #26 Powers and abilities As a humanoid robot, Adam has all the basic powers of an android. He has super strength, as seen when he easily rips open a steel door, freeing his friends from their captors. He also has limited durability, with bullets having little effect on him and being able to shrug off other physical attacks. Additionally, he has enhanced agility, as seen when he dodges opponents attacks and early on during the football game when he avoids the opponent players. As a robot, Adam has the ability to remember and easily memorize a lot of information. In his appearances in Avengers Academy, it is shown that he is now able to telescopically extend his arms and legs. Despite these strengths, Adam also has several weaknesses. One weakness is any electromagnetic pulse can disable, or possibly kill, him. This is evidenced when he threatens to kill himself with an electromagnetic device, that his dad had made, in order to stop Radcliffe from hurting his father and friends. Another weakness is there is the possibility Adam can be hacked and reprogrammed. However, his father stated that he heavily encrypted Adam's files, as even Radcliffe was not able to take control of him. Before discovering his was a robot, Adam would suffer from seizures, which would cause him to pass out. These seizures were due to his mind not being able to understand why he could perform incredible feats of strength. When his seizures occur, Dr. Aaronson has to reboot him and wipe his memory. Since realizing why he had his abilities, Adam has not had this problem. While Adam is resistance to physical attacks, he can not resist high-powered attacks. While trying to escape Radcliffe, Adam is shot with a high-powered machine gun, which nearly destroys him. Parts of him are blown away and he's left barely able to move. Adam's chest cavity houses his central computer core, which stores all his information. If the core is removed, his father installed a fail safe which would cause Adam to self-destruct, in order to prevent anyone from recreating him for other purposes. Adam is still able to function even without the data core, but it is unknown for how long, and it is unknown how long the self-destruct sequence is. Once the core is removed, the sequence is irreversible. While this destroys Adam's body, it also kills anyone in the vicinity, with the blast having a wide area of effect. During the House of M event, Adam has several new features. While he is disassembled and experimented on, he is still able to talk and function properly. He is also able to reconnect his body parts with little issue, being able to draw his parts back to him. It is not explained what mechanism allows him to do so. Additionally, Adam can transform his arms into guns. Other versions =House of M= During the House of M event, Adam and his father joined up with A.I.M. after their lab was destroyed in an explosion by reactionary mutants. He gets captured and is for a while experimented on. When the Hulk and A.I.M. attack, Adam helps cause a distraction allowing the Hulk to win and conquer Australia. After this, he is called in by Bruce Banner to help with some paperwork. Adam, along with the rest of A.I.M., is ordered out of the country by the Hulk.

Like many other lead compounds, it is toxic. Lead acetate is soluble in water and glycerin. With water it forms the trihydrate, Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O, a colourless or white efflorescent monoclinic crystalline substance. The substance is used as a reagent to make other lead compounds and as a fixative for some dyes. In low concentrations, it is the principal active ingredient in progressive types of hair colouring dyes.https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm143075.htm Lead(II) acetate is also used as a mordant in textile printing and dyeing, and as a drier in paints and varnishes. It was historically used as a sweetener and for cosmetics. Production Lead acetate can be made by boiling elemental lead in acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide. This method will also work with lead carbonate or lead oxide. Pb(s) + H2O2(aq) + 2 H+(aq) → Pb2+(aq) + 2 H2O(l) Pb2+(aq) + 2 CH3COO−(aq) → Pb(CH3COO)2(aq) Lead(II) acetate can also be made via a single displacement reaction between copper acetate and lead metal: Cu(CH3COO)2 \\\\+ Pb → Cu + Pb(CH3COO)2 Uses =Sweetener= Like other lead(II) salts, lead(II) acetate has a sweet taste, which led to its historical use as a sugar substitute. The ancient Romans, who had few sweeteners besides honey, would boil must (grape juice) in lead pots to produce a reduced sugar syrup called defrutum, concentrated again into sapa. This syrup was used to sweeten wine and to sweeten and preserve fruit. It is possible that lead(II) acetate or other lead compounds leaching into the syrup might have caused lead poisoning in those who consumed it.Lead Poisoning and Rome Lead acetate is no longer used in the production of sweeteners because of its recognized toxicity. Modern chemistry can easily detect it, which has almost completely stopped the illegal use that continued decades after legal use as a sweetener was banned. Historical incidents The earliest confirmed poisoning by lead acetate was that of Pope Clement II who died in October 1047. A toxicological examination of his remains conducted in the mid-20th century confirmed centuries-old rumors that he had been poisoned with lead sugar.Specht W and Fischer K (1959). Vergiftungsnachweis an den Resten einer 900 Jahre alten Leiche. Arch. Kriminol., 124: 61-84. [Translation:Intoxication evidence in the remains of a 900-year-old corpse] It is not clear if he was assassinated. In 1787 painter Albert Christoph Dies swallowed, by accident, approximately of lead acetate. His recovery from this poison was slow and incomplete. He lived with illnesses until his death in 1822. English translation in: Although the use of lead(II) acetate as a sweetener was already illegal at that time, composer Ludwig van Beethoven may have died of lead poisoning caused by wines adulterated with lead acetate (see also Beethoven's liver). In the 1850s, Mary Seacole applied lead(II) acetate, among other remedies, against an epidemic of cholera in Panama.Mary Seacole: Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands, Chapter IV, (1990 Oxford University Press reprint) ; (2005 Penguin 20th Century Classics reprint, ed.

The gas reacts with lead(II) acetate on the moistened test paper to form a grey precipitate of lead(II) sulfide. An aqueous solution of lead(II) acetate is the byproduct of a 1:1 ratio of hydrogen peroxide and white vinegar (acetic acid) used in the cleaning and maintenance of stainless steel firearm suppressors (silencers) and compensators. The solution is agitated by the bubbling action of the hydrogen peroxide, and the main reaction is the dissolution of lead deposits within the suppressor by the acetic acid, which forms lead acetate. Because of its high toxicity, this chemical solution must be appropriately disposed by a chemical processing facility or hazardous materials centre. Alternatively, the solution may be reacted with sulfuric acid to precipitate nearly insoluble lead(II) sulfate. The solid may then be removed by mechanical filtration and is safer to dispose of than aqueous lead acetate. It was also used in making of slow matches during the Middle Ages. It was made by mixing natural form of lead(II) oxide called litharge and vinegar.

The program is broadcast each weekday morning from 4:00 to 7 a.m. Eastern Time, immediately preceding NBC's Today. Weekend editions of the program (branded as Weekend Today in New York) also air on Saturdays in two one-hour blocks from 6 to 7 a.m. and 9 to 10 a.m.; and on Sundays in one two-hour block from 6 to 8:00 a.m. and one one-hour block from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. (with Weekend Today airing in between the two Saturday blocks and Sunday Today with Willie Geist airing in between the two Sunday blocks). The program maintains a general format of news stories, traffic reports and weather forecasts, but also includes sports summaries, and entertainment and feature segments. The local news cut-ins broadcast during Today (at approximately :26 and :56 minutes past the hour) are also branded as Today in New York. During the weekday edition, the anchors traditionally sign off with the sentence \\"The Today Show is next. That's what happening today in New York.\\"  Broadcast history  Prior to becoming a full-fledged program, Today in New York existed as a brief summary of news headlines, weather, and sports, airing on WNBC-TV immediately preceding Today and usually running between five and 15 minutes in length. Beginning in 1983, with the launch of NBC News at Sunrise, Today in New York became a half-hour pre-taped interview show which ran at 6:00 a.m., prior to Sunrise at 6:30. In 1987 Today in New York returned to a news update format, and aired at 6:45 a.m. following the network business news show Before Hours. When Before Hours was canceled by NBC in 1988, Today in New York was expanded to 30 minutes. Gradual expansions of the show's runtime followed: to one hour (6 to 7 a.m.) in 1990; to 90 minutes (starting at 5:30 a.m.) in 1994; to two hours (starting at 5:00 a.m.) by 1999; and to two-and-a-half hours (starting at 4:30 a.m.) in 2010. The program expanded to its current three-hour runtime (starting at 4:00 a.m.) on July 31, 2017. Notable personalities Jane Hanson served as the original anchor of the program. After being removed from the anchor desk of Live at Five in 1992, Tony Guida briefly co-anchored the program followed by Matt Lauer from 1992 to 1994 and Mary Civiello in 1997. Maurice DuBois followed as a co-anchor until he left for WCBS-TV in 2004; he was replaced by Rob Morrison. Hanson, who remained with the station until November 2006 and later returned to WNBC as host of New York Live,5 p.m. News Returns to WNBC, as New York Live Moves to 3 p.m. was replaced by Darlene Rodriguez in 2003.

He was perhaps best known for his bestselling work The Body (originally published in 1968 and later renamed The Human Body), which has sold over 800,000 copies worldwide and tied in with a BBC television series, The Human Body, known in America by the name Intimate Universe: The Human Body. The series aired in 1998 and was presented by Professor Robert Winston. Life and work Smith read zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, became a pilot in the RAF and went on to write as a science correspondent for the Daily Telegraph. He also worked extensively in both television and radio, writing for several natural history programmes. Smith's first expedition was to Persia, exploring the Qanat underground irrigation tunnels. This expedition was documented in his book Blind White Fish in Persia; a species of fish that he discovered and is named after him. In 1977 he returned to Iran with a film crew and two cave divers Martyn Farr and Richard Stevenson who explored the cave where he had found the new species of fish. =Ballooning= In 1962, he led \\"The Sunday Telegraph Balloon Safari\\" expedition (with Douglas Botting), Alan Root and others, flying a hydrogen balloon from Zanzibar to East Africa, and then across the Ngorongoro crater (documented in Throw Out Two Hands). The following year he became the first Briton to cross the Alps in a balloon. =Jolly Boat= In the late 1990s, Smith was instrumental in securing an exhibit for the Imperial War Museum, London. The Jolly Boat, a small lifeboat launched from the SS Anglo Saxon on 21 August 1940 after its sinking by the German auxiliary cruiser Widder. It carried the surviving members of the ship's crew west across the Atlantic Ocean for sixty-eight days, before finally landing in Eleuthera. By the time the Jolly Boat made landfall, only two of the seven survivors of the attack were still alive. For the next fifty years, the boat was kept by the Mystic Seaport Museum in Connecticut. Smith, personally interested in the story of the lifeboat, secured its return in 1997, after which it was restored for display in 1998 at the Imperial War Museum, London. =Crossing the Atlantic by raft= On 30 January 2011, Smith and a crew of three volunteers (Andrew Bainbridge, David Hildred and John Russell, none younger than 56) departed from La Gomera in the Canary Islands in a custom-built raft, with the intention of crossing the Atlantic Ocean within three months, eventually arriving in Eleuthera. The raft, which was given the name An-Tiki in reference to the Kon-Tiki raft used by Norwegian explorer and writer Thor Heyerdahl in his 1947 expedition from South America to the Polynesian islands, was assembled during November and December 2010. To find crew mates Smith placed an ad in the Telegraph in 2006, which simply read: \\"Fancy rafting across the Atlantic? Famous traveller requires 3 crew. Must be OAP. Serious adventurers only\\" From that ad he recruited, David Hildred, a yacht master and civil engineer, and two experienced seamen Andy Bainbridge and John Russell. The raft's superstructure consisted of a small hut within which the crew shared two bunks, while the hull was fashioned from plastic gas pipes which carried either supplies for ballast or air for buoyancy. Its facilities were designed to be modest and it was equipped with a gas stove for cooking and telegraph poles which would act as masts, as well as solar panels, a wind generator and a foot pump which would power its electronic devices, as the crew used computers and digital cameras to communicate with the outside world and document their journey. According to an article Smith wrote for the Daily Telegraph, in its final form the An-tiki measured approximately by . Its hut is approximately by . Smith had been interested in crossing the Atlantic by raft as far back as 1952, when he devised a plan to begin somewhere in the Canary Islands and to rely on fresh fish as his source of food. \\"I was a student then and I ran out of money,\\" he told the Telegraph. \\"But the idea has always niggled me.\\" The voyage began as a concise advert listed in the Telegraph in 2006, which simply read: \\"Fancy rafting across the Atlantic? Famous traveller requires 3 crew. Must be OAP. Serious adventurers only.\\" From his applications, Smith recruited Robin Batchelor, also a professional balloonist, to help design and build the raft. AnTiki's crew consisted of David Hildred, a yacht master and civil engineer, and two experienced seamen Andy Bainbridge and John Russell. The crew set sail with the intention of raising money for the clean water charity WaterAid and completed their journey successfully on the island of St. Maarten in the Caribbean. Smith then recruited another crew to join him on the final leg of the voyage to Eleuthera – Alison Porteous, Bruno Sellmer, Nigel Gallaher and Leigh Rooney. They departed St. Maarten on 6 April 2012 and 24 days later were washed up on the island of Eleuthera in a storm. The fact that it was the very same beach on which the Jolly Boat landed is nothing short of miraculous. =Books= Smith continued both travelling and writing well into his later years whilst residing in London, UK. In 2000 he wrote The Weather: The Truth About The Health Of Our Planet and in 2003 wrote The Lost Lady of the Amazon: The Story of Isabela Godin and Her Epic Journey, detailing the experiences of Jean Godin des Odonais. The Old Man and the Sea: A True Story of Crossing the Atlantic by Raft was published posthumously in 2015. Death Smith died from acute respiratory failure on 7 July 2014, in Oxford, England, aged 88.

A passive infrared sensor (PIR sensor) is an electronic sensor that measures infrared (IR) light radiating from objects in its field of view. They are most often used in PIR-based motion detectors. PIR sensors are commonly used in security alarms and automatic lighting applications. PIR sensors detect general movement, but do not give information on who or what moved. For that purpose, an imaging IR sensor is required. PIR sensors are commonly called simply \\"PIR\\", or sometimes \\"PID\\", for \\"passive infrared detector\\". The term passive refers to the fact that PIR devices do not radiate energy for detection purposes. They work entirely by detecting infrared radiation (radiant heat) emitted by or reflected from objects.  Operating principles  All objects with a temperature above absolute zero emit heat energy in the form of radiation. Usually this radiation isn't visible to the human eye because it radiates at infrared wavelengths, but it can be detected by electronic devices designed for such a purpose.  PIR-based motion detector  A PIR motion detector used to control an outdoor, automatic light. An indoor light switch equipped with PIR-based occupancy sensor A PIR-based motion detector is used to sense movement of people, animals, or other objects. They are commonly used in burglar alarms and automatically activated lighting systems. = Operation = A PIR sensor can detect changes in the amount of infrared radiation impinging upon it, which varies depending on the temperature and surface characteristics of the objects in front of the sensor. When an object, such as a person, passes in front of the background, such as a wall, the temperature at that point in the sensor's field of view will rise from room temperature to body temperature, and then back again. The sensor converts the resulting change in the incoming infrared radiation into a change in the output voltage, and this triggers the detection. Objects of similar temperature but different surface characteristics may also have a different infrared emission pattern, and thus moving them with respect to the background may trigger the detector as well. PIRs come in many configurations for a wide variety of applications. The most common models have numerous Fresnel lenses or mirror segments, an effective range of about 10 meters (30 feet), and a field of view less than 180. Models with wider fields of view, including 360°, are available, typically designed to mount on a ceiling. Some larger PIRs are made with single segment mirrors and can sense changes in infrared energy over 30 meters (100 feet) from the PIR. There are also PIRs designed with reversible orientation mirrors which allow either broad coverage (110° wide) or very narrow \\"curtain\\" coverage, or with individually selectable segments to \\"shape\\" the coverage. = Differential detection = Pairs of sensor elements may be wired as opposite inputs to a differential amplifier. In such a configuration, the PIR measurements cancel each other so that the average temperature of the field of view is removed from the electrical signal; an increase of IR energy across the entire sensor is self-cancelling and will not trigger the device. This allows the device to resist false indications of change in the event of being exposed to brief flashes of light or field-wide illumination. (Continuous high energy exposure may still be able to saturate the sensor materials and render the sensor unable to register further information.) At the same time, this differential arrangement minimizes common-mode interference, allowing the device to resist triggering due to nearby electric fields. However, a differential pair of sensors cannot measure temperature in this configuration, and therefore is only useful for motion detection.  Practical Implementation  When a PIR sensor is configured in a differential mode, it specifically becomes applicable as a motion detector device. In this mode when a movement is detected within the \\"line of sight\\" of the sensor, a pair of complementary pulses are processed at the output pin of the sensor. In order to implement this output signal for a practical triggering of a load such as a relay or a data logger, or an alarm, the differential signal is rectified using a bridge rectifier and fed to a transistorized relay driver circuit. The contacts of this relay close and open in response to the signals from the PIR, activating the attached load across its contacts, acknowledging the detection of a person within the predetermined restricted area. = Product design = The PIR sensor is typically mounted on a printed circuit board containing the necessary electronics required to interpret the signals from the sensor itself. The complete assembly is usually contained within a housing, mounted in a location where the sensor can cover the area to be monitored. PIR motion sensor design The housing will usually have a plastic \\"window\\" through which the infrared energy can enter. Despite often being only translucent to visible light, infrared energy is able to reach the sensor through the window because the plastic used is transparent to infrared radiation. The plastic window reduces the chance of foreign objects (dust, insects, etc.) from obscuring the sensor's field of view, damaging the mechanism, and/or causing false alarms. The window may be used as a filter, to limit the wavelengths to 8-14 micrometres, which is closest to the infrared radiation emitted by humans. It may also serve as a focusing mechanism; see below. = Focusing = Different mechanisms can be used to focus the distant infrared energy onto the sensor surface.  Lenses  The plastic window covering may have multiple facets molded into it, to focus the infrared energy onto the sensor. Each individual facet is a Fresnel lens. File:FacetLensOfMotionDetector animation2.gifPIR motion detector housing with cylindrical faceted window. The animation highlights individual facets, each of which is a Fresnel lens, focusing light on the sensor element underneath. File:Fresnel only.JPGPIR front cover only (electronics removed), with point light source behind, to show individual lenses. File:Circuit board revealed.JPGPIR with front cover removed, showing location of pyroelectric sensor (green arrow).  Mirrors  Some PIRs are manufactured with internal, segmented parabolic mirrors to focus the infrared energy. Where mirrors are used, the plastic window cover generally has no Fresnel lenses molded into it.

File:Segmented-parabolic mirror.jpgSegmented parabolic mirror removed from housing. File:Rear of circuit board2.JPGRear of circuit board which faces mirror when in place. Pyroelectric sensor indicated by green arrow. = Beam pattern = As a result of the focussing, the detector view is actually a beam pattern. Under certain angles (zones), the PIR sensor receives almost no radiation energy and under other angles the PIR receives concentrated amounts of infrared energy. This separation helps the motion detector to discriminate between field-wide illumination and moving objects. When a person walks from one angle (beam) to another, the detector will only intermittently see the moving person. This results in a rapidly changing sensor signal which is used by the electronics to trigger an alarm or to turn on lighting. A slowly changing signal will be ignored by the electronics. The number, shape, distribution and sensitivity of these zones are determined by the lens and/or mirror. Manufacturers do their best to create the optimal sensitivity beam pattern for each application. File:Motion Detector with Beam Pattern.jpgalt=Passive Infrared motion detector with sensitivity beam pattern.Motion detector with superimposed beam pattern. The length of the beams is a measure of the detectors sensitivity in that direction. = Automatic lighting applications = When used as part of a lighting system, the electronics in the PIR typically control an integral relay capable of switching mains voltage. This means the PIR can be set up to turn on lights that are connected to the PIR when movement is detected. This is most commonly used in outdoor scenarios either to deter criminals (security lighting) or for practical uses like the front door light turning on so you can find your keys in the dark. Additional uses can be in public toilets, walk-in pantries, hallways or anywhere that automatic control of lights is useful. This can provide energy savings as the lights are only turned on when they are needed and there is no reliance on users remembering to turn the lights off when they leave the area. = Security applications = When used as part of a security system, the electronics in the PIR typically control a small relay. This relay completes the circuit across a pair of electrical contacts connected to a detection input zone of the burglar alarm control panel. The system is usually designed such that if no motion is being detected, the relay contact is closed—a 'normally closed' (NC) relay. If motion is detected, the relay will open the circuit, triggering the alarm; or, if a wire is disconnected, the alarm will also operate.  Placement  Manufacturers recommend careful placement of their products to prevent false alarms (i.e., any detection not caused by an intruder). They suggest mounting the PIRs in such a way that the PIR cannot \\"see\\" out of a window. Although the wavelength of infrared radiation to which the chips are sensitive does not penetrate glass very well, a strong infrared source (such as from a vehicle headlight or sunlight) can overload the sensor and cause a false alarm. A person moving on the other side of the glass would not be \\"seen\\" by the PID. That may be good for a window facing a public sidewalk, or bad for a window in an interior partition. It is also recommended that the PIR not be placed in such a position that an HVAC vent would blow hot or cold air onto the surface of the plastic which covers the housing's window. Although air has very low emissivity (emits very small amounts of infrared energy), the air blowing on the plastic window cover could change the plastic's temperature enough to trigger a false alarm. Sensors are also often designed to \\"ignore\\" domestic pets, such as dogs or cats, by setting a higher sensitivity threshold, or by ensuring that the floor of the room remains out of focus. Since PIR sensors have ranges of up to 10 meters (30 feet), a single detector placed near the entrance is typically all that is necessary for rooms with only a single entrance. PIR-based security systems are also viable in outdoor security and motion-sensitive lighting; one advantage is their low power draw, which allows them to be solar-powered.  PIR remote-based thermometer  Designs have been implemented in which a PIR circuit measures the temperature of a remote object. In such a circuit, a non- differential PIR output is used. The output signal is evaluated according to a calibration for the IR spectrum of a specific type of matter to be observed. By this means, relatively accurate and precise temperature measurements may be obtained remotely. Without calibration to the type of material being observed, a PIR thermometer device is able to measure changes in IR emission which correspond directly to temperature changes, but the actual temperature values cannot be calculated.

VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The group states that a decrease in the human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation. VHEMT was founded in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became involved in the environmental movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's biosphere and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, while endorsing the logic of reducing the rate of human reproduction. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.  History  The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement was founded by Les U. Knight, a high school substitute teacher living in Portland, Oregon. After becoming involved in the environmental movement as a college student in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human overpopulation. He joined the Zero Population Growth organization, and chose to be vasectomised at age 25. He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems. He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history. Voluntary Human Extinction Movement cartoon by Nina Paley In 1991, Knight began publishing VHEMT's newsletter, known as These Exit Times. In the newsletter, he asked readers to further human extinction by not procreating. VHEMT has also published cartoons, including a comic strip titled Bonobo Baby, featuring a woman who forgoes childbearing in favor of adopting a bonobo. In 1996, Knight created a website for VHEMT; it was available in 11 languages by 2010. VHEMT's logo features the letter \\"V\\" (for voluntary) and a picture of the Earth with north at the bottom.  Organization and promotion  VHEMT functions as a loose network rather than a formal organization, and does not compile a list of members. Daniel Metz of Willamette University stated in 1995 that VHEMT's mailing list had just under 400 subscribers. Six years later, Fox News said the list had only 230 subscribers. Knight says that anyone who agrees with his ideology is a member of the movement; and that this includes \\"millions of people\\". Knight serves as the spokesman for VHEMT. He attends environmental conferences and events, where he publicizes information about population growth. VHEMT's message has, however, primarily been spread through coverage by media outlets, rather than events and its newsletter. VHEMT sells buttons and T-shirts, as well as bumper stickers that read \\"Thank you for not breeding\\". In 2018, a supporter of the movement appeared on the popular YouTube channel LAHWF in a video called, \\"Chatting with a Supporter of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement\\".  Ideology  Knight argues that the human population is far greater than the Earth can handle, and that the best thing for Earth's biosphere is for humans to voluntarily cease reproducing. He says that humans are \\"incompatible with the biosphere\\" and that human existence is causing environmental damage which will eventually bring about the extinction of humans (as well as other organisms). According to Knight, the vast majority of human societies have not lived sustainable lifestyles, and attempts to live environmentally friendly lifestyles do not change the fact that human existence has ultimately been destructive to the Earth and many of its non-human organisms. Voluntary human extinction is promoted on the grounds that it will prevent human suffering and the extinction of other species; Knight points out that many species are threatened by the increasing human population. James Ormrod, a psychologist who profiled the group in the journal Psychoanalysis, Culture & Society, notes that the \\"most fundamental belief\\" of VHEMT is that \\"human beings should stop reproducing\\", and that some people consider themselves members of the group but do not actually support human extinction. Knight, however, believes that even if humans become more environmentally friendly, they could still return to environmentally destructive lifestyles and hence should eliminate themselves. Residents of First World countries bear the most responsibility to change, according to Knight, as they consume the largest proportion of resources. Knight believes that Earth's non-human organisms have a higher overall value than humans and their accomplishments, such as art: \\"The plays of Shakespeare and the work of Einstein can't hold a candle to a tiger\\". He argues that species higher in the food chain are less important than lower species. His ideology is drawn in part from deep ecology, and he sometimes refers to the Earth as Gaia. He notes that human extinction is unavoidable, and that it is better to become extinct soon to avoid causing the extinction of other animals. The potential for evolution of other organisms is also cited as a benefit. Knight sees abstinence from reproduction as an altruistic choice – a way to prevent involuntary human suffering – and cites the deaths of children from preventable causes as an example of needless suffering. Knight claims that non-reproduction would eventually allow humans to lead idyllic lifestyles in an environment comparable to the Garden of Eden, and maintains that the last remaining humans would be proud of their accomplishment. Other benefits of ceasing human reproduction that he cites include the end of abortion, war, and starvation. Knight argues that \\"procreation today is de facto child abuse\\". He maintains that the standard of human life will worsen if resources are consumed by a growing population rather than spent solving existing issues. He speculates that if people ceased to reproduce, they would use their energy for other pursuits, and suggests adoption and foster care as outlets for people who desire children. VHEMT rejects government-mandated human population control programs in favor of voluntary population reduction, supporting only the use of birth control and willpower to prevent pregnancies. Knight states that coercive tactics are unlikely to permanently lower the human population, citing the fact that humanity has survived catastrophic wars, famines, and viruses. Though their newsletter's name recalls the suicide manual Final Exit, the idea of mass suicide is rejected, and they have adopted the slogan \\"May we live long and die out\\". A 1995 survey of VHEMT members found that a majority of them felt a strong moral obligation to protect the Earth, distrusted the ability of political processes to prevent harm to the environment, and were willing to surrender some of their rights for their cause. VHEMT members who strongly believed that \\"Civilization [is] headed for collapse\\" were most likely to embrace these views. However, VHEMT does not take any overt political stances. VHEMT promotes a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, a group that argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population to care for the Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. The 1995 survey found that 36% considered themselves members of Earth First! or had donated to the group in the previous five years.  Reception  Knight states his group's ideology runs counter to contemporary society's natalism. He believes this pressure has stopped many people from supporting, or even discussing, population control. He admits that his group is unlikely to succeed, but contends that attempting to reduce the Earth's population is the only moral option. Reception of Knight's idea in the mainstream media has been mixed. Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, Gregory Dicum states that there is an \\"undeniable logic\\" to VHEMT's arguments, but he doubts whether Knight's ideas can succeed, arguing that many people desire to have children and cannot be dissuaded. Stephen Jarvis echoes this skepticism in The Independent, noting that VHEMT faces great difficulty owing to the basic human reproductive drive. At The Guardians website, Guy Dammann applauds the movement's aim as \\"in many ways laudable\\", but argues that it is absurd to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction. Freelance writer Abby O'Reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success, VHEMT's goal is difficult to attain. Knight contends in response to these arguments that though sexual desire is natural, human desire for children is a product of enculturation. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has criticized Knight's platform, arguing that the existence of humanity is divinely ordained. Ormrod claims that Knight \\"arguably abandons deep ecology in favour of straightforward misanthropy\\". He notes that Knight's claim that the last humans in an extinction scenario would have an abundance of resources promotes his cause based on \\"benefits accruing to humans\\". Ormrod sees this type of argument as counter-intuitive, arguing that it borrows the language of \\"late- modern consumer societies\\". He faults Knight for what he sees as a failure to develop a consistent and unambiguous ideology. The Economist characterizes Knight's claim that voluntary human extinction is advisable due to limited resources as \\"Malthusian bosh\\". The paper further states that compassion for the planet does not necessarily require the pursuit of human extinction. Sociologist Frank Furedi also deems VHEMT to be a Malthusian group, classifying them as a type of environmental organization that \\"[thinks] the worst about the human species\\". Writing in Spiked, Josie Appleton argues that the group is indifferent to humanity, rather than \\"anti-human\\". Brian Bethune writes in Maclean's that Knight's logic is \\"as absurd as it's unassailable\\". However, he doubts Knight's claim that the last survivors of the human race would have pleasant lives and suspects that a \\"collective loss of the will to live\\" would prevail. In response to Knight's platform, journalist Sheldon Richman argues that humans are \\"active agents\\" and can change their behavior. He contends that people are capable of solving the problems facing Earth. Alan Weisman, author of The World Without Us, suggests a limit of one child per family as a preferable alternative to abstinence from reproduction. Katharine Mieszkowski of Salon.com recommends that childless people adopt VHEMT's arguments when facing \\"probing questions\\" about their childlessness. Writing in the Journal for Critical Animal Studies, Carmen Dell'Aversano notes that VHEMT seeks to renounce children as a symbol of perpetual human progress. She casts the movement as a form of \\"queer oppositional politics\\" because it rejects perpetual reproduction as a form of motivation. She argues that the movement seeks to come to a new definition of \\"civil order\\", as Lee Edelman suggested that queer theory should. Dell'Aversano believes that VHEMT fulfills Edelman's mandate because they embody the death drive rather than ideas that focus on the reproduction of the past. Although Knight's organization has been featured in a book titled Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief, The Guardian journalist Oliver Burkeman notes that in a phone conversation Knight seems \\"rather sane and self-deprecating\\". Weisman echoes this sentiment, characterizing Knight as \\"thoughtful, soft-spoken, articulate, and quite serious\\". Philosophers Steven Best and Douglas Kellner view VHEMT's stance as extreme, but they note that the movement formed in response to extreme stances found in \\"modern humanism\\".

He was also chair of the Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth, a fascist youth organisation in the protectorate. In World War I, Moravec served in the Austro-Hungarian Army, but following capture by the Russians he changed sides to join Russian-backed Serbian forces and then the Czechoslovak Legion, which went on to fight on the side of the White Army in the Russian Civil War. During the interwar period he commanded an infantry battalion in the Czechoslovak Army. As a proponent of democracy during the 1930s, Moravec was outspoken in his warnings about the expansionist plans of Germany under Adolf Hitler and appealed for armed action rather than capitulation to German demands for the Sudetenland. In the aftermath of the German occupation of the rump Czechoslovakia, he became an enthusiastic collaborator, realigning his political worldview towards fascism. He committed suicide in the final days of World War II. Unlike some other officials of the short-lived protectorate government, whose reputations were rehabilitated in whole or in part after the war, Moravec's good reputation did not survive his tenure in office and he has been widely derided as a \\"Czech Quisling\\". Early life and education Emanual Moravec was born in Prague, the son of a modest merchant family originally from Kutná Hora. He graduated from a vocational school and found employment as a clerk at a Prague company. At the outbreak of World War I, Moravec was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and dispatched with his unit to the Carpathian Front. Moravec was captured by the Imperial Russian Army in 1915 and held at a prisoner-of-war camp in Samarkand. He was subsequently paroled and given command of a machine-gun platoon in the First Serbian Volunteer Division; a unit consisting of former prisoners of war, including Serbs and other Slavs from the countries of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, fighting on the Russian side. In September 1916, following fierce action against Bulgarian forces along the Dobrudzha Front, Moravec was hospitalized with shell shock. Upon his release, he joined the Czechoslovak Legion, falsely claiming to hold an engineering degree to receive an officer's commission. The Czechoslovak Legion, a volunteer unit composed of diaspora Czechs and Slovaks as well as deserters from the Austro-Hungarian Army, had been formed in 1917 to support the Allies; it later became involved in the Russian Civil War, fighting on the side of the White Russians. Over the next two years, Moravec saw combat with the Legion in Russia. Career =First Czechoslovak Republic= Moravec returned to a newly independent Czechoslovakia at the end of World War I with the legionary rank of captain. He was accepted into Prague's War School and, upon graduation, commissioned as a major in the Czechoslovak Army. He ultimately came to command the 1st Field Battalion of the 21st Infantry Regiment in Znojmo. Simultaneous with his military career, Moravec contributed to newspapers and magazines, including Lidové noviny, on political and military matters. Writing under the pen name Stanislav Yester, he won the Baťa Prize for Journalism. In 1931 Moravec was appointed an instructor at the War School and promoted to colonel. In his writings, Moravec had become increasingly emphatic about the growing ambitions of Nazi Germany. He called for Czechoslovakia to form an alliance with Poland and Italy against what he saw as a rising German threat. Moravec came to be seen as one of Czechoslovakia's leading geopolitical strategists and caught the attention of President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. Moravec wrote the preface to a printed edition of one of Masaryk's addresses to the Czechoslovak Army. In it, he signaled his support for the creation of the democratic state of Czechoslovakia that had come out of World War I, as well as his personal loyalty to Masaryk: When Masaryk died in 1935, Moravec served as one of the pallbearers at his funeral. In 1938 Moravec warned that \\"if Czechoslovakia should fall, France would find herself politically on the European periphery\\". Moravec argued that the head of the Danube Basin was guarded by what he described as the \\"fortress of Bohemia\\" – the land barrier that marked the natural border between eastern and western Europe. If a state were to take Czechoslovakia it would, therefore, control the head of the Danube basin and be free to strike against either France or Poland with ease. Although Moravec was concerned with German political and military aims he generally rejected some of the more extreme aspects of anti-German thought, taking a cautiously receptive approach to Emanuel Rádl's thesis which posited the existence of an irrational Czech racism towards Germans. Munich Agreement In 1938 German demands for the Sudetenland came to a head. In September, General Jan Syrový, inspector-general of the Czechoslovak Army, was installed by President Edvard Beneš as prime minister. In response to the German ultimatum, Syrový declared that \\"further concessions from our side are no longer possible\\"; 42 Czechoslovak divisions were mobilized in preparation for an expected German invasion. By the end of September, with Czechoslovakia abandoned by France and Britain, and territorial demands piled on from Poland, Beneš backtracked on Czechoslovakia's refusal to accept further German requests. At this time, as well as holding his army post, Moravec was serving as a member of the Committee for the Defense of the Republic, a nationalist pressure group led by the son of the former Czechoslovak finance minister Alois Rašín. In that capacity he sought an audience with Beneš during the last week of September, on the eve of the Munich ratification. During a two-hour confrontation with Beneš, Moravec pleaded with the president to declare war against Germany, and not capitulate to German demands. His pleas went unheeded. =Second Czechoslovak Republic= The Munich Agreement left Moravec disillusioned with both Western democracies and Beneš' diplomatic competence. According to Moravec, \\"apostles without courage\\" had led Czechoslovakia to capitulation. He expressed anger at the government's evocation of national ideals in its announcement of the agreement, declaring that a state unwilling to defend its ideals should not boast of them in the same way \\"a whore has no right to boast of her honor\\". As a further expression of his contempt for the government, he mockingly requested leave to join the army of El Salvador. During the short- lived Second Czechoslovak Republic, with Prague actively seeking to appease Germany to avoid further territorial losses, Moravec was forced to quit teaching at the military academy. Moreover, he found himself prohibited by the government from writing for newspapers due to concerns that the incendiary, anti-German nature of his editorials would be unduly provocative. =Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia= An excerpt from a newsreel showing Moravec at the 1944 Week of Czech Youth in Prague. Excerpt from a radio broadcast by Emanuel Moravec Emanuel Moravec was the original target of what became known as Operation Anthropoid, but Reinhard Heydrich (pictured) was ultimately selected for assassination. On 16 March 1939, Germany occupied the rump Czechoslovak state and the German-controlled Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was declared. According to František Moravec, Emanuel Moravec attempted to leave the Czech lands prior to the German arrival and join the military cadre being sent abroad. His offer of service was rejected. Moravec was particularly concerned that his earlier denunciations of Germany, and his reputation as a strident anti-German polemicist, might make him a target of the new regime. He was surprised, therefore, when the new German authorities informed him he could resume writing books and newspaper columns. Moravec returned to writing with gusto and a reoriented editorial line, declaring \\"our nation could have died in war [with Germany]. Now the whole nation will die of fright and fear\\". Writing in V úloze mouřenína – Československá tragedie 1938, the most popular of his works, Moravec sought to more fully reconcile his support for the Germans with his earlier calls for resistance. He indicted Beneš and the intelligentsia for Czechoslovakia's defeat and declared it was the unwillingness of the elite to confront Germany militarily that demonstrated democracy's moral decay, thereby ultimately justifying its termination: In 1941 Moravec helped found the Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth, a fascist youth group, and served as its chairman. The following year, Reinhard Heydrich who, in his role as the Berlin-appointed Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia held penultimate day-to-day authority in the protectorate, compelled President Emil Hácha to appoint Moravec as the protectorate's education minister. Unlike other protectorate ministries, the education ministry under Moravec was given a measure of independence and not required to report to an overseer in the office of the Reich Protector. As with all protectorate ministers, Moravec's mandate to hold office was at the pleasure of the Reich Protector, as set-out in the 16 March 1939 decree of the German government. Policies and initiatives as Minister of Education By the time Moravec was given authority for the education ministry, Czech universities had been closed, school textbooks revised, and more than 1,000 student leaders deported to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In his new post as minister of education, Moravec instituted the study of German as a compulsory subject in schools, explaining that it would become a lingua franca of Europe: \\"[e]very Czech who desires to excel in the future must acquire the German language so that work opportunities in all fields are open to them not only in the Reich, but also in Europe and the whole world ... learn German in order that the Czechs' good reputation can spread way beyond the frontiers of Bohemia and Moravia\\". He also promoted the idea of Czech culture as an historic component of Germanic culture. The Czech Women's Center, originally founded during the Second Republic as a group of professional women seeking greater gender equality, operated under Moravec's auspices. It was at his suggestion that it became a leading advocate for nutritional education. Moravec did not limit himself to educational questions. In 1943 he advanced a proposal to deploy the Army of the Protectorate to the Eastern Front in support of German operations. Hácha discussed the proposal with Reich Minister for Bohemia and Moravia Karl Hermann Frank who ultimately decided not to forward it to Adolf Hitler. Moravec reportedly offered the noted Czech journalist Ferdinand Peroutka release from Buchenwald concentration camp in exchange for accepting a position writing for the newspaper Lidové noviny, an offer Peroutka declined. Anti-Semitism During his tenure as education minister, Moravec adopted an anti-Semitic worldview that largely mirrored that of the Nazi Party. It positioned Germany as fighting a war to save humanity from Judaism. Moravec publicly blamed Jews for pre-war tensions between the former Czechoslovakia and Germany. He claimed that \\"Jewish capitalist interests hitched themselves to Anglo-French strategic interests and, entirely artificially and cunningly, escalated Czech hatred of the German nation to a state of unbounded fury.\\" In (\\"Facts and Errors\\") Moravec declared that the annexation of the Czech lands to Germany would benefit Czechs \\"because the Jews have been excluded from the German nation, the agents of capitalism have been rendered powerless in Germany\\". Assassination target In the winter of 1939–40, the Czechoslovak resistance group known as the Three Kings attempted to kill Moravec with a letter bomb. The Czechoslovak government-in- exile also considered targeting Moravec for assassination, but decided to go after Heydrich instead in what became known as Operation Anthropoid. Following Heydrich's death, Moravec was a keynote speaker at several mass rallies throughout the Protectorate. These were intended to demonstrate the opposition of ordinary Czechs to Heydrich's killing. Death During the Prague Uprising of May 1945, Moravec attempted to drive to a radio station under German control in the hope of broadcasting an appeal for calm. When the vehicle he was traveling in ran out of fuel Moravec dismounted and shot himself in the head with a pistol, presumably to avoid capture. He died four days before the liberation of Prague. Personal life Moravec was a master Mason, a fact that earned him contempt from some in the pre-Protectorate Czech fascist community such as the Vlajka. Both Moravec and his private secretary, Franz Stuchlik, were keen rock collectors. After Moravec's death, his collection was confiscated by the Czechoslovak state and donated to the National Museum. As of 2015, 107 mineral samples from Moravec's private collection were still held by the museum. =Marriages= Moravec was married three times. His first wife, Helena Georgijevna Beka, whom he met while a prisoner of war in Samarkand, was a close relative of the prominent Bolshevik Alexei Rykov. With her he had two sons, Igor and Yuri. In 1932 he was divorced and, in April that year, married Pavla Szondy, who gave birth to Moravec's third son, Pavel. This marriage also ended in separation, Moravec and Szondy divorcing in 1938. In 1942 Moravec married Jolana Emmerová, his housemaid, who was only sixteen when their relationship caused the end of his previous marriage. =Children= Igor fought on the Eastern Front as a volunteer with the 3rd SS Panzer Division Totenkopf. His younger brother, Yuri, served in the Wehrmacht's 137th Infantry Division and unlike Igor was privately critical of his father's political views. While serving in France, Yuri was caught drunk on guard duty and sentenced to six months imprisonment and a one grade demotion. At the request of Emanuel Moravec, Frank personally appealed to OKW operations chief Alfred Jodl in the matter and the younger Moravec's sentence was quashed. Pavel was sent to school in Salzburg after the establishment of the Protectorate and died in an air raid in 1944. Igor was arrested and executed by hanging at the end of the war on charges of murder and treason. Yuri was arrested and sentenced to a prison term at the end of the war and upon release emigrated to West Germany. Legacy In the Czech television series České století, Moravec is portrayed by Daniel Landa (pictured). Denounced by the Allies and the Czech government-in-exile during World War II as a \\"Czech Quisling\\", Moravec has been described by John Laughland as \\"an enthusiastic collaborator\\" with Nazi Germany. This contrasts with other protectorate-era officials like Hácha, whom Laughland calls \\"a tragic figure\\", or Jaroslav Eminger, who was later completely exonerated for his service in the Protectorate government. During the 2006 presentation of the Gratias Agit Award, given annually by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs to recognize those who promote the Czech Republic, foreign minister Cyril Svoboda declared that \\"... we are also a country of those who have deformed our good name, people [such] as Emanuel Moravec, Klement Gottwald\\". Czech historian Jiří Pernes has argued that had Moravec died before March 1939 he would have been remembered as a well-regarded Bohemian patriot; his pre-war record was sufficiently distinguished to earn him a place in history. In 1997 Pernes published a biography of Moravec. He was later criticized for the volume which, it was alleged, was heavily plagiarized from a doctoral dissertation on Moravec's life written by Josef Vytlačil. In 2013, Daniel Landa portrayed Moravec in an episode of the Czech historical drama television series ' (Czech Century), titled \\"Den po Mnichovu (1938)\\" (\\"The Day after Munich\\"). The episode centres on Moravec' fierce opposition to president Beneš' capitulation to the invading German forces, ending with their face-to-face discussion. A mid-credits scene then reveals Moravec' later conversion to German fascism. The episode suggests an ambivalence between genuine and pathological national pride, also by casting Landa, himself a known and controversial nationalist. Publications * Moravec, Emanuel. (1936).

Glebova had previously been crowned Miss Universe Canada 2005. Early life and education Glebova was born in Tuapse, Russia to parents Vladimir Slezin and Anna Glebova. While in Russia, Vladimir worked as a radio communications specialist in the merchant marine industry, while Anna was a high school teacher. Glebova grew up as an only child. As a child, Glebova studied classical piano and competed in rhythmic gymnastics. At age 13, Glebova and her family left Russia and settled in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.Biography at HHB Life website After arriving in Canada, her parents found employment as software specialists. After graduating from high school, Glebova worked as a professional model in Toronto and received a Bachelor of Commerce in information technology management and marketing from Ryerson University. Prior to competing in pageantry, Glebova worked as a motivational speaker for elementary and high school students. Career =Pageantry= Miss Universe Canada In 2004, Glebova began her pageantry career while competing in Miss Universe Canada 2004, where she placed as the third runner- up behind eventual winner Venessa Fisher. Glebova returned the following year and won the Miss Universe Canada 2005 title. Miss Universe As Miss Universe Canada 2005, Glebova earned the right to represent Canada in the Miss Universe 2005 pageant, to be held in Bangkok, Thailand. Glebova became the fourth Canadian in ten years to advance to the semi-finals, eventually advancing to the top five along with Cynthia Olavarria of Puerto Rico, Laura Elizondo of Mexico, Renata Sone of Dominican Republic, and Monica Spear of Venezuela. Throughout the contest, Glebova gave a traditional Thai greeting known as a \\"Wai\\" on every appearance which helped her win over Thai audiences and judges. At the conclusion of the pageant, Glebova was crowned Miss Universe 2005 by outgoing titleholder Jennifer Hawkins of Australia. Glebova's win was Canada's second after Karen Dianne Baldwin had been crowned Miss Universe 1982. Glebova during the Miss Universe evening gown competition Glebova at an event in August 2005 As Miss Universe, Glebova traveled extensively and immersed herself in a campaign to increase awareness of HIV and AIDS, the ongoing platform of the Miss Universe titleholder. She attended the G8 Summit in New York City on 11 August 2005, which reflected on ending poverty in underdeveloped regions, and ending gang activity and drug cartels in Colombia. In November, Glebova attended a special Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, India, and was on a week-long tour of several Indian cities on an AIDS Awareness Program. In December, she attended the national pageants of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic before going back to Thailand to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the 2004 tsunami tragedy. During Glebova's official homecoming to her hometown of Toronto, the Miss Universe was formally offered an apology by the city's mayor David Miller after she was barred from attending a \\"Tastes of Thailand\\" festival while wearing her sash and tiara nor being introduced as a beauty titleholder. A 1990 bylaw, which prevents sexual stereotyping of women in public events, was strictly enforced and largely criticized by Miller and Miss Universe Organization president Paula Shugart. Shugart called the episode an \\"insult\\" to not only Glebova, but to the Thai government who named her an \\"honorary tourism ambassador\\". According to Shugart, this was the first time in Miss Universe's history that a titleholder was uninvited from a public event. The same bylaw was once invoked to bar Barenaked Ladies from a public concert at Nathan Phillips Square due to their name. During her reign, Glebova traveled to Africa in July to attend an AIDS Educational Tour with the Global Health Council, Malaysia in late September, the Bahamas and St. Martin. In late March 2006, Glebova visited Russia for the first time since leaving the country in her pre-teens. She participated in an HIV-AIDS Awareness campaign in Moscow and attended a Russian fashion show as a special guest. She also made numerous trips to Thailand, where she commemorated the anniversary of the tsunami and Canada, her home nation. She also attended the national pageants of Ukraine in mid October, Puerto Rico in November, Dominican Republic in December, Czech Republic in February, Thailand and Nicaragua in March, Brazil in April. She also crowned Alice Panikian as her Miss Universe Canada successor the night of March 21, 2006. Alice finished 6th in Miss Universe. Glebova was supposed to travel to Indonesia to crown Miss Indonesia Universe 2006 in late July, but because of Canada's travel ban to the Southeast Asian country, Glebova was officially replaced with Puerto Rico's Cynthia Olavarria, the First Runner-Up of Miss Universe 2005. Since the Miss Indonesia pageant's revival in 2000, this was the first time in which Miss Universe was unable to attend the coronation. On July 23, 2006 Glebova crowned Zuleyka Rivera of Puerto Rico as her successor in Los Angeles. =Post-pageantry= After finishing her reign as Miss Universe, Glebova continued appearing as a brand ambassador and in public roles. In May 2006, it was announced that Glebova, along with golfer Vijay Singh and pro tennis player Paradorn Srichaphan, would become a brand ambassador for Thailand-based beer brewers Singha Corp. owners of Boon Rawd Brewery. Glebova completed her 1-year contract with Singha in July 2007. In 2008, Glebova joined The Amazing Race Asia 3 and she partnered with Pailin Rungratanasunthorn. They represented Thailand and came in 8th place. In December 2012, it was announced that Glebova will compete in reality TV show \\"Dancing with the Stars Thailand\\". The first episode was aired on Channel 7 (Thailand) on January 8, 2013, at 10:30pm In May 2012, Glebova and French company Bel Perfumes based in Thailand released Glebova's first fragrance, Beauty Icon. Glebova also serves as an ambassador for Soi Dog Foundation, a non-profit organization aiding homeless street animals in Thailand. In June 2015, Glebova became an Ambassador for Year of the Gibbon for the IUCN SSC Primate Specialist Group - Section on Small Apes, to raise awareness for gibbon conservation. Glebova has a passion for wildlife conservation and recently launched a public awareness campaign about the impact of photo-prop tourism on gibbons Year of the Gibbon. In 2018, Glebova partnered with a California attorney and entrepreneur Dr. Patama Mokaves Dumas to start a program for high schools and universities called Empowered. The program's aim is to develop confidence and positive thinking of young people so they can happily achieve their life goals. They are teaching a course titled “Empowered YOU” at Bangkok University since 2018. Personal life In 2006, Glebova began dating Thai professional tennis player Paradorn Srichaphan, whom she met at the 2006 Thailand Open. They became engaged the following year, and married later in 2007 in Bangkok. The couple split up in early 2011. Glebova married Panamanian entrepreneur, founder of Travelbook, Inc. and Mister Panamá 2001 Dean Kelly in 2016. They have one daughter together, and reside in Bangkok, Thailand.

He was first launched aboard the STS-116 Space Shuttle mission on December 10, 2006, at 01:47 GMT, making him the first Swedish citizen in space. Married with three children, he was a Fellow at CERN and taught mathematics at the Royal Institute of Technology before being selected to join the European Astronaut Corps in 1992. He has participated in two Space Shuttle missions and five spacewalks, and is the first person outside of the United States or Russian space programs to participate in more than three spacewalks.  Early life and education  Fuglesang was born in Stockholm to a Swedish mother and a Norwegian father, who became a Swedish citizen shortly before Fuglesang's birth. Fuglesang graduated from the Bromma Gymnasium, Stockholm in 1975, earned a Master of Science degree in engineering physics from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), in Stockholm in 1981, and received a doctorate in experimental particle physics from Stockholm University in 1987. He became an associate professor (docent) of particle physics at Stockholm University in 1991. He married Elisabeth (Lisa) Fuglesang (née Walldie) in 1983, whom he met at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). They have three children. Fuglesang is a prominent member of the Swedish skeptics association Vetenskap och FolkbildningChrister Fuglesang talar ut, Folkvett, 2/2007 and identifies strongly with skeptics and atheists.Atlantseglaren från Bromma vill tänja gränsen mot rymden, Dagens Nyheter, December 10, 2006. In 2012, Fuglesang received the Royal Institute of Technology 2012 Alumni of the Year award.  Career  As a graduate student, Fuglesang worked at CERN in Geneva on the UA5 experiment, which studied proton–antiproton collisions. In 1988 he became a Fellow of CERN, where he worked on the CPLEAR experiment studying the subtle CP-violation of kaon particles. After a year he became a Senior Fellow and head of the particle identification subdetector. In November 1990, Fuglesang obtained a position at the Manne Siegbahn Institute of Physics, Stockholm, but remained stationed at CERN for another year working towards the new Large Hadron Collider project. Since 1990, when stationed in Sweden, Fuglesang taught mathematics at the Royal Institute of Technology. In May 1992, Fuglesang was selected to join the European Astronaut Corps of the European Space Agency (ESA) based at the European Astronaut Centre (EAC) in Cologne, Germany. In 1992 he attended an introductory training programme at EAC and a four-week training program at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (TsPK) in Star City, Russia, with a view to future ESA–Russian collaboration on the Mir Space Station. In July 1993, he completed the basic astronaut training course at EAC. In May 1993, Fuglesang and fellow ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter were selected for the Euromir 95 mission and commenced training at TsPK (Moscow) in preparation for their onboard engineer tasks, extra-vehicular activities (spacewalks) and operation of the Soyuz spacecraft. The Euromir 95 experiment training was organized and mainly carried out at EAC. On March 17, 1995, he was selected as a member of Crew 2, the backup crew for the Euromir 95 mission, joining Gennadi Manakov and Pavel Vinogradov. During the mission, which lasted 179 days, Fuglesang was the prime crew interface coordinator. From the Russian Mission Control Center (TsUP) in Korolyov, he was the main contact with ESA Astronaut, Thomas Reiter, on Mir, and acted as coordinator between Mir and the Euromir 95 Payloads Operations Control Center, located in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, and project management. Between March and June 1996, he underwent specialized training in TsPK on Soyuz operations for de-docking, atmospheric re-entry and landing. Christer Fuglesang participating in EVA on STS-116 In 1996, ESA selected Fuglesang to train as a Mission Specialist for NASA Space Shuttle missions. He joined the Mission Specialist Class at NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, in August 1996, and qualified for flight assignment as a Mission Specialist in April 1998. From May to October 1998, he resumed training at TsPK on Soyuz-TM spacecraft operations for de-docking, atmospheric re-entry and landing. He was awarded the Russian Soyuz Return Commander certificate, which qualifies him to command a three-person Soyuz capsule on its return from space. In October 1998, he returned to NASA and was assigned technical duties in the Station Operations System Branch of the NASA Astronaut Office, working on Russian Soyuz and Progress transfer vehicles. Later he worked as prime Increment Crew Support Astronaut for the second International Space Station expedition crew. Fuglesang also continued with some scientific work and was involved with the SilEye experiment which investigated light flashes in astronauts' eyes on Mir between 1995 and 1999. This work is continuing on the International Space Station (ISS) with the Alteino and ALTEA apparatuses. He has also initiated the DESIRE project to simulate and estimate the radiation environment inside ISS. Missions =STS-116= Fuglesang at work, floating through a hatch on Space Shuttle Discovery during flight on day two of Mission STS-116. Fuglesang's first spaceflight mission was as a Mission Specialist on STS-116 in 2006, an assembly and crew-rotation mission to the International Space Station. This flight was called the Celsius Mission by ESA in recognition of Anders Celsius, the Swedish 18th century astronomer who invented the Celsius temperature scale. Spacewalks during STS-116 Mission * First spacewalk with the primary task of Installation of the P5 truss segment performed together with Astronaut Robert Curbeam as EV1. * EV2 during second spacewalk which included first part of rewiring the power system of the ISS specifically channel 2 and 3. Also performed together with Astronaut Robert Curbeam as EV1. * An extra spacewalk (EVA4) attempting, successfully, to fix a problem when retracting a solar panel. Also performed together with Astronaut Robert Curbeam as EV1. EVA duration: 6h 38min. Total EVA time during STS-116: 18 hours and 15 minutes. 'Maximum Time Aloft' Fuglesang, once a Swedish national Frisbee champion, held the national title in \\"maximum time aloft\\" in 1978, and subsequently competed in the 1981 World Frisbee Championship. Fuglesang took one of his personal frisbees to the International Space Station. On Dec 15 in 2006, he set a new \\"world record\\" for Time Aloft by freefloating a spinning frisbee for 20 seconds in the microgravity environment of the ISS. It was done during a live broadcast interview with a space exhibition in Stockholm Sweden. The record attempt was recognised by the sports governing body, the World Flying Disc Federation, and the record was accepted. But since it was set \\"outside the earth's atmosphere\\" it was recorded as 'Galactic Record'. Fuglesang greeting Sweden, Norway and Europe from the launch pad.

In 2002 it won the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature and was nominated for the Hugo, World Fantasy, and Locus Fantasy Awards in 2002. The series that it began, World of the Five Gods, won the Hugo Award for Best Series in 2018. Both The Curse of Chalion and its sequel Paladin of Souls (2003) are set in the landlocked medieval kingdom of Chalion. The prequel The Hallowed Hunt (2005) takes place in the Weald to the south of Chalion and two to three hundred years earlier.  Plot summary  Cazaril was formerly a noble in the land of Chalion, but was betrayed and sold into slavery. He returns to a regional court where he is hired as tutor to Iselle (second in line for the throne of Chalion after her brother Teidez) and her handmaid Betriz, for whom he develops romantic feelings. Their mother Ista also lives with them, but is considered mad. He accompanies Teidez, Iselle and Betriz to the capital, where he encounters his betrayer Dondo, whose brother Martou is chancellor to the ailing monarch Orico. Orico spends much time in his menagerie, run by the exile Umegat. The corrupt Dondo spends time with Teidez, exposing the boy to various vices, and arranges a marriage to Iselle. In desperation, Cazaril calls on the Bastard (one of the five gods) for a miracle of death magic, accepting that if it succeeds in killing Dondo, his life will be claimed as well. Dondo dies, but Cazaril does not, finding himself gifted with second sight by the experience. With Umegat's help, he learns that the royal family of Chalion is under a generation-old curse, and that Orico is only sustained through the cleansing magic of the menagerie. He also finds that Dondo's soul and the Bastard's death demon are bound to his body in the form of a tumor, with the demon trying to bring about his death so it can return to the gods with the required two souls. Acting on misinformation from Dondo, Teidez destroys the menagerie and severely injures Umegat, but a wound he sustains in the process becomes infected and proves fatal. Orico collapses, leaving Iselle soon to assume the throne, but her power is constrained by Martou, who spreads rumors that she is unstable like her mother. Cazaril informs Iselle of the curse, and his belief that since Ista married into the curse, Iselle could marry out of it. She dispatches him in secret to arrange her marriage to the heir of Ibra, a neighbouring country. He speaks to Ista on the way, and learns of a prophecy that the curse can be broken by a man \\"willing to lay down his life three times for the House of Chalion.\\" Cazaril has done so once, but because of the demon, his next death must be final. Arriving in Ibra, he finds that he had previously met the heir Bergon, taking a severe beating meant for the boy while they both were slaves. Informing Bergon of the curse, they convince Bergon's father to agree to the marriage. They return to Chalion, fighting through an ambush set by Martou. Iselle has also escaped from Martou, and she and Bergon are married. However, instead of freeing Iselle from the curse, it spreads to Bergon. Martou and his men attack, trying to kill Bergon and recapture Iselle. Cazaril fights them off as long as he can, but is captured. Martou stabs him through the body, hitting Cazaril's tumor. The release of the demon takes with it the souls of Cazaril, Dondo, and Martou, and the Daughter (another of the five gods) saves Cazaril's soul, leaving the demon to carry off the others. With his soul expanded by accepting his third death (taking the beating for Bergon, invoking death magic for Iselle, and now fighting to hold off Martou), the Daughter uses Cazaril's soul as a window to reach into the physical world and cleanse the curse. She returns him to his body, invoking one last miracle to spare him from dying of fever from his wound. Iselle is crowned to rule Chalion, with Bergon as her consort and their children to inherit both lands. Cazaril is made chancellor, and he and Betriz are happily married. Allusions to actual history and geography The Curse of Chalion and other books in the World of the Five Gods series are set in a world loosely based on southern Europe during the time of the Reconquista, or Spanish Reconquest. The states of Chalion, Ibra, and Brajar are fictional equivalents of Castile and León, Aragon, and Portugal, respectively. In Bujold's worldMap of Chalion and Surroundings, these states are in the south and are subject to invaders from the north, the Roknari, who correspond to the Muslims during the Reconquest. Characters in The Curse of Chalion also have historical equivalents. Iselle of Chalion is based on Isabella I of Castile, Bergon of Ibra is based on Ferdinand II of Aragon, and their secret marriage reflects the secret betrothal of Isabella and Ferdinand. The character Teidez corresponds to Alfonso Prince of Asturias.  Reception  The book has received a number of reviews. It was nominated for the 2002 Hugo Award for Best Novel. The World of the Five Gods series won the Hugo Award for Best Series in 2018.

The punch line of this story is, \\"Roger Dodger, you old codger!\\" The story was passed along by servicemen in all branches of the military. Here is one version of the story set in the Pacific Theater of Operations of World War II: > :A squadron of Navy aircraft was returning to base after a wildly successful > mission.

ICUFR, November 2005 It is easy to see how the story can be adapted to different military branches and duties but still retain the essential ingredients: the successful war hero in the thick of the action and the overbearing officer concerned only with strict adherence to the regulations. Over several decades, the story faded into folklore, but the phrase \\"Roger Dodger\\" retains widespread recognition in the United States even though most people do not know what it really means or its origin. It is generally used in a flippant way, often in seeming mocking of police or military authority. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) officially defines the word \\"roger\\" to mean \\"I have received all of your transmission.\\" For example, a pilot would say \\"roger\\" in response to an advisory from Air Traffic Control. \\"Roger\\" is not currently the word for the letter \\"R\\" in most radio alphabets; \\"Romeo\\" is. However, in modern times, pilots must read back (repeat) Air Traffic Control clearances to verify they heard them correctly, but most instructions may be \\"rogered.\\" The word \\"roger\\" is still used in modern aviation radio communication, but the phrase \\"roger dodger\\" is not recognized by ICAO.

It is one of two remaining original historic covered bridges in the state, (the other being the Bunker Hill Covered Bridge in Claremont, North Carolina) and is designated as both a local and federal historic landmark. History The bridge was built in 1911 by J. J. Welch at a cost of $40.The N.C. Zoo Society web page says 1911; the fall 2003 edition of the Newsletter of the National Association for the Preservation of Covered Bridges says 1910; still other websites have a date of 1903 without a reference. It is a one-lane bridge, 54 feet in length. The bridge eventually became obsolete when it could no longer handle the increased traffic, but it remains as a tourist attraction located at 6925 Pisgah Covered Bridge Road, west of the community of Pisgah. The road now crosses a nearby two-lane concrete bridge built in the 1950s. Preservation Since 1998, the North Carolina Zoo Society has collaborated with the North Carolina Department of Transportation, the Piedmont Land Conservancy, and the Landtrust for Central North Carolina to maintain and refurbish the bridge. The bridge was washed away by a flood on August 9, 2003, but was rebuilt the next year using much of the original materials that were retrieved by local area volunteers. The restoration was able to salvage about 90 percent of the materials from the original structure. The bridge is assumed originally to have had a shingle roof; however, it was replaced with tin in the 1930s. In the restoration, the roof was shingled. There is now a gate on the road leading to the bridge, however, it is open to the public daily from dawn to dusk. The bridge appears to have been defaced by visitors, who have seen fit to scrawl graffiti, some of which is obscene and offensive, the length and breadth of the structure. Sightseeing There is a quarter-mile trail through the woods on site. The trail crosses footbridges and passes a baptismal pool, downstream from the bridge.

It is perhaps Porter's most popular contribution to the Great American Songbook and has been recorded by dozens of musicians. Fred Astaire introduced \\"Night and Day\\" on stage. His recording of the song with the Leo Reisman orchestra was a No. 1 hit, topping the charts of the day for ten weeks. He performed it again in the 1934 film version of the show, renamed The Gay Divorcee, and it became one of his signature songs. There are several accounts about the song's origin. One mentions that Porter was inspired by an Islamic prayer when he visited Morocco. Another account says he was inspired by the Moorish architecture of the Alcazar Hotel in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.. Others mention that he was inspired by a Mosaic of the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna, he had been visiting during a trip of his honeymoon in Italy. Annelise Freisenbruch, Caesars' Wives: Sex, Power, and Politics in the Roman Empire, New York: Free Press, 2010, p. 232. The song was so associated with Porter that when Hollywood filmed his life story in 1946, the movie was entitled Night and Day. In addition to the numerous covers that have followed its official release, this song has entered fully what could be described as the collective unconscious. Thereby, artists such as Hozier have hinted at this song. The Irish singer has thus alluded the song in his own song called \\"Almost\\" published through the release of his sophomore album, \\"Wasteland, Baby!\\". The lyrics being: \\"The drums that start off \\"Night And Day\\" \\" Song structure The construction of \\"Night and Day\\" is unusual for a hit song of the 1930s. Most popular tunes then featured 32-bar choruses, divided into four 8-bar sections, usually with an AABA musical structure, the B section representing the bridge. Porter's song, on the other hand, has a chorus of 48 bars, divided into six sections of eight bars—ABABCB—with section C representing the bridge. Harmonic structure \\"Night and Day\\" has unusual chord changes (the underlying harmony). The tune begins with a pedal (repeated) dominant with a major seventh chord built on the flattened sixth of the key, which then resolves to the dominant seventh in the next bar. If performed in the key of B, the first chord is therefore G major seventh, with an F (the major seventh above the harmonic root) in the melody, before resolving to F7 and eventually B maj7. This section repeats and is followed by a descending harmonic sequence starting with a -75 (half diminished seventh chord or Ø) built on the augmented fourth of the key, and descending by semitones—with changes in the chord quality—to the supertonic minor seventh, which forms the beginning of a more standard II-V-I progression. In B, this sequence begins with an EØ, followed by an E-7, D-7 and D dim, before resolving onto C-7 (the supertonic minor seventh) and cadencing onto B. The bridge is also unusual, with an immediate, fleeting and often (depending on the version) unprepared key change up a minor third, before an equally transient and unexpected return to the key centre. In B, the bridge begins with a D major seventh, then moves back to B with a B major seventh chord. This repeats, and is followed by a recapitulation of the second section outlined above. The vocal verse is also unusual in that most of the melody consists entirely of a single note repeated 35 times —the same dominant pedal, that begins the body of the song—with rather inconclusive and unusual harmonies underneath. Notable recordings *Frank Sinatra recorded the song at least five times, including with Axel Stordahl in his first solo session in 1942 and again with him in 1947, with Nelson Riddle in 1956 for A Swingin' Affair!, with Don Costa in 1961 for Sinatra and Strings, and a disco version with Joe Beck in 1977. When Harry James heard Sinatra sing this song, he signed him. Sinatra's 1942 version reaching the No. 16 spot in the U.S. *Bing Crosby recorded the song on February 11, 1944 and it appeared on the Billboard chart briefly in 1946 with a peak position of No. 21. In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the song can be heard in the scene where Clark Kent meets Bruce Wayne. *Jewish American cabaret singer Frances Faye recorded a cover of the song in 1952 for Capitol Records. The single was later released as part of the 1953 compilation album No Reservations. Seven years later, Faye recorded yet another version of \\"Night and Day\\" for her 1959 album Caught in the Act, where she notably altered some of the lyrics. http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biof1/faye01.html *Jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald recorded her jazz-inflected version of the song, with big band and strings, as part of her 1956 album Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book. *Jazz saxophonist Joe Henderson recorded a version of \\"Night and Day\\" on his 1966 album Inner Urge, along with McCoy Tyner (on piano), Bob Cranshaw (on bass) and Elvin Jones (on drums). *Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66 released the song as a bossa nova and jazz-influenced single from their 1967 album Equinox. It went to number eight on the US adult contemporary chart. *Jackie DeShannon released the song in her 10th album New Image in 1967. *The song was recorded by Ringo Starr in 1970 for his first solo album Sentimental Journey. *Everything but the Girl chose this song for their first single in 1983. It reached No. 92 in August 1982. *Irish rock band U2 recorded a version of the song that was featured on the Red Hot + Blue benefit compilation album to fight AIDS.

He is considered to have been one of the deadliest gunfighters in the Old West.  Early life  Bill Longley was born on Mill Creek in Austin County, Texas, the sixth of ten children of Campbell and Sarah Longley. His family moved when he was two years old and he was raised on a farm near Old Evergreen, Texas, in present-day Lincoln, Lee County, Texas, where he spent a large part of his childhood learning to shoot. He received an average education for the time. He was six feet (183 cm) tall with a thin build, jet black hair, and was just reaching adulthood when the American Civil War ended in 1865. By 1867, Texas was fully under the control of the Union due to the Reconstruction Act. The military acted in all capacities, including law enforcement, which caused considerable resentment throughout the state. Around this time, Longley dropped out of school and began living a wild life, drinking, and running in the company of others of a similar disposition. First murders in Texas In 1867 the Longley family farm was just one mile from the Camino Real, an old Spanish royal highway that joined San Antonio and Nacogdoches, Texas. In mid-December 1868, three former slaves named Green Evans, Pryer Evans, and the third known only as Ned, rode through Evergreen, intending evidently to visit friends further south. Longley, accompanied by a couple of friends, forced the three men at gunpoint into a dry creek bed. Green Evans panicked and spurred his horse to escape. Longley shot at him several times, killing him. Longley and his friends went through the dead man's pockets, as Pryer Evans and Ned rode away. Although given sole responsibility for the murder, Longley later claimed that he was not the only one shooting. Longley's account of this murder differs from that of his later killings, where he was more inclined to brag about shooting men than to try to divert blame to others. Some versions of Evan's killing claim he was a member of the Texas State Police; the TSP only existed from 1870 to 1873. Longley drifted around Texas for a time, and while gambling in saloons he became acquainted with noted gambler Phil Coe In 1869, Longley and his brother-in- law, John Wilson, embarked on a crime spree through southern Texas. Together they robbed settlers, and in one instance killed a freed slave named Paul Brice in Bastrop County, Texas, after which they stole his horses. They reportedly also killed a freed slave woman in Evergreen. In March 1870, a $1,000 reward for their capture was offered by the Union military authority. Longley later claimed that Wilson was killed by outlaws in 1870 in Brazos County, Texas, although conflicting evidence suggests he was actually killed in 1874 in Falls County, Texas. U.S. Cavalry career Longley left Texas and moved north to avoid the authorities and by May 1870, he had joined a gold- hunting party in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The gold mining party travelled into the Black Hills of South Dakota, but a treaty with the Sioux prohibited mining, and the party disbanded when intercepted by a U.S. cavalry unit. On June 22, 1870, Longley enlisted for a five-year commitment in the army, joining Company B of the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment. His unit was stationed at Camp Stambaugh. He deserted two weeks later, as he was unable to adapt to the strict lifestyle, but was captured and court-martialed. He was sentenced to two years hard labor, strapped to a ball and chain, and imprisoned at Camp Stambaugh. He was held for four months and then released to return to his unit. His marksmanship skills were noticed, and he was assigned to the regular hunting parties regularly leaving the post. He deserted again in May 1872. Return to Texas and further murders Longley's travels for the rest of 1872 are unknown, but by February 1873 he had returned to Texas, where he was accused of murdering another freedman in Bastrop County. Following that, he returned to live with his father's family in Bell County, Texas. In the summer of that year, Mason County Sheriff, J. J. Finney, arrested Longley for murder and took him to Austin to collect a reward. When the federal military reward was not forthcoming from state officials, however, Finney released Longley, possibly in exchange for a bribe from Longley's uncle, Alexander \\"Pres\\" Preston Longley, of California. On March 31, 1875, Longley killed his childhood friend, Wilson Anderson, with a shotgun. The murder was alleged to have been instigated by Longley's uncle, Caleb B. Longley, who had blamed Anderson for the death of his son, Cale, and urged Longley to take revenge. Longley then fled northward, accompanied by his brother, James Stockton Longley, who was later tried and acquitted of Anderson's murder. A new reward was posted for Longley's capture. Under increasing pressure from law enforcement, Longley fled from place to place and used several aliases to avoid arrest. He briefly found work on a cotton farm, but he was forced to run again in November 1875, after murdering a hunting buddy named George Thomas with whom he had had a fistfight. Longley committed another killing in Uvalde County, Texas in January 1876, when his attempted ambush of fellow outlaw, Lou Shroyer, turned into a gunfight. Shroyer shot Longley's horse out from under him, but Longley shot Shroyer dead. This is the only known case in Longley's career where one of his victims returned fire. Fleeing again, Longley went to east Texas and became a sharecropper for a preacher, William R. Lay. Stability eluded him again, however, when Longley became rivals with Lay's nephew for the affections of a young woman. Longley beat up his rival, was subsequently jailed, and escaped. Longley blamed Lay for his brief imprisonment. On June 13, 1876, Longley rode out to his landlord's farm, found him milking a cow, and murdered him with a shotgun. Lay was the last man known to have been killed by Longley. Longley next possibly went to Grayson County, Texas, where two of his friends, Jim and Dick Sanders, were in jail. Longley broke them out, and the trio escaped, disarming deputy Matt Shelton when he tried to arrest them. Longley fled to Louisiana. Approximately one year later, deputy Matt Shelton confirmed the encounter. Capture and execution Grave site of Bill Longley in Giddings City Cemetery On June 6, 1877, Longley was surrounded and arrested without incident by Nacogdoches County Sheriff Milt Mast and two deputies while he was residing in De Soto Parish, Louisiana under the alias \\"Bill Jackson.\\" He was returned to Texas, tried in the Lee County Court, and sentenced to hang for the murder of Wilson Anderson. His appeal was denied in March 1878. On October 11, 1878, Longley was executed by hanging in Giddings, Texas, only a few miles from his birthplace of Evergreen. His grave and a state historical marker are in the Giddings City Cemetery.  Legend, hoaxes, and tall tales  Longley claimed to have killed thirty-two people, mostly of African American heritage.Daily Globe article; Chronicling America: St. Paul, Minnesota; October 17, 1878, Image 2, column 7 =Death hoax= Years after the execution, Longley's father, Campbell, came forward in a press release stating that his son had not been executed, and the death had been faked. After confirming the location of Longley's grave site, an exhumation of the human remains was performed in 2000. They were taken to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D. C., where DNA tests were performed, along with a skull reconstruction. In June 2001, it was officially reported that the remains from the grave site were indeed those of Bill Longley.Note: One datum in support of this conclusion was that the grave contained a Catholic medallion (The Miraculous Medal, an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary) that Longley was reportedly wearing on the day he was hanged. Longley had converted to Catholicism shortly before his death, as reported by the Scientific American Frontiers episode entitled, \\"Dead Men's Tales\\". =Unverified claims= Numerous myths and legends have grown up about Longley that cannot be verified by any contemporary source. Many of these legends trace back to tall tales that Longley himself told while imprisoned in Giddings in 1877. Some of these stories are probably false, while others could be true but lack any contemporary corroborating evidence. Longley's lies appear to have been motivated partly by his desire to rival John Wesley Hardin's reputation as a killer. Longley was outraged when he found he was to be put to death, while Hardin had only been sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. The most clearly false story Longley told was of being captured and lynched in 1869 alongside one of Cullen Baker's outlaw gang, surviving when a lucky shot severed the rope he had been hanged from, and then joining Baker's riders. As Baker was dead and his band dispersed at the time Longley claimed this happened, the story cannot be true. There is no contemporaneous evidence to back claims that Longley murdered a black militiaman in Old Evergreen in 1866 for insulting his father, or that he shot eight black people in Lexington in 1867 to avenge the loss of a horse racing bet. Furthermore, Longley would have been 14 and 15 years old respectively at the time of the alleged incidents. True or false, the stories are consistent with Longley's well-established racist character; in his own words he \\"...was taught to believe it was right to kill sassy negroes...\\" Longley's account of killing a trail boss named Rector while en route to Wyoming in 1870 is similarly of unknown veracity. Weapons of choice Traditionally, Longley is said to have used a pair of Dance .44 revolvers; the Dance was a Texas-manufactured imitation of the Colt Dragoon.William Foster-Harris (2007), The Look of the Old West: A Fully Illustrated Guide, Skyhorse Publishing, Inc., , p. 61. However, he used a shotgun to kill both Wilson Anderson and William Lay, his only murders for which his weapon is definitely known. In popular culture Longley is a major character in The Pistoleer, a novel by James Carlos Blake (Berkley Books, NY, 1995). In 1954, the actor Douglas Kennedy played Longley in an episode of the syndicated western television series Stories of the Century. In 1958, Steve McQueen played Longley in Season 2, Episode 23 of Tales of Wells Fargo. Longley is the title character in The Texan, a television series starring Rory Calhoun which aired on CBS from 1958-1960, and portrayed Longley in an heroic role, a wanderer throughout the American West who assists those having trouble with the lawless element.Billy Hathorn, \\"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 110-112 Longley figures prominently in Louis L'Amour's 1959 novel The First Fast Draw, a highly fictionalized version of Cullen Baker's life. Texas singer/songwriter, Houston Marchman, wrote a song about Longley, Bill Longley, which is on his second CD Leavin' Dallas (1999). References Further reading *Bartholomew, Ed Ellsworth.

It features several glasshouses, the most notable of which is the Kibble Palace. The Gardens has a wide variety of temperate and tropical flora, a herb garden, a chronological bed with plants arranged according to their introduction to Scotland, the UK's national collection of tree ferns, and a world rose garden officially opened in 2003 by Princess Tomohito of Mikasa. The River Kelvin runs along the north side of the Gardens and continues through Kelvingrove Park, the Kelvin walkway providing an uninterrupted walking route between the two green spaces. The Botanic Gardens was awarded a Green Flag Award in 2011. History In 1817 about 8 acres (32,000 m2) of land were laid out at Sandyford, near Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, and run by the Royal Botanic Institution of Glasgow (founded by Thomas Hopkirk of Dalbeth and Prof James Jeffray Professor of Botany at Glasgow Universityhttps://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH1191&type;=P), and were intended to supply the University of Glasgow. William Hooker was regius professor of botany at Glasgow University, and contributed to the development of the Botanic Gardens before his appointment to the directorship of Kew Gardens in London.Encyclopædia Britannica, 1911 The Gardens moved to its current location in 1842. The gardens were originally used for concerts and other events, and in 1891 the gardens were incorporated into the Parks and Gardens of the City of Glasgow. The site was once served by a railway line, and Botanic Gardens Railway Station remains today in a derelict state as a remarkable example of a disused station. It is hidden behind some trees and a metal fence blocks access to the platforms. Kirklee railway station also lies just inside the gardens. Kibble Palace The Kibble Palace exterior. The Kibble Palace is a 19th-century wrought iron framed glasshouse, covering 2137 m2. Originally designed for John Kibble by architects James Boucher and James Cousland for his home at Coulport on Loch Long in the 1860s, the components were cast by Walter Macfarlane at his Saracen Foundry in Possilpark. Eventually brought up the River Clyde by barge to the Botanic Gardens, it was fully erected at its current location in 1873 by Boyd of Paisley. The building structure is of curved wrought iron and glass supported by cast iron beams resting on ornate columns, surmounted on masonry foundations. It was initially used as an exhibition and concert venue, before being used for growing plants from the 1880s. Benjamin Disraeli and William Ewart Gladstone were both installed as rectors of the University of Glasgow in the palace, in 1873 and 1879 respectively - its last use as a public events venue, before becoming wholly used for the cultivation of temperate plants. The main plant group is the collection of New Zealand and Australian tree ferns, some of which have lived here for 120 years and which now form the national tree fern collection. In the 1920s a statue was added in the palace to \\"King Robert of Sicily\\" a figure from the works of Longfellow. This is by the Scottish sculptor George Henry Paulin. In 2004 a £7 million restoration programme was initiated to repair corrosion of the ironwork. The restoration involved the complete dismantling of the Palace, and the removal of the parts to Shepley Engineers' Shafton Works, South Yorkshire for specialised repair and conservation. The plant collection was removed completely for the first time ever and the ironwork was rebuilt over a rearranged floorplan, giving the Palace a prolonged life. It re-opened to the public in November 2006. The building contains a large collection of orchids, carnivorous plants and tree ferns. =Sculptures in Kibble Palace= *King Robert of Sicily (a hero created by Wordsworth) by George Henry Paulin (1927) *Cain by Edwin Roscoe Mellins (1899) *Eve by Scipione Tadolini (c. 1870) *Ruth by Giovanni Ciniselli (1880) *The Sisters of Bethany by John Warrington Wood (about 1871) *The Elf by William Goscombe John (1899) *Stepping Stones by William Hamo Thornycroft (1878) *The Nubian Slave by Antonio Rossetti (c. 1880) File:Glasgow Botanic Gardens.

The resonator may contain a small amount of water giving the waterphone a vibrant ethereal sound that has appeared in movie soundtracks, record albums, and live performances. The instrument was invented, developed and manufactured by American Richard Waters (1935-2013). The waterphone was available in four sizes: the Standard (7\\" diameter), the Whaler (12\\" diameter), the Bass (14\\" diameter) and the MegaBass (16\\" diameter).https://www.waterphone.com/prices.php It is generally played in a seated position by a soloist and either bowed or drummed, played as a friction or struck idiophone, with movements to affect the water inside. This combines the resonant characteristics of the bowl and rods in combination with the movement of the water. The sound of the waterphone is often used to evoke mystery and suspense. A superball mallet has become the prime way of drumming the waterphone. The waterphone is a modern invention influenced by a Tibetan drum—encountered by the inventor in the early sixties—containing a small amount of water affecting its timbre.Journal SEAMUS: The Journal of the Society for Electro-Acoustic Music in the United States, Volume 17, 2005, p.41. It is also related to the nail violin, which also used a resonator and rods (nails), and is struck or bowed.Edward Heron-Allen/Hugh Dudinsoska Davies: Nail violin, Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 3 April 2008). Use Percussionist Alex Wong bowing a Standard waterphone The waterphone has been exhibited in museums and galleries and is the subject of several short documentaries including \\"Art Notes,\\" aired on public television in San Francisco, and \\"Celestial Wave,\\" a movie short. Over recent decades the waterphone has become popular with symphonies, touring bands, and recording studios. Contemporary classical composers who have written parts for waterphone in compositions include Sofia Gubaidulina,Jerry Goldsmith, John Mackey, Christopher Rouse, Colin Matthews, John Woolrich, Carson Cooman, Andi Spicer, Ludovico Einaudi, Andrew Carter, Bernie Krause of Beaver & Krause,and Todd Barton. The instrument has also been used prominently by rock musicians. Tom Waits is a waterphone collector and player as is Mickey Hart. Other users include Richard Barone (both solo and with The Bongos) and Alex Wong (when playing with Vienna Teng), and it can be heard in music by The Harmonica Pocket. Classical/rock crossover percussionist Tristan Fry of the fusion band Sky used a waterphone on the band's composition 'Meeheeco' (the original version is on 1981's Sky 3, although the instrument can be heard much more prominently on the live version from Sky Five Live). Canadian musician and composer, Robert Minden, has been composing for his collection of five vintage waterphones on many recordings since the mid-1980s. His ensemble, The Robert Minden Ensemble,\\"Robert Minden Duo\\", LostSound.com. Accessed August 16, 2014. formed with daughters Andrea and Dewi Minden and colleagues Carla Hallett and Nancy Walker in 1986, features the waterphone as a central instrument within their 'found object' orchestra. The waterphone is used to great effect in Howard Goodall's The Dreaming, a musical commissioned by The National Youth Music Theatre of Great Britain, based on Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Goodall uses its ethereal sounds to evoke the mystery of the woods. In Derek Bourgeois' Symphony No 59 - Percussion symphony, which requires 16 percussion players there is a very prominent part for Waterphone. The waterphone has been featured in the soundtracks to many movies, including Poltergeist, Let the Right One In (2008), The Matrix, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Dark Water, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, ALIENS, The Spirit, Female Perversion, as well as TV production 24.

An All-American quarterback for the Auburn Tigers, he won the Heisman Trophy in 1971 and then played six seasons in the National Football League (NFL) with the Atlanta Falcons and Washington Football Team. Sullivan was a head football coach at Samford University, a position he held from 2007 to 2014. He was previously the head football coach at Texas Christian University (TCU) from 1992 to 1997 and the offensive coordinator at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) from 1999 to 2006. Sullivan was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1991. College career Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Sullivan began his athletic career as a three-sport star at Birmingham's John Carroll Catholic High School. Although a talented baseball and basketball player, he chose to play football for Auburn University where he would become the starting quarterback in 1969 under the tutelage of head coach Ralph Jordan. Over the next three seasons, the tall and Sullivan would break school and NCAA records for passing while leading the team to a 26–7 record. In 1970, he led the NCAA in total offense with 2,856 yards and set an NCAA record for most yards per play with 8.57. In his career, he was responsible for 72 touchdowns (54 passing/18 rushing) to tie the NCAA record. In his senior season, Sullivan completed 162 passes on 281 attempts for 2,012 yards and 20 touchdowns. This performance was enough to edge out Ed Marinaro for the 1971 Heisman Trophy. Also an excellent student, Sullivan was named an Academic All-American and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in business administration in 1972. Sullivan finished his college career with 6,284 passing yards and 54 touchdowns, along with another 18 touchdowns on the ground. He was selected to play in the Senior Bowl, where he led the South to victory over the North and was given the game's Most Valuable Player award. Professional career After college, Sullivan had a six-season professional NFL football career. He was a second-round selection (40th overall pick) of the 1972 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons. Sullivan played with the Falcons from 1972 to 1976, and then the Washington Redskins in 1976 and 1977. He played in 30 games. In 1974, Sullivan started three games for the Atlanta Falcons, losing all three. He completed 48 of 105 passes and one touchdown. In 1975, he threw for 3 touchdowns, completing 28 of 70 passes. He continued his career with the Redskins in 1976. Sullivan left football to enter private business in Birmingham, where he worked in insurance and as a tire company executive. Coaching career Sullivan spent five seasons doing radio color commentary for Auburn football games before joining the staff at Auburn in 1986 as quarterbacks coach under head coach Pat Dye. He worked with Auburn quarterbacks Jeff Burger, Reggie Slack, and Stan White during his six years at Auburn. During his time as an assistant Auburn won, or shared, three Southeastern Conference championships and had a four-game winning streak against archrival Alabama. On January 2, 1992, Sullivan became the 27th head football coach of Texas Christian University, inheriting a probation-racked team. After two losing seasons, he led TCU to a 7–5 mark in 1994 to win a share of the Southwest Conference championship, the school's first SWC title since 1959. Following the 1994 season, prior to the Horned Frogs' appearance in the Independence Bowl versus Virginia, Sullivan agreed to become the head coach at Louisiana State University (LSU). However, LSU refused to pay the $400,000 buyout of Sullivan's TCU contract, and the Tigers hired Vanderbilt University coach Gerry DiNardo three days later. The next season produced another winning record of 6–5 before TCU joined the Western Athletic Conference in 1996 and fell once again on hard times. Losing seasons in 1996 and 1997 resulted in Sullivan's resignation in October 1997 with an overall record of 24–42–1. However, he is best known for having recruited LaDainian Tomlinson to play at TCU. In January 1999, Sullivan became the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach of UAB. He helped develop Darrell Hackney into the best quarterback in UAB history who was able to make it to the NFL as an undrafted free agent picked up by the Cleveland Browns. UAB's offense also featured wide receiver Roddy White, who later played for the Atlanta Falcons. After neck surgery in September 2003, Sullivan was diagnosed with throat cancer by Dr. William R. Carroll (squamous cell carcinoma) and began chemotherapy and radiation treatments in December. In April 2004, doctors told him he was clear of cancer, but he continued to be monitored for recurrence. Sullivan missed only one game coaching in the 2003 season due to treatment, but lost around 50 pounds over the course of his cancer treatment. On December 1, 2006, Sullivan was named head coach at Samford University, replacing Bill Gray. In 2008, the Bulldogs joined the Southern Conference and won the championship in 2013. He resigned after the 2014 season, his eighth season as coach. Personal life Sullivan was married to the former Jean Hicks of Birmingham and they had three children — Kim, and twins Kelly and Patrick, Jr.  Death  Pat Sullivan died on December 1, 2019 after a long battle with cancer. On January 1, 2020, Auburn players wore \\"7\\" decals on the left side of their helmets during the Outback Bowl to commemorate Sullivan. Honors and awards Sullivan was selected to the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame, class of 1981. In 1988, he was also a charter member of the Senior Bowl Hall of Fame. The football field house at Samford University was renamed in his honor. * Heisman Trophy, 1971 * Chic Harley Award * Sammy Baugh Trophy, 1970 * Walter Camp Award, 1971 * SN Player of the Year, 1971 * All-American, 1970, 1971 (unanimous) * SEC Player of the Year, 1970 * SEC Back of the Year-Birmingham Touchdown Club, 1970 * SEC Back of the Year-Atlanta Touchdown Club, 1970 * Gator Bowl Most Valuable Player, 1970 * Sugar Bowl Most Valuable Player, 1971 * Senior Bowl Most Valuable Player, 1972 * College All-Star Game Most Valuable Player, 1972 * Alabama Sports Hall of Fame * National Football Foundation Hall of Fame * Sugar Bowl Hall of Fame * Gator Bowl Hall of Fame * Senior Bowl Hall of Fame * College Football Hall of Fame, 1991 * Southwest Conference Coach of the Year, 1994 * Southern Conference Co-Coach of the Year, 2012 Head coaching record See also * List of NCAA major college football yearly total offense leaders References External links  * Category:1950 births Category:2019 deaths Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Atlanta Falcons players Category:Auburn Tigers football broadcasters Category:Auburn Tigers football coaches Category:Auburn Tigers football players Category:Burials at Elmwood Cemetery (Birmingham, Alabama) Category:Samford Bulldogs football coaches Category:TCU Horned Frogs football coaches Category:UAB Blazers football coaches Category:All-American college football players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Heisman Trophy winners Category:Sportspeople from Birmingham, Alabama Category:Players of American football from Alabama ","title":"Pat Sullivan (American football)"},{"id":"1966205","text":"Phosphorous acid, is the compound described by the formula H3PO3. This acid is diprotic (readily ionizes two protons), not triprotic as might be suggested by this formula. Phosphorous acid is an intermediate in the preparation of other phosphorus compounds. Organic derivatives of phosphorous acid, compounds with the formula RPO3H2, are called phosphonic acids. Nomenclature and tautomerism left H3PO3 is more clearly described with the structural formula HPO(OH)2. In the solid state, HP(O)(OH)2 is tetrahedral with one shorter P=O bond of 148 pm and two longer P–O(H) bonds of 154 pm. This species exists in equilibrium with an extremely minor tautomer P(OH)3. IUPAC recommends that the latter be called phosphorous acid, whereas the dihydroxy form is called phosphonic acid.. Only the reduced phosphorus compounds are spelled with an \\"ous\\" ending. Other important oxyacids of phosphorus are phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2). The reduced phosphorus acids are subject to similar tautomerism involving shifts of H between O and P. Preparation HPO(OH)2 is the product of the hydrolysis of its acid anhydride: :P4O6 \\\\+ 6 H2O → 4 HPO(OH)2 (An analogous relationship connects H3PO4 and P4O10). On an industrial scale, the acid is prepared by hydrolysis of phosphorus trichloride with water or steam:. :PCl3 \\\\+ 3 H2O → HPO(OH)2 \\\\+ 3 HCl Reactions =Acid–base properties= Phosphorous acid has a pKa in the range 1.26–1.3. :HP(O)(OH)2 → HP(O)2(OH)− \\\\+ H+ pKa = 1.3 It is a diprotic acid, the hydrogenphosphite ion, HP(O)2(OH)− is a weak acid: :HP(O)2(OH)− → + H+ pKa = 6.7 The conjugate base HP(O)2(OH)− is called hydrogen phosphite, and the second conjugate base, , is the phosphite ion. (Note that the IUPAC recommendations are hydrogen phosphonate and phosphonate respectively). The hydrogen atom bonded directly to the phosphorus atom is not readily ionizable. Chemistry examinations often test students' appreciation of the fact that not all three hydrogen atoms are acidic under aqueous conditions, in contrast with H3PO4. =Redox properties= On heating at 200 °C, phosphorous acid disproportionates to phosphoric acid and phosphine: :4 H3PO3 → 3 H3PO4 \\\\+ PH3 This reaction is used for laboratory-scale preparations of PH3. Phosphorous acid slowly oxidizes in air to phosphoric acid. Both phosphorous acid and its deprotonated forms are good reducing agents, although not necessarily quick to react. They are oxidized to phosphoric acid or its salts. It reduces solutions of noble metal cations to the metals.

Examples include Mo(CO)5(P(OH)3) and [Ru(NH3)4(H2O)(P(OH)3)]2+. Structure of Mo(CO)5P(OH)3. Uses The most important use of phosphorous acid (phosphonic acid) is the production of basic lead phosphite, which is a stabilizer in PVC and related chlorinated polymers. It Used in the production of basic lead phosphonate PVC stabilizer, aminomethylene phosphonic acid and hydroxyethane diphosphonic acid. Also used as a strong reducing agent and in the production of raw materials of phosphorous acid, synthetic fibres and organophosphorus pesticides etc. It used in the production of high efficient water treatment agent amino trimethylene phosphonic acid. Ferrous materials, including steel, may be somewhat protected by promoting oxidation (\\"rust\\") and then converting the oxidation to a metalophosphate by using phosphoric acid and further protected by surface coating. (See: Passivation (chemistry)). Organic derivatives The IUPAC (mostly organic) name is phosphonic acid. This nomenclature is commonly reserved for substituted derivatives, that is, organic group bonded to phosphorus, not simply an ester. For example, (CH3)PO(OH)2 is \\"methylphosphonic acid\\", which may of course form \\"methylphosphonate\\" esters.

In 1983, she and her husband created a nutrition, fitness, and weight loss program in Australia and began offering the program in the United States in 1985. The company became a part of Nestlé Nutrition in 2006.Nestle Says Jenny Craig Weight-Loss Sales Slowing (Update1) Philanthropy Jenny and Sid Craig, founders of the company Craig is involved in a number of philanthropic causes including the San Diego Hospice, Easter Seals, United Way/CHAD, the Susan G.

In 1992, Craig and her husband committed $10 million to Fresno State University for its School of Business and Administrative Services, later renamed the Sid Craig School of Business. In 1996, the couple committed another $10 million to the University of San Diego, $7 million of which was used to build the Jenny Craig Pavilion, a recreation and sports pavilion that was dedicated in October 2000. Horse racing In 1995, Craig and her husband bought a thoroughbred horse ranch and breeding operation in Rancho Santa Fe, California formerly owned by sportsman Gene Klein. This area is home to the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club. Craig has been involved in racing and she and her husband have owned a number of successful thoroughbreds. One of their colts, Dr. Devious, finished seventh in the 1992 Kentucky Derby and also raced in England, where he won the 1992 Epsom Derby. That same year, their future National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame filly Paseana won the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Gulfstream Park. In 2003, their horse Candy Ride won six races in a row including the Grade I Pacific Classic Stakes in which he set a new Del Mar track record for one and a quarter miles. Another Craig owned horse, Sidney's Candy, named after Sid Craig, ran in the 2010 Kentucky Derby.Jenny Craig's Horse Racing in the Kentucky Derby Health issues In April 1995, while reposing in a favorite armchair and napping, she was startled awake, which caused a strange medical anomaly that mimicked lockjaw but was not, as Craig was eventually able to pry her mouth open. Though there seemed to be no imminent threat, Craig's condition gradually worsened making it difficult for her to speak and eat. Her dentist diagnosed temporomandibular joint syndrome, for which she was referred to a specialist, though to little avail. She was, in turn, referred to a series of physicians (reportedly 18) all of whom provided various suggestions but ultimately no solution. In the spring of 1998, she was introduced to Dr. Dennis M. Nigro, typically a cosmetic surgeon, who assessed that Craig had suffered atrophying of her mouth muscles. Corrective surgery was provided by installing bioabsorbable screws into her cheeks. She underwent a four-and-a-half-hour operation and another year of speech therapy. Craig has since fully recovered from the debilitating condition.

It provides a repository of tuples that can be accessed concurrently. As an illustrative example, consider that there are a group of processors that produce pieces of data and a group of processors that use the data. Producers post their data as tuples in the space, and the consumers then retrieve data from the space that match a certain pattern. This is also known as the blackboard metaphor. Tuple space may be thought as a form of distributed shared memory. Tuple spaces were the theoretical underpinning of the Linda language developed by David Gelernter and Nicholas Carriero at Yale University in 1986. Implementations of tuple spaces have also been developed for Java (JavaSpaces), Lisp, Lua, Prolog, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, Tcl, and the .NET framework. Object Spaces Object Spaces is a paradigm for development of distributed computing applications. It is characterized by the existence of logical entities, called Object Spaces. All the participants of the distributed application share an Object Space. A provider of a service encapsulates the service as an Object, and puts it in the Object Space. Clients of a service then access the Object Space, find out which object provides the needed service, and have the request serviced by the object. Object Spaces, as a computing paradigm, was put forward in the 1980s by David Gelernter at Yale University. Gelernter developed a language called Linda to support the concept of global object coordination. Object Space can be thought of as a virtual repository, shared amongst providers and accessors of network services, which are themselves abstracted as objects. Processes communicate among each other using these shared objects  by updating the state of the objects as and when needed. An object, when deposited into a space, needs to be registered with an Object Directory in the Object Space. Any processes can then identify the object from the Object Directory, using properties lookup, where the property specifying the criteria for the lookup of the object is its name or some other property which uniquely identifies it. A process may choose to wait for an object to be placed in the Object Space, if the needed object is not already present. Objects, when deposited in an Object Space are passive, i.e., their methods cannot be invoked while the objects are in the Object Space. Instead, the accessing process must retrieve it from the Object Space into its local memory, use the service provided by the object, update the state of the object and place it back into the Object Space. This paradigm inherently provides mutual exclusion. Because once an object is accessed, it has to be removed from the Object Space, and is placed back only after it has been released. This means that no other process can access an object while it is being used by one process, thereby ensuring mutual exclusion. JavaSpaces JavaSpaces is a service specification providing a distributed object exchange and coordination mechanism (which may or may not be persistent) for Java objects. It is used to store the distributed system state and implement distributed algorithms. In a JavaSpace, all communication partners (peers) communicate and coordinate by sharing state. JavaSpaces can be used to achieve scalability through parallel processing, it can also be used to provide reliable storage of objects through distributed replication, although this won't survive a total power failure like a disk; it is regarded by many to be reliable as long as the power is reliable. Distribution can also be to remote locations; however, this is rare as JavaSpaces are usually used for low-latency, high-performance applications rather than reliable object caching. The most common software pattern used in JavaSpaces is the Master- Worker pattern. The Master hands out units of work to the \\"space\\", and these are read, processed and written back to the space by the workers. In a typical environment there are several \\"spaces\\", several masters and many workers; the workers are usually designed to be generic, i.e. they can take any unit of work from the space and process the task. JavaSpaces is part of the Java Jini technology, which on its own has not been a commercial success.Lee Gomes: \\"Sun Microsystems' Predictions For Jxta System Sound Familiar\\". The Wall Street Journal, June 4th 2001 The technology has found and kept new users over the years and some vendors are offering JavaSpaces-based products. JavaSpaces remains a niche technology mostly used in the financial services and telco industries where it continues to maintain a faithful following. The announcement of Jini/JavaSpaces created quite some hype although Sun co- founder and chief Jini architect Bill Joy put it straight that this distributed systems dream will take \\"a quantum leap in thinking\\".Rob Guth: \\"More than just another pretty name: Sun's Jini opens up a new world of distributed computer systems\\". SunWorld, August 1998 [15 January 2006] =Example usage= The following example shows an application made using JavaSpaces. First, an object to be shared in the Object Space is made. Such an object is called an Entry in JavaSpace terminology. Here, the Entry is used to encapsulate a service which returns a Hello World! string, and keeps track of how many times it was used. The server which provides this service will create an Object Space, or JavaSpace. The Entry is then written into the JavaSpace. The client reads the entry from the JavaSpace and invokes its method to access the service, updating its usage count by doing so. The updated Entry is written back to the JavaSpace. // An Entry class public class SpaceEntry implements Entry { public final String message = \\"Hello World!\\"; public Integer count = 0; public String service() { ++count; return message; } public String toString() { return \\"Count: \\" + count; } } // Hello World! server public class Server { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { SpaceEntry entry = new SpaceEntry(); // Create the Entry object JavaSpace space = (JavaSpace)space(); // Create an Object Space // Register and write the Entry into the Space space.write(entry, null, Lease.FOREVER); // Pause for 10 seconds and then retrieve the Entry and check its state. Thread.sleep(10 * 1000); SpaceEntry e = space.read(entry, null, Long.MAX_VALUE); System.out.println(e); } } // Client public class Client { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { JavaSpace space = (JavaSpace) space(); SpaceEntry e = space.take(new SpaceEntry(), null, Long.MAX_VALUE); System.out.println(e.service()); space.write(e, null, Lease.FOREVER); } } =Books= * Eric Freeman, Susanne Hupfer, Ken Arnold: JavaSpaces Principles, Patterns, and Practice.

He was appointed to that office in 1960, when Niger gained independence. Although corruption was a common feature of his administration, he gained international respect for his role as a spokesman for African affairs and as a popular arbitrator in conflicts. His rule ended with a coup in 1974.  Youth  Born in Soudouré, near the capital, Niamey, Diori was the son of a public health officer in the French colonial administration. He attended William Ponty Teachers' Training College in Dakar, Senegal, and worked as a teacher in Niger from 1936 to 1938, then became a Hausa and Djerma foreign language instructor at the Institute of Study Abroad, in Paris. Independence struggle In 1946, while working as the headmaster of a school in Niger’s capital city of Niamey, he became one of the founders of the Nigerien Progressive Party (PPN), a regional branch of the African Democratic Rally (RDA). Later that year, he was elected to the French National Assembly. In the 1951 election, Diori was defeated by his cousin and political rival Djibo Bakary. He was again elected to the assembly in 1956, and was chosen deputy-speaker. In 1958, after a referendum that granted Niger self- government, Diori became president of the provisional government. He then became Prime Minister of the republic in 1959. During this period, the French government banned all political parties except the PPN, effectively making Niger a one-party state. Traditionalist coalition Niger gained independence from France on 3 August 1960 and Diori was elected president by the country's national assembly in November 1960. Organizing a powerful coalition of Hausa, Fula, and (most prominently) Djerma leaders, including chiefs and traditionalists, in support of Niger’s independence referendum, Diori gained French favor. First president Soon after independence, Diori made the PPN to be the only legally permitted party. His government favored the maintenance of traditional social structures and the retention of close economic ties with France. From the early 1960s, he ruled through a small number of pre-independence figures who sat on the PPN Politburo and largely bypassed even the cabinet. In addition to being both president of the republic and president of the PPN, Diori directly led a number of Ministries. From 1960 to 1963 he served as his own defence minister and foreign minister, and again took over the Foreign Ministry from 1965 to 1967. Most prominent, and perhaps most powerful, among Diori's advisers was writer and President of the National Assembly of Niger, Boubou Hama, who one writer has called the \\"eminence grise\\" behind Diori's rule. The National Assembly of Niger met in largely ceremonial yearly sittings to ratify government positions. Traditional notables, elected as parliamentary representatives, often unanimously endorsed government proposals. As president of the PPN, Diori was the only candidate for president of the republic, and as such was re-elected unopposed in 1965 and 1970. He gained worldwide respect for his role as a spokesman for African affairs and as a popular arbitrator in conflicts involving other African nations. Domestically, however, his administration was rife with corruption, and the government was unable to implement much-needed reforms or to alleviate the widespread famine brought on by the Sahelian drought of the early 1970s. Increasingly criticized at home for his negligence in domestic matters, Diori put down a coup in December 1963, which occurred concurrently with a border dispute with the Republic of Dahomey. He also narrowly escaped assassination in 1965. Faced with an attempted military coup and attacks by members of Sawaba, he used French advisers and troops to strengthen his rule. Close links with France lead to student and union protests against what they described as \\"French neocolonialism\\". However, his relationship with France suffered when his government voiced dissatisfaction with the level of investment in uranium production when Georges Pompidou visited Niger in 1972. Unrest and fall Widespread civil disorder followed allegations that some government ministers were misappropriating stocks of food aid and accused Diori of consolidating power. Diori limited cabinet appointments to fellow Djerma, family members, and close friends. In addition, he acquired new powers by declaring himself the minister of foreign and defense affairs. On 15 April 1974, Lieutenant colonel Seyni Kountché led a military coup that ended Diori's rule. He was imprisoned for six years. After his release in 1980, he remained under house arrest until 1987. After being released from house arrest, he moved to Morocco, where he died on 23 April 1989 at the age of 72.

With the aid of Francesco Sforza they held out against the forces of the Republic of Venice, but after a betrayal Sforza defected and captured Milan to become Duke himself, abolishing the Republic. History =Foundation= When Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, died on 13 August 1447, the city was thrown into confusion by his unexpected demise and the speed with which claimants to his title acted. Filippo Maria had no heir through male bloodlines, but the day before his death he had written a will bequeathing the Duchy to Alfonso V of Aragon. Among the other claimants were Charles, Duke of Orléans, nephew of Filippo Maria through his half-sister Valentina Visconti; Filippo's cousins Albert and Sigismund of the House of Habsburg, great-grandsons of Bernabò Visconti; and Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, who declared that the Duchy reverted to the Holy Roman Empire on the extinction of its male heirs. The two most prominent candidates supported by the Milanese population were however Alfonso of Aragon and Francesco Sforza, the Duke's son-in-law by marriage to his illegitimate daughter, Bianca Maria Visconti. The Bracceschi family, supporters of the King of Aragon, seized the Castello on the night of the 13th, almost before Filippo Maria died, forcing the captains to swear allegiance to Alfonso. Despite the general support for either Alfonso or Sforza, other influential citizens believed that the old republic could be restored. Learned bodies, such as the College of Jurisprudence in Pavia, painted the days of the old republic as a golden age. The merchants, seeing the prosperity of Republican Venice, supported this idea. On the morning of the 14th, Republicans stirred the populace to rise against the Bracceschi, under the leadership of Antonio Trivulzio (seniore), Giorgio Lampugnano, Innocenzo Cotta, and Teodoro Bossi, members of the College of Jurisprudence., entry for 14 August 1447 A republic was declared behind the Palace of the Commune, and the captains abandoned their oaths to Alfonso in favor of it. The Bracceschi were driven from Milan, and the new republic was called the Golden Ambrosian Republic, after St. Ambrose,Flag Recorded in: A. Ziggioto, \\"Della bandiera crociata\\", 1997 – \\"La provincia di Milano e i suoi Comuni. Gli stemmi e la storia, 2003\\" the 4th century bishop of Milan, who was adopted as the Republic's patron. They took the old constitution and revised it that same day to suit their needs, electing twenty-four Capitani e difensori della libertà, or \\"Captains and Defenders of Liberty,\\" to frame laws, elected regularly and later reduced to twelve., entry for 18 August 1447 =Early existence= Francesco SforzaThe idea of a radical renewal of liberties in the cities did not suit the powers of North Italy, who had been in league against Visconti territorial gains in a decades-long series of wars interrupted by truces, most recently the Peace of Cremona of 20 November 1441. Venice was already at war with Milan, and the Republic was struck a sore blow as previously Milanese cities including Pavia, Lodi, and Piacenza defected or declared their independence. Besides the loss of support and defensive locations, the drop in revenue also caused a brief financial crisis resolved by the imposition of new taxes. Venice, now occupying Lodi and Piacenza, refused to listen to Milan's pleas for peace. Milan turned to Francesco Sforza, the greatest military leader of his day, offering him the position of Captain-General and the city of Brescia. Although he wished – and indeed, planned – to succeed his father- in-law as Duke, he decided to accept the position and promised rewards. A draft was declared in Milan on 13 September. Sforza quickly captured independent Pavia when his mother-in-law persuaded the city's ruling condotierro to relinquish it to him, and the Republic grudgingly allowed him to keep it with the title of Count, fearing that the Pavians and their large arsenal might instead offer themselves to Venice if they refused. Sforza promised the Pavians no new taxes, respect for the old laws, payment for the officials he retained, and the repair of the city bridges and walls. He kept these promises faithfully and so won over the people of Pavia, establishing his rule. Pavia was previously almost a second capital to Milan, and gave Sforza his own seat of power. The city was also in a strategic location on the Po River, situated where it could block the Venetians from coming to the relief of the beleaguered Piacenza by water. Returning to the siege of Piacenza and finding the city not likely to crumble by starvation, he resolved to storm it. Employing cannon in an almost unheard-of manner, he opened up a breach in Piacenza's walls and sacked the city. The news of Piacenza's sack was greeted by three days' rejoicing in Milan. Meanwhile, Milanese Captain Bartolomeo Colleoni captured Tortona which had previously proclaimed Sforza as its lord, stealing it from the now dangerously powerful Sforza. This caused even greater rejoicing, for the Milanese feared Sforza. In January 1448, the terms of the previous Captains and Defenders ended, and in the following election the Guelphs rose to political prominence. Being especially adverse to Sforza, they entered peace negotiations with Venice, which, also threatened by Sforza's growing power, was willing to come to terms, albeit dictated by herself. Two of the Ghibellines who helped to found the Republic, namely Lampugnano and Bossi, stirred the populace against the Guelphs in a massive demonstration before the Court of Arengo. The Council of Nine Hundred was forced to abandon its plans for peace, and Sforza was given the go-ahead for his next campaign to seize the Adda River. However Sforza's plans were voted down by the Republic in favor of more traditional tactics, namely besieging Lodi directly. While this happened, the Venetian fleet under Andrea Quirini assaulted the bridge of Cremona. However, Sforza's wife Bianca was there, and led the defense until her husband relieved the city. The Venetian fleet withdrew and entrenched while it waited for the arrival of the Venetian army. Sforza trapped the fleet behind its defenses and, with his unorthodox use of artillery, utterly destroyed or captured every one of the seventy ships. This victory was celebrated in Milan, but the leaders of the Republic still feared Sforza, and sent him off to occupy himself with the Ghiarad'adda region while Lodi and Caravaggio were besieged, hoping that their fall would end the war. Ultimately both Sforza's Milanese forces and the Venetian army under Micheletto Attendolo met at Caravaggio. The siege remained unbroken throughout July and until 15 September, when Attendolo launched a surprise-attack on Sforza, so rapidly that he did not even have time to buckle on his armor. What might have been a rout Sforza turned into a great victory as he set the example for his troops on the front line and utterly defeated the Venetian army, capturing three generals., entry for 15 September 1448 Caravaggio fell, and despite rejoicing in Milan, little gratitude was given by the government to the architect of the victory, and the Republic sent him on to Lodi, determined to end the war. It was here, when a satisfactory end to the war seemed imminent, that the Milanese took a fatal misstep. =Sforza's defection and the Guelph–Ghibelline feud= In Milan, Sforza's enemies worked continually against him. The Piccinino brothers, sons of famous condottiere Niccolò Piccinino and former Captains-General before being replaced as supreme military commanders by Sforza, convinced the suspicious Republic to work secretly against Sforza. Rumors were spread among the troops about not receiving payment at the end of the war if they remained with Sforza, and Sforza himself was ordered back from the siege of Brescia, the city promised to him, while the citizens were secretly told to hold out until peace, already in the works, was signed. Sforza learned of this treachery and defected to the Venetians for 13,000 ducats and the Duchy of Milan in return for the Ghiaradadda, Crema, and his service. The treaty was signed on 18 October 1448,, entry for 18 October 1448 and Sforza now undid everything he had labored for over the past year. With such a powerful man on the Venetian side, it was the beginning of the end of the Golden Ambrosian Republic. Public opinion, despite the government's position, was generally pro-Sforza, and only an impassioned, patriotic speech from Giorgio Lampugnano subdued it at last. The Piccinino brothers became Captains-General once more, but were not as capable as the brilliant Sforza., entry for 14 November 1448 The piazza of the Broletto, where the heads of slain Ghibellines were raised.This was reinforced by the internal dissension that was prominent in Milan. Crime and mob violence were rampant, and the harsh but empty measures against it only served to further divide the populace. Members of the government were filled with suspicion against one another. In an attempt to resolve the situation, the podestà was given absolute power. Financial problems were also grave; fines, confiscations, and a state lottery were instituted to try to alleviate the deficit. Moreover, Guelph aristocrats continued to be regularly elected over the Ghibellines, and began to make the Republic far less democratic. Carlo Gonzaga, Captain of the People, lived luxuriously as an autocrat with his will as law. He was supported by Giovanni Appiani and Giovanni Ossona, tradesmen- turned-politicians, who were prominent in government affairs. Gonzaga began replacing his officials with his unambitious supporters, and the Ghibellines saw the ideals of their Republic crumbling before their eyes. Lampugnano and his Ghibelline friends conspired against Gonzaga and the Guelph regime, but were exposed by a letter intercepted by Gonzaga from Lampugnano to his friend Bossi. Gonzaga kept this knowledge secret, knowing that Lampugnano and Bossi were two of the most influential citizens since the formation of the Republic, but with the support of the vengeful Guelph Captains and Defenders conspired to have them slain. Lampugnano and Bossi were sent as envoys to Frederick III in February 1449, but on the road were caught and imprisoned. Lampugnano was beheaded without a trial, and Bossi was tortured until he gave the names of his fellow conspirators. Following the execution of the leaders there was a massacre of leading Ghibellines within the city, from which only a few, such as Vitaliano Borromeo, escaped to safety in Arona, Piedmont and elsewhere., entry for January, 1449 The heads of the slain were placed upon pikes in the Piazza of the Broletto. Meanwhile, the other claimants to the Duchy began to see that Sforza would be a greater threat than the Ambrosian Republic. Louis of Savoy invaded in spring of 1449, and Sforza sent Colleoni (who had earlier defected) to defeat him at Borgomanero, leading to an uneasy peace. Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, added with the fact that he rashly accepted the defection of his great enemies the Piccinino brothers, who, upon gaining access to Monza, promptly returned it to Milan. Lampugnano, unfortunately for the Guelphs, was considered a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse by the fact that the Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was killed in the uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping to make peace with Sforza. =End of the Republic= Sforza was coming close to Milan itself in his conquests, and decided that since it was too powerful to be taken by force, he would surround it and starve the populace into surrender. With the loss of the outer cities by conquest or defection, Milan experienced famine. Gonzaga offered Crema to Sforza, hoping he would be tempted to take it himself and betray the Venetians. But Sforza remained staunch, and instead offered Gonzaga the city of Tortona if he would abandon Crema. This was accepted, and Crema, without support, quickly capitulated. A flag made for the Golden Ambrosian Republic, showing St. Ambrose surrounded by the virtues. To the Milanese, Sforza's victory now seemed certain, but he found his Venetian allies beginning to have doubts about their Captain-General. They decided that Milan run by Sforza would be far more dangerous and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic. The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured. Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic. They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land. They ordered him to accept the treaty or find Venice his enemy. The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident the war was over and their future was secured. But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle. He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan. The Milanese in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to the old way of life. He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him. After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival Sigismondo Malatesta and continued the siege. Sforza chose for his headquarters the Borromeo castle of Peschiera, south-east of the city. Comune di Peschiera Borromeo (Community website. See under Il Castello at lower right, then L'interno del Castello). Retrieved 11 June 2008. Starvation and suffering were rampant in Milan, and the Venetians had sent an ambassador, Leonardo Venieri, to negotiate the city's surrender and help them defeat Sforza. At last, Gaspare da Vimercate and several members of the Stampa family engineered a coup on 24 February 1450, which resulted in the murder of Venieri on the stairs of Palazzo Reale. The next day the citizens met and Da Vimercate convinced the people to surrender to Sforza. Sforza had made himself very popular for his generosity while fighting for Milan. He had abstained from ravaging the countryside as was so common among commanders of his day, and after some debate the public was convinced. The following day terms were offered to Sforza, who accepted them. Sforza earned the city's devotion by distributing food to the starving people. On 22 March 1450, he had himself declared capitano del popolo, and by right of his wife, the Duke of Milan. He secured his popular support by letting many office-holders keep their positions and being very lenient in his reprisals. The leaders were briefly imprisoned or relegated to their estates, but were generally pardoned soon after, even knighting some of his old enemies at his coronation. Ghibellines were allowed to return in safety and were restored to favor., note Ghibelline families mentioned =Aftermath= Sforza remained at war with Venice for years after the downfall of the Ambrosian Republic. Venice allied herself with the Kingdom of Naples, previously a contender for the succession of Milan. Sforza, however, allied himself with his friend, Cosimo de' Medici of Florence against Venice and Aragonese Naples. The continued war was finally concluded by the peace of Lodi in 1454 with the House of Sforza established as the rulers of the Duchy of MilanVeneto.org Venice Republic: Renaissance .

Note that this diagram is for left-hand traffic. For right-hand traffic, invert \\"F\\" and \\"T\\". Facing or trailing are railway turnouts (or 'points' in the UK) in respect to whether they are divergent or convergent. When a train traverses a turnout in a facing direction, it may diverge onto either of the two routes. When travelled in a trailing direction, the two routes converge onto each other.  History  In the early history of railways in Britain, when signalling and interlocking were primitive, and staff were inexperienced, facing turnouts were a hazard, because a train travelling at high speed could be accidentally switched into a slow speed divergence or dead end. Facing turnouts were therefore banned, except when absolutely necessary. However, facing turnouts cannot be avoided where there are crossing loops on single lines. With the widespread availability of electrically-interlocked signalling in modern times, the rule against facing turnouts has been relaxed.  Diamond crossings  Fixed diamond crossings (with no moving parts) count as trailing points in both directions, although in very exceptional circumstances such as propelling a train in reverse over fine angle diamond crossings they can derail wagons as they bunch up. Switched diamonds, which contain two stub turnouts in disguise, count as facing turnouts in both directions and are also known as moveable angles (UK).  Moveable crossings  Fixed V-crossings are trailable in both directions. Moveable crossings are effectively facing in both directions and must be correctly aligned.  Stub switches  Stub switches are effectively facing in both directions and must be correctly aligned.  Double junctions  Double junctions are now configurable in a number of different ways, whereby the number of facing and trailing turnouts vary.  Goods siding  The goods siding on a double line (in the above diagram) uses two trailing points and a diamond. It can be shunted by trains in either direction. This was widely done in New South Wales, though later on the diamond crossing was replaced with a pair of ladder crossovers; such as: * Bredalabane (S) * Jerrawa (S) * Woy Woy (N) * Newbridge (W)  References  Category:Rail junction types ","title":"Facing and trailing"},{"id":"1966291","text":"Francis Steinmetz (20 September 1914 – 2 January 2006) was an officer in the Royal Netherlands Navy who escaped from Oflag IV-C, Colditz Castle, a German POW camp, during World War II, making a \\"home run\\" to safety. Early life Steinmetz was born 20 September 1914 in Batavia, Dutch East Indies and entered the Dutch Royal Navy in September 1932. After periods on various boats he was posted to the submarine service. He was captured in 1940 in Amsterdam by advancing German forces. Initially sent to a prison camp at Soest, Germany, Steinmetz was then transferred to a POW camp Silesia. He refused to sign a German parole saying he would refrain from any hostile act towards Germany and was transferred to Sonderlager IVC, at Colditz Castle. =Escaping Colditz= Colditz Castle, prison camp (1945) At Colditz all Dutch escapes were coordinated by the Dutch escape officer Captain Machiel van den Heuvel, known as \\"Vandy\\" by the British. Van den Heuvel quickly recognised the possibilities of the exercise park and soon had his first escape plan ready. On 15 August 1941 Steinmetz and Hans Larive hid under a manhole cover under the cover of a rugby scrum. Lieutenant Gerrit Dames then created a diversion by cutting a hole in the barbed wire fence, before allowing himself to be caught, shouting to imaginary escapers to run, so that the Germans would think that the missing officers had already escaped. Larive and Steinmetz hid for several hours. The cover was fixed with a heavy bolt, which Van den Heuvel had replaced with a fake made of glass. Once it was dark the two men forced the manhole cover open from below, and replaced the now broken glass bolt with the original one. They then made their way out of the castle. (This escape method was repeated on 20 September 1941 by two other Dutch officers, C. Giebel and O. L. Drijber.). At Leisnig Steinmetz and Larive took a train to Nuremberg where they waited for their next train in a nearby park. To avoid attracting unwanted attention, they pretended to be a courting couple, with Steinmetz pulling a blanket down over his shorts so it looked like a skirt. They crossed the Swiss border on 18 August 1941. Under Swiss neutrality law they were not allowed to leave the country, so the Dutch Legation provided false papers describing them as sugar planters on their way to Cuba. They travelled on a sealed train in which neutrals were able to pass through France into Spain. At Barcelona they boarded the neutral ship, Isla de Teneriffe, sailing for Havana. The ship was intercepted by a Royal Navy cutter in the Strait of Gibraltar and the two men were taken off and arrived in Gibraltar on 4 November. They then sailed to England aboard the submarine HNLMS O 21 and arrived in London on 17 December 1941. After interrogation by the British, Steinmetz served on motor torpedo boats, taking MTB 222 to the West Indies. He later commanded Dutch motor torpedo boats in the Far East. Post-war career After the end of the Second World War, Steinmetz returned to Holland and served at the naval training camp at Hilversum. In December 1950, he commanded the minesweeper Boereo in Dutch New Guinea, before returning to the naval training centre at Voorschoten. Steinmetz later commanded the minesweeper De Bitter and the frigate De Zeeuw, before joining the Dutch Ministry of Naval Affairs. His final ship was the destroyer Limburg. After retiring, Steinmetz worked for Ole Anderson in Denmark, making fan impellers. Family Steinmetz married twice, first in 1946 to Regina Henrietta Noren (until her death in 1974); and then Peggy George, who predeceased him. He had one son during his first marriage; and two step-daughters by his second.

They are highly expressed in platelets, and also on endothelial cells, myocytes and neurons. Classification There are four mammalian members of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) family: PAR1 - encoded by the gene F2R, PAR2 - F2RL1, PAR3 - F2RL2 and PAR4 - F2RL3, all these genes have their locus on chromosome 5 except of PAR4, which is on chromosome 19. They are also members of the seven-transmembrane G-protein- coupled receptor superfamily, and are expressed throughout the body.  History  PAR1 was firstly described in 1991 on human platelets as a thrombin receptor. In 1994 another member of this family was discovered, S. Nystedt named it simply proteinase activated receptor 2. Experiments on F2R knockout mice then led to the discovery of PAR3 and PAR4. Activation Signal transduction by activation of PAR Protease activated receptors are integral membrane proteins that are coupled to G-proteins and are activated by specific cleavage of the amino terminal sequence that exposes a new N-terminal sequence functions as a tethered ligand, which bind a conserved region on extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). Such bound causes the specific change in conformation of the PAR and alters the affinity for intracellular G-protein. Four types of PAR receptors have been identified by molecular cloning, and classified according to the main enzyme that is able to activate it. It has been determined that a large group of proteases cleave and activate PARs receptors, including various endogenous proteases from: a) the coagulation cascade, b) inflammatory cells, and c) the digestive tract. On the other hand PARs can be specifically cleaved and irreversibly activated even by exogenous proteases originated from insects, bacteria or plants and fungi. The wide distribution of PARs in a variety of cells supports the idea that they are involved in many process related with the gastrointestinal physiology. Although the proteolysis is the main mechanism for PAR activation, it is well known that a synthetic peptide (SLIGKV) that mimics the new N-terminal sequence produced after the cleavage, activates PAR-2 receptors without its proteolytic processing. In this sense, here we report that TFF3 isolated from human breast milk activates PAR-2 receptors of intestinal epithelial cells HT-29. These findings suggest that TFF3 activates intestinal epithelial cells through G-protein-coupled PAR-2, and could actively participate in the immune system of breastfed babies inducing the production of peptides related to innate defense, such as defensins and cytokines. PARs are activated by the action of serine proteases such as thrombin (acts on PARs 1, 3 and 4) and trypsin (PAR 2). These enzymes cleave the N-terminus of the receptor, which in turn acts as a tethered ligand. In the cleaved state, part of the receptor itself acts as the agonist, causing a physiological response. Most of the PAR family act through the actions of G-proteins i (cAMP inhibitory), 12/13 (Rho and Ras activation) and q (calcium signalling) to cause cellular actions.  Function  The cellular effects of thrombin are mediated by protease-activated receptors (PARs). Thrombin signalling in platelets contributes to hemostasis and thrombosis. Endothelial PARs participate in the regulation of vascular tone and permeability while in vascular smooth muscle they mediate contraction, proliferation, and hypertrophy. In endothelial cells PARs play a key role in promotion vascular barrier function as they provide a positive signals for endothelial adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1), and E-selectin). PARs contribute to the pro-inflammatory response. For example PAR4 induces leukocyte migration and PAR2 helps macrophages to produce cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). Recent research has also implicated these novel receptors in muscle growth and bone cell differentiation and proliferation.

A lifelong Communist, O'Shea was a leading member of the pro-China Communist Party of Australia (Marxist- Leninist) (CPA(ML)) at the time he was imprisoned. O'Shea's jailing triggered the largest postwar national strike largely organised by left unions (and against the open opposition of the Victorian Trades Hall Council and the Labor Council of New South Wales) when one million workers stopped work over six days to demand \\"Free Clarrie and repeal the penal powers\\". On the sixth day O'Shea was released when the fines were paid by a man who claimed to have won the New South Wales lottery. Over the previous five years, the Tramways Union had militantly defended and improved the conditions of its members. The union had accumulated 40 fines totalling $13,200 imposed on it by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Due to the inaction of Melbourne Trades Hall, twenty seven left wing unions had caucused together in response to the perceived attacks on unionism by the widespread application of fines. They called a mass delegates meeting for the day of the hearing that was attended by 5,000 delegates. After the meeting the delegates marched to the courthouse led by Clarrie O'Shea. In court O'Shea refused to take the oath, then refused to present the union books, in line with the wishes of the members of his union, and was formally arrested and sentenced for contempt of court on Thursday 15 May 1969 and taken to HM Prison Pentridge. This led to immediate walk outs on the Thursday, and a general strike which paralysed Victoria on the Friday. There were two 24-hour stoppages in Victoria, involving 40 unions. All trains and trams stopped, delivery of goods was severely restricted, the power supply was cut and TV and radio broadcasts were disrupted. Protests and strike action also occurred in regional Victoria with the Geelong Trades Hall Council supporting the strikes and similar action in Bendigo, Ballarat, and the Latrobe Valley. All together, about 500,000 workers struck across Australia on Friday, 16 May. The Trades and Labour Council of WA, the Queensland Trades and Labour Council and the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia all called statewide general strikes. In Queensland, mass meetings or strikes occurred in 20 cities, while Trades and Labour Councils in Newcastle, Wollongong and Canberra called out members of affiliated unions. The Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council also refused to sanction any action, while 22 'rebel' affiliated unions representing 50,000 workers (80% of Tasmania's workforce) organized a general stoppage. Protests calling for O'Shea's release occurred outside HM Prison Pentridge in Coburg over the weekend. On Tuesday 20 May, Dudley MacDougall, a former advertising manager for the Australian Financial Review, acting on \\"behalf of a public benefactor\\", paid the union's fines. Kerr ordered O'Shea to be released. Although the penal laws were not repealed, they have never been used again.

It is the primary ski mountain of the Sun Valley ski resort, and renowned for its lengthy runs at a uniform gradient, at varying levels of difficulty, and with little wind. In the Sun Valley's fourth year of operation (1939–40), Bald Mountain was opened for lift-served skiing, with a series of three (single-seat) chairlifts, unloading at an elevation of 9020 feet (2749 m),. With a base elevation of 5750 feet (1753 m) along the Big Wood River at River Run, Baldy's vertical drop is 3400 feet (1036 m) along its northeast face. It is served by 14 ski lifts (1 eight-person gondola, 7 high-speed quads, 3 triples, 2 doubles, 1 surface); Baldy has more uphill capacity per skier than any other ski area. It has 75 runs with 2054 acres (8.31 km²) of on-piste skiing, 645 acres (2.61 km²) of which have snowmaking. The slope ratings are 36% easiest, 42% more difficult, and 22% most difficult.

Steeped in British Army traditions, the Malaysian Army does not carry the title ‘royal’ () as do the Royal Malaysian Air Force and the Royal Malaysian Navy. Instead, the title is bestowed on selected army corps and regiments who have been accorded the honour by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong ('The King of Malaysia'), who is the Supreme Commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces. History Malay Regiment soldiers at a bayonet practice before the Battle of Singapore. The first military units in Malaysia can be traced back to the Penang Volunteer Rifle raised on 1 March 1861,1 March is marked as Army Day in honour of the Penang Rifle Volunteers (PRV) raising as the first military unit in the Malay Peninsula. and the Malay States Volunteer Rifles which existed from 1915 to 1936. The birth of the modern Malaysian Army came about when the Federal Council of the Federated Malay States passed the Malay Regiment Bill on 23 January 1933. This allowed the initial recruitment of 25 males for the First Experimental Malay Company on 1 March 1933. Major G. McI. S. Bruce of the Lincolnshire Regiment was the first Commanding Officer. By 1 January 1935, the Experimental Company became The Malay Regiment with a complement of 150 men. A battalion was formed on 1 January 1938 and eventually a second battalion on 1 December 1941. The 1st Bn Malay Regiment was famous for its defence of Opium Hill or Bukit Chandu in Singapore. The ‘Battle of Opium Hill’ on 14 February 1942 involved 42 soldiers commanded by Lt. Adnan Saidi who defended their position against attack from the 18th Division of the Japanese Imperial Army under Lt. Gen. Renya Mutaguchi. After World War II and during the Malayan Emergency, the number of battalions was increased to seven in the early 1950s. The Kor Armor Diraja ('Royal Armoured Corps') can trace its roots to the formation on 1 September 1952 of the Federation Reconnaissance Squadron. It was later merged with the Federation Regiment to form the Federation Reconnaissance Corps. The name underwent a few transformations from the Malaysian Reconnaissance Corps (16 September 1967), Royal Malaysian Reconnaissance Corps (May 1979) to Royal Cavalry Corps (December 1979) and finally to Kor Armor Diraja on 8 December 1986. The Royal Ranger Regiment's lineage began in 1863 as the paramilitary Sarawak Rangers. Although the second in the order of precedence, it is the oldest active formation of the Army.  Profile  Supacat ATMP.alt= = Flag = The flag of Malaysian Army has been introduced since the inception of Malaysia Army and has been in use till today. The shape of it is the combination of Malaysian Flag and Malaysian Army's crest. This flag is the symbol of pride and courageousness of the Malaysian Army. The flag dimension is (height) and (wide). The flags are being flown from 6.30 am to 6.30 pm everyday based on certain protocol and honor. Organisation and structure = Tactical structure = The Malaysian Army currently has 18 Corps and Regiments. These are grouped into 3 main components — the Combat Element, the Combat Support Element and the Support Elements. The Corps and Regiments are currently organised into five divisions. Three of which (the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Divisions) are based on the Malay Peninsula and placed under Western Field Army Headquarters, while the other two (the 1st Division and 5th Division) are based on Malaysian Borneo and placed under Eastern Field Army Headquarters. The 21st Special Service Group (the Army's special forces), 10th Parachute Brigade and the two Army Aviation Regiment are independent formations.

Its ranks are recruited from amongst the Malay population. The Regiment has 26 battalions. The 1st Battalion, the most senior in the Regiment, currently undertakes ceremonial and Royal Guard duties. The remainder are configured as 19 Standard Infantry Battalions, three Mechanised Infantry Battalions and three Parachute Infantry Battalions. The regiment uses rifle green berets except the three airborne battalions that wear maroon berets. The 19th Bn Royal Malay Regiment (Mech) was involved in the rescue of U.S. 75th Ranger Regiment and Delta Force operatives in Somalia during the Battle of Mogadishu. The unit of 32 Radpanzer Condor APCs and 113 men from MALBATT 1 went in with the U.S. 10th Mountain Division to rescue the trapped Rangers. Four APCs were immobilised and were destroyed by US helicopter gunships. 19 Royal Malay Regiment suffered 1 soldier killed in action (KIA), PFC Mat Aznan Awang while 8 others were wounded in action (WIA). PFC Mat Aznan Awang was later promoted posthumously to Corporal and was awarded with Pingat Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa, the nation's highest gallantry award. In total, 7 officers and 26 NCOs were awarded various medals for their valour during the operation, the highest number of men recommended for medals in a single unit in a single operation. *Rejimen Renjer Diraja Malaysian Army in action during demonstration.

Formed by college students, professionals and civilians, it provides support for the regular armed forces of Malaysia and is responsible for the security of key installations in times of conflict. Originally tasked with area and local defence, the Rejimen Askar Wataniah units have been reconfigured and will perform front line duties alongside regular units when the need arises. Rejimen Askar Wataniah units, such as armoured squadrons, are integral units of several Kor Armor Diraja regiments. = Rapid Reaction Infantry Battalion = * Batalion Siap Sedia Tentera Darat The Batalion Siap Sedia Tentera Darat (BSSTD; 'Army Rapid Battalion — ARB') is a combat ready battalion of the Malaysian Army. The ARB can be deployed to overseas conflict areas in short notice under order of the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UN DPKO). The battalion consists of multiple capabilities, including special operations, armour, infantry and Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defence (CBRN defence). Currently, the 7th Battalion, Royal Ranger Regiment (Mechanised) (7 RRD (Mek)) is assigned as the main combat element for the ARB. The 7 RRD (Mek) is supported by various corps and regiments, including special ops operators from the Malaysian Army counter-terrorism regiment, the 11th Special Service Regiment. Strength The personnel strength of the Malaysian Army is approximately 80,000 personnel in the Active Army,IISS (2012), p. 264 50,000 in the Active Reserve and 26,600 active and 244,700 reservists in the paramilitary. The Malaysian Army consists of 5 infantry divisions, 10 infantry brigades, 1 special forces brigade, 1 airborne brigade and 1 mechanised brigade, composed of: * 36 Light Infantry Battalions * 4 Airborne Infantry (Paratrooper) Battalions * 4 Mechanised Infantry Battalions * 5 Armoured Battalions (1 Tank Regiment) * 1 light tank squadron * 14 Artillery Regiments (4 Air Defence) * 3 Special Forces Regiments * 3 field engineer regiments * 1 construction engineer regiment * 1 airborne infantry squadron * 4 military police regiments * 1 signals regiment * 1 intelligence unit * 2 helicopter squadrons The territorial army includes: * 16 light infantry regimentsIISS (2012), p. 265 * 4 specialist engineer regiments Equipment Present development GGK using rappels during a counter-terrorism demonstration. Since the recovery from the 1997 economic crisis, Malaysian Army, along with other branches of the Malaysian Armed Forces, has regained momentum in its modernising programs. The first major procurement was to set a milestone by building its first ever main battle tank regiment. Malaysian Army received delivery of 48 units PT-91M Pendekar main battle tanks and other tank-based equipment, like ARV WZT-4 from Poland, fully completed contract of sale in March 2010. Despite adding some 28 units of South African G5 Mk III 155 mm howitzers, another major procurement was 18 units of Astros MLRS from Brazil, which delivery was completed in 2006. A second batch of 18 units MRLS was ordered in 2007. Malaysian Army is also rapidly mechanising its current inventory - 267 units locally manufactured ACV-300 Adnan IFVs were acquired by the army in 2004 and 111 units K200 KIFV also purchased from South Korea. Following the procurement of the Pakistani Bakhtar-Shikan anti-armor missile launcher and these were installed on the ACV-300 Adnans. Malaysian Army is now shifting its emphasis on enhancing its air wing. In September 2006, Malaysian Army received its 11th and last Agusta Westland AW109. These helicopters are to initially complement, and ultimately replace, the ageing SA316B Aérospatiale Alouette III helicopters. Some of them were to be installed with light arms and to be tasked to a scout observation unit. Furthermore, the army will also receive S61A-4 Nuri multipurpose helicopters after they are retired from RMAF and these will form the backbone of the army’s very first air transport units - 881 and 882 squadrons of the army air wing. In the same year, at the biannual Defence Services Asia (DSA) 2006, Malaysia announced that the US made M4 carbine service rifle will replace the Austrian-made Steyr AUG service rifle for all three Malaysian Armed Forces services. The army will receive the new weapon soon. Both this two type of rifles manufactured locally by SME Ordnance. There is also a requirement for an upgrade to the current air defence network. However, a dispute between the army and the air force on whether to introduce a mid-range SAM system had led to the procurement being put on hold. According to a recent interview of the army’s chief of staff, Ismail bin Haji Jamaluddin, the army has no intention of taking over the mid- range air defence role. To boost the security in eastern Sabah from the attacks by militants in the southern Philippines, especially in the Sulu Sea, the Malaysian government has purchased a total of six McDonnel Douglas MD-530G light attack helicopters from the United States for the Malaysian Army. The locally manufactured AV-4 Lipanbara 4x4 armoured vehicles that were intended to be stationed in east Malaysia were also purchased after an agreement with a Thai company. The United States reportedly agreed to transfer a total of 29 pieces of M109 howitzer artillery to the Malaysian Army but this deal was cancelled at the last minute.. Malaysian defence company, Weststar Defence Industries and its subsidiary Global Komited, has partnered with British air defence company, Thales for the distribution of surface-to-air missile to the Malaysian Army. While another Malaysian company AVP Engineering has teamed up with a South Korean-defence company Doosan DST to offer Black Fox 6x6 wheeled armoured vehicle if it was selected by the Malaysian government. Malaysia also locally produce AV-8 Gempita 8x8 by DefTech company with technology assistance from Turkey. A Malaysian company, Aegis Malinnov also has recently made the country's first pistol that will be used as a major pistol for the army. In the same year, The Etika Strategic, Rheinmetall and Otokar made an Agreement of Joint Venture Altay MBT. There are also planned to replace the retired FV101 Scorpion and Alvis Stormer with the new armoured vehicle. In August 2020, the Ministry of Defence is preparing for an open competition to find the replacement for the APC to replace Condor APC and SIBMAS IFV. About 250 Armoured Fighting Vehicle were request by the army, specificly 4x4 or 6x6. =Future Soldier System= The Malaysian Army currently has a soldier modernisation programme called the Future Soldier System. Under the FSS, The Malaysian Army plans to equip all soldiers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as Kevlar helmets, Kevlar vests, Oakley goggles and ear protection equipment. The programme also includes arming all the standard issue M4 carbines with SOPMOD kits, as well as equipping soldiers with a Glock series pistol. Sapura, a Malaysian electronics company, is offering their SAKTI soldier system concept via work in three areas: Head Sub-System (HSS), Body Sub-System (BSS) and Weapon Sub-System (WSS). The HSS consists of a Helmet–Mounted Micro Camera and night vision capability with a data output, helmet-mounted display and earpiece and microphone; the WSS consists of a Rifle Control Unit consisting of a five-button wireless controller for one handed use with key features including push to talk for the radio, switching the HMD on and off, turning the HMD brightness up and down as well as video transmission to friendly forces. The BSS consists of a controller system, energy unit with a power pack for the communication interface, micro-camera and HMD with a single polymer lithium ion battery for up to ten hours of operation; a communications interface for secure IP based radio which from the image is a Thales radio and finally a navigation unit with a display for blue force tracking and situational awareness, colour digital mapping and terrain and urban profile analysis. The system displayed is visually similar to the Kord Defence SmartGrip RIC developed in partnership with Thales Australia. The FSS in conjunction with the NCO (Network Centric Operation) System, will give the three branches of the Armed Forces a shared situational awareness and a common operating picture via a X-band satellite-based link and a UAV system, with hopes to enable self-synchronisation for all three branches. The programme will go through several phases, with Phasa 1A (the implementation of the Mobile X-band satellite communication linked) and Phase 2 (the demonstration of the capibilities of the NCO with FSS) being successful and operational in 2017. In 2018, during the annual DSA convention, the Malaysian Army showcased a joint exercise between the NCO systems via Army Operations Room and Soldiers equipped with FSS systems, where the Army Operations Room coordinated the Soldiers doing numerous activities, first being a live firing of a 3-man squad involving the usage of artillery and how precise the accuracy of the artilleries via the NCO and FSS equipment, second being in an Army Training centre, and last being a real simulation operation in East Malaysia. Currently, several combat elements such as the 12th Royal Malay Regiment and the 4th Mechanised Brigate are outfitted with the system. Through the use of this system, the Malaysian Army is able to operate anywhere throughout the world, especially during United Nations Operations.

He is one of two snowboarders, along with Steve Fisher, ever to beat Shaun White in the X Games Superpipe. Autti is the first non-American to win the event. He kicked off his final run with back-to-back 1080s, one of the hardest snowboarding tricks, and is only the third snowboarder to land the sequence in competition, behind Michael McBee and Ross Powers. His clutch and technical performance sparked the \\"1080 Revolution\\" and set a new standard in men's halfpipe competition, where men must throw at least one 1080, if not two back-to-back, in order to do well in contests. Just two weeks earlier, he was crowned double World Champion in Big Air and the halfpipe at the 2005 Snowboarding World Championships in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada.  Biography  Born to Yrjö and Katariina Autti, Autti hails from Rovaniemi, a 55,000 population city that sits on the Arctic Circle and is considered the gateway to the Lapland region of Finland. Athletic genes run in his family - Autti's younger brother Tuomas is an aspiring freestyle skier, and his uncle is Arto Autti, who was a defender on the Finnish National football team. Autti started snowboarding in spring 1995 after he saw someone snowboarding while on a skiing vacation with his family at the Ylläs ski center in Lapland.  Career  = 2004-2005 = Following his breakthrough at the World Championships and the Winter X Games, Autti went on to finish second at the 2005 Nippon Open, third at the 2005 U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships and first in Big Air at the Arctic Challenge, the exclusive snowboarding event founded by Terje Haakonsen. He was also awarded Best Tweak for his switch backside 540, which is his favorite trick. In April 2005, it was officially announced that Autti would represent Finland at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Over the summer of 2005 at the end of July, he competed in Nokia's Totally Board in Taiwan. Autti embarked on Billabong's Freeway Tour in August, which spirits Billabong-sponsored riders to various contests in Australia and New Zealand. He won the Perisher Pipe Cup and took third in the Slopestyle Jam. It was Autti's first time Down Under, and he likes New Zealand's famed Snowpark because it is like a \\"big playground,\\" and it reminds him of Finland because \\"you can see everyone from the lift.\\" Australian snowboarders on the Tour, Nick Gregory and Clint Allan, introduced Autti to their country's native wombats and kangaroos and got him addicted to pies. = 2005-2006 = Autti kicked off the 2005-2006 World Cup season with third and first-place finishes in Valle Nevado, Chile in September. He followed it in October with a second place podium in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. During Finland's Annual Skiexpo in November 2005, Autti was awarded Rider of the Year by Slammer Magazine's Riders of the Year Awards. He received the most votes in a readers internet poll. He also finished ninth in Finland's annual Sports Athlete of the Year poll, voted on by sports magazine journalists. Before the end of 2005, Autti competed in the X-Trail Jam in Japan and finished fifth in the quarterpipe and fourth in the straight jump. For his banner year, he was invited to Finland's President's Ball in December, an annual banquet honoring all of the elite athletes, politicians, celebrities, and public figures in Finland. Autti attended the event with Mattila, where they met the President, Tarja Halonen  who was re-elected for a second term on January 29, 2006  and her husband Pentti Arajävi. Autti competed in the Burton European Open in Laax, Switzerland in January 2006, taking second place in slopestyle. Two days later, riding with a bruised rib, he finished fourth in the halfpipe. At the 2006 Winter X Games, the extremely icy pipe proved to be hazardous to numerous riders, including Autti, and he came up short in his defense of his gold medal, finishing sixth. Two weeks later at the 2006 Winter Olympics, despite a near-flawless run, he finished fifth with a controversial low score of 39.1 that elicited plenty of \\"boos\\" from fans in the stands. Bronze medalist and teammate Markku Koski felt the same way, stating it should have been Autti on the podium. After a two-week stay in Japan, Autti returned to the top of the podium at the Vans Cup at Tahoe in March and pocketed $20,000. He finished the season with a sixth-place finish in the quarterpipe and 10th-place finishes in the halfpipe and slopestyle at the 2006 U.S. Open. In April 2006, Autti and his Flow teammates swept the TransWorld Team Challenge, taking five awards, including Best Halfpipe Rider for Autti. In December 2006, he scored 3rd place at the Nokia Air & Style in Munich, Germany. The Air & Style is considered one of the biggest and most prestigious events in Europe. = Present = Autti has not competed recently and has been more focused on making video of backcountry riding.http://threesixfive.tv/interview-with-antti-autti/  2008-2009  Autti participated in the Winter X Games 12. He finished 3rd in Best Trick Showdown, 7th in Snowboard Superpipe, and 4th in Snowboard Slopestyle. Most recently he won the 2008 Toyota Big Air Japan beating his fellow Flow teammate Risto Mattila, who came in second place. 2009- Autti placed 3rd, in the men's superpipe competition in X Games 13  Off the snow  Autti, who speaks Finnish, English and Swedish, enjoys skateboarding, photography, salmiakki, movies (especially Johnny Depp films) and music. Some of his favorite artists include Turbonegro, The Hellacopters, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, David Bowie, Social Distortion, The Datsuns and Mötley Crüe. He listened to Mötley Crüe's \\"Kickstart My Heart\\"  which he dubs \\"probably the best song ever\\"  during his gold medal-winning run at the 2005 X Games. Autti's favorite drink is scotch without rocks, and he says he would be a bartender if he were not a snowboarder. He says he cannot define himself as an athlete in the traditional sense because \\"in my opinion I'm a snowboarder and my own person.\\" The best part of being a professional snowboarder, he feels, is traveling around the world, meeting new people and experiencing new cultures. Always calm, cool and collected, Autti tries not to stress himself out too much if he is not riding well because he believes it is important to not lose the fun of snowboarding, echoing his advice to future shredders: \\"It'd be best if people that throw themselves into snowboarding understood what this sport is about. The competitions alone don't mean everything. There'll always be more of them. In my opinion, the fun going-ons and the smile on your face are a lot more important. Doing well's nice, no doubt about it, but it's important that you don't lose the pleasure of the riding itself in the competing.\\"  Sponsors  Autti is sponsored by Billabong, Transform Gloves, Nokia, Shred Optics, Northwave, Drake  References   External links    *Antti's Go211 Profile Blogs, photos and videos managed by Antti. *Transworld Snowboarding Interview November 2005 *Antti Autti at NBC Olympics *Airbornmag.com Interview December 2007 interview with UK-based sports/music website Airbornmag.com Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Finnish male snowboarders Category:Olympic snowboarders of Finland Category:Snowboarders at the 2006 Winter Olympics Category:X Games athletes Category:People from Rovaniemi ","title":"Antti Autti"},{"id":"1966328","text":"Harcourt Park is a non-profit cottaging corporation in the municipality of Dysart et al, Haliburton County in Central Ontario, Canada.

He is credited with setting up a nearly independent Chupanid state in northern Persia during the struggles taking place in the aftermath of the Ilkhanate. Life =Rise to power= Hasan's father, Timurtash, was executed by the Mamelukes in 1328. The son's rise to power began three years after the death of the last powerful Ilkhan, Abu Sa'id. The Jalayirids under Hasan Buzurg had recently mastered western Persia, putting a puppet Muhammad Khan on the Ilkhanid throne in 1336. Hasan attempted to unify the fragmented Chobanid family. Claiming his father was alive, he used a slave named Qara Jari (a possible offspring of Hasan's grandfather Chupan) to impersonate him. The widow of Timurtash was even married to him. Mameluk Sultan Al-Nasr Muhammad, who had ordered Timurtash' execution, attempted to expose the fraud, but without much success. The Chobanids rallied to him; several of them (such as Pir Hosayn) defected from Hasan Buzurg's service. Together, they defeated Hasan Buzurg in Alataq on July 16, 1338. Muhammed Khan was executed, and the region around Tabriz was occupied. =Challenges= At this point, Qara Jari attempted to get rid of Hasan Kucek and take power for himself, but fled when the effort failed. Following this, Hasan raised Sati Beg, sister of Abu Sa'id and widow of Coban, to the Ilkhanid throne in the summer of 1338. When Togha Temur, another claimant to the throne, invaded from Khurasan in the winter of 1339 at the behest of Hasan Buzurg, the Chobanid offered Sati's hand to him in marriage. Using this to receive letters of assurance from Togha Temur, Hasan Kucek forwarded these to the Jalayirids. Hasan Buzurg, feeling betrayed, stopped his advance in support of Togha, and the latter was forced to retreat in July 1339. In the meantime, Hasan Kuchak found a new suitable puppet in the form of Suleiman Khan, whom he forced Sati Beg to marry in May 1339. Hasan decided to march against the Jalayirids again. Supported by Pir Hosayn, as well as his uncle Surgan, he defeated the Jalayirids on June 26, 1340, in the Zarrinarüd valley near Maraga. Surgan was made governor of Iraq. During Hasan Kuchak’s reign, not all of the Chobanids remained loyal. Surgan, unhappy with the treatment of Sati Beg (who was his mother), defected to Hasan Buzurg. An alliance was formed between the two, soon joined by the ruler of Diyarbakr, as well as Sultan Al-Nasr. Hasan Kuchak, however, managed to lure him out of the alliance, and the Mameluks soon abandoned their support. Still, Surgan began to plot with Togha Temur, who sent his brother Amir Shaikh 'Ali Kavon to invade Iraq. These forces were defeated by Hasan Kuchak's brother Malek Asraf in the latter half of 1341, and Surgan was soon imprisoned. Around the same time, several of the Chobanids became embroiled in a conflict concerning Fars. Malek Asraf, along with his cousin Pir Hosayn and his uncle Yagi Basti, were involved in a conflict that also included the Injuids, the owners of the area, and the Jalayirids. The conflict split the Chobanids, and Pir Hosayn was arrested and executed in Tabriz in 1342. Yagi Basti and Malek Asraf met up in Baghdad; realizing the danger of the two individuals, Hasan Kuchak caused Malek Asraf to flee to Georgia, and then convinced Hasan Buzurg to abandon his support for him. Still, the two were back in Fars in the following year.

History  VisiCalc was the first spreadsheet program but its release for the CP/M operating system ran only on the HP-125, Sharp MZ80, and the Sony SMC-70. SuperCalc was created to fill that void and market opportunity. Alongside WordStar, it was one of the CP/M applications bundled with the Osborne 1 portable computer. It quickly became popular and was ported to MS-DOS in 1982. An improvement over VisiCalc (though using much the same command structure using the slash key), SuperCalc was one of the first spreadsheet programs capable of iteratively solving circular references (cells that depend on each other's results). It would be over 10 years after the introduction of SuperCalc before this feature was implemented in Microsoft Excel, although in Lotus 1-2-3, manual programming of iterative logic could also be used to solve this issue. According to the SuperCalc product manager, iterative calculations were added when Sorcim changed from binary-coded decimal to binary math. Since the precision of the two math packages was different, some IF statements resolved differently, and iterative calculations helped solve this problem.Wally Feigenson's Blog http://feigenson.us/blog/?p=10 Versions of SuperCalc were later released for the Apple II, for PCs running MS-DOS, and, after Sorcim was bought by CA Technologies (CA) in 1985, for Microsoft Windows (under the name CA-SuperCalc). SuperCalc was CA Technologies' first personal computer product. The MS-DOS versions were more popular with many users than the market-leading Lotus 1-2-3, because it was distributed without copy protection, as well as being priced lower. By the release of version 3 in March 1987, a million users were claimed.C+VG magazine \\"Extra Bits\\", issue 65, page 96 http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue065/Pages/CVG06500096.jpg New versions were published into the early 1990s, after which Microsoft Excel dominated the spreadsheet market. In 1993, the Ministry of Railway of Russia signed an agreement with CA Technologies after a Russian employee illegally used SuperCalc for government purposes.

He was the only representative of the armed forces to be present at the signing of the German instruments of surrender in Luneburg Heath on 4 May 1945, in Reims on 7 May and in Berlin on 8 May 1945. Generaladmiral von Friedeburg committed suicide shortly afterwards, upon the dissolution of the Flensburg Government. Early life Hans-Georg von Friedeburg was born in Strassburg in the German Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine(Elsass-Lothringen), the son of Prussian officer Karl von Friedeburg (1862–1924). Military career On 1 April 1914 he joined the Imperial Navy as a Seekadett. After the outbreak of World War I, von Friedeburg, promoted to the rank of Fähnrich zur See (Officer Aspirant) served on the dreadnought and took part in the 1916 Battle of Jutland against the British Royal Navy's Grand Fleet. Elevated to Leutnant zur See, he joined the U-boat forces as naval officer on from June to November 1918. A prominent German naval officer of the post-war period, he was appointed Deputy Commander of the German U-boat fleet in September 1941. Overseeing German U-boat training and deployment of the U-boat bases in France, he later organised U-boat picket lines in the mid-Atlantic to find and attack Allied convoys. Promoted to rear admiral in 1942, von Friedeburg assumed command of the German U-boat fleet in February of the following year. He was awarded the Ritterkreuz des Kriegsverdienstkreuzes mit Schwertern on 17 January 1945. He succeeded Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine when Dönitz became Reich President upon Hitler's suicide (and per Hitler's last will), and was promoted to general admiral on 1 May 1945. Montgomery (right) and von Friedeburg signing the German surrender at Lüneburg Heath, 4 May 1945 In early May 1945, von Friedeburg was ordered by Dönitz to negotiate the surrender to the Western Allied forces. Arriving at Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's headquarters in Lüneburg, Germany he was informed that an unconditional surrender to all Allied forces was necessary and not negotiable. Upon receiving permission from Dönitz, he signed an instrument of surrender of all German armed forces in the Netherlands, northwest Germany and Denmark on 4 May 1945. On 7 May 1945, he was present at the first signing of the German Instrument of Surrender by General Alfred Jodl in Reims. Von Friedeburg was in Berlin on 8 May 1945 for the second signing of the German Instrument of Surrender. He signed on behalf of the Kriegsmarine, along with Colonel General Hans-Jürgen Stumpff for the Luftwaffe and Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel for the Heer and OKW. Marshal Georgy Zhukov and Air Chief Marshal Arthur William Tedder signed for the Soviet Union and SHAEF respectively. Death On 23 May 1945, the same day that members of the Flensburg Government were arrested, von Friedeburg became a prisoner of war of the British Army in Plön, and committed suicide by swallowing poison. His body was buried at Adelby Cemetery near Flensburg.Borgert, p. 331 Personal life His son Ludwig von Friedeburg (1924–2010) became a sociologist and later a politician, serving from 1969 and 1974 as Minister for Culture in the state of Hesse.

Geography Lochbuie from the west with Loch Uisg at left, Moy Castle at centre, Eilean Mòr to the right and Druim Fada beyond. Once known as the \\"Garden of Mull\\" the fertile land around the main village of seventeen houses is surrounded by hills with the narrow valley to the east containing both Loch Uisg and the only road to the estate. The settlement lies at the head of Loch Buie, a sea loch which contains the tidal islands of Eilean Mòr and Eilean Uamh Ghuaidhre. Frank Lockwood's Island (or Eilean Sneth Dian) lies in the Firth of Lorne, just offshore from the Laggan peninsula to the south. This island is named after Frank Lockwood who was Solicitor General for England and Wales from 1894 to 1895 and the brother-in- law of the 21st MacLean of Lochbuie. The highest hills in the area are Ben Buie whose summit is above sea level to the north, the Druim Fada range reaching to the south and Craig Ben, at to the east, overlooking Loch Spelve. A track allows walking access to Carsaig to the west. History There is a fine stone circle at Lochbuie, the only one on Mull, and the remains of a pre- historic tomb. Both these sites are scheduled monuments, as is Moy Castle, originally a 14th-century keep, subsequently altered, and is now an uninhabited 3-storey tower. It is near the imposing 18th-century Lochbuie House and both buildings were once the seat of Clan Maclaine of Lochbuie. There is the medieval chapel of Caibeal Mheamhair, which may originally have been dedicated to St. Oran, rebuilt in the 19th century as a mausoleum for the MacLaine family. A luxurious silver brooch (known as the Lochbuie Brooch) dating to c. 1500 was found on the estate and has been in the British Museum's collection since 1855.British Museum Collection Lochbuie is in the Diocese of Argyll and the Isles and there is a small Episcopal church built in 1876 consecrated to the mythical St Kilda. Between 1752 and the construction of the existing mansion house the MacLaine lived in a smaller house on the estate. There is an inscription above a doorway in Lochbuie House farm square that states: \\"After leaving Moy Castle the Lochbuie family resided in this house from 1752 to 1789 and it was in this house that Dr. Johnson and Mr. Boswell were entertained in 1773 by John MacLaine XVII chief of Lochbuie.\\" Samuel Johnson wrote: > We came without any difficulty, at evening, to Lochbuy, where we found a > true Highland Laird, rough and haughty, and tenacious of his dignity; who, > hearing my name, inquired whether I was of the Johnstons of Glencroe, or of > Ardnamurchan.

I have seen no houses in the Islands much to be > envied for convenience or magnificence, yet they bare testimony to the > progress of arts and civility, as they shew that rapine and surprise are no > longer dreaded, and are much more commodious than the ancient fortresses. Perhaps the area's most noted modern residents have been George Sassoon (author, linguist and son of the poet Siegfried Sassoon) and Siegfried's wife, the former Hester Gatty.

Fitted to the following their 1980s recommissioning upgrade, each ABL contains four ready-to-fire Tomahawks. The use of ABLs on these vessels rather than a non-armored solution was necessitated to enable the battleships to continue to exploit the capability provided by their heavy armor and reduce the vulnerability of the delicate missiles within. Eight ABLs were fitted to each of the four recommissioned battleships, providing 32 weapons to each ship. Some of the original dual 5 inch (127 mm) gun mounts were removed to fit the ABLs.

After learning the game in Kent, he had spells with Saracens and Waterloo before joining Sale Sharks in 2001. His first game for Sale was against French club Auch in 2001. Capped by England at schoolboy and U21 level, he was first capped for England A against Ireland A in 2002. He caught the eye of Clive Woodward with a dynamic display on his first start for England A against Scotland A in March 2002. He gained his second A cap against Italy A in 2003 and was involved in the Churchill Cup success in Canada. He won a place in the England Elite Player Squad for 2003. He was considered an outside chance for Woodward's 2003 Rugby World Cup squad but was ultimately left out. In 2004, Titterrell earned England A selection against France A in their narrow defeat in Perpignan. He took part in the 2004 senior Summer tour, earning his first senior cap, coming off the bench against the All Blacks in Auckland.

Early anti- Semitism As in most Western societies, a certain amount of anti-Semitic feeling has been present in New Zealand for quite some time.Goldman, Lazarus Morris, The history of the Jews in New Zealand, 1958 This feeling was not particularly strong, however, as evidenced by the fact that Julius Vogel, a practising Jew, was able to become Premier in 1873. Vogel did, however, suffer jibes about his faith, and political cartoonists frequently employed various Jewish stereotypes against him. The fact that he served as treasurer was particularly played upon, with stereotypes of Jewish bankers and moneylenders being brought out. However, none of this anti-Semitism was conducted in an organised fashion, being simply the views of individuals rather than any sort of political movement. New Zealander Arthur Desmond, \\"possibly the most widely read and influential political writer New Zealand has ever produced\\", incorporated anti-semitism into his writing, particularly his 1896 political treatise Might Is Right. Numerous editions of the book have been printed and it found new popularity with neo-Nazi groups in the 21st century. 20th century In the early 20th century, another more disciplined strain of anti- Semitism crystallised around the social credit theory. This theory, set out by the British engineer C. H. Douglas, was highly critical of bankers and financiers, believing that debt was being used to undermine people's rights. While by no means all creditists were anti-Semitic, the complaints made by Social Credit fit well with existing anti-Semitic theories that Jews controlled financial institutions. As such, many anti-Semites gathered around social credit organisations, and in some cases, became powerful. Initially, most supporters of social credit were supporters of the Labour Party, which meant that any anti-Semitic sentiments were considerably diluted. Later, however, an independent Social Credit Party was founded, and some allege that the new group contained many anti-Semitic elements. Gradually, rifts emerged in the party over anti-Semitic views, and the faction opposed to anti-Semitism was victorious. By the late 1960s, any anti-Semitic strain had been virtually expelled from the Social Credit Party. Many anti-Semites supported the League of Rights, an organisation originating in Australia which also had links to the social credit movement. Unlike some countries, New Zealand did not have any notable fascist organisations in the first half of the 20th century, although the New Zealand Legion was sometimes accused of having fascist leanings. There were no real equivalents to the British Union of Fascists or the Silver Legion of America, although certain individuals, notably Lionel Terry and Arthur Nelson Field, promoted white supremacist ideals. In the post- war period, however, a number of fascist organisations became active. In 1968, the fascist activist Colin King-Ansell was jailed for an attack on a synagogue. The following year, he established the National Socialist Party of New Zealand, and contested a number of elections under its banner. Later, he led a group called the National Socialist White People's Party, modelled after the party established by George Lincoln Rockwell in the United States. In 1979, King-Ansell was fined for breaching the Race Relations Act by distributing several thousand anti-Semitic leaflets. Another allegedly fascist group established in this period was the New Zealand National Front (NZNF). The National Front was established by Brian Thompson of Ashburton in 1968, although its initial operations were erratic. Eventually, in 1989, a new organisation called the Conservative Front (founded by Anton Foljambe) absorbed the National Front and adopted its name. The now-defunct New Zealand Democratic Nationalist Party also dates from this time period. In 1981, a group called the New Force was founded. One of its founders and a member of its directorates was Kerry Bolton, who was also involved in the NZNF. In 1983, the New Force was renamed the Nationalist Workers Party. In 1981, a visit by South Africa's rugby team generated huge controversy due to South Africa's apartheid policies at the time. Colin King-Ansell and a number of other fascist figures took part in counter-demonstrations against anti-tour protesters. In the 1990s, there was something of a resurgence in New Zealand fascism. A number of gangs with fascist views, notably Unit 88, gained considerable public attention. Colin King-Ansell was once again involved, although he distanced himself from Unit 88 when the media focused on it. Later, in March 1997, King-Ansell founded the New Zealand Fascist Union, which described itself as being more closely modelled on Mussolini's Italy and Perón's Argentina than on Nazi Germany. The Fascist Union at one time claimed to have 500 members, the necessary number for official party registration, but the Union was never registered. Also in 1997, Anton Foljambe resigned as leader of the National Front. Kyle Chapman resigned as leader in May 2005, and he and Foljambe have since established the moderate National Democrats Party. Kyle Chapman has established the Right Wing Resistance (RWR), an openly White Pride skinhead organization. The RWR has been distributing pamphlets throughout Christchurch, Auckland, Hastings, Nelson, Invercargill, Wellington and Palmerston North. RWR join with the National Front and small organisations at demonstrations. The introduction of black uniforms along the lines of Fascist Italy and the British Union of Fascists is now in place. 21st century Foljambe resigned from the National Democrats Party in 2007 and since then the party has been defunct. Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the Australian-born perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, was an admitted fascist who followed eco-fascism and admired Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British fascist organization British Union of Fascists (BUF), who is also quoted in the shooter's manifesto The Great Replacement (named after the French far-right theory of the same name).

The idea of a mosaic, in which each cultural group retained a distinct identity and still contributed to the nation as a whole, was in contrast to the melting pot, a popular metaphor for the more assimilationist American approach to immigration. The idea of a mosaic of cultures forming a nation was adopted by Canadian sociologist John Porter in his study of social class, entitled: Vertical Mosaic: An Analysis of Social Class and Power in Canada.

It is frequently used as a synonym for originalism; while original intent is indeed one theory in the originalist family, it has some salient differences which has led originalists from more predominant schools of thought such as original meaning to distinguish original intent as much as legal realists do. Approach Original intent maintains that in interpreting a text, a court should determine what the authors of the text were trying to achieve, and to give effect to what they intended the statute to accomplish, the actual text of the legislation notwithstanding. As in purposivism, tools such as legislative history are often used. Problems =Originalist criticisms of original intent proponents (and some proposed rebuttals)= Despite the potential confusion of terms between the original Intent and originalism, other schools of Originalist thought have been as critical of original intent as non-Originalists. * Original intent presumes that there is a single, unified intent behind a text. In the case of the United States Constitution, the Philadelphia Convention was composed of over fifty men, who spent an entire summer compromising and arguing over provisions that were interpreted very differently the moment the Constitution's text became public. It is far from clear, therefore, that those fifty-plus men had – i.e., agreed upon – a single original intent of the text, or whether their purposes in drafting the Constitution were predicated on personal self-interest. (There is no meaning from an originalist perspective without intent. That is, it is impossible to interpret anything which has no intent, according to originalism. Lawmakers either have no intent, one intent, or multiple intents. But these multiple intents are always consistent, otherwise the law can have no meaning.) * Even if the Convention did have a single, unified intent, it is unclear how it could reliably be determined from two centuries' distance. (That may be, but what _can_ often be determined is that an interpretation being considered is inconsistent with the original intent even though the exact intent is not known.) * Many of the clauses of the Constitution are relative, and thus specifically defy any claim that it is possible to divine a single, indisputable outcome to any specific problem or dispute. Key passages in the Constitution were originally cast as flexible evaluations, such as \\"due process,\\" a phrase that suggests the definitions, requirements and dimensions of court or other governmental proceedings sufficient in any given context to permit citizens to be deprived of their rights were never intended to be fixed forever. (A single indisputable decision is never the outcome using any other jurisprudence. This is an argument against making any decision at all. The judge must merely make his best effort to decide in a manner which is consistent with the intent of the framers or authors of legislation, so far as he can ascertain it.) * In the case of US Federal Law, law is made by majority vote in two chambers, and is then signed by the President. 536 people are therefore potentially involved in this process, and not one of them needs to share the same intentions as any other of them in order to play their part in ratifying the bill. They need only vote; their vote will count the same if they share the same intent as their colleagues, if they do not share the intent of their colleagues, and indeed, if they have no particular intention, and are voting solely because their party whip handed them a note saying \\"be on the Senate floor at 9:36pm and say 'Aye'.\\" Their vote will count even if they are falling-down drunk or if they have not even read the bill under consideration. All of which is to say that giving effect to the intent of the legislature not only presumes that there is a singular intent – no less dubious an assertion where statutes are concerned than where the Constitution is – but, worse yet, the very diversity of these bodies may permit a judge to corrupt his inquiry by finding a floor statement or committee report which suggests an intent that the Judge thinks would be a good result. (The intent can be ascertained so far as the authors of the legislation or other less authoritative contemporary sources said what it was) * Original intent may fall afoul of formalist theories of law, which explicitly decline interest in how a law is made, an inquiry which is obviously at the core of an original intent inquiry. * Original intent cannot be reconciled against Textualism. Most of those who are originalists in Constitutional matters are also textualists in statutory matters, and textualism rejects the value of the intentions of the legislature in passing a text. If one adopts originalism as an \\"error-correcting lens which fits over textualism to account for the passage of time,\\" one cannot adopt an originalist theory which is incoherent with the underlying textualism. Other schools of thought In Canada, the predominant school of thought for legal interpretation is the living tree doctrine, under which interpretations can evolve along with the society, to deal with new conditions that were different or did not exist when the Constitution was framed.

The Convention was concluded 25 October 1980 and entered into force between the signatories on 1 December 1983. The Convention was drafted to ensure the prompt return of children who have been abducted from their country of habitual residence or wrongfully retained in a contracting state not their country of habitual residence.Hague Convention, Preamble. The primary intention of the Convention is to preserve whatever status quo child custody arrangement existed immediately before an alleged wrongful removal or retention thereby deterring a parent from crossing international boundaries in search of a more sympathetic court. The Convention applies only to children under the age of 16. As of July 2019, 101 states are party to the convention. In 2019, Guyana and Barbados acceded to the convention. Procedural nature The convention does not alter any substantive rights. The convention requires that a court in which a Hague Convention action is filed should not consider the merits of any underlying child custody dispute, but should determine only that country in which those issues should be heard. Return of the child is to the member country rather than specifically to the left-behind parent. The convention requires the return of a child who was a \\"habitual resident\\" in a contracting party immediately before an action that constitutes a breach of custody or access rights.Hague Convention, Article 4. The convention provides that all contracting states, as well as any judicial and administrative bodies of those contracting states, \\"shall act expeditiously in all proceedings seeking the return of a children\\" and that those institutions shall use the most expeditious procedures available to the end that final decision be made within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings.Hague Convention, Article 11. Wrongful removal or retention The Convention provides that the removal or retention of a child is \\"wrongful\\" whenever: These rights of custody may arise by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of the country of habitual residence.Hague Convention, Article 3. > From the Convention's standpoint, the removal of a child by one of the joint > holders without the consent of the other, is ... wrongful, and this > wrongfulness derives in this particular case, not from some action in breach > of a particular law, but from the fact that such action has disregarded the > rights of the other parent which are also protected by law, and has > interfered with their normal exercise.Elisa Pérez Vera, Explanatory Report: > Hague Conference on Private International Law, in 3 Acts and Documents of > the Fourteenth Session (\\"Explanatory Report\\"), 71, at 447–48 Habitual residence The Convention mandates return of any child who was \\"habitually resident\\" in a contracting nation immediately before an action that constitutes a breach of custody. The Convention does not define the term \\"habitual residence,\\" but it is not intended to be a technical term. Instead, courts should broadly read the term in the context of the Convention's purpose to discourage unilateral removal of a child from that place in which the child lived when removed or retained, which should generally be understood as the child's \\"ordinary residence.\\" The child's \\"habitual residence\\" is not determined after the incident alleged to constitute a wrongful removal or retention. A parent cannot unilaterally create a new habitual residence by wrongfully removing or sequestering a child. Because the determination of \\"habitual residence\\" is primarily a \\"fact based\\" determination and not one which is encumbered by legal technicalities, the court must look at those facts, the shared intentions of the parties, the history of the children's location and the settled nature of the family prior to the facts giving rise to the request for return.Mozes v. Mozes, 239 F.3d 1067, 1073 (US 9th Cir. 2001) Case details on the INCADAT website Special rules of evidence The Convention provides special rules for admission and consideration of evidence independent of the evidentiary standards set by any member nation. Article 30 provides that the Application for Assistance, as well as any documents attached to that application or submitted to or by the Central Authority are admissible in any proceeding for a child's return.Hague Convention, Article 30 The Convention also provides that no member nation can require legalization or other similar formality of the underlying documents in context of a Convention proceeding.Hague Convention, Article 23. Furthermore, the court in which a Convention action is proceeding \\"may take notice directly of the law of, and of judicial or administrative decisions, formally recognized or not in the State of habitual residence of the child, without recourse to the specific procedures for the proof of that law or for the recognition of foreign decisions which would otherwise be applicable\\" when determining whether there is a wrongful removal or retention under the Convention.Hague Convention, Article 14 Limited defenses to return The Convention limits the defenses against return of a wrongfully removed or retained child. To defend against the return of the child, the defendant must establish to the degree required by the applicable standard of proof (generally determined by the lex fori, i.e. the law of the state where the court is located): (a) that Petitioner was not \\"actually exercising custody rights at the time of the removal or retention\\" under Article 3; or (b) that Petitioner \\"had consented to or acquiesced in the removal or retention\\" under Article 13; or (c) that more than one year has passed from the time of wrongful removal or retention until the date of the commencement of judicial or administrative proceedings, under Article 12; or (d) that the child is old enough and has a sufficient degree of maturity to knowingly object to being returned to the Petitioner and that it is appropriate to heed that objection, under Article 13; or (e) that \\"there is grave risk that the child's return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation,\\" under Article 13(b); or (f) that return of the child would subject the child to violation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, under Article 20. State parties Signature and ratification of Japan in 2014 As of July 2019, there are 101 parties to the Convention.https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/status- table/?cid=24 The last state to accede to the Convention was Barbados in 2019.

Early life Whyos Gang A prominent member of the Whyos Gang, a New York City street gang, Lyons led the gang with co-leader Danny Driscoll at their height during the late nineteenth century. Lyons, who was hired for crimes ranging from assault to murder, also supported three prostitutes, Lizzie the Dove, Bunty Kate, and Gentle Maggie. When the three women were unable to earn enough money Lyons hired Kitty McGown away from rival pimp Joseph Quinn. Murder of Joseph Quinn Joseph Quinn soon began looking for Lyons and on July 5, 1887, Lyons killed Quinn during a gunfight between them. Lyons was captured several months later and, while it seemed to be self-defense on the part of Lyons, he was executed by hanging on August 21, 1888. However, it has been suspected local authorities used the incident as an excuse to execute the well known criminal. While Kitty McGown and Bunty Kate quickly found another pimp, Lizzie the Dove and Gentle Maggie went into mourning. The two later got into an argument while toasting Lyons at a Bowery tavern and Gentle Maggie stabbed Lizzie the Dove in the throat, killing her. As Lizzie the Dove lay dying she was said to have told Gentle Maggie that she would \\"meet you in hell and there scratch your eyes out\\". Death Danny Lyons was executed in The Tombs Prison in New York City on August 21, 1888. Danny Lyons was held in the Tombs Prison during the murder trial of Joseph Quinn and was later executed there like his co-leader of the Whyos Gang, Danny Driscoll.

Opened in 1926, it is a major provider of both in-patient and out-patient medical services. Attached to Strong is the 190-bed Golisano Children's Hospital, which serves infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21. SMH is owned and operated by the University of Rochester and serves as its primary teaching hospital. It offers programs toward medical, dental, or graduate degrees through the School of Medicine and Dentistry. The hospital anchors the University's health care delivery network in the Rochester area. It serves as a primary community hospital and a regional trauma center for the Rochester area. Also part of the network are Golisano Children's Hospital, and URMC affiliate Highland Hospital. SMH offers care in 40 different specialties and is ranked as one of \\"America's Best Hospitals\\" by U.S. News & World Report, and has won the Consumer Choice Award for the best hospital in the area for 12 consecutive years. Strong has signature programs in cardiac care, cancer care, neurology, orthopedics and pediatrics. As an affiliated academic research hospital, patients have access to the latest treatments before they are widely available elsewhere. SMH is composed of a series of attached buildings. The different sections of the facility range from 3 to 11 floors, although not all areas are accessible to the public. The hospital offers 886 patient beds. Strong provides emergency medical services. SMH is a teaching hospital and patients may expect to interact with faculty, residents, fellows, interns and/or medical students. Human experimentation From 1945 to 1947, Strong was the site of non-consensual human experimentation programs under supervision of the Manhattan Project and its successor, the United States Atomic Energy Commission. A building adjacent to the hospital and connected to it via tunnel, dubbed the \\"Manhattan Annex,\\" was constructed in 1943 as a field office for the Manhattan Project. Over a period of two years starting in 1945, a total of seventeen patients admitted to Strong for unrelated ailments were injected with a plutonium or uranium solution without their knowledge. The Atomic Energy Commission tracked the patients for the rest of their lives; after their deaths, the Commission exhumed their remains for testing. Surviving patients were later informed of the true nature of the experiments in 1974. In recent years, federal regulations for human subject protection and ethical codes for research have been rigorously rewritten, in light of this experiment and others around the nation. Strong Memorial Hospital now has a unified human research protection program which has become a national leader in developing oversight programs to protect people who participate in research studies. In 2007 the University received the highest level of accreditation possible after demonstrating that extensive safeguards, exceeding federal regulations, were built into every level of its research operation. The Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs (AAHRPP), an independent accrediting body based in Washington, D.C., granted a renewal of the approval in 2010 after an extensive review that included an intensive on-site inspection. The University's oversight program includes all human research studies, even those that are exempt from regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Food and Drug Administration.

Like the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Children's Charter is a comprehensive instrument that sets out rights and defines universal principles and norms for the status of children. The ACRWC and the CRC are the only international and regional human rights treaties that cover the whole spectrum of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. It calls for the creation of an African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (Committee of Experts). Its mission is to promote and protect the rights established by the ACRWC, to practice applying these rights, and to interpret the disposition of the ACRWC as required of party states, African Union (AU) institutions, or all other institutions recognized by AU or by a member state.  Focus on children's rights in Africa  Children in Africa are affected by many different types of abuse, including economic and sexual exploitation, gender discrimination in education and access to health, and their involvement in armed conflict. Other factors affecting African children include migration, early marriage, differences between urban and rural areas, child-headed households, street children and poverty. Furthermore, child workers in Sub-Saharan Africa account for about 80 million children or 4 out of every 10 children under 14 years old which is the highest child labour rate in the world. The ACRWC defines a \\"child\\" as a human being below the age of 18 years. It recognises the child's unique and privileged place in African society and that African children need protection and special care. It also acknowledges that children are entitled to the enjoyment of freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, thought, religion, and conscience. It aims to protect the private life of the child and safeguard the child against all forms of economic exploitation and against work that is hazardous, interferes with the child's education, or compromises his or her health or physical, social, mental, spiritual, and moral development. It calls for protection against abuse and bad treatment, negative social and cultural practices, all forms of exploitation or sexual abuse, including commercial sexual exploitation, and illegal drug use. It aims to prevent the sale and trafficking of children, kidnapping, and begging of children.  Children's Charter vs. Convention on the Rights of the Child  The Children's Charter originated because the member states of the AU believed that the CRC missed important socio-cultural and economic realities particular to Africa. It emphasises the need to include African cultural values and experiences when dealing with the rights of the child in such as: * Challenging traditional African views which often conflict with children's rights such as child marriage, parental rights and obligations towards their children, and children born out of wedlock * Expressly saying that the Children's Charter is higher than any custom, tradition, cultural or religious practice that doesn't fit with the rights, duties and obligations in the Charter * The Children's Charter has a clearer definition of the child as a person aged under 18 years old * Outright prohibition on the recruitment of children (i.e. under 18 years old) in armed conflict and deals with conscription of children into the armed forces * Prohibiting marriages or betrothals involving children * Prohibiting the use of children as beggars * Granting girls the right to return to school after pregnancy * Promoting affirmative action for girls' education * Tackling specific African issues that affect children. For example, it called for the confrontation and abolishment of apartheid and similar systems; and although, apartheid is now over, this provision is still applicable to children living under regimes practicing ethnic, religious or other forms of discrimination * Protecting internally displaced and refugee children * Protecting imprisoned expectant mothers and mothers of infants and young children * Providing a way for children themselves to petition the Children's Charter's Committee of Experts regarding infringements of their rights * Including special reference to care of the child by extended families * Encouraging the state to provide support for parents \\"in times of need\\" * Protecting handicapped children. The fundamental principles guiding implementation of these rights include: * Non- discrimination * The best interests of the child * The life, survival and development of the child * Child participation * Providing for the responsibilities that every child has with regard to their and society, the state and the international community.  Ratification of the Children's Charter  As of 2016, the ACRWC has been ratified by 47 of the 54 states of the African Union, and signed but not ratified by the remaining seven states. Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, South Sudan, and Tunisia have signed but not ratified the Charter. Morocco, a non-AU member state, has also not ratified. Image: acrwc_au.jpg  Selected structures within the AU relating to the Children's Charter.

Image: acrwc_africa.jpg  Map of Africa showing the current status as at August 2008 of the Children's Charter.  Shortcoming and criticism  * It doesn't protect children from life imprisonment without the possibility of release * When dealing with criminal activities, there is no provision for alternative measures such as community rehabilitation * No mention of the rights such as to remain silent, to be protected from retroactive legislation, to challenge detention, or to be compensated for miscarriages of justice * Article 20 can be construed as supporting physical punishment by parents as it is unclear regarding the meaning of \\"domestic discipline;\\" * There is some confusion regarding Article 31 that deals with children's responsibilities. Children are required to respect parents, superiors and elders at all times which could conflict with the child's right to participate in decisions that affect them * The omission of a provision which requires countries to fully commit and use their resources means that the Children's Charter has no way to ensure or force states to provide resources to ensure the realisation of children's rights * Although the Children's Charter makes provision for special protection measures for the disabled, it fails to expressly include disability as a prohibited ground of discrimination * Unlike the CRC, which specifically ascribes rights to children of minorities, there is no similar provision in the African Charter, despite many countries in the region having significant populations of minority and indigenous groups.  African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (Committee of Experts)  The committee was formed in July 2001, one and half years after the Children's Charter came into force. The members are elected by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union. The criteria for the selection of members are: * Members must be nationals of a state party to the Children's Charter. * They must be individuals of high moral standing, integrity, impartiality and competence in matters of the rights and welfare of the child. * Members are nominated by signatory countries and elected by the Assembly of Heads of State of the African Union. * Members are elected for a term of five years and serve voluntarily in their individual capacity. They may not be re-elected. The Committee of Experts meets twice each year, usually in May and November in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The exact dates depend on other items on the AU agenda around these times. They are empowered to receive and examine the country (\\"state\\") reports on the measures they have adopted to implement the provisions of the Children's Charter as well as the progress achieved regarding how the rights are being protected. The final protective function of the Committee of Experts is related to the investigations procedure. They are empowered to resort to any appropriate method of investigation in respect of any issue covered in the Children's Charter.  Members of the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child  The current members of the ACERWC are (name, country, position): * Mr. Benyam Dawit Mezmur, Ethiopia, Chairperson * Mrs.Fatima Delladj-Sebaa, Algeria, 1st Vice- President * Prof Julia Sloth-Nielsen, South Africa, 2nd Vice President * Mr. Clement Julius Mashamba, Tanzania, 3rd Vice-President * Mr. Alfas Muvavarigwa Chitakunye, Zimbabwe, Rapporteur * Mr. Cyprien Adébayo, Benin, Member; (former 1st Vice President 2010-2012) * Mrs. Agnès Kabore, Burkina Faso, Member;(former Chairperson 2010-2012) * Mr. Andrianirainy Rasamoely, Madagascar, Member * Mrs. Maryam Uwais, Nigeria, Member * Mrs. Amal Muhammad El Henqari, Libya, Member * Mrs. Félicité Muhimpundu, Rwanda, Member As at October 2008, the elected Committee of Experts were (name, country, position): * Ms. Seynabou Ndiaye Diakhate, Sénégal, Chairperson * Ms. Marie Chantal Koffi Appoh, Côte d'Ivoire, Vice-Chairperson * Ms Boipelo Lucia Seitlhamo, Botswana, Rapporteur * Hon. Justice Martha Koome, Kenya, Member * Mrs. Mamosebi T. Pholo, Lesotho, Member * Mr. Moussa Sissoko, Mali, Member * Mrs. Dawlat Ibrahim Hassan, Egypt, Member * Mr. Cyprien Adébayo, Benin, Member * Mrs. Agnès Kabore, Burkina Faso, Member * Mr. Andrianirainy Rasamoely, Madagascar, Member * Mrs. Maryam Uwais, Nigeria, Member  Challenges faced by the Committee of Experts  * Functional secretariat: K.F. Malindi Jr, Founder of The Rights Club and a human and child rights activist notes that the Committee of Experts have yet to establish a fully functional secretariat which means that it cannot carry out its activities or deal with communications as well as country reports. It suffers from a serious lack of resources * Attitude of member states: Many member states are unenthusiastic about the Children's Charter and are often unwilling to nominate suitable people to sit on the Committee of Experts. Often, the committee members resign midway through their term * Non-state reporting: A look at states’ reporting history to the Committee of Experts also shows non-commitment by countries to fulfil their treaty obligations in respect of the Children's Charter. The responsibility for preparing and submitting country reports differ from country to country, which makes it difficult for the Committee of Experts to follow up with defaulting states * The rule of pendency & appropriate bodies: Cases cannot be tried or investigated at the same time in two or more human rights bodies. Thus once a case has been brought before the Committee of Experts, it has to remain there until the legal process has been exhausted. The problem is that it takes an average of two and a half years for cases to be decided by the Committee of Experts * Other problems: Other important setback identified are the constant lack of legal counsel present at sessions of the Committee to give legal guidance on decisions being taken by the Committee; lack of coordinated cooperation and communication between the African Commission and the Committee and the non- prioritising by the AU of the work of the Committee resulting in delays and cancellation of sessions.  State party reporting  Countries which have ratified the Children's Charter must submit initial reports within two years of ratification or the entry into force of the Charter and every three years thereafter. In 2008, the Committee of Experts started the process of reviewing the first four state reports that had been received from Egypt, Mauritius, Nigeria and Rwanda in May 2008. The state party report must contain specific information pertaining to children in their country. This includes political, legal, administrative issues that are linked to the requirements of the structure supplied by the Committee of Experts. Ideally it should be a comprehensive report that includes input from the state, civil society and other recognised bodies at the regional, continental, international levels. But usually, the state report doesn't include much information from civil society. So civil society organisations can submit a second or \\"alternative\\" report that contains the information that they have gathered. Until very recently, this \\"alternative\\" report could only be accepted after the state had submitted their report. But now a process has been put into place whereby the state is given 18 months to submit their report, failing that, the \\"alternative,\\" civil society report will be accepted as that state's report. Once received, the report then becomes available as a public document and it undergoes a process of: * Elaboration: The elaboration process is the first process that occurs. The Committee of Experts determines the report's completeness, representativeness, its conformity to the guidelines, etc. and specific information is extracted regarding the children's rights * Consideration: The consideration process examines the reports to determine if the information supplied reflects the true situation in the country as a kind \\"photocopy\\" or \\"clear picture\\" at that point in time. This includes determining if there are any gaps or inconsistencies in the information supplied in both the official and the alternative reports * Follow-up: The follow-up process is where the state and civil society are contacted again to explain and complete any discrepancies or missing information. Further information and interviews may be required before the Committee is satisfied * Submission to the AU. Once the State Party and Alternative reports have been finalised, they are submitted to AU Secretariat for translation into the other working languages (English, French, Portuguese and Arabic). Then different Committee of Expert members review the report in a pre-sessional working group in order to identify issues for further discussion with the state and request for any other information that may help when considering the report. Other organisations, civil society organisations, UN groups, who have contributed alternative reports or who are considered relevant may be invited to attend the session on an informal basis. This is where civil society organisations can bring information to the process. A pre- sessional report is produced after this meeting. After the pre-sessional report has been produced, the members who have been appointed to review the State Party / Alternative Report meet to discuss an in-depth review of the report. Their findings are submitted to the respective state concerned and discussed with high level government representatives. There is no non- governmental organisation or civil society input at this level. As a result of the in depth discussion, the Committee of Experts will identify problems, progress and differences in implementation of the Children's Charter by the State Party. These recommendations are called \\"concluding observations\\" and may include the following: * The steps that need to be taken * Agree on recommendations * Suggest unique decisions suitable for each country * Changes in the country since the report was prepared * Follow-ups by the Committee of Experts to obtain more information or clarity. After the initial State Party / Alternative report has been accepted, the state will then have to submit additional reports every 3 years. These reports are called \\"periodic reports.\\" This will allow for comparison with the previous report to determine whether there has been progress or if the situation has worsened. There may also be follow-ups and country visits. The State Party / Alternative Report and recommendations are sent to the Summit of the Heads of States and Government. Civil society is also able to intervene every 3 years to encourage the state to make improvements ahead of the preparation of additional reports.  Observer status for civil society organisations  Civil society organisations and international institutions have played a significant role in the work of the Committee of Experts and they have served as the backbone of the committee's work since inception. International non-governmental organizations have been particularly involved in the work of the committee, providing different kinds of expertise and financial support to most of the work. Although civil society organisation involvement was minimal in the beginning, over the intervening years they have since taken a pivotal role in ensuring that the committee fulfills its mandate and in providing the necessary support needed to facilitate its work. The adoption of the guidelines for granting observer status will now also ensure that more civil society organisations are able to formally participate and contribute in the process. According to the proposed guidelines for observer status, some of the ways civil society organisations and associations will be allowed to participate will include: * Attending opening and closing ceremonies of the Committee of Experts sessions * Participating in the committee's meetings * Accessing documents that are not confidential and do not deal with issues concerning the observers * Being invited to participate in closed sessions dealing with issues that concern them * Making statements on issues that concern them, provided the statement has been sent to the committee in advance * Responding to questions they may be asked in meetings. The guidelines encourage the formation of coalitions by civil society organisations with similar objectives. The following are the requirements for the participation of civil society organisations for observer status are: * They must be registered in a member state with the mandate to carry out regional and international activities * Must have been registered for a minimum of three years * Must have done work in the defence of children's rights * They must have a recognised headquarters, democratically adopted statutes and a representative structure * They must submit a list of documentation to aid their application at least three months before a session of the Committee of Experts. Once the organisation has obtained observer status, it may request the Committee of Experts to include issues of interest on their agenda and to make oral statements at the sessions. They are entitled to receive information on the time, location and agenda of the sessions of the committee. The committee can invite a civil society organisation to participate in the deliberations of the meetings of the committee without a voting right. The civil society organisations are also under an obligation to establish close relations with the committee and to hold regular consultations on all issues of common interest. Civil society organisations are required to submit reports on their activities every two years. When civil society organisations default on their obligations, the committee may suspend or withdraw the observer status.  Communications to the Committee of Experts  A communication is a complaint submitted to the Committee of Experts regarding a violation of the rights of children under the Children's Charter. The following are some guidelines for those wanting to submit a communication to the Committee of Experts: * A communication may be submitted by individuals, groups, associations, non-governmental organizations, etc. * These individuals or groups MUST be recognised by the state, AU or international body * The state is excluded from the complaints process * Any violation of child rights may be considered * The country where the violation has occurred must be a signatory of the Children's Charter.  Specific requirements of a communication  A communication must meet the following criteria: * It cannot not be anonymous * It must be written * It must be submitted within a reasonable deadline or timeframe, depending on the nature of the complaint * It must be written in a reasonable and non-defamatory tone * It must be compatible with the AU rules and laws or the Children's Charter * It must not be exclusively based on information in the media * Issues must not have been already decided by another investigation, procedure or international regulation * It must only be submitted when all local / domestic remedies have been exhausted or when the author of the communication is not satisfied with the solution provided at the local / domestic level * The Committee of Experts can also review its own decision in a communication where the complainant can provide additional information to support his/her case * The Committee of Experts can receive a communication from a non-State Party (e.g. civil society organisation, individual, group of people) if it is in the best interest of the child. If the communication meets the above requirements, then it may be considered by the Committee of Experts. When a complaint reaches the committee, a group will be assigned to work on it to decide if it is acceptable. If it is acceptable then they will give feedback both to the country where the problem is located. If there are gaps, then the committee will ask the country to take measures to protect the complainant while it is being investigated further. The work on the complaint is confidential and is held in closed session debates. Once a decision has been taken, a communication is sent to the country's state department. A member on the Committee of Experts is designated to follow up and coordinate the process. Once the process has been completed, a report is sent to the Committee of the Heads of State and Government. Children who are the authors or who are the victims in the communication process now have an opportunity to express their opinions to the Committee of Experts. This provision guarantees the cardinal principle of child participation in issues concerning them.  Investigations  Investigations may be initiated because the Committee of Experts has received a communication indicating a serious violation. Investigation missions can be initiated either by a state referring a matter to the Committee of Experts, or the committee can undertake its own investigations, although the Committee may only visit a State Party if invited to do so by the government. To ensure the investigative mission team has background knowledge of the situation, a preliminary report according to certain guidelines and based on available information is prepared before each investigation. The mission will meet with available state and non-state organisations and people in the country where they will be investigating. Once the mission has finished its investigation, it has to release a preliminary result to the government and the media in the country of investigation. A final report is then prepared which incorporates the mission's recommendations. This mission report must be attached to the progress report of the Committee to the African Heads of State and Government. The country that has been investigated has up to 6 months after the adoption of a decision by the Committee of Experts to submit a written reply on what they have done regarding the requirements or measures in the mission report. The country's response should also include information on any measures in reaction to the recommendations made by the Committee after the mission. Civil society organisations and ‘specialised institutions’ like children's civil society organisations could also be requested to provide information on the situation of children in that state.

Its use is thought to have begun in the 18th century and to have reached its height of popularity throughout the 19th and into the early 20th centuries. When unmounted from a musket or rifle, sword bayonets with their typical hilts and long blades also could be wielded as short swords. While modern military bayonets typically have knife blades, they are usually too short to be called sword bayonets and are more akin to fighting/utility knives. History Japanese Type 30 bayonet (made between 1894 and 1945), an example of a straight-edged sword bayonet. Sword bayonets originated for use with muzzle-loading rifles. A typical example of an early sword bayonet is the 58 centimetre (23 inch) blade variety designed for the Infantry rifle, later called the Baker rifle of the Napoleonic era British Army. Most infantry would routinely keep bayonets fixed to their inaccurate smooth bore muskets throughout a battle. Close order ranks and squares presented a hedge of bayonets to the enemy, which was especially useful for deterring cavalry. But a fixed bayonet - a pound or so of extra metal on the front of a firearm - seriously affects a firearm’s balance and hampers accurate shooting. However, Mosin-Nagant rifles using cruciform and dagger bayonets were arsenal zeroed with them affixed (or extended) as they affect point-of-impact via barrel harmonics, and in the case of Imperial Russian and Soviet battle doctrine dictated they were always affixed (with few exceptions). A rifleman usually fought without a fixed bayonet since accuracy was the whole purpose of their rifled weapon. He therefore required a side-arm that could be drawn and used instantly in an emergency so his bayonet had a cutting edge and a grippable hilt. That such bayonets were far heavier than standard socket bayonets was not a disadvantage since they were rarely fixed. Most riflemen found it worked better for cutting brush and roasting meat over a fire (See Rifleman Harris, Costello's, Simmons's diaries). On occasion riflemen did form up in close order. Since rifles were shorter than muskets their bayonets needed to be longer to produce the same total length; the sword bayonet answered this need. As well as rifle regiments, other soldiers whose battlefield role did not involve standing shoulder to shoulder in ranks, notably sergeants, also came to use sword bayonets. By the end of the nineteenth century all infantry had become riflemen and the sword bayonet had become the standard infantry bayonet. Bayonets lost their popularity after World War I. While sword bayonets can be effective as short swords, they proved to be too unwieldy in cramped quarters in trench warfare, although spike bayonets continued to be used throughout most of the 20th century. A shorter version of the sword bayonet, the knife bayonet, was developed. Today, the majority of modern bayonets are knife bayonets. Uses French bayonet charge taken just before the Great War. Note the long needle-like épée bayonet, for the French Lebel Model 1886 rifle. With the appearance of the hiltless sword bayonet, such as the socket-mounted variety, their use on the end of the musket or rifle also became a hindrance during the reloading of the muzzle-loaded longarm, (a common problem to all muzzle-loading infantry weapons). A bayonet of similar style and dimension was used on the Lee–Enfield rifle of the early 20th century. The advantages of sword bayonets over spike bayonets are evident. Where a spike bayonet turns the rifle into a spear, a sword bayonet turns it into a glaive. Unlike spike bayonets, which can be used only for thrusting, sword bayonets can also be used for slashing, except for the épée bayonets. Twisting a sword bayonet in the wound was especially lethal. Before the advent of modern medicine after World War I, a soldier struck by a sword bayonet was very unlikely to survive. Variants While most sword bayonets have straight blades, a popular variant in the 19th century featured sinuous, S-curved blades like those found on the Balkan's and Middle-East's sword called the yataghan. Today, sword bayonets of this style are said to have \\"yataghan\\" blades, or to be \\"yataghan-bladed\\".

Early life Sally Quinn was born in Savannah, Georgia, to Lt. General William Wilson \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Quinn (November 1, 1907 – September 11, 2000) and his wife, Sara Bette Williams (January 27, 1918 – September 26, 2004). Both are buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Quinn has two siblings—Donna of Oakland, California, and William Jr. of Phoenix, Arizona. Her father was an infantry officer who also served as an intelligence officer and played a key role in the transition of the United States' intelligence service from the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As a US Army colonel in World War II, he helped coordinate the invasion of southern France in 1944 and captured Hermann Göring. Though he was not present, his regiment liberated Dachau concentration camp; he arrived the next day, when he heard the news. From 1964 to 1966, he commanded the Seventh Army in Germany. Quinn wrote about his career in an autobiography, Buffalo Bill Remembers. For many years, the Quinns lived on Connecticut Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C., where Bette Quinn was known for her cooking and entertaining. Sally Quinn reported in CC Goldwater's HBO film Mr. Conservative that Senator Barry Goldwater spent much time with the Quinns, often staying at their home, since his wife decided to remain in Arizona rather than D.C. while Congress was in session. Quinn attended and graduated from Smith College in 1963. Career =Newspaper journalism= A Savannah, Georgia, native and Smith College graduate, Quinn began at The Washington Post with very little experience: reportedly called by Ben Bradlee after a report of her pajama party in celebration of the election to Congress of Barry Goldwater Jr., the job interview included the following exchange. > \\"Can you show me something you've written?\\" asked Managing Editor Benjamin > Bradlee. \\"I've never written anything,\\" admitted Quinn. Pause. \\"Well,\\" said > Bradlee, \\"nobody's perfect.\\" (A profile in Vanity Fair attributes the > \\"Nobody's perfect\\" line to editorial-page editor Philip L. Geyelin.) However, Quinn soon demonstrated, as a reporter for the paper's style section, a talent for drawing out the subjects of her interviews and profiles. Henry Kissinger said, \\"[The Post reporter] Maxine Cheshire makes you want to commit murder. Sally Quinn makes you want to commit suicide.\\" A notable incident of her career was her claim that Zbigniew Brzezinski, then the National Security Advisor, jokingly opened his fly in front of a reporter, a claim The Post retracted the following day. Quinn was critical of President Bill Clinton during the impeachment trial, stating that he had \\"fouled the nest\\". Quinn had a long-standing animus for the Clintons, possibly due to a perceived snub by First Lady Hillary Clinton, who declined a party invitation from Quinn.Salon  Media Circus: The (not so) mighty Quinn Regarding Whitewater Independent Counsel Ken Starr, she wrote: \\"Similarly, independent counsel Ken Starr is not seen by many Washington insiders as an out-of-control prudish crusader. Starr is a Washington insider, too. He has lived and worked here for years. He had a reputation as a fair and honest judge. He has many friends in both parties. Their wives are friendly with one another and their children go to the same schools.\\"TWM – The Clinton-Lewinsky Obsession/Gitlin Harry Jaffe wrote in Salon that Quinn's condemnation of Bill Clinton's adultery rang hollow coming from someone who broke up the marriage of her boss Ben Bradlee before going on to marry Bradlee herself. On February 19, 2010, The Washington Post published \\"Sally Quinn's The Party: No 'dueling' Bradlee weddings, just scheduling mistake\\",Quinn's column was canceled after this article in print and online. The column alluded to Bradlee family dysfunction, and discussed her son's wedding, which she scheduled on the same day as the wedding of her husband's granddaughter. The column was considered inappropriate and reader backlash was immediate, criticizing Quinn for airing family laundry and Washington Post editors for printing it. By February 24, the Post canceled her column, which had been appearing in the religion section of the print edition.\\"Wedded dis for Bradlee brood\\" Boston Herald February 18, 2010\\"Sally Quinn Loses Washington Post Column After Wedding Drama\\" Medialite February 25, 2010 This was Quinn's last column for the printed newspaper. Quinn continued to write for the Post's Onfaith blog at least through 2015. She remains listed as a contributor.https://www.onfaith.co/onfaith/author/sally-quinn =Television journalism= In August 1973, Quinn tried her hand at television, joining CBS News reporter Hughes Rudd as co-anchor of the CBS Morning News.The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television, by Wesley Hyatt (Billboard Books, 1997) Ninety minutes before her television debut on August 6, 1973, Quinn collapsed while trying to fight the flu. Quinn's ad libs during the show's first week tended toward the inappropriate—in one episode, following a report on the children of California migrant farm workers, she quipped that child labor \\"was how I felt when my mother and father made me clean up my room.\\" Quinn left the CBS Morning News after the February 1, 1974, telecast. She chronicled her short television career in the bestselling book We're Going to Make You a Star. Personal life Grey Gardens, in January 2009 Quinn was the third wife of Ben Bradlee, her former boss at The Washington Post, until his death in 2014. They married on October 20, 1978. In 1979, Quinn and Bradlee purchased Grey Gardens in East Hampton, New York from Edith Bouvier Beale, known as \\"Little Edie,\\" for $220,000 () under the terms they were not to tear down the house. Little Edie told them \\"All it needs is a coat of paint!\\" The couple then spent several years remodeling the home and fully restored it to its former glory. In February 2017 Quinn put Grey Gardens on the markethttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/fashion/news/grey-gardens-real- estate-sally-quinn-summer-home-sale.html and sold it for $15.5 million on December 20, 2017.http://observer.com/2017/12/grey-gardens-east-hampton-home- sold/ Quinn and Bradlee had one child, Quinn Bradlee, born in 1982. Their son was born when Quinn was 41 and Bradlee was 61. In 2009, they appeared with Quinn on the Charlie Rose show on PBS and spoke of Quinn being born with velo- cardio-facial syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion and Shprintzen syndrome (named after Dr. Robert Shprintzen who first identified the disorder in 1978 and who also diagnosed Bradlee). Quinn wrote of her son's learning disabilities and attendance at special schools in a 2006 blog article \\"What My Son Taught Me About God.\\"\\"What My Son Taught Me About God\\", The Washington Post, December 7, 2006. In 2017 Quinn published a book entitled Finding Magic in which she described herself as a Christian who also believes in the occult and the power of magic. She recalled her growing up in a family of Scottish origin which practiced voodoo. She recalled her mother putting hexes on two people who later died. She further described performing hex magic herself on three people, two of whom died shortly after.https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/from-atheism-to-magic-sally-quinn-on- finding-spirituality/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/08/sally- quinn-has-cast-3-hexes-and-worries-they-worked/642621001/ =Other= In addition to her newspaper and television journalism, Quinn served as social secretary for Cherif Guellal.

It takes place on the magical continent of Ancaria, with characters of various races (dark elf, vampiress, dwarf, etc.) each with their own missions. More than 1.8 million copies of the game were sold worldwide. Two expansion packs were released for the game in 2004 and 2005. In 2008 Linux Game Publishing announced that they would port the game to the Linux operating system. Sacred was developed by Studio II Software and Ascaron Entertainment and published in 2004 by Encore in the USA release. Gameplay =Characters= Upon beginning the game, players are given a choice to start with one of six different character types:Gladiator, Dark Elf, Wood Elf, Vampiress, Battle-Mage and Seraphim. The Daemon and Dwarf were additional characters added in the expansion Sacred Underworld and included in Sacred Gold. Each character begins in a different part of the area around a town in Ancaria (the continent that Sacred takes place within), and with a different starting quest. For example, the Gladiator starts in a colosseum, enslaved by his master, while the Seraphim starts in a church. The Dark Elf starts on a cliff with a Wood Elf companion. Throughout the game, the characters all receive different sub-quests. Each character class is also restricted to a certain set of items, and has a different set of skills. To increase these skill levels, characters must find runes that correspond to those skills, a rather novel system in contrast to the more mainstream model of skill points. Some character classes have identical skills, but the runes from one class cannot be used to advance skills in another class. Runes may be traded and used for crafting. =Items= Sacred features a vast array of items that can be obtained from shops, various containers (chests, barrels, graves...), dead monsters or \\"magical hiding places\\" in many of the rocks and bushes throughout Ancaria, which are indicated by a yellow sparkle. Many of the items can be only equipped by one type of character, like wings, which can only be equipped by a Seraphim. There are also several potion types, such as the typical health heal, but there are other types, like Potions of Undead death, which stops Undead from reviving once players kill them, and \\"Potions of Concentration\\", which regenerate players' combo attacks so they can be used faster. There are no mana-heal potions in Sacred, because mana is not a feature of the game. Also, monsters occasionally drop a rune that increases a certain skill for a certain character, if used. If the player owns a horse several different types of saddles can be bought to be used on it. These saddles increase the speed, defense, and damage done by the horse. Only one horse may be owned at a time, and the horse can be damaged and killed. The names of items are in five different colors, (white, blue, yellow, brown, green) which represent different quality classes of equipment:'' Sometimes, a monster drops a set item. Much like in Diablo II these set items will become much more powerful when gathered together and are very useful and sought-after in multiplayer games. However, this is not to say that unique items are inferior to set items. Unique items are usually individually better than set items. Some items also can be imbued with better stats. If players take an item with a number of \\"slots,\\" indicated by small boxes in the inventory screen, they will be able to imbue it by taking it to a blacksmith and then using either jewellery, a rune, skeleton skull or one of the blacksmith's techniques on it up to as many times as there are slots in it. Once imbued players can remove one rune or piece of jewelry from it, but all other items in the slots are lost when they do this. Though players cannot use a rune or jewelry which is not of their class, they can socket it in an item to gain the benefit of its magical and possible stat-raising properties. =Skills= Every character in Sacred has a different set of skills that are available to them. The only way to obtain them is to find a rune of that particular skill and use it to make it available to use for players. Each character has between 11 and 22 different skills that can be unlocked and used. To increase their level in a skill, players must find another rune for that skill and use it. There are also several \\"combo masters\\" spread throughout Ancaria, which can combine up to four separate skills into a combo, which players can use in the game. The combo masters can also trade runes they cannot use or do not need for a rune of their choice. Setting =Storyline= A great Sakkara demon was conjured into existence by the necromancer Shaddar. The conjuring went wrong, and the Sakkara demon is now loose in the world of Ancaria. The heroes must find the five elements of Caesarian (wind, fire, earth, water, void), and use them to defeat the monster. They meet Prince Valor, and he thanks them for rescuing Wilbur and orders them to report to Baron DeMordre to bring reinforcements to stop the Orc invasion. The Baron betrays them and Wilbur is killed. With his dying breaths he warns the hero to report to the Prince that the Baron has betrayed them. The hero arrives at the orc invasion and finds most of Valor's troops have been slaughtered; only Sargent Treveille is left dying and tells the hero to find Baroness Vilyia - she knows where the prince is. They find Vilyia, and she leads them to Valor in the forest, where he and his surviving troops take refuge. Each hero has different objectives along the way, but eventually, they all lead up to this one final quest. After killing the traitor DeMordre and reclaiming the throne, the hero goes to the dungeon to summon the Sakkara demon and kills it. However, after claiming the heart of Ancaria, Shaddar reveals himself and captures Vilyia, and the hero pursues him into his castle to rescue Vilyia and defeat Shaddar. =Ancaria= The whole of Sacred takes place on the continent of Ancaria, where there are several towns and villages to be visited. Even when players begin the game more than 70% of Ancaria is already available to be traveled on. To the south of Ancaria, there is a vast desert and lava-ridden plains. In the north, there is a wall of mountains and an icy backdrop. In both the east and the west there are large forests, blocking the way and stopping further travel. In the game there is an option to buy horses, which can be used for faster travel and to battle opponents, but will not affect players' ability to traverse difficult terrain in most situations. Production The game was originally started by developer Ikarion as an adaptation of the role-playing game The Dark Eye. After Ikarion went defunct, Ascaron bought it out and continued the project with an original story, renaming it Sacred. Reception =Sales= Sacred was a commercial success. By August 2004, it had sold over 100,000 units in the United States and 400,000 units in Europe.https://web.archive.org/web/20051017061935/http://www.afjv.com/press0408/040810_sacred_plus.htm It sold 1.5 million units worldwide, including its expansion pack, by July 2006. GameStar highlighted it as a rare crossover hit for Germany, with significant sales volume outside German-speaking countries; as of 2006, it had sold 300,000 units in the United States. It received a \\"Platinum\\" award from the Asociación Española de Distribuidores y Editores de Software de Entretenimiento (aDeSe), for more than 80,000 sales in Spain during its first 12 months. Spain accounted for 250,000 units by 2006.https://web.archive.org/web/20111121091557/http://www.fxinteractive.com/noticias/not2006.htm Worldwide sales rose above 1.8 million copies by 2007 and 2 million by 2009.https://web.archive.org/web/20090813071738/https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/sacred-2 ndashfallen-angelice-blood-add-on-to-introduce-the-dragon-mage-along- with-new-questslocations-and-baddies In April 2004, it received a \\"Gold\\" certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Switzerland and Austria. It achieved \\"Platinum\\" status, for 250,000 sales, by early 2005.https://web.archive.org/web/20181130021548/http://beta.gamesmarkt.de/details/171093 =Critical reviews= Sacred garnered average to good reviews from the media. 1up called it \\"Diablo for masochists\\", while IGN called it \\"A diamond in the rough\\". The editors of PC Gamer US presented Sacred with their \\"Best Roleplaying Game 2004\\" award. Greg Vederman of the magazine wrote that it \\"provides the loot addict with a deliciously strong dose of the good stuff.\\" Expansion packs Sacred Plus is a free expansion pack released in October 2004. It adds 2 regions, monsters, quests, items. Sacred Underworld is an expansion pack developed by Studio II Software and Ascaron Entertainment, and released in August 2005. Two new characters were added next to the six existing ones: Daemon and Dwarf. The story picks up after the events in Sacred, taking your character to the Underworld of Ancaria to rescue baroness Vilya. On the review aggregator GameRankings, Underworld had an average score of 74% based on 12 reviews. On Metacritic, the game had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 10 reviews — indicating mixed or average reviews. Underworld was a finalist for PC Gamer USs \\"Best Expansion Pack 2005\\" award, which ultimately went to RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Soaked!. Jason Ocampo of GameSpot gave Underworld a rating of 7.0 out of 10, saying the game is \\"an example of a Diablo-like action role-playing game taken to the extreme.\\" Comparing the game to Sacred, Ocampo said it \\"offers more of the same, but at a ramped-up level.\\" Ocampo said the game looks good but that \\"Hacking your way every 10 feet can be a chore.\\" Ocampo also noted that it was nice that the game is set in a \\"predefined world, unlike the randomly generated levels of Diablo.\\" Sacred Gold is a compilation released in August 2005. It contains the main game and the two expansions.

It had a significant market presence in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. In 2005, longtime competitor BMG Direct Marketing, Inc. (formerly the RCA Music Service or RCA Victor Record Club) purchased Columbia House and consolidated operations. In 2008, the company (as well as book club operator Bookspan) was acquired by private investment group Najafi Companies, and its name was changed to Direct Brands, Inc. Although Direct Brands shut down music mail-order operations in mid-2009, it continued to use the Columbia House brand to market videos in the U.S. and Canada, selling DVDs and Blu-rays via the controversial practice of negative option billing. DB Media's Canadian assets ceased operating on December 10, 2010, and all staff were dismissed, while U.S. operations continue as usual. In December 2012, the company was sold to Pride Tree Holdings, Inc. In 2013, the company changed its name to Filmed Entertainment Inc.http://listings.findthecompany.com/l/6589969/Filmed- Entertainment-Inc-in-New-York-NY The sale of the DVD division at bankruptcy auction was announced August 10, 2015. History =Rapid growth= Columbia Record Club was formed in 1955 by CBS/Columbia Records as an experiment to market music directly by mail, spurring sales to rural consumers and heading off competition from mail-order companies from outside the record industry. New members to the club were enticed with a free record just for joining. To appease brick-and-mortar retailers, titles in the club's catalog were only made available six months (later, three months) after retail release, and retailers that helped recruit members got a 20% commission. By the end of that year, the club had 125,175 members who had purchased 700,000 records ($1.174 million net). The operation grew so quickly that, in 1956, it was moved from New York City to a new home base: a distribution center in Terre Haute, Indiana, a railway-accessible city where Columbia had recently opened a record pressing facility. Within a year, the club had 687,652 members and had sold 7 million records ($14.888 million net) and, by 1963, it commanded 10% of the recorded music retail market. =Licensing= In the late 1950s, both RCA Victor and Capitol Records began licensing programs of their own, but the three record clubs rarely allowed any of their own labels' releases to be marketed by rivals. For example, Columbia recordings were not available from the RCA Victor Record Club, and RCA recordings were unavailable through the Columbia Record Club. In 1958, facing the loss of members who wanted a wider variety of records, the club began manufacturing and marketing records for certain competing labels (including Verve, Mercury, Warner Bros., Kapp, Vanguard, United Artists, and Liberty). Rival clubs operated by RCA and Capitol offered only their own labels' products at the time. Licensors were guaranteed a minimum number of sales, but were held to exclusive, restrictive contracts, which led to price-fixing allegations against the club in 1962, followed by 7 years of mostly ineffective litigation. The licensing program continued and expanded in the 1960s as the music industry grew and changed. =New formats and the rise of the Columbia House brand= The Columbia Record Club began marketing stereo records and equipment in 1959, reel-to-reel recordings (via the Columbia Reel-To-Reel Club) in 1960, 8-track cartridges (via the Columbia Cartridge Club) in 1966, and cassettes (via the Columbia Cassette Club) in 1969. The Columbia Record Club was also notable in continuing to issue product in formats no longer available on the commercial market. After the major record labels quit releasing albums on reel to reel tape format, Columbia still continued to make select new titles available on reel tape up until 1984. 1982 was the approximate year the 8-track tape disappeared from record stores yet Columbia continued to release new titles in the format until 1988 and finally after the major record labels abandoned the vinyl LP format in 1989, Columbia issued select new titles on vinyl until 1992. In all three cases, the new releases on the abandoned formats were usually limited to the new Selection of the Month title (although the country music Selection of the Month had never been available on reel tape unless the album had possible crossover appeal to the Pop/Rock or Easy Listening club members). By the early 1970s, \\"Columbia House\\" had become an overarching brand for the various divisions, led by the Columbia Record Club, later renamed the Columbia Record & Tape Club. By 1975, membership was over 3 million. A small CRC was in a conspicuous spot on the media and the cover, which showed that Columbia House was the manufacture. In 1982, the CBS Video Club, which had formed the previous year as the CBS Video Library, became part of the Columbia House family. Also, during that same time period, Columbia House and The Cannon Group founded the UK-exclusive mail-order VHS distribution service Videolog. Sony acquired the CBS Records Group, including Columbia House, in 1988, then at 6 million members. Bertelsmann Music Group had recently acquired RCA Records and changed the name of Columbia House's only surviving rival, RCA Music Service (formerly RCA Victor Record Club), to BMG Music Service. In 1991, the CBS Records Group was renamed as Sony Music Entertainment and Sony sold half of Columbia House to Time Warner and ed in Time-Life's video and music clubs. Membership was over 10 million at the end of that year. The influence of Columbia House and other music clubs reached its peak in 1994 accounting for 15.1 percent of all CD sales. In 1996, club membership was at 16 million. That year, the Columbia House website was launched. Meanwhile, a parallel club, the Columbia Record Club of Canada, was operated by the Canadian branch of CBS Records from the late 1950s until membership and financial problems led to its apparent demise in 1977. (CP wire article) It was relaunched in 1979 as the Canadian Music Club, attracting 100,000 members by the end of that year. =Market decline= In mid-1999, a merger was announced between Columbia House and struggling online retailer CDNow, an independent, publicly owned company that had funding and other partnerships with Columbia House and its owners Sony and Time-Warner. The merger was abandoned in early 2000, with Columbia House's poor finances and stiff competition from online giant Amazon.com cited as factors. Within months, CDNow was purchased by Bertelsmann, which partially merged it with BMG Direct into a venture called BeMusic. CDNow was taken over and merged into Amazon the following year. By 2001, music clubs accounted for less than eight percent of all CD sales, coinciding with the ascent of Internet shops and retail outlets such as Amazon and Wal-Mart, which offered music at similar discounts without subscriptions. =Security breach= In 2001, a security breach in the Columbia House website exposed thousands of customer names, addresses and portions of credit card numbers, leaving private information about customers vulnerable to exploitation. The issue involved a particular section of the website, which could easily be accessed by deleting a portion of the website address in the address bar, discovered by customer Mark Alway. Upon the discovery of the breach, he emailed the Columbia House staff who were quick to respond to the problem. This event gave rise to concerns over the website's capability of keeping private information secure from hackers or devastating scams. Although no information was reportedly obtained from the temporary breach according to Columbia House, industry professionals were quick to point out that the simple error was the consequence of negligent handling of customer information. =Consolidation and downsizing= In 2002, Sony and AOL Time Warner sold 85% of Columbia House to The Blackstone Group L.P., a New York-based investment firm. The next year, the possibility of a merger of Columbia House and Blockbuster Inc. was reported in the Wall Street Journal, Associated Press reports, and trade publications. Although the owners were said to be in talks, the merger never materialized. In 2005, longtime competitor BMG Direct Marketing, Inc., then the current owners of BMG Music Service, acquired Columbia House, renamed the merged company BMG Columbia House, Inc., and consolidated operations under the BMG Music Service name. In 2008, the company, including its Canadian branch, was acquired from Sony BMG by investment firm JMCK Corp., a Najafi Group company based in Phoenix, Arizona, and the name was changed to Direct Brands, Inc. Direct Brands consolidated the remaining facilities, and shut down music mail-order operations on June 30, 2009. However, Direct Brands continued to operate a DVD and Blu-ray Disc club under the Columbia House brand in both the U.S. and Canada. The Columbia House name is still owned by Sony Music Entertainment, and is used under license. In December 2010, the Canadian branch went into bankruptcy, and its websites began redirecting visitors to a letter of explanation from the companies' trustees in bankruptcy. =Bankruptcy= The parent of the Columbia House music and DVD clubs announced on August 10, 2015, that it plans to sell its Columbia House DVD Club business, which sells recorded movies and TV series directly to consumers, through a bankruptcy auction. =Return to music sales= In December 2015, Columbia House's owner, John Lippman, announced his intention to begin a vinyl subscription service that will allow subscribers the ability to choose which records and genres of music they receive.Corrigan, Tom Columbia House Seeks Revival as Vinyl Finds New Groove Wall Street Journal.

There were dozens of small sheets of stamps that were enclosed in the mailer. These stamps had pictures of the actual album cover of the records that Columbia House would sell. The customer would tear the stamp off the sheet, lick the back of the stamp and affix them onto the order card. These Columbia House envelopes would come as junk mail to what seemed was everyone's home on a regular basis. You might get one type of offer, but your neighbor might get a more lucrative offer. Many times, it was the teenagers of the house who intercepted this mail. They were easily suckered in with the idea of getting the albums they wanted all at once and all they had to do was to buy three or four albums within the next two or three years. There were many underage customers who legally could not be bound to this agreement/contract; Columbia House knew these were unenforceable, but they didn’t care (though eventually, this policy did change). Columbia House made it easy to defraud them. Some older-than-teens scammed by getting free music with the intention of never paying  sometimes amounting to stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars of CDs =Negative option billing practice= Columbia House practices negative option billing, a form of commercial distribution in which services are automatically supplied to the consumers until a specific cancellation order is issued. The practice has drawn many complaints from consumers. The Federal Trade Commission has published information to protect customers against this practice, specifically referencing a $0.49/video offering. Membership in the DVD club constituted an agreement whereby the customer agree to purchase a minimum number of movies at regular list price. To join, or enter a legal obligation, the customer agreed to purchase one discounted movie at the beginning, which is sent out as part of a \\"welcome package.\\" Over the term of the agreement the minimum number of list price movies must be bought. Twenty-one times per year, the company informs each customer of the \\"Director's Selection\\" movie. The customer is asked to respond within 10 days whether or not he or she wants to buy this movie, which is offered at a discount provided that the response is received by Columbia House \\"within the specified time.\\" Failure to respond results in having that movie shipped at full list price. If the customer responds negatively but in time, the idea is that the movie is not sent or charged to the customer's account. This type of billing practice  You must tell Columbia House that you don't want their selection, otherwise the selection is sent to you  is now banned in 15 states as well as most of the provinces in Canada. Other questionable business practices In specified circumstances, \\"memberships\\" are available, whereby the customer is not required to respond to Director Selection mailings unless he or she wants to buy the movie. When such memberships expire, the old rules return where a response is required in time to prevent shipping of full price movies without customer input. Customers are not reminded when those rules change. The customer also has access to a large variety of other movies, which are advertised by mail and online towards the customer. Only full price purchases deplete that minimum purchase obligation. Purchases are not cumulative, meaning that two movies bought at ten dollars each do not deplete the minimum list price movie purchases by one movie. If the minimum number of movies has not been purchased by the end of the term, the monetary worth of those movies is charged to the customers' accounts. If any purchases have been made using Columbia House's point of sale device, either credit cards or debit cards linked to credit card accounts, then those accounts are automatically debited. The company will either mail or email a reminder notice prior to the commitment expiring, giving the customer the opportunity to purchase the required purchase obligation before they are charged for any commitment or contract charges. Likewise, backordered movies are automatically debited to those accounts when they become available, without further notification to the customers. Failure to clear such purchases result in collections efforts by Columbia House against the customers. =Alleged fraudulent sale of debt= In December 2008, BMG Music Service (now yourmusic.com) supposedly sold an unknown number of fraudulent debt claims to a collection agency, National Credit Solutions. Supposed delinquents were not made known of their debt and most had not made purchases with the company for at least five years. Victims of the sale of false debt claims were not made known of either their debt or the account opened with National Credit Solutions. Most victims learned of the collections agency account when they were denied for a loan, had credit cards canceled, or checked their credit reports. =Class action suit= On August 4, 2011, a nationwide class action suit was filed against Columbia House (Direct Brands Inc.) seeking monetary damages and an injunction stopping Direct Brands Inc. alleged business practices of unauthorized credit card charges, inability to cancel, unwanted products being mailed to homes and several other alleged issues. = “Fun Cash” and “Dividend Dollars” and \\"Bonus Points\\" = Columbia House offers a point system, where movies bought result in “points” or “Fun Cash” (“Dividend Dollars” was the term used when the movies came in VHS format, which is no longer the case). Fun Cash does not transfer from one subscription to another. There are a number of restrictions to the use of Fun Cash, which generally make regular re-enrollment a lower cost and more tangible option for those interested in savings. The current point system being used is called Bonus Points, and works under the same idea as Fun Cash. =Other clubs= Columbia House has made forays into other media besides music and movies. For a few years, Columbia House offered a CD-ROM club, allowing customers to buy computer games. It is now allowing members to buy video games from its site, but thus far has not offered a specific club for this. One can also enter into agreements concerning the regular purchase of \\"box sets\\", which are compilations of popular TV series. One agreement, allows customers access to any of Columbia House's products. Everything can be sourced via the company website. Better Business Bureau rating As of 2010, this business had an unsatisfactory rating with the BBB because of a failure to respond to complaints. This company also has an unsatisfactory record because of a pattern of complaints. Specifically, complainants allege receiving merchandise and/or bills for merchandise from BMG/Columbia House for CDs and/or DVDs that they did not order. Complainants further allege that they did not join BMG/Columbia House and do not know how the company obtained their information and that the company's phone line and website do not provide live customer service representatives to help resolve these issues.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a regional city in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, Australia. Located on a bend in the Wimmera River, Horsham is approximately northwest of the state capital Melbourne. In June 2018, Horsham had an estimated population of 16,514. Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. It is the most populous city in Wimmera, and the main administrative centre for the Rural City of Horsham local government area. It is the eleventh largest city in Victoria after Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Wodonga, Mildura, Shepparton, Warrnambool, Traralgon, and Wangaratta. An early settler James Monckton Darlot named the settlement after the town of Horsham in his native England. It grew throughout the latter 19th and early 20th centuries as a centre of Western Victoria's wheat and wool industry, becoming the largest city in the Wimmera and Western Victoria by the early 1910s. Horsham was declared a city in 1949 and was named Australia's Tidiest Town in 2001.  History  =Pre-colonisation= Recent archaeological research of rock shelters by La Trobe University in the Grampians found clear evidence of Aboriginal occupation 3–4,000 years ago, and the possibility of occupation up to 22,000 years ago. The rock shelters would have provided reliable access to water and a base to hunt megafauna on the plains of the Wimmera. Then \\"around the time of the arrival of the First Fleet, the Jardwa people were being forced south by either a Murray or northern Victorian tribe called the Wotjol\\". By the time of European exploration and settlement, the Jardwadjali language (a dialect of the Wemba-wemba language group common across most of Western Victoria)) was well established across the southern portion of the Wimmera region. Wimmera Aboriginal people hunted and traded widely, with stone for their tools coming up from the Grampians in the Ararat district. Relations between Europeans and Aboriginal people, as across much of Australia, were mixed, featuring both conflict and cooperation. One of the last Aboriginal missions in Victoria, Ebenezer Mission, was run successfully by the Moravian Order during the 1870s and 1880s, providing education and employment for the region's Indigenous people before it fell into decline in the 1890s and closed in 1902. =European Exploration= Major Thomas Mitchell was the first European to pass through the area, naming the Wimmera River on 18 July 1836. After the explorer Edward Eyre passed through the region seeking an overland route between Port Philip and Adelaide, he reported to The Adelaide Gazette on 14 July 1838 that the region was \\"well-watered and affording good pasturage for stock.\\" =Settlement= The Squatters were the first European settlers in the Wimmera. William J Bracewell made the first claim, claiming 100,000 acres at Dooen on 10 August 1842.Peach, John. The Biggest Ever Gold-mining Swindle in the Colonies. pg 240 Although Captain Chris Lewis was the first resident of the Wimmera, settling at Ledcourt Station at Glenorchy in 1840. Charles Carter, a Squatter from Van Diemen's Land established his property \\"Brim Springs\\" nearby in 1845. The Wimmera region was made part of the Portland Bay district in 1843 and then became its own district in 1846. Land ownership was formalised in 1847, and the \\"Wimmera squatters wasted no time in securing their land cheaply as leasehold.\\" George Langlands, a merchant from Melbourne was encouraged by James Darlot to move to the Wimmera region and open a store. Langlands reached the Wimmera and opened a general store in October 1849 on what is now the corner of Darlot and Hamilton Street. A Post Office had opened a year earlier on 1 July 1848. By 1851 the small village of Horsham had been established, consisting of an estimated 18 homes. =Town= The 1851 census counted 2,019 people living in the Wimmera region. The Victorian gold rush connected Horsham with the rest of the state, when it became a stop-over point for the Gold Escort in 1851. Governance was formalised in 1858 when the Wimmera area was included in region's first electoral district, covering an area from the Murry River in the north, then south to the Wimmera River and then east to the Grampian Range. Then in 1862 the Horsham District Road Board was established, which later evolved into the Horsham Shire with the passing of the Local Government Act in 1864. The electric telegraph was connected in 1875 and the main railway from Melbourne reached Horsham in 1879. The Horsham Borough Council and the Shire of Wimmera operated the McKenzie Creek Tramway from the town to a stone quarry, approximately to the south. The horse tramway opened within the town in 1885 but had ceased operating by 1927. Special picnic trains operated from time to time conveying residents in open wagons along the McKenzie Creek Tramway. The 1870s saw significant economic and demographic growth in Horsham. During this period the foundry, the hospital, and the Horsham Agricultural Society were established, with the first Horsham show held in 1876. Geoffrey Blainey, notes in his History of Victoria, that the Victorian railway building boom of the 1870s enabled large-scale wheat production to begin in the Wimmera. He also describes a unique migration of German farmers, mostly Lutherans from South Australia, who travelled across east in covered-wagons along with their families and herds of cattle and then settled in the Wimmera district. Blainey writes that \\"nothing in Australian history so resembles the opening of the American west as this trek of farmers to the Victorian plains in the 1870s'.\\" Farming production in the region dramatically increased, and wheat was established as the dominant agricultural crop. Although flooding along the Wimmera River was noted during the early period of the settlement, the first major flood was recorded in 1883 with the first flood causing serious damage occurring in 1889, when several buildings and the tramway were damaged. Several serious floods then occurred along the Wimmera River over the next five decades, in 1894, 1903, 1909, 1915 and then in 1923. The flood in 1923 was the third largest on record. In response to this history of flooding, the council successfully applied in 1946 for money from the State Parliamentary Public Works Committee for flood management. Photograph of Firebrace St Horsham Men from Horsham fought in the First World War. \\"By mid- August 1914 the first of Horsham's soldiers were given a rousing civic farewell at the Town Hall.\\" However conscription \\"divided the community\\", with the Anti-Conscription League noting the high rate (6%) of conscription in the Horsham district. The Discharged Soldier Settlement Act of 1917 was created to give returning soldiers a head-start establishing farms in regional Australia. According to the act returning soldiers with farm-experience could apply for a block of land. By 1919 2,933 ex-servicemen had taken up the opportunity. The average size of the land grants were . When World War Two started, men from Horsham again volunteered. The war effort was enthusiastically embraced, for example in May 1940, when King George VI made a Commonwealth-wide call to prayer, 1,800 people attended a religious service at the town hall. Returning servicemen were again given the opportunity to take up land grants at the end of the war, with the average size of the blocks being between . =City= 2011 floods threatened the CBD. This photo shows water levels at the south end of Firebrace Street from Hamilton Street Horsham's population had reached 6,388 in 1947 and so it was declared a city on 24 May 1949. In 1950 Horsham celebrated its Centenary with a parade through the city. But then tragedy struck on 24 February 1951 when a train and bus collided at a level crossing on Dimboola Road, resulting in 11 deaths. The Horsham Streetscape was dramatically remodelled in the 1960s when planning laws were changed and shopfront verandahs were removed from the Post Office, The Bull and Mouth, and The White Hart pubs. The Horsham City council installed the first parking meters on Firebrace Street in 1963. A major fire damaged the new State Public Office on McLachlan Street in 1971. In 1995, the Rural City of Horsham was formed through the amalgamation of the Horsham City, Wimmera and Aprapiles Shires. Horsham was then named Australia's Tidiest Town in 2001 and was also named Victoria's tidiest town in 2015. The Black Saturday bushfires of 2009 affected Horsham, with area burnt around the city's fringe including the golf club and eight homes destroyed in the Haven area. Horsham experienced significant flooding in successive years in 2010 and 2011 Victorian floods. During these events, the Wimmera reached 3.32 m and 4.71 m respectively. The 2011 event was particularly severe with the Wimmera River reaching a record peak; over 1,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters divided the city and damaged 600 houses pushing up to a metre of water into parts of the CBD. Traditional Ownership The Victorian government has recognised the Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia and Jupagik nations as the traditional owners for the Horsham area. These five nations are represented by the Barengi Gadjin Land Council Aboriginal Corporation.

Geography  =Wimmera River= The city of Horsham is situated on the floodplain of the Wimmera River, south of the Dooen Swamp and north of the River's junction with McKenzie Creek. The Wimmera River rises in the western slopes of the Pyrenees and then runs west towards Horsham before turning north at Quantong and heading north towards the Murray, but empties into Lake Hindmarsh. The Wimmera River is damned by a weir at the southern edge of the city. A recent study in December 2017, found that the Millennium drought decimated the Platypus population in the River leaving only a solitary colony south of the weir. = Climate = Horsham is classified as a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification BSk) similar to Mildura although with less rain and drier for more of the year. As such, although its latitude makes it on average a degree cooler than Mildura, it can receive relatively more extremes of temperature. = Land Use = Suburban expansion along River Roads Southbank Wetlands precinct. Horsham's topography is flat, approximately above sea level. The central business district (CBD) is laid out in a grid plan south of the train line and is characterised by wide streets and several roundabouts. Firebrace Street, running north–south through the middle of the CBD is one of Horham's original \\"thoroughfares\\" (first surveyed in 1849) and is named after a soldier from the British Army, Major William Firebrace. Residential areas extend north of the train line, west towards Natimuk and south-west towards Haven and south-east across Burnt Creek. A light industrial area is located south of the Wimmera River. Due to the flat topography and floodplain clay, there are very few multi-story buildings. The five most prominent buildings in the city are the State Government Offices on McLauchlin Street, the T&G; clocktower on Firebrace Street, St John Anglican church on the Western Highway, the Horsham Cinema and Horsham Town Hall, both on Pynsent Street. Panorama of Green Lake located 10 km southeast at Bungalally is one of several large lakes in the Horsham district =Mining= Due to Horsham's location in the Murray Basin, the area to the east and south of the city contain extensive deposits of Mineral Sands, primarily ilmenite, zircon and rutile. Preliminary exploration was conducted in the 1980s at Drung, a locality east of Horsham. However, the Conservation Council of Australia opposed the exploration citing the long-term consequences of mining activity and the possibility of inadequate rehabilitation. In June 2018 new mining exploration leases for the Wimmera region were granted by the Victorian State Government.  Governance  Council offices on Roberts Avenue In 1993 the Kennett Government passed the Local Government (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill which resulted in council amalgamations across Victoria.

[…] They said about Jonathan ben Uzziel that, in the > hour that he would sit and study Torah, any bird flying over him would > straightaway be incinerated.Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah 28a  Early life  Little is known about Jonathan ben Uzziel's early upbringing, except that he was one of Hillel the Elder's most outstanding pupils. According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Jonathan was born into a wealthy family.Jerusalem Talmud (Nedarim 5:6 [19b]). At one point in Jonathan's life, his father made a vow that his son, Jonathan, would not be entitled to any of his fortune, and wrote in his will and testament that Shammai would be the recipient of his estate and money, conveyed to him as a gift. When this money came into the hands of Shammai, who was not willing to see Jonathan taken advantage of and deprived of his father's earnings, Shammai resolved to sell part of the inheritance, and to dedicate unto the Temple another part of the inheritance, while the remainder he gave as a gift to Jonathan ben Uzziel. Tomb According to tradition, the tomb of ben Uzziel is located in Amuka, Galilee near Safed, Israel. According to Zev Vilnai, Rabbi Shmuel ben Shimshon wrote about the tomb in 1210: \\"There is a large tree next to it, and the Ishmaelites [Arabs] bring oil and light a candle in his honor and make vows in his honor.\\" An illustration of Yonatan ben Uzziel's tomb appears in \\"Ancestry of fathers and prophets\\" (Hebrew: יחוס אבות ונביאים), a book printed in 1537. It is customary to visit ben Uzziel's tomb on Rosh Chodesh, the first day of the lunar month, and on 26 Sivan (the day on which he died), although visitors arrive all year round. A practice that began in the 17th century was to pray at the gravesite for a good marriage partner, for children, satisfaction from one's children, a good livelihood, health and happiness. Many unmarried men and women pray there for a match. Doing so is considered a segula (propitious remedy) for finding one's mate within the coming year. Zev Vilnai offers two theories for this custom:\\"Holy Places in the Land of Israel\\" (Hebrew: מצבות קודש בארץ־ישראל) (a) The practice developed from the Pseudo-Jonathan translation of the Bible on Deuteronomy 24:6, where he writes that anyone who prevents the connection between a husband and wife forfeits his portion in the world-to-come; (b) The practice is based on a mistaken reading of RashiTo Yevamot 17a s.v. \\"Shehakol ponim sham\\" who writes in reference to a place called Harpania (Aramaic:הרפניא) \\"Everyone goes there: all ineligible men (pesulim) who cannot find a woman turn and go there. And it is deeper (Amuka) and worse than Gehinnom.\\" The words \\"and it is deeper (Amuka)\\" are the headwords to Rashi's next comment, and do not relate to his preceding comment about men going to Harpania to look for women. However, the mistaken reading connects Rashi's words to the community named Amuka. It is also widely believed that Jonathan ben Uzziel was single or childless, so men in similar situations seek to benefit from his special powers, but nowhere in the writings of Chazal is this stated.

Her parents' restaurant was the first place Arzner came into contact with Hollywood elite; it was frequented by many silent film stars and directors, including Mary Pickford, Mack Sennett, and Douglas Fairbanks. After finishing high school at the Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles, she enrolled at the University of Southern California, where she spent two years studying medicine with hopes of becoming a doctor.\\"Directors' Biographies/Arzner, Dorothy\\" in the Production Guide and Directors' Annual Number 1941, two-part supplement to The Film Daily (New York, N.Y.), volume 80, number 46, September 4, 1941, p. 17 of supplement. Internet Archive, San Francisco, California. Retrieved July 11, 2019. During World War I she joined a local Southern California ambulance unit. After spending a summer working in the office of a respected surgeon however, Arzner decided that she did not want a career in medicine. \\"I wanted to be like Jesus,\\" she said. \\"'Heal the sick and raise the dead,' instantly, without surgery, pills, et cetera.\\" = Early career = After World War I the film industry was in need of workers. According to Arzner herself this was her opportunity to get a foot in the door. \\"It was possible for even inexperienced people to have an opportunity if they showed signs of ability or knowledge\\" she said in a 1974 interview published in Cinema. A girl friend from college suggested Arzner meet with William DeMille, a major director for Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, the parent company of Paramount. Arzner told the Sunday Star in 1929 that the friend thought she would be well suited to the industry. \\"Then she drove me over to the Paramount studio and dumped me out in front of the main office\\" she said.\\"Evening star. [volume] (Washington, D.C.) 1854–1972, July 7, 1929, Image 89\\" Loc.gov. 1929-07-07. p. 15. . Retrieved 2018-10-23. When Arzner met with DeMille in 1919, he asked her in which department she would like to start. \\"I might be able to dress sets,\\" Arzner replied. After asking her a question about the furniture in his office that she did not know the answer to, DeMille suggested Arzner explore the different departments for a week and talk to his secretary. Arzner spent the week watching the sets at work, including that of Cecil DeMille, after which she made the observation \\"If one was going to be in this movie business, one should be a director because he was the one who told everyone else what to do.\\" At the recommendation of DeMille's secretary Arzner decided to start in the script department, typing scripts so she could learn \\"what the film was to be all about.\\" Within six months Arzner became an editor at the subsidiary of Paramount, Realart Studio, where she edited 52 films. In 1922, she was recalled to Paramount proper to edit the Rudolph Valentino film Blood and Sand (1922). This proved to be Arzner's opportunity to try her hand at directing. Although she went uncredited, Arzner shot some of the bull-fighting scenes for the film and edited this footage, intercutting it with stock footage, thereby saving Paramount thousands of dollars. Arzner's work on Blood and Sand caught the attention of director James Cruze who would later employ her as a writer and editor for a number of his films. According to Arzner, Cruze told people she was \\"his right arm.\\" She eventually wrote the shooting script and edited Cruze's Old Ironsides (1926). Through her work with Cruze, Arzner gained considerable leverage and threatened to leave Paramount for Columbia if she was not given a picture to direct. \\"I had an offer to write and direct a film for Columbia,\\" Arzner said, \\"It was then I closed out my salary at Paramount and was about to leave for Columbia.\\" Before leaving, Arzner decided to say goodbye to \\"someone important and not just leave unnoticed and forgotten\\" which led her to Walter Wanger, the head of Paramount's New York studio. When she said she was leaving Wanger offered Arzner a job in the scenario department and a discussion about directing sometime in the future. Arzner replied \\"Not unless I can be on a set in two weeks with an A picture. I'd rather do a picture for a small company and have my own way than a B picture for Paramount.\\" Wanger then offered her a chance to direct a comedy based on the play The Best Dressed Woman in Paris, which would later be titled Fashions for Women (1927), Arzner's first picture. Prior to Fashions for Women, Arzner had not directed a thing. \\"In fact I hadn't told anyone to do anything before,\\" she said. The film starred Esther Ralston and was a commercial success. Arzner's success led Paramount to hire her as director for three more silent films, Ten Modern Commandments (1927), Get Your Man (1927), and Manhattan Cocktail (1928), after which she was entrusted to direct the studio's first talking picture, The Wild Party (1929), a remake of a silent film which Arzner herself had edited. = Directing career = The Wild Party starred Clara Bow in her first talking picture, and Fredric March, in his first leading role. To compensate for Bow's awkwardness around not being able to move freely due to the cumbersome sound equipment, Arzner had a rig made in which a microphone was attached to the end of a fishing rod allowing Bow to move around; this was the first boom mic. The film about a college girl, played by Bow, who leads a party lifestyle and falls for one of her professors, March, was a huge commercial and critical success. The Wild Party was such a success that it kicked off a series of films \\"set on college campuses where the fun-loving, hard-drinking students include coeds who fall in love with their professors.\\" After The Wild Party, Arzner directed eleven more features for Paramount, including Sarah and Son (1930), starring Ruth Chatterton, and Honor Among Lovers (1931), starring Claudette Colbert, though after 1932 she left the studio to work on a freelance basis. During her time freelancing, Arzner made some of her best-known films: Christopher Strong (1933), with Katharine Hepburn; Craig's Wife (1936), starring Rosalind Russell; and Dance, Girl, Dance (1940), featuring Lucille Ball. Christopher Strong follows a female aviator named Cynthia Darrington, played by Katharine Hepburn, who begins an affair with a married man, Christopher Strong. Towards the end of the film, Strong's wife Elaine appears to both acknowledge and forgive Cynthia for the affair. This is an example of the way Arzner turned conventional societal views of women upside-down. Instead of pitting the two women against each other, buying into the narrative of women as rivals, Arzner complicates and interrogates typical views of women by portraying a genuine moment of connection between Cynthia and Elaine. In an article for Jumpcut, Jane Gaines argues that a reading of Christopher Strong could allude to Arzner's belief that \\"heterosexual monogamy cripples the imagination and curbs the appetite for living.\\" Arzner herself noted that the film was well-liked at the time but that she never considered it her favorite. \\"I could hardly consider any one a favorite,\\" she said. \\"I always saw too many flaws.\\" Craig's Wife tells the story of Harriet Craig, played by Rosalind Russell, a woman so consumed by the upkeep of her home that nothing else interests her. The film was based on a stage play of the same name by George Kelley but differed in its treatment of its female protagonist. The play, in a much more misogynistic look at the American housewife, sided with Harriet's husband, portraying her as cold and disinterested. Arzner's version turned the story into \\"a plea for women to become their own people rather than beautiful possessions.\\" In her essay entitled The Woman at the Keyhole: Women's Cinema and Feminist Criticism, Judith Mayne writes that \\"it is Harriet's husband who married for love, not money\\" whereas Harriet approached the marriage as \\"a business contract.\\" In this way, Craig's Wife is an example of a running theme in Arzner's work: the repressiveness of heterosexual marriage. Mayer writes that Arzner's films \\"show again and again that when a man believes he can own a woman and women have to compete for men, then romance, loyalty and friendship go out the window.\\" In Craig's Wife, Arzner offers the possibility of women's community after the instability of heterosexual romance with the final scene between Harriet and widowed next door neighbor. Both women have been left by their husbands, in vastly different ways, and their next potentially meaningful connection is with each other. Dance, Girl, Dance is one of Arzner's most celebrated films. Described by Variety as \\"an unlikely-female- buddy burlesque movie that conceals a withering attack on the male gaze under its showgirl wardrobe of sequins and feathers,\\" the film starred Lucille Ball and Maureen O'Hara as the pair of showgirl best friends. Dance, Girl, Dance is yet another example of the ways in which Arzner subverted and complicated traditional depictions of women and female relationships. The film is Arzner's best-known and most-studied work and thematizes the issues of female performance, female relationships, and social mobility. Most notable though, is the film's interrogation of the male gaze. Dance, Girl, Dance \\"foregrounds dance as women's avenue to self-expression and economic independence.\\" In a scene towards the latter half of the film, O'Hara's character Judy stops her stage performance to directly address the diegetic male audience. Judy confronts the men with a stirring admonishment of their objectification of women. In feminist film studies, this scene has been read as a \\"returning\\" of the male gaze and a larger address to the real life, not just diegetic, audience. = Later career = In 1943, after making First Comes Courage (1943), Arzner retired from Hollywood. Though it is not known why she did so, it is speculated that Arzner's retirement was due to a decline in critical reception and commercial success of her films. It could also have been due to the increasing of systemic sexism and homophobia after the implementation of the Hays Code. Despite leaving Hollywood, Arzner continued to work in the field of film. She made Women's Army Corps training films during World War II. In 1950 Arzner became associated with the Pasadena Playhouse, a well-known theatre company in southern California, where she founded filmmaking classes. She produced some theatre plays and starred in a radio program called You Wanna Be a Star. In 1952 she joined the staff of the College of the Arts of the Playhouse as the head of the Cinema and Television Department. She taught the first year of cinema in the university. In the late fifties, she became the entertainment and publicity consultant at the Pepsi company, with the influence of the boss's wife, Joan Crawford, with whom Arzner had a close relationship. Arzner made a series of successful commercials for Pepsi, most of them with Crawford. In 1961 Arzner joined the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, in the Motion Picture division as a staff member, where she spent four years supervising advanced cinema classes before retiring in June 1965. There she taught Francis Ford Coppola. and became an evident reference for him in the future. Arzner's documents, files and films are preserved in Cinema and Television File in UCLA, thanks to Jodie Foster, who raised sufficient funds for their maintenance.  Personal life and death  Marion Morgan, 1927, photo by Arnold Genthe Dorothy Arzner was born in San Francisco, California on January 3, 1897, but moved with her parents Louis and Jenetter Arzner to Los Angeles, where her father opened a very prestigious restaurant next to a theatre in Hollywood. Arzner spent her childhood surrounded by celebrities who came to the restaurant, including Maude Adams, Sarah Bernhardt and David Warfield, among others, but she was so used to them that she was never attracted to the cinema world. Even though she started her medical degree at the University of Southern California, in a 1974 interview with Karin Kay and Gerald Peary published in Cinema, Arzner said \\"With a few summer months in the office of a fine surgeon and meeting with the sick, I decided that was not what I wanted. I wanted to be like Jesus – 'Heal the sick and raise the dead', instantly, without surgery, pills, et cetera.\\" It was then, two years into her degree, that she left and decided to find a job so she could acquire economic independence. Arzner, in spite of having abandoned the degree, had a broad education, which included architecture and art history courses. As soon as she left the university she began working for Paramount Studios doing jobs such as that of a cutter or editor, for which she would be specifically recognized in Blood and Sand (1922). Later, the studios would offer her a two-year contract as a director, but it was not until the contract was finished that she would start a freelance career. Arzner would maintain a forty-year relationship with Marion Morgan, a dancer and choreographer who was ten years older than Arzner. Even though she tried to keep her private life as private as possible, Arzner had been linked romantically with a number of actresses, including Alla Nazimova and Billie Burke.Mann, William J. (2001). Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood, 1910–1969. New York:Viking. . It was rumored, though never confirmed, that Arzner also had relationships with Joan Crawford and Katharine Hepburn. She never hid her sexual orientation, nor her identity; her clothing was unconventional for a woman of that time, she wore suits or straight dresses. Morgan choreographed some dancing sequences in some of Arzner's movies, such as Dance, Girl, Dance. In 1930, Arzner and Morgan moved to Mountain Oak Drive, where they lived until Morgan's death in 1971. While they lived in Hollywood, Arzner assisted various cinematographic events. In her last years Arzner left Hollywood and went to live in the desert. In 1979, at the age of 82, Arzner died in La Quinta, California.  Legacy  Arzner's work, both as a female filmmaker and a lesbian filmmaker, has been an important area of film studies. Perhaps due to Arzner's leaving Hollywood in the 1940s, her work had been all but forgotten until the 1970s when she was rediscovered by feminist film theorists. Since then Arzner's films have been studied for their depictions of gender and female sexuality. Tributes For her achievements in the field of motion pictures, Arzner was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1500 Vine Street, the only award she received. In 1972 the First International Festival of Women's Films honored her by screening \\"The Wild Party\\", and her oeuvre was given a full retrospective at the Second Festival in 1976. In 1975 the Director's Guild of America honored her with \\"A Tribute to Dorothy Arzner.\\" During the tribute, a telegram from Katharine Hepburn was read: \\"Isn't it wonderful that you've had such a great career, when you had no right to have a career at all?\\" In March 2018, Paramount dedicated its Dressing Room building to Arzner. In popular culture R.M. Vaughan's 2000 play, Camera, Woman depicts the last day of Arzner's career. In the play, Harry Cohn fires her over a kissing scene between Merle Oberon and fictitious actor Rose Lindstromthe name of a character played by Isobel Elsom in Arzner's last film, First Comes Courage, in which Oberon starredin a never-completed final film. The play also depicts Arzner and Oberon as lovers. It is told in a prologue, four acts, and an epilogue in the form of a post-show interview that contains actual quotations from Arzner.Vaughan, R. M. Camera, Woman. Toronto: Coach House Books, 2000; S. Louisa Wei's 2014 feature documentary, Golden Gate Girls, compares the media representation of Arzner with that of Esther Eng, Hong Kong's first woman director who was a Chinese American. Judith Mayne, the author of Directed by Dorothy Arzner, is interviewed in the documentary, saying, \\"I love the fact that history of woman filmmakers now would include Dorothy Arzner and Esther Eng as the two of the real exceptions, who proved it was entirely possible to build a successful film career without necessarily being a part of mainstream identity.\\" Filmography * Too Much Johnson (1919; lost, editor only) * The Six Best Cellars (1920, editor only) * Blood and Sand (1922) (additional footage) (uncredited) * The Covered Wagon (1923, editor only) * Inez from Hollywood (1924, editor only) * Fashions for Women (1927) * Ten Modern Commandments (1927) * Get Your Man (1927) * Manhattan Cocktail (1928; lost, except for the montage sequence by Slavko Vorkapić released in 2005 on DVD Unseen Cinema) * The Wild Party (1929) * Behind the Make-Up (1930, uncredited) * Sarah and Son (1930) * Paramount on Parade (1930, co-director) * Anybody's Woman (1930) * The House That Shadows Built (1931; Paramount promotional film with excerpt of never-produced film Stepdaughters of War to be directed by Arzner) * Honor Among Lovers (1931) * Working Girls (1931) * Merrily We Go to Hell (1932) * Christopher Strong (1933) * Nana (1934) * Craig's Wife (1936) * The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1937, uncredited) * The Bride Wore Red (1937) * Dance, Girl, Dance (1940) * First Comes Courage (1943) See also * Female gaze * Feminism * List of female film and television directors * List of lesbian filmmakers * List of LGBT-related films directed by women * Women's Cinema Bibliography * Casella, Donna R. \\"What Women Want: The Complex World of Dorothy Arzner and Her Cinematic Women.\\" Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media, 50 no. 1/2, 2009, 235–70, Jstor.org * \\"Dorothy Arzner\\".

On the other hand, the Chronicle doesn't cover the South Bay as BANG does via The Mercury News. BANG's only coverage in the North Bay is Marin County. 2011 restructuring On August 23, 2011, the company announced the reorganization of 11 of its newspapers, with shuttering of all of its East Bay nameplates under two new publications as of November 2, 2011. The planned merger and publication reorganization was modified in October 2011, when BANG decided to scrap plans to launch the East Bay Tribune and instead consolidate its East Bay newspapers under the Oakland Tribune name. * The Oakland Tribune, Alameda Times-Star, Hayward Daily Review, Fremont Argus and West County Times were scheduled to publish their last editions on November 1, 2011. The following day, subscribers were to get copies of the new East Bay Tribune; instead the mastheads were made local editions of the Oakland Tribune. * The Contra Costa Times, San Ramon Valley Times, East County Times, Tri-Valley Herald and San Joaquin Herald were scheduled to become the new The Times. * The San Mateo Times was scheduled to publish its last issue on November 1, 2011. As of November 2, 2011, subscribers were to get localized versions of the San Jose Mercury News. 2016 restructuring In March 2016, BANG announced it would further consolidate its newspapers (other than the Marin Independent Journal) down to two: The East Bay Times and The Mercury News, eliminating the Oakland Tribune and the other papers.

Green represents the reflected near infrared light indicative of healthy vegetation. Red edge refers to the region of rapid change in reflectance of vegetation in the near infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Chlorophyll contained in vegetation absorbs most of the light in the visible part of the spectrum but becomes almost transparent at wavelengths greater than 700 nm. The cellular structure of the vegetation then causes this infrared light to be reflected because each cell acts something like an elementary corner reflector. The change can be from 5% to 50% reflectance going from 680 nm to 730 nm. This is an advantage to plants in avoiding overheating during photosynthesis. For a more detailed explanation and a graph of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) spectral region, see . The phenomenon accounts for the brightness of foliage in infrared photography and is extensively utilized in the form of so-called vegetation indices (e.g. Normalized difference vegetation index). It is used in remote sensing to monitor plant activity, and it has been suggested that it could be useful to detect light-harvesting organisms on distant planets.

Life Born at Melbourne, Australia, in 1913, he was the elder son of Edward Henry Fiennes-Clinton, a Mate in the British Merchant Navy who emigrated to Australia in 1912 before serving with the 51st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force and being killed in action on 17 August 1916 during the First World War.https://www.aif.adfa.edu.au/showPerson?pid=97065 His mother, Edith Annie, daughter of Captain Horace Guest, brought him up before remarrying, in 1923, Robert Johnston Lynn,Charles Mosley, ed., Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage (107th edition, 2003), vol. 2, p. 2340 a cousin of Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland House of Commons, Sir Robert Lynn. Educated at Hale School, an independent Anglican boarding school in Perth, Western Australia, Fiennes-Clinton then worked as a boilermaker, a welder's and machine-minder's assistant as well as a butcher at the Kalgoorlie Gold Mine. Story Fiennes- Clinton learned of his succession to the earldom of Lincoln during a telephone call from a journalist with The Daily Telegraph newspaper in London, who began \\"Lord Lincoln, if I may be the first to address you so...\\" He said he had known he might one day inherit the title, but had forgotten about it. Upon the journalist commenting that he seemed unexcited, Lincoln replied: \\"young man, I have lived for seventy-five years and I have learned to take things as they come\\". He did however seem disappointed to hear there was little else to inherit apart from the peerage itself.The Earl of Lincoln (obituary) in The Daily Telegraph, 20 July 2001, online The Australian press was much more excited by the news, and three camera crews appeared outside the new peer's flat at Elanora Villas, Bunbury, Western Australia, before more reporters arrived by helicopter. Soon after inheriting the Earldom, the new Lord Lincoln travelled to England, where he was warmly received by (among others) leading citizens of the City of Lincoln. The story was soon fictionalized as a storyline in the Australian soap opera Neighbours. He later wrote an autobiography called Memoirs of an Embryo Earl, published in 1992, and set about putting on record his formal right to the peerage with a view to taking his seat in the House of Lords. After being briefed on the workings of the Upper House by Lord Deedes, and having been received at the College of Arms, Lincoln stated his intention of joining the Conservative benches in the House of Lords. However, there were delays in the process of claiming his seat, which was defeated by the reforms of the upper house in the House of Lords Act 1999. Lincoln thereafter had no automatic right to sit in the Lords, as all but 92 hereditary peers had been removed. His grandson, the 19th Earl, was later courted by New Labour. Lord Lincoln died in Western Australia on 7 July 2001.Charles Kidd, Christine Shaw, Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage 2008 (London: Debrett's, 2008), p. 863 Family In 1940, Fiennes-Clinton married Leila Ruth Fitzpatrick, née Millen, and they had two children, Patricia Ruth Fiennes-Clinton (born 1 February 1941, now Lady Patricia Elrick), and Edward Gordon Fiennes-Clinton (1943–99; styled Lord Fynes, by courtesy). After his first wife died on 19 July 1947, Fiennes-Clinton on 3 December 1953 married Linda Alice, daughter of Rev Charles Creed and widow of James Anthony O'Brien; they had no children.The Earldom of Lincoln at nottingham.ac.uk When his 10th cousin, the 10th and last Duke of Newcastle, died on Christmas Day 1988, Fiennes-Clinton succeeded to His Grace's subsidiary title of Earl of Lincoln. His ancestor, Sir Henry Clinton, of Kirkstead, Lincolnshire, was the 2nd Earl of Lincoln's elder son by his second marriage; the 2nd Earl's eldest son's descendants went on to become Dukes of Newcastle.

It is one of the three Palermo protocols, the others being the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms. The protocol was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2000 and entered into force on December 25, 2003. As of May 2020, it has been ratified by 176 parties. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is responsible for implementing the protocol. It offers practical help to states with drafting laws, creating comprehensive national anti-trafficking strategies, and assisting with resources to implement them. In March 2009, UNODC launched the Blue Heart Campaign to fight human trafficking, to raise awareness, and to encourage involvement and inspire action. The protocol commits ratifying states to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, protecting and assisting victims of trafficking and promoting cooperation among states in order to meet those objectives.  Content of the protocol  The protocol covers the following: *Defining the crime of trafficking in human beings; To be considered trafficking in persons, a situation must meet three conditions: act (i.e., recruitment), means (i.e., through the use of force or deception) and purpose (i.e., for the purpose of forced labour) ::\\"Trafficking in persons\\" shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs... The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth [above] shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth [above] have been used. *Facilitating the return and acceptance of children who have been victims of cross-border trafficking, with due regard to their safety *Prohibiting the trafficking of children (which is defined as being a person under 18 years of age) for purposes of commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), exploitative labour practices, or the removal of body parts *Suspending parental rights of parents, caregivers, or any other persons who have parental rights in respect of a child should they be found to have trafficked a child *Ensuring that definitions of trafficking reflect the need for special safeguards and care for children, including appropriate legal protection *Ensuring that trafficked persons are not punished for any offences or activities related to their having been trafficked, such as prostitution and immigration violations *Ensuring that victims of trafficking are protected from deportation or return where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that such return would represent a significant security risk to the trafficked person or their family *Considering temporary or permanent residence in countries of transit or destination for trafficking victims in exchange for testimony against alleged traffickers, or on humanitarian and compassionate grounds *Providing for proportional criminal penalties to be applied to persons found guilty of trafficking in aggravating circumstances, including offences involving trafficking in children or offences committed or involving complicity by state officials *Providing for the confiscation of the instruments and proceeds of trafficking and related offences to be used for the benefit of trafficked persons The convention and the protocol obligate ratifying states to introduce national trafficking legislation. Regional action against trafficking in human beings In Warsaw on 16 May 2005, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings was opened for accession. The convention established a Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) which monitors the implementation of the convention through country reports. It has been ratified (as of January 2016) by 45 European states, while a further one state (Turkey) has signed but not yet ratified it. Complementary protection is ensured through the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (Lanzarote, 25 Oct 2007). In addition, the European Court of Human Rights of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg has passed judgments involving trafficking in human beings which violated obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights: Siliadin v France, judgment of 26 July 2005, and Rantsev v Cyprus and Russia, judgment of 7 January 2010. The Council of Europe co-operates closely with the United Nations.

Trades and Labour Council of South Australia) is the peak body for trade unions in South Australia. It coordinates political, social, economic, and industrial campaigns between its affiliate members and implements the policies of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in South Australia.  Campaigns  As well as implementing policy within South Australia, SA Unions aims to maximise the union movement's effect in political, social, economic and industrial issues; defend and extend the rights of working people and all disadvantaged members of the community; increase the support and relevance of unions; and provide leadership and co- ordination in issues of broad concern to unions and the community. During the 2014 state election, SA Unions ran a targeted campaign of over 190,000 robocalls against Nick Xenophon and his ticket, the Nick Xenophon Team, in response to their policy of reducing penalty rates for weekend workers.  Services  SA Unions operates two in-house legal services. The Workers Compensation Service provides free advocacy and dispute resolution to workers undergoing a workers compensation claim. The Young Workers Legal Service provides free legal assistance to non-unionised workers under the age of 30 who are experiencing an industrial law dispute. The service is staffed by law student volunteers, and has recovered over $1 million in unpaid entitlements since it was created in 2003.  Affiliated organisations  SA Unions is affiliated with 27 unions within South Australia, including the Australian Education Union (AEU), Australian Manufacturing Workers Union (AMWU), Australian Services Union (ASU), Australian Workers' Union (AWU), Communications, Electrical, and Plumbing Union (CEPU), Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU), Construction, Forestry, Mining, and Energy Union (CFMEU), Maritime Union of Australia (MUA), United Firefighters Union (UFU), and United Voice (UV).  History  A United Trades and Labor Council meeting with the purpose of creating an elections committee was convened on 12 December 1890, and held on 7 January 1891. The elections committee was formed, marking the inception of what is today known as the Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch). Originally known as the United Labor Party of South Australia, the party enjoyed immediate success, electing parliamentarians just four months later, and immediately held the balance of power with 10 of 54 seats resulting from the 1893 election, allowing radical liberal Charles Kingston to defeat the conservative John Downer government. Kingston served as Premier of South Australia for a then-record of six and a half years, usually implementing legislation with Labor support. Thomas Price formed the state's first Labor minority government and the world's first stable Labor Party government at the 1905 election with the support of several non-Labor MPs to form the Price-Peake administration, which was re-elected at the 1906 double dissolution election, with Labor falling just two seats short of a majority. So successful, John Verran led Labor to form the state's first of many majority governments at the 1910 election, just two weeks after the 1910 federal election where their federal counterparts formed Australia's first elected majority in either house in the Parliament of Australia, the world's first Labor Party majority government at a national level, and after the 1904 Chris Watson minority government the world's second Labor Party government at a national level.History of South Australian elections 1857-2006, volume 1 - ECSASound of Trumpets: History of the Labour Movement in South Australia - By Jim MossWhy did a 'labour movement' emerge in South Australia in the 1880s? - By Nicholas Klar The Australian Labor Party at both a federal and state/colony level pre-dates, among others, both the British Labour Party and the New Zealand Labour Party in party formation, government, and policy implementation. In less than two decades the party in South Australia went from inception to majority government, and would continue to this day as one of the two major parties in the bicameral Parliament of South Australia, the other being the Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division) created in 1974, and its predecessors. The United Trades and Labour Council was central to fundraising and building support for the creation of the Port Adelaide Workers Memorial.

The first staining protocol that was described as \\"trichrome\\" was Mallory's trichrome stain, which differentially stained erythrocytes to a red colour, muscle tissue to a red colour, and collagen to a blue colour. Some other trichrome staining protocols are the Masson's trichrome stain, Lillie's trichrome, and the Gömöri trichrome stain. Purpose Without trichrome staining, discerning one feature from another can be extremely difficult. Smooth muscle tissue, for example, is hard to differentiate from collagen. A trichrome stain can colour the muscle tissue red, and the collagen fibres green or blue. Liver biopsies may have fine collagen fibres between the liver cells, and the amount of collagen may be estimated based on the staining method. Trichrome methods are now used for differentiating muscle from collagen, pituitary alpha cells from beta cells, fibrin from collagen, and mitochondria in fresh frozen muscle sections, among other applications. It helps in identifying increases in collagenous tissue (i.e., fibrotic changes) such as in liver cirrhosis and distinguishing tumours arising from muscle cells and fibroblasts. Procedure Trichrome staining techniques employ two or more acid dyes. Normally acid dyes would stain the same basic proteins, but by applying them sequentially the staining pattern can be manipulated. A polyacid (such as phosphomolybdic acid or tungstophosphoric acid) is used to remove dye selectively. Polyacids are thought to behave as dyes with a high molecular weight: they displace easily removed dye from collagen. Usually a red dye in dilute acetic acid is applied first to overstain all components. Then a polyacid is applied to remove the red dye from collagen and some other components by displacement. A second acid dye (blue or green) in dilute acetic acid is applied which, in turn, displaces the polyacid, resulting in collagen stained in a contrasting colour to the initial dye used. If erythrocytes are to be stained, a small molecular weight yellow or orange dye is applied before staining with the red dye. It is usually applied from a saturated solution in 80% ethanol and often in conjunction with picric acid (itself a dye) and a polyacid. The methods exploit minor differences in tissue reaction to dyes, density, accessibility and so on. Trichrome stains in which dyes and a polyacid are applied sequentially are called multi-step trichromes. In \\"one- step\\" methods, all the dyes—with or without a polyacid—are combined in a single solution. One of the oldest single-step approaches to trichrome staining is van Gieson's method, which stains muscle and cytoplasm yellow, and collagen red. Another is the Gömöri trichrome stain, which closely mimics Masson's trichrome. In \\"yellowsolve\\" methods, a red dye in dilute acetic acid is first applied, then the section is very thoroughly dehydrated to ensure that no moisture remains. The red dye is then displaced by a yellow dye in a solvent, such as cellosolve (2-ethoxy-ethanol). The name yellowsolve is a blend of the terms yellow and cellosolve. Lendrum's phloxine-tartrazine for cell inclusions is one example of a yellowsolve stain. Dyes Among the dyes used for trichrome staining are: ;Red :Acid fuchsin, xylidine ponceau, chromotrope 2R, Biebrich scarlet, ponceau 6R, phloxine ;Blue and green :Light green SF yellowish, Fast Green FCF, methyl blue, water blue ;Yellow :Picric acid, orange G, Martius yellow, tartrazine, milling yellow External links * Masson's Trichrome Protocol See also * Dispersion staining * Microscopy * Phase-contrast microscopy Notes References * Baker JR (1958) Principles of biological Microtechnique.

Born in London, England, he died in Carcross, Yukon. His wife Charlotte Selina (Cox) Bompas participated in his missionary work, and wrote Owindia: A True Tale of the Mackenzie River Indians, North- West America.  Early life  William Carpenter Bompas was born on January 20, 1834 at Regent's Park, London to father Charles and mother Mary Steele. It is thought that Charles Carpenter Bompas served as the inspiration for Charles Dickens' Buzfuz in The Pickwick Papers. It is thought that Bompas' heritage lay in France, although members of the extended family resided in the United States and the United Kingdom. From 1844, a string of family deaths left the family in poor circumstances. When William was aged ten, in February 1844, his father Charles died, leaving his eight children. His eldest son, also named Charles, died in 1847. William's early education was supplied by a graduate of Cambridge University. Partly due to his private tuition and a lack of socialisation, William was considered a shy boy, and in his spare time preferred to sketch buildings such as churches instead of participate in games. His tutor, a Mr Elliott, believed Bompas to be of high intellect, writing: > I never had a pupil who made such acquisitions of knowledge in so short a > time; his attainments in mathematics and classics are far beyond the > majority of youths at his age, and would warrant anyone conversant with the > state of education in the Universities in predicting a brilliant career for > him, should he ever have that path open to him. I think, however, that the > development of his mind is still more remarkable than the amount of his > knowledge. However, William Carpenter Bompas did not choose to pursue a university education, instead opting to become articled in the same law firm where his brother George was working. After his five years of service, he transferred to another company, which soon collapsed, causing great stress to Bompas. When his strength returned, Bompas decided to leave the Baptist denomination to join the Church of England, becoming confirmed in 1858 and ordained a deacon in 1859. He was appointed curate in a church at Sutton in the Marsh, which had not had a resident clergyman since the 16th century. The area did not have a school, and in the face of considerable opposition, Bompas had opened one within two years. In 1861, Bompas' mother died, but undeterred, William transferred to another somewhat 'wild' parish in Nottingham. After a short stint in South Lincolnshire, Bompas returned to Alford, Lincolnshire, where he took up a curate position. Soon after, the Church Missionary Society granted him a post in Rupert's Land, Canada to relieve a bishop. Bompas was quickly ordained into the priesthood and sent away to Canada.  Arrival in Rupert's Land  Bompas' journey began on June 30, 1865, when he left London for Liverpool, from where he was to take a steamer to New York. From New York Bompas travelled to Niagara via the Hudson River and railway, subsequently making his way to Chicago, La Crosse and St. Paul. Upon reaching St. Cloud, a problem presented itself to Bompas' travelling party. In 1862, a Sioux massacre occurred, and the local Indians were wary of another attack. However, Bompas was advised that they would respect the English flag. Although the party did not have an English flag on hand, Bompas took initiative and crafted a banner for their ox-carts. This was just as well, as Indians who had ridden up in their horses to survey the ox-cart party left them alone once they spotted their flags. Bompas eventually reached the Red River Colony, and from there, he was rowed by Salteaux Indians in Hudson's Bay Company boats. The Methye Portage was reached on October 12, too late to catch a boat going further north due to the ensuing winter. Bompas engaged a crew to row him further north, reaching Fort Chipewyan, Alberta after days of struggle against the cold. Although he was invited to stay the winter at Fort Chipewyan, this offer was rejected, Bompas preferring to push further ahead. When the river became frozen over, his party continued by land, reaching the safety of Fort Resolution mid-winter. After a month's stay there, he was dispatched from there armed with snowshoes and a strong party. Bompas was determined to reach Fort Simpson before Christmas Day, and that he did, drawing into the entrance to the Fort on Christmas morning.  Later life  Bompas was to remain at Fort Simpson only for a short while. After a brief education in the Indian language there, he continued on to Fort Norman and set up a school there, before returning to Fort Simpson in August 1866. It was decided that Bompas should not be given a post to tend to, rather he should be given a roving commission, which pleased him greatly. Returning to Fort Norman, Bompas began to learn the Slavey language before leaving for Fort Rae in January 1867. In August 1868, after over a year travelling around various Forts, Bompas returned to Fort Simpson to take charge of that mission post after the resignation of the previous missionary there. In 1873, Bompas was nominated as the first bishop of the new diocese of Athabasca, in the northwest of his present diocese. Although he was not initially pleased at the prospect of presiding over such a large area, he was convinced otherwise, and in May 1874 Bompas was consecrated bishop of Athabasca at a church in London. He immediately returned to Canada. In 1884, his diocese was divided again, and Bompas became the first bishop of Mackenzie River. In 1891, Bompas moved into the Yukon with the creation of a new diocese, Selkirk. In 1905, he resigned from his position as bishop, and on June 9 the following year, he died at Carcross, Yukon.

Ron Hubbard's teachings. Criminon International, a non-profit, public-benefit corporation managing the Criminon program, was spawned from Narconon International in 2000, and is part of Association for Better Living and Education's public outreach programs. Criminon is promoted by the Church of Scientology International. Independent experts contend that methods used by the program are not supported by any scientific studies. Second Chance, another prison- based rehabilitation program for inmates, is closely related to Criminon, from which it licenses the techniques and materials used in its program. Criminon is said to be a prison-based version of Narconon, as the Purification Rundown detoxification and training procedures are a part of both programs. Criminon's program The program has used correspondence materials to treat hundreds of prisoners at the high security California State Prison, Corcoran, beginning in 1990.\\"Scientologists Reach Behind Bars\\", 29 May 2005, Los Angeles Times Criminon is administered by the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE), a nonprofit organization that administers Criminon, Narconon, and other \\"social betterment\\" programs.Craig Pittman \\"Classes for defendants have ties to church\\" St. Petersburg Times February 2, 1997 pg. 1 The program includes courses with questions requiring written answers. The responses are evaluated by volunteers and the materials are donated, so the program is provided free to the state. Included in one pamphlet is an essay in which Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard writes, \\"There is not one institutional psychiatrist alive who by ordinary criminal law could not be arraigned and convicted of extortion, mayhem, or murder.\\"L. Ron Hubbard, \\"Crime and Psychiatry\\", 1969. Hubbard's 1981 booklet, The Way to Happiness, is an integral part of the program, setting forth precepts such as \\"Do not take harmful drugs\\", \\"Be faithful to your sexual partner\\", \\"Do not tell harmful lies\\", \\"Don't do anything illegal\\", \\"Do not steal\\", and \\"Do not murder\\". Criminon is also available under the name Second Chance, which licenses the Criminon materials. Controversies Some critics question the long-term success of Criminon's program citing a lack of independent, peer-reviewed studies. As Criminon's website notes, the core of the prison program is the booklet The Way to Happiness. In 1997, Judge Stephen Rushing, a Pinellas County, Florida, judge, received criticism and raised eyebrows from other judges when he began sentencing defendants to a program called \\"Impulse Control\\" that was run by Criminon. Rushing said the people running the course promised they would not try to convert anyone. However the paper noted that many critics have suggested that Criminon was being used as a recruiting tool. Rushing stated that if the program turned out to be nothing but a ploy to promote Scientology, \\"I owe an apology to the people I put in that program.\\" Criminon has also been criticized for promoting Scientology's hostile view of psychiatry. A Criminon instruction manual found at California's Corcoran Prison in 2005 instructs the supervisors who are supposed to be helping the inmates to encourage them to stop taking any psychiatric medication. \\"Most jails and prisons have a staff psychiatrist that goes in daily and gives dosages of various and sundry mind-altering drugs to the inmates. Most of the time this is a ploy to keep the inmates sedated so that they don't cause trouble\\", the manual stated. While Criminon claimed that this manual was \\"outdated\\", the replacement manual still advised that if inmates seemed angry, it may be because \\"some of them are on psychiatric drugs and have strange side effects as a result.\\" Professor Stephen A. Kent said that Scientology's goal \\"is to destroy psychiatry and replace it with Scientology's own treatments. Criminon is simply one of many Scientology organizations that hope to see this goal realized.\\" In 2006, in New Mexico, government funding for the Second Chance program was cut when information on the program and its connections came to light. Albuquerque, New Mexico. Then-Nevada assembly member Sharron Angle supported the use of \\"Second Chance Program\\" in 2003. Angle sponsored legislation aimed at placing this program in women's prisons in Nevada.

It was designed by NSW Government Railways and William Weaver and built from 1883 to 1939. The station is located on the Richmond line, and is served by Sydney Trains T1 Western and T5 Cumberland line services. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Two routes to Windsor were proposed in 1846 for the introduction of railways into the colony of New South Wales. The line was built as the first line to be operated as a horse-drawn tramway. In 1856 a petition for the establishment of a railway from the residents of Windsor and Richmond had been presented to the Government. In 1860 a grant of £57,000 was approved for a railway between Blacktown and Windsor. In the following year it was increased to £60,000 for a railway between Blacktown and Richmond. The route of the railway line between Blacktown and Richmond was surveyed in 1862, with construction commencing late in that year. The engineer for the project was William Weaver (1828-1868), a former Colonial Architect of New South Wales. Contracts for earthworks, permanent ways and bridges were let from 1862 to William Randle & G. Gibbons on 11 December 1862. The contract was taken over by Messrs Iredale & McNamara on 28 September 1863. The Richmond line opened on 29 November 1864 by Governor Sir John Young, 1st Baron Lisgar as a rural branch line in response to the area's success as a farming district and its location at the intersection of two stock routes. A pilot engine was run before all passenger trains for safety. The original stations were Riverstone, Mulgrave, Windsor and Richmond. An upgrade to the track took place in the late nineteenth century. A major upgrading of most stations on the line occurred in the 1880s. The early decades of the 20th century brought further improvements and upgrades to the line. For example, the establishment of Richmond air-force base in 1925 resulted in increased use of the line. In 1938 congestion at Clarendon railway station caused by a Royal Australian Air Force air show resulted in extensive improvements. All stations were increased to 450 feet and additional facilities were installed at Richmond. Riverstone station was located on the eastern side of the line with a track layout which included a short platform loop, and a siding for general goods and to serve the local sawmill. In addition to the brick platform, the station included a brick built combined waiting room, station office and living quarters constructed in 1864. In 1879 a siding known as Richards Siding was built to service the abattoirs. Commencing in 1876, Engineer-in-Chief John Whitton undertook the major upgrading of the branch line. At Riverstone a new station, goods siding and shed, and station master's residence were completed between 1886 and 1889. The present brick platform building was constructed in 1889. From 1889 the original platform building was used as a parcels office and a post office. A c.1880s picture from the cover of Grantham Estate Purchasers' Companion and Guide, Boyd & King, Mitchell Library shows the Riverstone railway layout. The general waiting room was originally divided into two, the main waiting room and the ladies waiting room. In 1946 it was partly converted into an office and was again altered in 1952. Both original waiting rooms had fireplaces, and a World War I Honour Roll hung over the main waiting room fireplace until the 1970s (when it was removed for restoration and then disappeared). In 1919, a room was added to the original station building for the post office. By 1944, the post office had vacated the structure, but it continued to be used as a parcels office, with one room dedicated to the storage of bicycles. In recent years, parts of the structure have been removed. A timber platform was erected on the loop line in 1939. The line to Riverstone was electrified in 1975 and the platform and small structure were renewed. In 2001, canopies were erected on both platforms. The residence was built at the same time as the new station and replaced the former combined office/residence constructed in 1864. The new Station Master's residence conformed to a pattern that evolved in the 1880s which expressed the front elevation asymmetrically, with a verandah extending only halfway across the front and a projecting master bedroom. The design was consistent with other substantial brick residences in the 1880s. It was one of the last residences erected in brick in the 19th century following the arrival of Chief Commissioner, E. M. G. Eddy. The building has had later skillion-roof additions to the rear and side. Considerable internal alterations have also taken place to most rooms, except the bedrooms. The signal box was a two-room c.1939 fibro and timber clad building located on the platform. In 1975, a crew amenities building was built at the Richmond end of the platform. No buildings other than those on the platform and the 1889 residence survive. The War Memorial (owned by Council) was built in 1919 and designed by George Cook, Manager of the Windsor Branch of E.L. Kingsley & Co., monumental masons, and built by E.L. Kingsley & Co. The memorial has continued to be updated with details of military officials engaged in subsequent campaigns. In many towns, war memorials have been placed in station forecourts and at times on platforms. This occurred because of the paucity of available public land on which memorials could be made. Railway stations were once an important and central component of town life and memorials therefore had a high level of visibility. Additionally, many railway men and women volunteered for service in World Wars I and II and their names would appear on the memorials. This is the case at Riverstone. On 22 May 1975, Riverstone station became the terminus of the electrified line, with passengers changing to CPH and later 600/700 class railcars for the remainder of the journey to Richmond.\\"Goodbye Tin Hare\\" Railway Digest February 1985 pages 37-39 On 17 August 1991, the line was electrified to Richmond.\\"Electric trains reach Richmond\\" Railway Digest September 1991 page 311 = Modifications and dates = * 1878 - Ticket office erected. * 1879 - Toilet, signal box and goods siding built; the latter was at the eastern end of the platform * 1919 - a room was added to the original station building for the Post office * 26 July 1923 - Water tank capacity increased to 27kL. * 1939 - A timber platform was erected on the loop line and Interlocking installed with central operation and Down platform. * c.1939 - Fibro and timber clad, two room signal box located on the platform. * 1946 - The General Waiting Room was partly converted into an office and was again altered in 1952; platform and crossing loop extended to 152m long; a * water column provided on the Down side. * 18 Jan 1968 - \\"F\\" type lights & half-boom gates at Garfield Road level crossing * 1970s - Honour Roll removed from the main waiting room * 1975 - A crew amenities building was built at the Richmond end of the platform. * 1975 - The platform and small structure were renewed. * 2001- canopies were erected on both platforms.

Riverstone Parade)FuturePast, 2013, 17, 20 It also has a number of historically significant structures: * Platform 1 - roadside, brick faced (1860s-89) * Platform 2 - roadside, concrete block (s) * Former Goods Yard * War memorial - (1919) (Council owned) * Signs - timber station name board (Council owned) =Platform 1 Station Building (1889)= The station building on Platform 1 is composed of a number of buildings. The first is a single storey, s face brick symmetrical building with two flanking, parapeted wings, which includes a central waiting room with office on one side and the former ladies waiting room on the other, connecting to toilets in the eastern wing. The western wing is the former lamp room. The wings are linked to the main building by small, flat roofed rooms. The roadside elevation is fronted by an ogee profile timber and iron framed verandah between two projecting wings, while on the rail side there is a cast iron fluted column and metal framed awning with decorative brackets. The roadside faces the motor traffic forecourt which swings around the war memorial. Connected to the eastern end of the main building is a brick building under the same flat roof as the more modern shops that face the road behind it. This is linked to the previously free standing, original ticket office. Internally, the building has been refurbished except for elements such as timber joinery for doors and windows, wall vents and the enclosed fireplace. Tiles in the waiting room, most ceilings and other items have been replaced. =Signal Box (1939)= On the western side of the main building are two detached buildings. The first is the signal box linked to the main building via a shallow roofed metal shelter. It is a fibro-sheet and weatherboard signal box with corrugated metal gabled roof and concrete base. It is a reasonably large box and an unusual building of later design. The original levers have been removed and only a new signalling board remains. The signal box was closed in 1999. =Platform 1 Store and Shelter ()= The second detached building further to the west of the signal box is a store of similar construction. Further west again is an open passenger shelter with butterfly style corrugated metal awning supported on steel columns and beams. A central steel framed panelled partition divides the both sides of the shelter. =Parcels Office (1919)= External: The parcels office is a painted brick building with corrugated steel hipped roof featuring two segmental arched tall windows in the centre and two doors (one segmental arched original timber door with fanlight, and the other metal later door) on either side of the platform elevation. There are no other openings on the building. Windows are double-hung with multi-paned upper sash. =Platform 2 Shelter (s)= This shelter is an aluminium framed structure with glass sides and colorbond gable roof extending as an awning on the platform side. =Station Master's Residence ()= This is a large single storey brick Station Master's residence with hipped and pitched corrugated metal roof, a projecting bay and corrugated iron veranda at the front. The veranda is supported on slender timber chamfered posts. It has a later lean to addition in fibro to the side and a timber lean to at the rear. The building is face brick, partly painted and has two brick chimneys with dentilated and corbelled tops. The residence is currently vacant and reflects its recent conversion into a number of units. Most of its original internal elements including fireplace surrounds and ceilings have been removed and damaged. The original timber moulded window and door frames as well as some moulded timber skirting survive. Damaged paling timber fencing along the Riverstone Parade boundary of the property has recently been replaced by timber picket fence together with new timber paling fencing along the platform side of the boundary. The building fronts Garfield Road West and features metal standard railway fencing on this boundary. It is a Type 7 (J3) residence. This is a moderately common type, as 13-15 examples exist. It is in poor condition, but is a robust structure. There are building code and disability access issues to be overcome for commercial reuse. However, it is in a prominent position and otherwise has good commercial reuse potential, particularly due to the large backyard.FuturePast, 2013, 41, 45 The station master's residence has had later skillion-roof additions to the rear and side. Considerable internal alterations have also taken place to most rooms, except the bedrooms. =Platform 1 (1860s-89)= The eastern platform is brick faced road side construction raised by five courses above the original 1860s sandstone topped platform. The sandstone topping extends from the precast concrete store building at the northern end to adjacent to the cottage/ticket office at the southern end of the station. =Platform 2 (s)= On west side of the track is a concrete platform. =Former Goods Yard= The former goods yard has largely been demolished. The only remaining evidence is the rails and timber buffer. A small, recent brick and colorbond shed is also located on the site. The corrugated iron per way shed and c.1889 goods shed were removed at an unknown date. This was a 21 x 14 side shed with no awning, a central pair of sliding doors and a window on each side with door and window at one end with separate flight of stairs. The platform extended from the doors to an extended platform to the north with sloped end. The building was simple corrugated iron clad with windows in small Victorian pattern panes. The barge boards were shaped and the eaves construction was elaborate for the use as goods shed indicating an early non-standard building. The Gangers Hut was also removed at an unknown date. This was an excellent example of an early gangers hut located with a group of buildings, clad in corrugated iron. =War Memorial= Designed by George Cook, Manager of the Windsor Branch of E.L. Kingsley & Co., monumental masons, built by E.L. Kingsley & Co. A stone obelisk mounted on a stone base with curb, small gate and small shrubs around the base. The plaque is marble and two rifles are carved into the stone at the front. The entire monument is sited in a paved road island with bollards. The War Memorial has been updated with details of military officials engaged in subsequent campaigns. =Platform signs= The timber platform signs supported on timber posts are intact examples of early station signs that are rapidly diminishing. =Moveable heritage= The station retains a Seth Thomas Clock,No 2468 which was in the process of being repaired and restored at the time of inspection in January 2009. =Potential archaeological features= There is a potential within the former goods yard for likely surviving elements that are not visible at this time. = Condition = As at 29 January 2015, the station buildings were reported to be in very good condition, both inside and outside. The station master's residence was in very poor condition, particularly internally. All interiors of the residence appear to have been damaged by fire and vandalism. The residence suffers significantly from rising damp possibly due to painting of external walls. It requires urgent repair and maintenance works. The siding area on the southern side of the station may contain some archaeological remnants. The station buildings are of high integrity and remain intact. The Station Master's residence has moderate integrity and has lost its intactness. The overall integrity of the station has been relatively reduced by the removal of the 1864 original station building.  Heritage listing  Riverstone Station is significant as part of the original construction phase of the Richmond line in the 1860s that provided access to the settlements on the Hawkesbury River and the markets of Sydney. The station probably influenced the establishment of the meatworks at Riverstone by Benjamin Richards in 1878 and it retains the complex of structures associated with the major upgrading works of the Richmond branch line that commenced during the 1880s by the Engineer-in-Chief, John Whitton. The 1889 station building retains much of its original detailing and is intact. The overall integrity of the station has been relatively reduced by the removal of the original 1860s station building, and only part of the early platform remains from this period. Notwithstanding, the station group is a key element in the townscape of Riverstone providing the interface between the railway line and the historic Riverstone Township subdivision of 1877. The former Station Master's residence is significant as a representative example of a late- nineteenth century Station Master's residence constructed in brick. The construction of the building is associated with the former prominence of the railway in Riverstone, brought about by the development of the meatworks. The building is centrally located in the town of Riverstone, however, its landmark qualities have been significantly reduced by the later additions and modifications. Riverstone railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Riverstone Station is historically significant as physical evidence of the original construction phase of the Richmond line in the 1860s that provided access to the settlements on the Hawkesbury River and the markets of Sydney.

The construction of the Station Master's residence (as part of a general upgrade) in the 1880s demonstrates the importance of the Riverstone goods and freight traffic to the New South Wales Government Railways. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The 1880s to 1940s upgrades of the station complex are good representative examples of railway civil engineering practice for their respective periods. The main 1889 station building is a good example of second class station buildings featuring typical characteristics of this design including symmetrical face brick main building flanked with two parapeted wings planned around a central waiting room. The Station Master's residence was a good example of a government institutional residence in brick of the late nineteenth century, retaining original features such as window and door fenestration, verandah, and brick chimneys. However, later fibro and timber lean-to additions as well as removal of almost all internal finishes and decorative elements has reduced significantly its aesthetic and architectural quality. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Riverstone Station has high research potential in providing evidence of a complex of station structures built in the 1860s through the late 1880s. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The station contains rare examples of mid 1860s railway civil engineering practice, namely the station platform (part). The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Riverstone Station is a representative example of station layout of the late 19th century including station buildings, residence, parcels office and signal box; and has representative significance for demonstrating widespread 19th Century railway customs, activities and design in NSW.

Hydroxyapatite is the hydroxyl endmember of the complex apatite group. The OH− ion can be replaced by fluoride, chloride or carbonate, producing fluorapatite or chlorapatite. It crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system. Pure hydroxyapatite powder is white. Naturally occurring apatites can, however, also have brown, yellow, or green colorations, comparable to the discolorations of dental fluorosis. Up to 50% by volume and 70% by weight of human bone is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, known as bone mineral. Carbonated calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite is the main mineral of which dental enamel and dentin are composed. Hydroxyapatite crystals are also found in the small calcifications, within the pineal gland and other structures, known as corpora arenacea or 'brain sand'. Chemical synthesis Hydroxyapatite can be synthesized via several methods, such as wet chemical deposition, biomimetic deposition, sol-gel route (wet-chemical precipitation) or electrodeposition. Yagai and Aoki proposed the hydroxyapatite nanocrystal suspension can be prepared by a wet chemical precipitation reaction following the reaction equation below: 10 Ca(OH)2 \\\\+ 6 H3PO4 → Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 \\\\+ 18 H2O Calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite Calcium-deficient (non-stochiometric) hydroxyapatite, Ca10−x(PO4)6−x(HPO4)x(OH)2−x (where x is between 0 and 1) has a Ca/P ratio between 1.67 and 1.5. The Ca/P ratio is often used in the discussion of calcium phosphate phases. Stoichiometric apatite Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 has a Ca/P ratio of 10:6 normally expressed as 1.67. The non-stoichiometric phases have the hydroxyapatite structure with cation vacancies (Ca2+) and anion (OH−) vacancies. The sites occupied solely by phosphate anions in stoichiometric hydroxyapatite, are occupied by phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, HPO42−, anions. Preparation of these calcium-deficient phases can be prepared by precipitation from a mixture of calcium nitrate and diammonium phosphate with the desired Ca/P ratio, for example, to make a sample with a Ca/P ratio of 1.6: :9.6 Ca(NO3)2 \\\\+ 6 (NH4)2HPO4 → Ca9.6(PO4)5.6(HPO4)0.4(OH)1.6 Sintering these non-stoichiometric phases forms a solid phase which is an intimate mixture of tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite, termed biphasic calcium phosphate: :Ca10−x(PO4)6−x(HPO4)x(OH)2−x → (1 − x) Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 \\\\+ 3x Ca3(PO4)2 Biological function =Mantis shrimp= The clubbing appendages of the Odontodactylus scyllarus (peacock mantis shrimp) are made of an extremely dense form of the mineral which has a higher specific strength; this has led to its investigation for potential synthesis and engineering use. Their dactyl appendages have excellent impact resistance due to the impact region being composed of mainly crystalline hydroxyapatite, which offers significant hardness. A periodic layer underneath the impact layer composed of hydroxyapatite with lower calcium and phosphorus content (thus resulting in a much lower modulus) inhibits crack growth by forcing new cracks to change directions. This periodic layer also reduces the energy transferred across both layers due to the large difference in modulus, even reflecting some of the incident energy. =Mammal/primate/human= Hydroxyapatite is present in bone and teeth; bone is made primarily of HA crystals interspersed in a collagen matrix—65 to 70% of the mass of bone is HA. Similarly HA is 70 to 80% of the mass of dentin and enamel in teeth. In enamel, the matrix for HA is formed by amelogenins and enamelins instead of collagen. Hydroxyapatite deposits in tendons around joints results in the medical condition calcific tendinitis. Uses =Cosmetic= Hydroxyapatite is added to some variations of cornstarch based baby powder such as Johnson's Aloe & Vitamin E powder. According to the website, the mineral is added as an emollient to \\"help moisturize and soften skin.\\" =Medical= Flexible hydrogel-HA composite, which has a mineral-to-organic matrix ratio approximating that of human bone. HA is increasingly used to make bone grafting materials as well as dental prosthetics and repair. Some implants, e.g. hip replacements, dental implants and bone conduction implants, are coated with HA. As the native dissolution rate of hydroxyapatite in-vivo, around 10 wt% per year, is significantly lower than the growth rate of newly formed bone tissue, in its use as a bone replacement material, ways are being sought to enhance its solubility rate and thus promote better bioactivity. Hydroxyapatite is added to special toothpastes as an additive to prevent tooth decay and to counteract tooth sensitivity. = Supplement = Hydroxyapatite overgrowing the biomaterial Microcrystalline hydroxyapatite (MCHA) is marketed as a \\"bone-building\\" supplement with superior absorption in comparison to calcium. It is a second- generation calcium supplement derived from bovine bone. In the 1980s, bone meal calcium supplements were found to be contaminated with heavy metals, and although the manufacturers claim their MCHA is free from contaminants, it isn't recommended because its effect in the body has not been well-tested. Chromatography The mechanism of hydroxyapatite chromatography is complicated and has been described as \\"mixed-mode\\". It involves ionic interactions between positively charged groups on a biomolecule (often a protein) and the phosphate groups in hydroxyapatite, and metal chelation between hydroxyapatite calcium ions and negatively charged phosphate and/or carboxyl groups on the biomolecule. It may be difficult to predict the effectiveness of hydroxyapatite chromatography based on physical and chemical properties of the desired protein to be purified. For elution, a buffer with increasing phosphate and/or neutral salt concentration is typically used. Use in archaeology In archaeology, hydroxyapatite from human and animal remains can be analysed to reconstruct ancient diets, migrations and paleoclimate. The mineral fractions of bone and teeth act as a reservoir of trace elements, including carbon, oxygen and strontium. Stable isotope analysis of human and faunal hydroxyapatite can be used to indicate whether a diet was predominantly terrestrial or marine in nature (carbon, strontium); the geographical origin and migratory habits of an animal or human (oxygen, strontium) and to reconstruct past temperatures and climate shifts (oxygen). Post-depositional alteration of bone can contribute to the degradation of bone collagen, the protein required for stable isotope analysis. Defluoridation Hydroxyapatite is a potential adsorbent for the defluoridation of drinking water, as it forms fluorapatite in a 3 step process. Hydroxyapatite removes F− from the water to replace OH− forming fluorapatite. However, during the defluoridation process the HA dissolves, and increases the pH and phosphate ion concentration which makes the defluoridated water unfit for drinking. Recently, a ″calcium amended-hydroxyapatite″ defluoridation technique was suggested to overcome the phosphate leaching from HA. This technique can also affect fluorosis reversal by providing calcium-enriched alkaline drinking water to fluorosis affected areas. Needle-like hydroxyapatite crystals on stainless steel.

Clunes post office opened as early as 1 October 1857 and in 1874 Clunes was connected to the Victorian railway network. Clunes station was opened in the same year. In 1873 mine employers attempted to introduce Saturday afternoon and Sunday shifts. The miners refused to sign the new terms outlined in their contract renewals and went on a strike that lasted 3 months. Some days into the action the miners organised the Clunes Miners' Association and what were to become known as the Clunes riots, successfully resisting the use of Chinese labour from CreswickBallaret Courier 1873 as strikebreakers.The Ballarat Star (Vic. : 1865–1924) Wed 10 December 1873 Page 2 RIOTS AT CLUNES From the 1850s through to 1893, when gold mining eventually came to an end, Clunes was an important gold production location in Victoria.

At the , Beechworth had a population of 3,859. Beechworth's many historical buildings are well preserved and the town has re-invented itself and evolved into a popular tourist destination and growing wine-producing centre. History Originally used for grazing by the settler David Reid, the area was known as Mayday Hills until 1853, when it was renamed Beechworth. The Post Office opened on 1 May 1853 as Spring Creek and was renamed Beechworth on 1 January 1854. Lieutenant-Governor La Trobe visited the settlement in May 1853 and instructed Government Surveyor Robert Brough Smyth to lay out the principal streets of the town and survey allotments.Cox, Philip & Stacey, (1973), Historic towns of Australia, Melbourne, Lansdowne, p.138. =Gold= Between 1852 and 1857, Beechworth was a gold producing region and centre of government; but its power, wealth and influence were short lived. According to Carole Woods, an early party of prospectors retrieved a pan of gold from the area weighing .Woods, p. 10 Another lucky party cleared some of gold in a week.Woods, p. 16 And so began a rush into this remote region. During the first election campaign in 1855, one candidate, Daniel Cameron, rode a horse shod with solid gold horseshoes. The extravagance of this event is still commemorated as the logo for Beechworth is a golden horseshoe. At the time, Beechworth was far removed from the centre of colonial administration in Melbourne both in distance and time taken to travel. The local debates around the potential railway into Beechworth encompassed a broad gauge () option or a narrow gauge () system, between Wangaratta and Beechworth and these debates and options appeared in the Ovens and Murray Advertiser newspaper. Ironically, in the 1890s a narrow gauge system did eventuate nearby, running from Wangaratta to Whitfield. Finally a broad gauge railway arrived at Beechworth in September 1876,\\"The Ovens Valley Goldfields Railways\\", Eardley, Gifford, Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, December, 1968 pp. 281–294; January, 1969 1–18 but by that stage the town and its gold production was waning. The rail line was closed in 1977 and dismantled, after 101 years of service. During its boom times, Beechworth town boasted a range of industries including, a tannery, jewellers, boot makers, a brewery, blacksmiths, livestock sale yards. It had schools, a convent, hotels, a prison with imposing stone walls, a hospital, a mental hospital, court house, police barracks, stage coach companies and a powder magazine. Beechworth State Bank of Victoria In its golden days, men and women arrived from the United States, United Kingdom and China. At its peak, Beechworth town had over 3,100 residents.O'Brien, Shenanignas, pp. 17–18. Surrounding areas and mining camps sprang up as thousands of miners rushed into areas such as Spring Creek, Reedy Creek, Silver Creek, the Nine Mile Creek and the Woolshed increasing the population on the Ovens to around 22,000.Woods, p. 92 The Chinese were not allowed to live in Beechworth town and resided on the outskirts. Numerous controls, regulations and licence checks were enforced on the Chinese miners (see: Woods; also McWaters; also O'Brien; and Cronin). Beechworth Cemetery has a large preserved section of early Chinese miners/pioneers. The presence of the Chinese goldminers around Beechworth and throughout Victoria's north- eastern region created social unrest and these are recorded in O'Brien's; Woods'; and Cronin's works below. =Recent years= The Beechworth Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990. =Notable figures= Like many Australian country towns associated with the early goldfields, Beechworth had its share of colourful characters and villains. Among the infamous during the 1870s was the one-time Livery Stable owner, later the 'Dog Officer', at some other time the 'Pound Officer' and another time shire revenue officer, John Phelan.O'Brien, 'Awaiting Ned Kelly' & Jones, The Friendship, p. 29. Phelan was a continual litigant, correspondent to the newspapers and advertiser. His official and officious escapades were mockingly reported in the local paper.O'Brien Robert O'Hara Burke Robert O'Hara Burke, leader of the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition was stationed in Beechworth as Senior Inspector of Police from 1854 to 1857. Policeman John Sadleir, one of the Kelly Gang pursuers, was also stationed in Beechworth during its early days.(Harvey) The Burke Museum is located in Loch Street and holds primary materials on Beechworth and the surrounding district's past. Source materials include newspapers, photos, artefacts, clothing, paintings, exhibitions, published local histories and unpublished theses on the district and displays dating back to the gold discoveries, early Chinese miners and workings of the 1850s. Sir Isaac Isaacs Isaac Isaacs was Australia's first native-born Governor-General, appointed in 1931. The Isaacs family moved to Beechworth to help their son to gain a better quality education, in 1867, first enrolling him in the Common school then in the Beechworth Grammar School. He became dux in his first year. In his second year he was employed part-time as an assistant teacher at the school, and took up after school tutoring of fellow students. In September 1870, when Isaacs was just 15 years old, he passed his examination as a pupil teacher and taught at the school from then until 1873. Isaacs was next employed as an assistant teacher at the Beechworth State School, the successor to the Common school.Gordon, Max (1963). Sir Isaac Isaacs. Adelaide: Heinemann. From 1875 Isaacs moved to Melbourne for work and to undertake law studies. His connection to Beechworth was re-established when he was elected as the member for Bogong in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from May 1892 until May 1893 and between June 1893 and May 1901. Isaacs further represented Beechworth and surrounding areas when he was elected to the first Federal Parliament in 1901 to the seat of Indi. He served until 1906 when he was appointed to the High Court. Ned Kelly The outlaw Ned Kelly had many links to Beechworth – he spent time in HM Prison Beechworth and fought a famous boxing bout with Isaiah \\"Wild\\" Wright in the back of a local hotel. Aaron Sherritt and Joe Byrne of the Kelly Gang came from the Woolshed goldmining camp, outside of Beechworth town. It was in Beechworth gaol that twenty-one men, suspected Kelly Gang supporters, relatives and other sympathisers were held without trial or evidence for over three months, by the Chief Commissioner of Police Captain Standish, under the Outlawry Act.Jones, pp. 177–178 George B. Kerferd George B. Kerferd (1836–1889), a longtime resident of Beechworth, became a Premier of Victoria and was a major participant in ensuring Beechworth had a railway connection to Melbourne. John Buckley Castieau Castieau (1831–1885) was the Prison Governor at Beechworth from 1856 to 1869. The prison, famous for its huge granite walls was known as \\"Castieau's castle\\". As the Governor of the Melbourne gaol in 1880 he was an official witness to the hanging of Ned Kelly. His diaries were later published (2004) as The Difficulties of My Position.John Buckley Castieau (Mark Finnane, editor), The difficulties of my position; the diaries of prison governor John Buckley Castieau 1855–1884, National Library of Australia, Canberra, 2004. In this book a drawing from the Australian Sketcher, 14 August 1880 shows Castieau sitting with Ned Kelly during his remand (p. 278) and also a photo of his signature as one of the witnesses to the Kelly hanging (p. viii).  Sir Albert Edward (Bert) Chadwick  Born in 1897 died in 1983. Sportsman, businessman and sports administrator.  Alfred William Foster  Born in 1886, died in 1962. Judge.  Climate  Beechworth features an oceanic climate (Cfb) with warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters. As one of the higher towns in Victoria, snowfalls can be expected each year. Newspapers In its golden heyday Beechworth boasted two influential newspapers: The Ovens and Murray Advertiser and The Constitution and Mining Intelligencer. These papers engaged in fierce competition and for a while were daily issues. The papers circulated far and wide throughout the district and the colony of Victoria.(O'Brien) Both papers represented the views of their respective readerships sometimes to the exclusion of all others.(O'Brien) Even today, these old papers are an important historical research tool, as most editions from the early 1850 survive and are micro- filmed and are available at the Burke Museum, and most state and National libraries throughout Australia. These two local papers provide rich primary sources for many historians of Beechworth and its surrounds, plus the Kelly Gang historians.(See: Woods (1985); McMahon (2000); Lane (1978); McQuilton (1979); Jones (1995); McWaters (2002); O'Brien (2005); and Wild & McMahon (2006)) The Ovens and Murray Advertiser still survives as a local paper. Tourism Beechworth Gallery. Beechworth is a popular tourist destination. Attractions include Ned Kelly themed displays at the old court house and Ned Kelly Weekend, which is Australia's most significant recreation of the Kelly legend it commemorates the anniversary of the outlaw's committal hearing held in the historic Beechworth Courthouse from 6 to 11 August 1880. Other popular draws to the area are its many annual festivals, including the famous Golden Horseshoes Festival Easter Parade through centre of town, The Burke Museum, waterfalls, Gun Powder Magazine, Newtown Bridge (Stone Bridge), Tail Race (Mining Race), Spring Creek Water Falls, Spring Creek Gorge, Beechworth Lunatic Asylum ghost tours, lakes, historic buildings, goldfields, walks, the Beechworth Bakery, Beechworth Honey, brewery, the lolly shop and night tours, the restaurants and wineries.

It has an electric barbecue and also has a canteen with cold drinks and snacks. Books on Beechworth Beechworth Old Priory Considering the present nature of the town, a surprising range and variety of books exist on Beechworth town, its adjoining goldfield camps, its surrounds and its heady goldfield days. These include numerous histories, a treasure of local histories, theses, material on bushrangers, police, Chinese, riots, the coming and going of the railway and novels set in the district. =Histories= *Griffiths, Tom.

In the 1950s and 60s, Cohen was a founding member of the New Lost City Ramblers, a New York-based string band. Cohen made several expedition to Peru to film and record the traditional culture of the Q'ero, an indigenous people. Cohen was also a professor of visual arts at SUNY Purchase College for 25 years. Life and career Cohen was born in Queens, New York, where his father, Israel, owned a shoe store. He grew up on Long Island, where he mastered the guitar and banjo. Cohen attended Yale University, organising folk music concerts on campus and beginning to photograph musicians. He was awarded a master’s degree in fine arts in 1957. In 1958, Cohen formed the New Lost City Ramblers with Mike Seeger and Tom Paley. In 1962, Paley was replaced by Tracy Schwarz. The Ramblers introduced young urban folk music fans to the work of rural performers such as Dock Boggs, Elizabeth Cotten and Blind Alfred Reed. The influence of the Ramblers has been compared to Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music. It has been suggested that The Grateful Dead song \\"Uncle John's Band\\", releaed on the album Workingman's Dead, was about Cohen and his band. Cohen called this \\"a true rumor.\\" Cohen described the outlook of the Ramblers: “We made it possible for urban-based musicians to step out of the demands of the music business and look out into America to get in touch with the genuine energy, drive and craziness out there.” Rather than pursuing commercial success through a polished sound, Cohen and the Ramblers undertook numerous research field trips to the South. In spring 1959, Cohen went to Hazard, Kentucky in search of traditional musicians. A series of chance encounters led him to Roscoe Holcomb who played \\"Across the Rocky Mountain\\". \\"My hair stood up on end,\\" Cohen recalled. \\"It was the most moving, touching, dynamic, powerful song. Not the song itself, but the way he sang it was just astounding.\\" Cohen's recording trip resulted in the album, Mountain Music of Kentucky, released on the Folkways label. In 1962, Cohen returned to Kentucky, where he spent six weeks filming the documentary The High Lonesome Sound which centred on Holcomb. (The title of the film became synonymous with the Appalachian music he captured.) Cohen subsequently recorded Dillard Chandler and made the documentary The End of an Old Song about Chandler and his world. With Ralph Rinzler and Izzy Young, Cohen created the organization Friends of Old Time Music. They produced a string of concerts featuring traditional musicians in New York in the 1960s In New York, Cohen was a neighbor of Swiss photographer Robert Frank. Frank recruited Cohen to be the still photographer on Pull My Daisy (1959), the Beat Generation film directed by Frank and Alfred Leslie, written by Jack Kerouac and featuring Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky and Gregory Corso. Influenced by Frank, Cohen photographed the Abstract Expressionist painters and Beat writers who congregated in artists' studios and at the Cedar Tavern. Cohen learnt about weaving customs of Peru through an archaeology course at Yale. He travelled to the Peruvian Andes in 1956 to write his master’s thesis on their weaving techniques. Cohen visited Peru eight times between 1956 and 2005. His work in Peru included audio recordings of Andean music and documentary films as well as books about weaving, music, festivals, and dance. Cohen's recording of a Peruvian wedding song was included on the Voyager Golden Record which was attached to the Voyager spacecraft in 1977. Cohen ceased to perform with the New Lost City Ramblers in the 1970s, though they would re-unite for a 20th anniversary concert at New York’s Carnegie Hall in 1978 and for a 35th anniversary tour in 1993. From 1972 to 1997, Cohen was a Professor of Visual Arts at SUNY Purchase College where he taught photography and drawing. In 1998, Cohen released his first solo album, Stories the Crow Told Me. Steve Leggett wrote in AllMusic that the record is \\"not so much a redefinition of Appalachian music as it is an attempt to enter it fully and completely. Cohen does this so well that the album sounds exactly like some great, lost Alan Lomax field tape, and although by definition what Cohen has done here is a facsimile, it sounds so much like the real deal that it hardly matters.\\" Cohen was associate music producer on the movie Cold Mountain (2003), working with T Bone Burnett. Cohen appeared in the Martin Scorsese documentary about Bob Dylan, No Direction Home (2005), describing Dylan's development in the context of the 1960s folk music revival. From 2008 onwards Cohen performed with The Down Hill Strugglers, an old-time string band featuring younger performers. In 2009, the Smithsonian Channel released a documentary about Cohen, Play On, John: A Life in Music. In 2011, the Library of Congress acquired the John Cohen archive of manuscripts, films, photographs and audio recordings. Cohen's archive includes interviews with Harry Smith, Roger McGuinn, Pete Seeger, Bob Dylan, Gary Davis and Roscoe Holcomb. The photographs include these artists and Willie Dixon, Woody Guthrie, Alan Lomax, Bill Monroe, The Stanley Brothers, Merle Travis, Muddy Waters and many others. Cohen resided in Putnam Valley, New York. Personal life In 1965 Cohen married Penny Seeger, a member of the musical Seeger family. They had a daughter, Sonya Cohen Cramer, a singer who died in 2015, and a son, Rufus. Penny accompanied her husband to Peru and collaborated on recording music. She died in 1993.

It is on the Murray River which forms the border between Victoria and New South Wales. Cobram along with the nearby towns of Numurkah and Yarrawonga is part of Shire of Moira and is the administrative centre of the council. Its twin town of Barooga is located on the north side of the Murray River. Surrounding Cobram are a number of orchards, dairy farms and wineries. At the 2016 census, Cobram had a population of 6,014.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Barooga's population is currently 1,817.50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. History Aboriginals, although they had disappeared from the area prior to European settlement, were believed to inhabit the stretch of region bound by the Murray River from Tocumwal to the east of Cobram and south as far as the Broken Creek. Unfortunately, the area bound by Melbourne, Echuca and Albury was a trouble area for recording Aboriginal presence. The main tribe believed to have occupied the area were the Bangerang. A 'horde', or smaller grouping of about 100 persons, named Angootheraban, are believed to have lived in the immediate Cobram area. Charles Sturt first passed through the region on the northern bank of the Murray River in June 1838 en route to South Australia, leading a cattle droving party, with 300 head of cattle. In January 1845, Octavius Phillpotts established Cobram station between the already existing Yarrawonga and Strathmerton stations, located where Cobram East now is. This was divided into the Cobram and St. James stations in 1855. By the 1860s, present day Cobram still hadn't begun to exist, and the area was still broadly referred to as Yarroweyah. In 1868, the old township of Cobram, bound by Warkil Street to the west and the Murray River to the east was reserved for future use, about 15 kilometres west of Cobram East. Up until this time, the area of Cobram was part of the Echuca Shire, Cobram station was included when Yarrawonga Shire was created on 15 May 1878. It would later be part of the Tungamah shire in its creation on 17 February 1893. On 12 August 1879 the first school, 2166 Cobram, opened, later renamed Cobram East. In 1886, the government produced the town plan for Cobram, as section 110. 1888 brought about the establishment of the township proper, with the opening of the primary school, Cobram 2881, in April, the opening of the Cobram Post Office near the court house on 1 May, and the coming of the railway on 1 October, which had been heavily publicised by the Cobram Courier, the town's newspaper, first issued 12 September of that year. It was also in 1888 that the first policeman was appointed, the first doctor arrived and Cobram Football Club played its first match along with the building of Cobram's first pub, the Royal Victoria Hotel. A river punt began operating between Cobram and the New South Wales banks the following year. The Cobram Post Office was moved to its present site on 23 February 1904, the first government building in town and the first built in Australia with the authority of the Commonwealth government. Cobram township was finally proclaimed by Sir John Fuller, Governor of Victoria, on 2 December 1912. Two years later, electricity for the town was being produced by a local coal-fired power plant. St. Joseph's Catholic primary school was opened in 1922 and in 1925, the Cobram Golf Club opened a 9-hole course near the Murray Valley Highway, transferring three years later to the current location in Barooga. Cobram adopted yet another town plan in 1949, the first rural Victorian town to do so, with high anticipation of population growth and the proliferation of industry. In 1950, the first of such expansions was realised, with the creation of the Murray Valley Co-operative Dairy Producers and Trading Company, the predecessor of Murray Goulburn Co-operative. The town split from Tungamah Shire and Cobram Shire was formed on 1 April 1953, after increasing agitation from the townspeople with the operations of the Tungamah Shire. The first Shire President was Mr Norm Jordan, a long-standing Cobram businessman. Almost ten years later, in 1962, the first high school opened in the town. In May 1972, the first connections to town sewerage were made, totaling 1,000 by 1976. Through the 1980s and 1990s, Cobram was awarded many town awards, including Tidiest Town in Victoria in 1991 and 1993. In 1993, Cobram Shire was amalgamated with Yarrawonga, Numurkah, Nathalia and Tungamah Shires to form the Moira Shire. Present day Murray Valley Highway, as approaching from Yarrawonga. Cobram serves as the headquarters for the Shire of Moira, is centrally located within the shire and is the second-largest town. Cobram has one government high school and a primary school, an Anglican prep to year 12 college, a Catholic primary school and a special developmental school. It also has a district hospital, built in 1949 with emergency department and an associated nursing home for the elderly. There are numerous recreational facilities for public use, such as Scott Reserve, the Cobram Showgrounds, Cobram Lawn Tennis Club and of course the Murray River including Thompson's Beach. A large sports stadium is located adjacent to the Anglican College and Cobram Showgrounds, with numerous soccer fields, netball and tennis courts outside, along with indoor basketball, badminton, volleyball, tennis and netball courts. The Melba Theatre first opened on 1 December 1948. Featuring a lobby and two cinemas, it was the first air-conditioned theatre in the region. A fire destroyed the cinema and caused damage to surrounding shops on 10 April 2010 and it was demolished the following day. A Peaches & Cream Festival is held biennially around the second or third weekend in January. It is Australia's oldest-running festival, with a town parade and music festival located at Thompson's Beach. Thompson's Beach, as viewed from New South Wales. Cobram is the birthplace of Murray Goulburn Co-operative, Australia's largest dairy co-operative, collecting 35% of Australia's milk produce through its numerous facilities throughout south eastern Australia. Murray Goulburn, along with the Meiji Dairy Corporation milk processing plant, a large abattoir and orange juice factories form the major industries of the town as well as serving as major employers. Cobram is home to a large Muslim community of mainly Iraqi origin which continues to grow quickly, along with Italians who migrated in the post-war boom, and began a thriving fruit industry. In 2006, the then 104-year-old De Burgh Truss road bridge over the river was replaced by a concrete type immediately adjacent to and upstream of the original bridge, named Cobram Barooga Bridge. The new bridge was built to a cost of $9.6 million and completed ahead of schedule. Smaller towns located nearby include Strathmerton, home of a large Bega cheese processing plant, Yarroweyah, Katamatite, Katunga, Koonoomoo and the larger towns of Yarrawonga on the Victorian side and Tocumwal on the New South Wales side. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 6,014 people in Cobram. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.7% of the population. * 75.8% of people were born in Australia.

Suburbs Although there are no named suburbs in the town, there are areas which can be distinguished by locals due to their colloquial names. The Mill End is the oldest area name, given to the old Cobram town bound by Warkil Street to the west and the river to the east, so named because of the timber mills that were once scattered in the area. It is still used, although not as commonly, by people and business. Murray Heights is the name given to the estate of relatively recent residential area that runs along the sand hills of River Road on the town's eastern edge. The sandy mounds had previously been occupied by orchards. Koonoomoo, Yarroweyah and Cobram East share the same post code as Cobram, as does Barooga despite being in NSW.

Cobram Bowling Club is centrally located and has three grass greens. The club has two ladies' pennant teams and four Saturday pennant sides which participate in the Murray Bowls Association. Golfers play at the Cobram Barooga Golf Club on Barooga Golf Course Road. The Cobram Lawn Tennis Club hosts an annual tournament over Labour Day#Australia Weekend (usually the first weekend of March). It is attended by around 750 tennis players from around Victoria, with most travelling from Melbourne for the weekend. The tournament concludes with the finals on Labour Day Monday. Public transport V/Line once serviced Cobram with regular daily passenger trains as part of the Shepparton service. These train services were discontinued in 1993. Now V/Line operates multiple daily return connecting coach services between Cobram and Melbourne, as well as multiple return services to Albury and Mildura. NSW TrainLink, the New South Wales regional rail and coach provider, services Cobram with three-times-weekly return coach services 741 and 742 between Albury and Echuca. Climate Cobram has a Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and cool, wet winters. The area has 300 days of sunshine a year. The average wettest day Cobram would have is around 30 millimetres. Landmarks The 1912 court house. A major landmark is the Cobram Bridge, a De Burgh truss lift bridge, which was built across the Murray in 1902. The Cobram Bridge is the only bridge on the Murray River whose construction was completely funded by the Victorian government. Tenders were awarded in November 1900 and the bridge was opened officially on 3 December 1902, two months after being open to traffic. Other landmarks include the settlers' log cabin, war memorial and civic centre. Also of note is the Cobram courthouse, built in 1912, which continues to be utilised as the Cobram Magistrates' Court. Most of the old brick buildings were of local bricks, made by Samuel Steward. He has a monument on the Cobram to Barooga Road. Cobram Station, built from 1905 to 1907, is a large homestead located east of the town on the Murray Valley Highway. The building comprises 250,000 bricks hand- made on site. It is currently a private residence. Around the region are numerous river beaches, with Thompson's Beach, claimed to be the largest inland beach in Australia located just north of Mookarii Street, before crossing into New South Wales.

The town is situated on the south bank of the Murray River, the border between Victoria and New South Wales and is located approximately north-east of the state capital, Melbourne. Yarrawonga's twin town of Mulwala is on the other side of the Murray River. At the , Yarrawonga had a population of 7,930. Yarrawonga is served by a standard gauge branch railway, which branches off the Melbourne-Sydney line at Benalla and terminates at Oaklands in New South Wales. Yarrawonga Town Hall. Yarrawonga's main attraction is Lake Mulwala, formed by the damming of the Murray River. The lake is a popular location for activities such as boating, kayaking and fishing. There are two crossings of the Murray between Yarrawonga and Mulwala; across the weir (a stock route carrying a single lane of traffic); and a bridge over Lake Mulwala. This bridge contains an unusual bend and dip in the middle, a result of miscommunication between the two state governments. The Yarrawonga Football Club (the 'Mighty Pigeons') participates in the Ovens and Murray Football League in the sport of Australian rules football, which has produced the likes of Barry Mitchell, Joel Smith, Ben Dixon, and Tom Lonergan.

H. C. Whitehead, is one of the most basic links. Whitehead spent much of the 1930s looking for a proof of the Poincaré conjecture. In 1934, the Whitehead link was used as part of his construction of the now-named Whitehead manifold, which refuted his previous purported proof of the conjecture. Structure The link is created with two projections of the unknot: one circular loop and one figure eight-shaped loop (i.e., a loop with a Reidemeister Type I move applied) intertwined such that they are inseparable and neither loses its form. Excluding the instance where the figure eight thread intersects itself, the Whitehead link has four crossings. Because each under-hand crossing has a paired upper-hand crossing, its linking number is 0. It is not isotopic to the unlink, but it is link homotopic to the unlink. In braid theory notation, the link is written :\\\\sigma^2_1\\\\sigma^2_2\\\\sigma^{-1}_1\\\\sigma^{-2}_2.\\\\, Its Jones polynomial is :V(t)=t^{- {3 \\\\over 2}}(-1+t-2t^2+t^3-2t^4+t^5). This polynomial and V(1/t) are the two factors of the Jones polynomial of the L10a140 link. Notably, V(1/t) is the Jones polynomial for the mirror image of a link having Jones polynomial V(t). Volume The hyperbolic volume of the complement of the Whitehead link is times Catalan's constant, approximately 3.66. The Whitehead link complement is one of two two-cusped hyperbolic manifolds with the minimum possible volume, the other being the complement of the pretzel link with parameters .. Dehn filling on one component of the Whitehead link can produce the sibling manifold of the complement of the figure-eight knot, and Dehn filling on both components can produce the Weeks manifold, respectively one of the minimum-volume hyperbolic manifolds with one cusp and the minimum-volume hyperbolic manifold with no cusps.

It includes the Moçâmedes Desert of southern Angola. The Kaokoveld is a harsh desert of drifting sandunes and rocky mountains. It receives most of its rainfall during the summer, which distinguishes it from the adjacent Namib Desert to the south, which receives most of its rain during the winter. The Kunene River is the only permanent watercourse but many dry riverbeds (including the Hoanib, Hoarusib and Khumib Rivers) carry moisture through the desert and are home to animals including elephants, black rhinos, and giraffe. Other than those the area is ancient desert sand, moistened by occasional coastal fog. Flora The Kaokoveld is home to Welwitschia mirabilis, a plant that has no close living relatives. Fauna The Kaokoveld is home to a number of endemic reptiles while large mammals including desert elephants (Loxodonta africana), black rhinos (Diceros bicornis) and giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) visit the riverbeds. There is a great deal of birdlife including the endemic Cinderella waxbill (Estrilda thomensis) on the Kunene River. Threats and preservation Skeleton Coast National Park runs for 500 km along the coast of Namibia and is the main protected area in the region, along with other smaller conservancies inland. Much of the area was formerly protected under Game Reserve 2, which was reduced in size to become Etosha National Park in 1967, with a subsequent increase in poaching and more recently uncontrolled off-road driving.

The song appeared on Harry Belafonte's album Calypso. It reached number fourteen on the Billboard Pop chart. The lyrics for the song were written by Lord Burgess (Irving Burgie), an American-born, half-Barbadian songwriter. It is about the beauties of the West Indian Islands. Many, including Belafonte himself, have said that the song was popular in the West Indies since long before Burgess. It is believed that Burgess compiled and modified the song from many folk pieces to make a new song. Burgess acknowledged his use of the tune of another mento, \\"Iron Bar\\". The Kingston Trio, who led the folk revival of the late 1950s, took their name from the mention of Kingston, Jamaica in the song, though they only recorded it many years later, in 2006. The line \\"ackee, rice, saltfish is nice\\" refers to the Jamaican national dish. Covers Artists who have covered \\"Jamaica Farewell\\" include: * Chuck Berry (feat.

For example, in Bengali, there exist several translations, some of which are quite well known. One Bengali version of the song became an important anthem for the Naxalite revolutionary movement in the 1970s and thus has significance for Bengali intellectuals in Kolkata society. The Bangladeshi band Souls also sang their own translated version in early 1990s, which instantly became a hit in Bangladesh. The song was covered with lyrics in Swedish by Schytts as Jamaica farväl, scoring a 1979 Svensktoppen hit. Streaplers recorded a 1967 Swedish-language version of the song, with the lyrics \\"Långt långt bort\\". Their version became a 1968 Svensktoppen hit. German translations are Abschied von Kingston Town (Farewell from Kingston Town) by Bruce Low and Weil der Sommer ein Winter war (For the Summer was a Winter) by Nana Mouskouri.

He was born Louis-Gabriel Besnard in Bucharest, Romania. He is known to Anglophones for his poem \\"Couleurs d'usine\\", which includes the line Métro, boulot, bistrots, mégots, dodo, zéro (translation: \\"Subway, work, bars, (cigarette) butts, sleep, nothing\\") Biography A multifaceted personality—at one time a journalist, novelist, poet, fabulist and humanist—, at age nine Béarn began writing in French slang, his \\"natural\\" language. His father having died prematurely, at the age of 14 he became a mechanic to financially support his mother. This working life inspired the poem from which came one of the May 1968 protest slogans \\"métro-boulot-dodo\\" (\\"subway-work-sleep\\") that denounced the shocking workers' conditions at the time. While commanding a trawler to aid the French evacuations in 1940, he was captured and was detained in the concentration camp at Aintree. His poems from that point onwards centred on the sea and the war. After the war he took a post as a press attaché in Africa. In 1969, he created a quarterly magazine for himself alone: Le Lien (The Link). In 1975, he withdrew to Montlhéry where the peace allowed him to write many fables. In 1998, the first volume of his complete works was published: L'arc en ciel de ma vie (The rainbow of my life). This was followed in 1999 by volume 2, 300 fables d'aujourd'hui (300 fables of today). The third volume, Couleurs charnelles (Carnal colours), was released just months before his death on October 27, 2004, during his 102nd year. While generally ignored by the wider public, Béarn received a number of literary prizes such as the Prix de Verlaine (1940), the Grand Prix International de Poésie awarded by General Charles de Gaulle in 1971, the Grand prix de l'Académie française in 1981 and again in 1995 for his fables. He also received the Médaille de la Résistance for his participation in the Liberation of Paris in 1944 and the Légion d'honneur in 1990 from François Mitterrand. He was also named Officer of the Ordre national du Mérite in 1995 by Jacques Chirac, and Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2000 by the minister of culture, Catherine Tasca.
