It is found in north-eastern, northern, western and central Africa. Taxonomy and systematics The common bulbul was originally described in the genus Turdus. Some authorities treat the Somali, Dodson's and dark-capped bulbul as subspecies of the common bulbul. The common bulbul is considered to belong to a superspecies along with the Himalayan bulbul, white-eared bulbul, white- spectacled bulbul, African red-eyed bulbul, and the Cape bulbul. Alternate names for the common bulbul include the black-eyed bulbul, brown bulbul (also used for the Asian red-eyed bulbul), brown-capped geelgat, common garden bulbul, garden bulbul and white-vented bulbul as well as one name used for another species (yellow-vented bulbul). =Subspecies= Five subspecies are recognized: * P. b. barbatus ‚Äì (Desfontaines, 1789): Alternate names for the nominate race include Barbary bulbul and North-west African garden bulbul. Found from Morocco to Tunisia * Upper Guinea bulbul (P. b. inornatus) ‚Äì (Fraser, 1843): Originally described as a separate species in the genus Ixos. Found from southern Mauritania and Senegal to western Chad and northern Cameroon * Gabon bulbul (P. b. gabonensis) ‚Äì Sharpe, 1871: Originally described as a separate species. Found from central Nigeria and central Cameroon to Gabon and southern Congo * Egyptian bulbul (P. b. arsinoe) ‚Äì (Lichtenstein, MHK, 1823): Originally described as a separate species in the genus Turdus. Alternately named the Sahel garden bulbul. Found in eastern Chad, northern and central Sudan and eastern Egypt * Abyssinian bulbul (P. b. schoanus) ‚Äì Neumann, 1905: Not to be confused with an alternate name for the Somali bulbul. Found in south-eastern Sudan, western, central and eastern Ethiopia, Eritrea Description The bill is fairly short and thin, with a slightly downcurving upper mandible. The bill, legs, and feet are black and the eye is dark brown with a dark eye-ring, which is not readily visible. It is about 18 cm in length, with a long tail. It has a dark brown head and upperparts. Sexes are similar in plumage. Distribution and habitat Eggs of Pycnonotus barbatus inornatus MHNT It is a common resident breeder in much of Africa, and it has recently been found breeding in southern Spain at Tarifa. It is found in woodland, coastal bush, forest edges, riverine bush, montane scrub, and in mixed farming habitats. It is also found in exotic thickets, gardens, and parks. Behaviour and ecology The common bulbul is usually seen in pairs or small groups. It is a conspicuous bird, which tends to sit at the top of a bush. As with other bulbuls they are active and noisy birds. The flight is bouncing and woodpecker-like. The call is a loud doctor-quick doctor-quick be-quick be-quick. =Breeding= This species nests throughout the year in the moist tropics, elsewhere it is a more seasonal breeder with a peak in breeding coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The nest is fairly rigid, thick walled, and cup-shaped. It is situated inside the leafy foliage of a small tree or shrub. Two or three eggs is a typical clutch. It, like other bulbuls, is parasitised by the Jacobin cuckoo. =Feeding= This species eats fruit, nectar, seeds and insects.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 tributary of the Delaware River in northwestern New Jersey in the United States. It flows through the rural mountainous country of northwestern New Jersey. Part of it is a National Wild and Scenic River. It rises out of Lake Hopatcong, on the border between Sussex and Morris counties. It flows through Lake Musconetcong, then flows southwest, past Stephensburg and New Hampton, passing south of Washington then along the southeastern side of the Pohatcong Mountain ridge. It joins the Delaware across from Riegelsville, Pennsylvania, approximately 10 mi (16 km) south of Phillipsburg. The river does not flow through any large population center and has been the site of relatively little industrial development throughout its history. In the 18th century, the surrounding hills were largely deforested as a source of charcoal for the iron industry in the surrounding region. The local industry declined by the middle of the 19th century after the building of the former Morris Canal, the course of which ran along the upper river, to bring coal from Pennsylvania to northern New Jersey. After the demise of the canal from the introduction of railroads in the late 19th century, the dam pools along the river that supplied the canal became the site of a popular summer cottage industry. Silted remnants of the pools, as well as the remnants of the canal itself, can still be seen along the river. Human habitation in the Musconetcong Valley can be traced back approximately 12,000 years to the end of the last ice age. The Plenge Site along the lower river in Warren County was the first of only two major Paleo-Indian archaeological site excavations in New Jersey, and is considered one of the most significant in the northeastern United States. The USGS stream flow gauge at Bloomsbury has the river's flows recorded from as far back as 1904. The average flow over the time recorded for the gauge at Bloomsbury is approximately 244 cfs. Record flows of the river were recorded in 2011 as result of Hurricane Irene.

Of use in chemistry and thermodynamics. Overview Amagat's law states that the extensive volume V = Nv of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of volumes Vi of the K component gases, if the temperature T and the pressure p remain the same:Amagat's law of additive volumes : N\\\\, v(T, p) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^K N_i\\\\, v_i(T, p). This is the experimental expression of volume as an extensive quantity. It is named after Emile Amagat. According to Amagat's law of partial volume, the total volume of a non-reacting mixture of gases at constant temperature and pressure should be equal to the sum of the individual partial volumes of the constituent gases. So if V_1, V_2, \\\\dots, V_n are considered to be the partial volumes of components in the gaseous mixture, then the total volume V would be represented as: :V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + \\\\dots + V_n = \\\\sum_{i} V_i Both Amagat's and Dalton's laws predict the properties of gas mixtures. Their predictions are the same for ideal gases. However, for real (non-ideal) gases, the results differ. Dalton's law of partial pressures assumes that the gases in the mixture are non-interacting (with each other) and each gas independently applies its own pressure, the sum of which is the total pressure. Amagat's law assumes that the volumes of the component gases (again at the same temperature and pressure) are additive; the interactions of the different gases are the same as the average interactions of the components. The interactions can be interpreted in terms of a second virial coefficient, B(T), for the mixture. For two components, the second virial coefficient for the mixture can be expressed as: :B(T) = X_1 B_1 + X_2 B_2 + X_1 X_2 B_{1,2}\\\\ where the subscripts refer to components 1 and 2, the Xs are the mole fractions, and the Bs are the second virial coefficients. The cross term, B1,2, of the mixture is given by: :B_{1,2} = 0\\\\ (Dalton's law) and :B_{1,2} = \\\\frac{B_1 + B_2}{2}\\\\ (Amagat's law). When the volumes of each component gas (same temperature and pressure) are very similar, then Amagat's law becomes mathematically equivalent to Vegard's law for solid mixtures. Ideal gas mixture When Amagat's law is valid and the gas mixture is made of ideal gases: :\\\\frac{V_i}{V} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{n_i RT}{p}} {\\\\frac{n RT}{p}} = \\\\frac{n_i}{n} = x_i where: * p is the pressure of the gas mixture, * V_i = \\\\frac{n_i RT}{p} is the volume of the i-component of the gas mixture, * V = \\\\sum V_i is the total volume of the gas mixture, * n_i is the amount of substance of i-component of the gas mixture (in mol), * n = \\\\sum n_i is the total amount of substance of gas mixture (in mol), * R is the ideal, or universal, gas constant, equal to the product of the Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro constant, * T is the absolute temperature of the gas mixture (in K), * x_i = \\\\frac{n_i}{n} is the mole fraction of the i-component of the gas mixture.

Chiquinha Gonzaga was the first pianist of \\"choro\\" and author of the first carnival march, \\"√ì Abre Alas \\"(1899). Her plays and operettas, such as Forrobod√≥ and Jurit√≠, were a great success with the public because they used elements of Brazilian popular culture of the time. In the Passeio P√∫blico of Rio de Janeiro, there is a herm in her honor by the sculptor Honorius Pe√ßanha. In May 2012, law 12624 was enacted establishing the National Day of Brazilian Popular Music, celebrated on the day of her birthday, October 17.  Biography = Early life = Chiquinha Gonzaga was born in Rio de Janeiro, from a mestizo mother and a wealthy white father ‚Äì after she was born her father became a marshal. Her godfather was Lu√≠s Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias. For her mother, a mestizo and poor woman, the birth of Chiquinha was a very difficult, in part because of the risk that the father would not recognize the paternity of her daughter. Indeed, Jos√© Basileu, the military promising career, from a wealthy family, suffered from the pressure of his parents, who were against his marriage with Rosa. Despite these disagreements, he accepted the child as his daughter and married. Like all girls of a military family in the 19th century, Chiquinha Gonzaga was very well educated. Her father, very strict with her education,prepared her for a successful future: a good marriage that would raise her to the category of \\"lady\\". She learned to read and write, do maths and primarily play the piano. Therefore, the music became her sole purpose in life. At age 11, she composed her first musical work, the song \\"Can√ß√£o dos Pastores\\", in a Christmas celebration. In Brazil in the late 19th century, women were often seen on a quasi role of slave; few dared to defy their parents and husbands; when that happened, they were quickly sent to reformatories and convents. However, since 1808 with the arrival of the Royal Family in Brazil, women began to circulate more in the streets, dancing in receptions, to come to parties at theater and opera. Rio de Janeiro in those times was already turning into a metropolitan center, gradually growing according to the development of external trade. The usages and consumption were modified. The port of Rio de Janeiro became the financial and commercial center of the Empire, which were trading coffee, slaves and foreign goods that fascinated the new consumers. The city now had the appearance of a European city. Even with all these social changes, manners were not so advanced. For the young Chiquinha, nothing had changed, she always obeyed the orders of her father. = Mariage and family = In 1863, at age 16, Francisca married Jacinto Ribeiro do Amaral, a young man of 24, official of the Imperial Navy. Jacinto do Amareal was chosen by her father to marry Chiquinha even though she had expressed her disagreement with this arranged marriage. Unable to withstand the life on the ship where her husband served (and where he spent more time than with his family), his psychological and physical abuses and humiliation, because he did not agree that she would pursue a musical career, Chiquinha leaves her husband and asks for the divorce, a scandal at the time. She takes with her their eldest son, Jo√£o Gualberto (born in 1864). Her husband, however, did not let Chiquinha take her younger children: their daughter, Maria do Patroc√≠nio (born in 1865) and their other son, Hil√°rio (born in 1867). After leaving her husband, Chiquinha was ‚Äúdeclared dead and of unpronounceable name‚Äù by her father. In 1870, Chiquinha moved to Minas Gerais with the engineer Jo√£o Batista de Carvalho, with whom she had a daughter, Maria Alice (born in 1876). As Chiquinha could not accept his extra-marital betrayals, she splits and again loses a daughter. Jo√£o Batista did not let Chiquinha keep Maria Alice. In 1876 Chiquinha Gonzaga, 29 years old, lives in Rio de Janeiro with her eldest son, Jo√£o Gualberto, to work as an independent musician and initiate her successful career as a pianist and composer. In 1899, after decades dedicated mainly to her music, Chiquinha met Jo√£o Batista Fernandes Lage, a young man full of life and talented musician apprentice. They fell in love but the age difference was too large and would cause more prejudice and suffering in the life of Chiquinha. She was 52 years old and John the Baptist, was only 16. Chiquinha adopted him as a son, in order to be able to live this great love. This decision was taken to avoid the scandals regarding her own children and the society of the time, and to not affect her brilliant career. For this reason also, Chiquinha and Jo√£o Batista moved to Lisbon (Portugal) where they lived several years away from the acquaintances in Rio de Janeiro. At first, her children did not accept the couple, but soon they realized the importance of Jo√£o Batista for Chiquinha's music and life. After a few years, the couple returned to Brazil without arousing any suspicions to be living as husband and wife. Chiquinha never admitted publicly her relationship with Jo√£o Batista, which was only discovered after his death, through letters and photos of the couple. She died beside Jo√£o Batista Fernandes, her best friend, partner and faithful companion, her great love, in 1935, during the beginning of a new Carnival. She was buried in the cemetery of S√£o Francisco de Paula, district of Catumbi, in Rio de Janeiro.  Career  After separating from her husband, Chiquinha lived as an independent musician, playing piano in music instrument stores. She gave piano lessons to support her son Jo√£o Gualberto, regardless of society critics because she was raising a child without a husband. She was devoted entirely to her music, which was very successful, as her career grew and she became very famous as a composer of polkas, waltzes, tangos and ditties. Chiquinha began to participate in balls and ‚Äúchor√µes‚Äù reunions, normally reserved for men, where she met the flautist Joaquim Ant√¥nio da Silva Callado and started to play in his group, O Choro do Calado, being the first woman to play in this group. The need to adjust the piano sound to popular taste are the reason of Chiquinha Gonzaga's glory to become the first popular composer of Brazil. During this time she composed her first success, the polka \\"Atraente\\", in 1877, ‚Äúcomposed by the piano, as an improvisation, during a ‚Äòchoro‚Äô meeting‚Äù. At that time, she was famous but highly criticized by the masculine society of her time. In 1884, she composed the waltz \\"Walkyria\\", considered one of her most beautiful waltzes. After the success of her first printed composition, she decided to start to do vaudeville and revue. She composed the costume operetta \\"A Corte na Ro√ßa\\" in 1885. In 1911, her greatest success in the theater was the operetta \\"Forrobod√≥\\", that reached 1500 straight shows after the premiere - until today the best show of its kind in Brazil. In 1900, Chiquinha meets the irreverent artist Nair de Tef√© von Hoonholtz, the first woman cartoonist in the world, a bohemian woman from noble family, and become great friends. Between 1902 and 1910, Chiquinha travelled through Europe, becoming particularly famous in Portugal, where she wrote songs for various authors. Shortly after her return from Europe, her friend Nair Tef√© married the President of the Republic of Brazil Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca, becoming the first lady of Brazil. Chiquinha was invited by Nair de Tef√© a few evenings at Catete Palace, the presidential palace, even against the will of the Nair family. At that time, Chiquinha was already very famous but very criticized by the society of her time. Once, in 1914, for the premiere of \\"Corta Jaca\\" at the presidential palace, the first lady of Tef√© Nair joined Chiquinha on guitar, playing a bit of the song composed by the pianist. This episode was considered a scandal at the time, with critics against the government, the life at the palace, the promotion and dissemination of music whose origins were in \\"vulgar\\" dances, contrary to the values of the aristocratic social elite. Playing Brazilian popular music in the palace of the Brazilian Government was regarded at the time as a violation of the protocol, which caused controversy in the upper echelons of society and politicians. After the end of his presidential term, Hermes da Fonseca and Nair de Tef√© moved to France, where they remained for a long time. Because of this episode, Chiquinha Nair end up losing touch. She was the composer of the famous operetta partition \\"Juriti\\" with Viriato Corr√™a, in 1919. In 1934, at age 87, she wrote her last composition, the opera \\"Maria\\". Chiquinha was also the founder of the Brazilian Society of Theater Authors. At the end of her life, she composed music for 77 theater plays and was the author of about two thousand compositions in different genres: waltzes, polkas, tangos, lundus, maxixes, Fado, quadrilles, mazurkas, Choros and serenades.  Civic engagement  Due her maternal origins and the many injustices experienced during her life, Chiquinha was a very active citizen and involved in all kinds of social movements that took place during her generation in Brazil, such as the abolition of slavery, with the Law √Åurea of 1888 and the proclamation of the Republic in 1889. Many times, she has a leading position for the suffragist movement. Tribute On 17 October 2018, to commemorate what would have been her 171st birthday, Google released a Google Doodle celebrating her.

Founded in 1901, the school serves the Chicago suburbs of Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glencoe, and Northfield as well as portions of Northbrook, Glenview, and unincorporated Cook County. New Trier's logo depicts the Porta Nigra, a symbol of Trier, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. The athletic teams are known as the Trevians, an archaic demonym for the people of Trier.  History  Winnetka campus New Trier district and locations New Trier High School opened its doors for the first time on February 4, 1901, welcoming 76 students. West campus in Northfield, Illinois New Trier was featured in the December 9, 1996, issue of Time in an article entitled \\"High Times at New Trier High.\\" Among other claims, the article stated that \\"New Trier kids who smoke pot\\" were \\"by all accounts more than three-fifths of the student body,\\" compared with national averages at the time closer to 33%. However, on the school's WNTH's radio program, the writer acknowledged that the \\"three-fifths\\" claim had been inadvertently rewritten during the editing process in such a way that seemed to imply that more than 60% of New Trier students may be regular users of marijuana, whereas that figure should have been clearly labeled as the portion of students who had ever used marijuana, including many who had used it only once or twice https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-12-07-9612070039-story.html In 2017, the school neared completion of a $104.9 million renovation and addition project at its East Campus, which replaced three aging buildings on the west side of the campus with the addition of a new student cafeteria, a new library, more than two dozen classrooms for core English, math, social studies, language and business program classes, new art labs, applied arts classroom spaces in the basement for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programming, space for the school's radio and broadcasting programming, two green roofs, and two new theaters. Jonathan Kozol wrote a book called Savage Inequalities in 1991 that discussed the harsh conditions in the poorest school districts in the United States, making a correlation between inequality and racial separation and segregation. In the book, Kozol contrasted New Trier High School's spending per student to impoverished schools within Chicago. In 2016, Newsweek magazine ranked New Trier as the top open-enrollment high school in Illinois and the 17th best high school in the country. Administration , the New Trier Township High School Board of Education's members are mostly from Glencoe and Wilmette.New Trier Board of Education  New Trier Township High School Academics=Profile and recognition= New Trier spends more than $15,000 yearly per student, well above the state average of $8,786. It has been included in the \\"Top Hundred\\" and \\"Most Successful\\" lists of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Parade magazine. The school was identified as \\"quite possibly the best public school in America\\" by Town & Country, in a six-page article on New Trier that cited the \\"rich\\" and \\"demanding\\" curriculum, extensive arts and activities, strong participation in athletics, and faculty of the caliber typically found teaching at good colleges.Maeroff, Gene I.

In the class of 2017, 23 students were National Merit finalists, 27 were National Merit semifinalists, 71 received letters of commendation and 442 were Illinois State Scholars. For this same class, the average composite ACT score was 27.8, the highest in Illinois for an open enrollment public school and among the top school scores in the United States. The class of 2018 scored an average 28.0 composite on the ACT, the highest ever for New Trier, and the highest in Illinois for open enrollment schools. According to an article by the University of Michigan Department of Psychology, \\"New Trier students outperform their Illinois classmates on every conceivable measure.\\" The article also points out that 92% of the school's funding comes from the high property taxes of its affluent surroundings. Approximately 98% of the class of 2014 went on to enroll in college. New Trier ensembles or individuals have received 39 awards in the Downbeat Student Music Awards program. A record- setting seven of these were achieved in 2007 alone. More than 1,100 students participate in the music department. The student-run Soundtraks Club produces all 24 concerts a year, webcast live on the internet at ntjazz.com, on local cable television, and in stereo on WNTH radio. New Trier was named a Grammy Signature School Gold recipient by the Grammy FoundationGrammy Foundation in 2000 for its commitment to music education, and was named the National Signature School in 2007 as the nation's top high school music program. In April 2006, the school's Concert Choir and Symphony Orchestra performed in New York City at Carnegie Hall. In the summer of 2000, the school's Jazz Ensemble, Chamber Orchestra and Bluegrass Band enjoyed a successful two-week concert tour of China. = Subject levels = New Trier has practiced subject-level grouping for over fifty years. In this system, up to four different levels of difficulty are offered for each academic subject. Level 2E is considered a general level. Levels 2, 3 and 4 are college preparatory, honors, and high honors levels, respectively. Level 5 was reserved for Advanced Placement classes and other college-level classes, such as multivariable calculus and linear algebra, but the level was phased out beginning with the class of 2011. (All 5-level courses are currently counted as 4-level.) Students may work at different levels in different subjects. Other levels include 8 and 9. Level 8 classes are counted for elective credit and level 9 classes, a combination of level 2, 3, and 4 students (i.e. 2+3+4=9) are graded as level 3 classes. New Trier offers both unweighted and weighted grade point averages (GPA), and plus and minus grades are reported on transcripts. In calculating a weighted GPA, grades in a student's coursework are given different values depending on the level in which the grade is earned. For example, an \\"A\\" in a 2-level course is weighted at 4.00, while in levels 3 and 4 the values are 4.67 and 5.33, respectively (an \\"A\\" in a 5-level AP class is worth 5.67). In 2009, New Trier announced that for the 2010‚Äì2011 school year the level 5 will be eliminated. A.P. classes will be weighted to level 4. Student life=Athletics= Official logo of the New Trier Trevians With more than 120 state championships, New Trier High School currently has more than any other high school in Illinois. New Trier also leads the state in both boys' and girls' state titles. The sports in which New Trier has the most IHSA-sponsored state titles are boys' swimming and diving (24), boys' tennis (19), girls' swimming and diving (13), boys' golf (9), girls' tennis (9), and girls' badminton (8). New Trier has been strong in the sport of baseball, twice as state champions, winning in 2000 and 2009. New Trier has also historically been strong at non- IHSA sponsored sports, including 18 Great Lakes High School Fencing Conference (formerly Midwest High School Fencing) championships in men's fencing and 10 in women's fencing, fifteen state titles (Blackhawk Cup) in boys' ice hockey, twelve state championships in boys' lacrosse, 1995, 1998, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2019 six state titles in girls' ice hockey, six state titles in girls' golf (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2012, 2017) and six runners up in girls' golf,IHSA Records and History 2 national championships in boys' rowing, 7 national championships in girls' rowing, nine state championships in girls' field hockey, six state championships in girls' lacrosse, and one state championship in girls' cross country.Girls Cross Country  New Trier Township High School The top varsity ice hockey team for boys, New Trier Green, won the first ever USA Hockey High School National Championship title in 2010, and repeated as champions in 2011.

The show began as two separate productions, Lagniappe and Potpourri, at the east and west campuses respectively. In 1981, the two campuses combined, causing the two shows to merge into Lagniappe-Potpourri. Debate New Trier's debate program has flourished in recent years, with two students receiving the top speaker award at the Tournament of Champions,http://ukdebate.wikispaces.com/file/view/PF_spkrs.pdf which only allows the top 72 teams in the nation to compete through a system of qualification. The school has also placed teams in the top 16 in recent years.Planet Debate  Blogs ‚Äì TOC Policy Results! New Trier has also had students either go to the final or win in the Illinois High School Association's state debate tournament in all four divisions, winning the 2011 and 2013 championship in Public Forum. In 2017 they won the championship in Lincoln-Douglas debate. Philanthropy Each of the four official class governments (Sophomore and Junior Steering Committees and the Freshman and Senior Senates) makes significant annual donations to various philanthropic causes throughout the community, state, country, and world. Every year since 2001, the Senior Senate has fully funded the construction of a house in conjunction with Habitat for Humanity of Lake County, Illinois, a non-profit organization that fights homelessness and substandard housing. A recent goal of the campaign was 10 houses in 10 years, and the class of 2010 fulfilled that goal. New Trier is the only school so far to build 10 houses with Habitat. Many fundraisers contribute to this and various other causes over the course of the academic year. The New Trier Tsunami Relief Committee donated more than $18,000 to relief organizations to save people who were affected by the tsunami, and also helped victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004. Frank Mantooth Jazz Festival The jazz festival began in 1983 and takes place on the first Saturday of February. Each year, the event brings in around fifty high school and junior high jazz ensembles from the Great Lakes region and Canada to perform during the day. The high school groups attend clinics with jazz educators and composers from around the country. Seminars are also held throughout the day on improvisation, transcription, and music business, as well as instrument masterclasses. A jazz combo and college big band perform in the afternoon, while the evening concert features New Trier's top jazz ensemble and a professional big band. Past groups have included the Buddy Rich Big Band (led by Dave Weckl), the Woody Herman Orchestra, the Count Basie Orchestra, the Artie Shaw Orchestra, the Duke Ellington Orchestra, the Toshiko Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin Jazz Orchestra, the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, the Chicago Jazz Ensemble (led by Jon Faddis), the Bob Mintzer Big Band, Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band, the Mingus Big Band, Maynard Ferguson, and Dizzy Gillespie. The festival was renamed in 2005 after Frank Mantooth when the jazz musician, educator, and composer died just days before the 2004 festival. In the movies Scenes from Home Alone were shot at the high school's west campus in Northfield.

It is found in southern Asia from India east to southern China. It is the type species of the genus Hypsipetes, established by Nicholas Aylward Vigors in the early 1830s. There are a number of subspecies, mostly varying in the shade of the body plumage which ranges from grey to black, and some also occur in white-headed morphs, as also suggested by its specific epithet leucocephalus, literally \\"white head\\". The legs and bill are always rich orange-red. Taxonomy and systematics The tail of H. l. psaroides has a gentle curve in the outer tail feathers and a shallow fork The black bulbul was originally described in the genus Turdus and has also been considered as either conspecific with or as subspecies of the Malagasy bulbul. The common name 'black bulbul' is also used as an alternate name by the Malagasy bulbul. Formerly, the square-tailed bulbul was also classified as two subspecies of the black bulbul. = Subspecies = Ten subspecies are currently recognized, although the reproductive isolation mechanisms such as vocalization and geographic distributions of these populations still remain to be studied: * H. l. psaroides - Vigors, 1831: Originally described as a separate species.

Found from eastern Myanmar and southern Yunnan (southern China) through Indochina * H. l. ambiens - (Mayr, 1942): Found in north-eastern Myanmar and western Yunnan (southern China) * H. l. sinensis - (La Touche, 1922): Found in northern Yunnan (southern China) * H. l. stresemanni - (Mayr, 1942): Members of this race have white heads. Found in central Yunnan (southern China) * H. l. leucothorax - (Mayr, 1942): Members of this race have white heads. Found in central China * H. l. leucocephalus - (Gmelin, JF, 1789): Members of this race have white heads. Found in south-eastern China * H. l. nigerrimus - (Gould, 1863): Originally described as a separate species. Found in Taiwan * H. l. perniger - R. Swinhoe, 1870: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Hainan (off south-eastern China) Description White-headed morph of the nominate race Botanical Garden in the city of Taipei Black bulbul (Hypsipetes leucocephalus psaroides) Himachal Pradesh, India The black bulbul is in length, with a long tail. The body plumage ranges from slate grey to shimmering black, depending on the race. The beak, legs, and feet are all orange and the head has a black fluffy crest. Sexes are similar in plumage, but young birds lack the crest, have whitish underparts with a grey breast band, and have a brown tint to the upperparts. They have a black streak behind the eye and on the ear coverts. =Vocalisations= They can be quite noisy, making various loud cheeping, mewing and grating calls. The Himalayan form has been reported to make a call resembling a goat kid, throwing back its neck when calling. Distribution and habitat This bulbul is found in broad- leaved forests, cultivation and gardens mainly in hilly areas, but Himalayan populations are known to sometimes descend into the adjoining plains in winter. =Breeding= It builds its nest in a tree or bush; the nest is a cup placed in a fork and made from grasses, dry leaves, mosses, lichens and cobwebs. The lining is made up of ferns, rootlets and other soft material. Both sexes participate in nest construction. Two or three eggs form the usual clutch. =Food and feeding= Black bulbuls feed mainly on seeds and insects, and they are often seen in small groups, either roosting or flying about in search of food. They are particularly fond of berries. They are known to feed on a wide range of berries including Celtis, Rosa, Melia and Ehretia in the Himalayas. They feed on the nectar of Salmalia, Erythrina, Rhododendron and other species. They make aerial sallies for insects.

The winner of 1992 Prometheus Award, the novel was written as a tribute to science fiction fandom, and includes many of its well-known figures, legends, and practices. It also champions modern technology and heaps scorn upon its critics - budget cutting politicians, fringe environmentalists and the forces of ignorance. An ebook of this text was among the first released by the Baen Free Library. The novel takes aim at several targets of ridicule: Senator William Proxmire, radical environmentalists and mystics, such as one character who believes that one cannot freeze to death in the snow because ice is a crystal and \\"crystals are healing.\\" It also mocks ignorance in journalism, which greatly helps the main characters (for example, one \\"expert\\" cited in a news article believes that the astronauts must have superhuman strength, based on a photograph of a weightless astronaut easily handling heavy construction equipment) and the non-scientific world in general. Several real people are tuckerized into the book in a more positive light, including many fans who made donations to charity for that express purpose and a character called \\"RMS\\" (presumably Richard M. Stallman) who leads a network of hackers called the Legion of Doom, connected by a series of BBS systems. Setting Set in an unspecified 'near-future' (one of the main characters has childhood memories of the Exxon Valdez disaster) in which a radical left-wing environmentalist movement has joined forces with the religious right through a shared distaste for modern technology. The resulting bipartisan conspiracy has gained control of the US government and imposed draconian luddite laws which, in attempts to curb global warming, have ironically brought about the greatest environmental catastrophe in recorded history - an ice age which may eventually escalate into a Snowball Earth. The exact process is described: Clouds are water condensation. This cannot occur without Cloud condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. The emission laws have removed most of this, reducing cloud cover, meaning the ground loses heat faster. This in combination with the drop in greenhouse gases has resulted in the return and exacerbation of the Little Ice Age; now self-perpetuating as glaciers have a much higher albedo. As a radical totalitarian environmentalist party now controls the US government, the scientific explanation is denounced as \\"propaganda from life-hating technophiles\\", and blame for the ice age is instead solely placed on the society surviving in orbit. Science fiction fandom forms the core of a pro-technology underground in the United States, working in tandem with Hacker movements. Other technologists - accused by the government of pursuing \\"materialist science\\" - were removed from their jobs and forced underground, where they were generally unable to continue their work. This rabid distaste for technology has resulted in the collapse of the economy and lack of education and a complicit media has left the majority of the population credulous and easily manipulated. The Greens have been in power for most of the lives of the characters. As glaciers rapidly advance south, Canada and the northern United States are all but destroyed. Near the edge of the glaciers, in Milwaukee, barbaric feudal systems arise as the federal government and markets collapse, leaving violence and disease in their wake. In orbit, Mir and Space Station Freedom survive in tandem with a Lunar colony, but with no support from Earth. The city of Winnipeg is the last major outpost of Canadian civilization, warmed and inhabitable due to immense amounts of solar power beamed from the space stations. Plot summary Space station Mir, home to Russo-American Gordon Tanner Astronauts from the orbital society fly a modified scramjet, redesigned to harvest nitrogen from the Earth's atmosphere. Government policy declares that these ships are responsible for the ice age, so the scramjet is shot down with a surface-to-air missile. The pilot and copilot, an Earth-born American named Alex MacLeod and a space-born Russo-American named Gordon Tanner, are forced to crash land in Canada atop the glaciers. Upon hearing of this, the fan underground embarks on a rescue mission - a group of fans rides north through the Dakotas to rescue the astronauts before they can be apprehended by the Government. Upon reaching the Dakotas, the fans must travel largely on foot, as their van is unable to traverse the glaciers. However, they have a major advantage over their foes in the government - their relationship with the space station provides them with superior navigational abilities; following the fall of scientific society, the United States Air Force (USAF) no longer enjoys access to satellite reconnaissance. The fans are able to reach the downed spacecraft well in advance of the USAF. Their escape is aided in a similar manner. Though the Angels are unable to walk due to their overexposure to weightlessness and must be dragged along on sleds, the microwave power transmission beam reserved for Winnipeg is diverted to warm the travellers as they return south to their van. In addition, a tribe of nomadic Inuit peoples shares supplies with them in thanks for the warmth provided by the microwave beam. Upon finally reaching their van, the rescuers flee to a small science fiction convention of some 50 fans at a mansion owned by one of their own. Once there, one of the fans takes on the role of personal trainer to help the Angels adjust to Earth's gravity including various asanas from yoga. At the con, the fans brainstorm a daring plan - before the Greens had come to power, one of the Board of Trustees for the Metropolitan Museum of Boston by the name of Ron Cole supposedly refurbished a Titan II rocket. This rocket still exists at the Museum of Science and Industry at Chicago. The fans and the Angels leave for Chicago just moments before the mansion is raided by the Green police. The trip to Chicago gives the reader a brutal depiction of American life without basic technology. A blizzard forces the fans to take shelter in a farm town - where at least one towns-person dies in each blizzard for lack of heating oil. After hitching a ride in a consignment of cheese, the fans are captured by the feudal inhabitants of Milwaukee who are burning the excess houses in the city for heat. One of their captors has the food swapped with moonshine liquor and forces the group into slavery to pay off a series of trumped-up \\"fines\\". They are assisted by a fellow fan amongst their captors, and are able to continue on to Chicago. When the fans finally meet Ron Cole, their hopes are crushed. The rocket is a decaying wreck, and Cole is a shadow of his former self due to invasive 'reeducation' treatments. However, Cole is able to put them on another path - a privately constructed single-stage-to-orbit spacecraft at Edwards Air Force Base, disguised by the simple and effective method of its designer, Gary Hudson, declaring it non-functional.

The name comes from the form of the party, which often involves closing an entire city block to vehicle traffic. Many times, there will be a celebration in the form of playing music and dance and activities like pony rides, inflatable slides, popcorn machines and barbecues. As a form of activism street parties are festive and/or artistic efforts to reclaim roadways as public space by large groups of people. They were made known in Western Europe and North America by the actions of Reclaim the Streets, a widespread \\"dis-organization\\" dedicated to reclaiming public space from automobiles and consumerism. Poland Poland Orange Alternative staged festive protests to break the Communist government's monopoly on public life. UK A street party in London for the 2011 Royal Wedding In the UK, street parties are mainly known as private residents' events and have a special cultural meaning, especially in England and south Wales. They have historically been held to commemorate major national events, such as VE Day or for royal events such as jubilees, with bunting dressing the street, and children playing in the street. An estimated 10 million people took part in street parties in 1977 for the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The tradition seems to have begun in England and Wales after World War I as residents' own \\"peace teas\\" to celebrate the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. The tradition was boosted for the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011 with about 1 million people joining in street parties. For the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in June 2012 about 2 million took part. Now street parties are held annually and at any time for residents to meet their neighbours in a traffic-free street in a private street party. Some \\"street parties\\" are public events taking many forms. An application may be needed to the local authority to close a road for a street party under 2 different laws. US People and police officers at a very large block party Musicians performing at a block party Block parties are reported as a World War I innovation originating from the East Side of New York City, where an entire block was roped off and patriotic songs sung and a parade held to honor the members of that block who had gone off to war.\\"Block Parties\\", The Outlook, 16 October 1918; reviewed 2008-09-20.Fiocco v. Carver, 234 NY 219 (1922) Traditionally, many inner city block parties were actually held illegally, because they did not file for an event permit from the local authorities. However, police turned a blind eye to them. In the United States, block parties usually occur on holidays such as Independence Day and Memorial Day. Some towns may also have an annual block party. Block parties gained popularity in the United States during the 1970s, particularly within the hip hop community. Block parties were often held outdoors and power for the DJ's sound system was taken illegally from street lights, as referenced in the song \\"South Bronx\\" by KRS-One. Sometimes the occasion may be a theme such as a recent popular movie or \\"Welcome to our town\\" for a new family. Often block parties involve barbecues and lawn games such as Simon Says, karaoke, and group dancing such as the Electric Slide, the Macarena or line dancing. In many small towns, the local fire department may also participate in the party, bringing out trucks that they display for show.

Flinders Island is part of the state of Tasmania, Australia. It is from Cape Portland and is located on 40¬∞ south, a zone known as the Roaring Forties. History=Prehistory= Flinders Island was first inhabited at least 35,000 years ago, when people made their way from Australia across the then-land bridge which is now Bass Strait. A population remained until about 4,500 years ago, succumbing to thirst and hunger following an acute El Ni√±o climate shift.Hiscock, Peter, Archaeology of Ancient Australia, London and New York, Routledge, 2008, pp.140‚Äì141 =European discovery= Some of the south-eastern islands of the Furneaux Group were first recorded in 1773 by British navigator Tobias Furneaux, commander of , the support vessel with James Cook on Cook's second voyage. In February 1798, British navigator Matthew Flinders charted some of the southern islands, using one of the schooner Francis' open boats. Later that year, Flinders returned and finished charting the islands in the Norfolk; he then went on to complete the first circumnavigation of Tasmania (1798‚Äì99), accompanied by George Bass, proving Tasmania to be an island separated from the Australian mainland by Bass Strait, later named in honor of George Bass. =Geographic naming= James Cook named the islands Furneaux's Islands, after Tobias Furneaux. Flinders named the largest island in the group \\"Great Island\\". He also named a group of mountains on Flinders Island, the \\"Three Patriarchs\\". The small island just to the east, Flinders named \\"Babel Island\\" from the noises made by the seabirds there. Phillip Parker King later named the largest island Flinders Island, after Matthew Flinders.Matthew Flinders' Observations 1801Matthew Flinders' Voyage to Terra Australis 1814The Early History of Tasmania, R. W. Giblin, 1928 Flinders named Mount Chappell Island after his wife Ann n√©e Ann Chappelle. There are three islands named \\"Flinders' Island\\"‚Äîthe large island on the east side of Bass Strait, named by Phillip Parker King; an island in the Investigator Group of South Australia, named by Matthew Flinders after his young brother Samuel Flinders (midshipman on the ); and an island in the Flinders Group north of Cooktown, Queensland was named after Matthew Flinders. =Settlement= In the late 18th century, the island was often frequented by sealers and Aboriginal women, the majority of whom had been kidnapped from their mainland tribes. Seal stocks soon collapsed, causing the last sealing permit to be issued in 1828. Many sealers' families chose to stay in the Furneaux Group, subsisting on cattle grazing and muttonbirding. From 1830, the remnants of the Tasmanian Aboriginal population were exiled to Settlement Point (or Wybalenna, meaning \\"Black Man's House\\" in the language of the Ben Lomond people) on Flinders Island. These 160 survivors were deemed to be safe from white settlers here, but conditions were poor, and the relocation scheme was short-lived. In 1847, after a campaign by the Aboriginal population against their Commandant, Henry Jeanneret, which involved a petition to Queen Victoria, the remaining 47 Aboriginals were again relocated, this time to Oyster Cove Station, an ex-convict settlement 56 kilometres south of Tasmania's capital, Hobart,Gough, Julie.

From the late 19th century freehold land was given out, but it was not until the 1950s that a proper settlement scheme was initiated, mainly drawing settlers from mainland Tasmania and central New South Wales to Flinders Island's eastern shore. The Municipality of Flinders Island was instituted in 1903. Geography and nature The island forms part of the state of Tasmania, and part of the Municipality of Flinders Island local government area. Flinders Island is only one of the many islands included in the Municipal area. Of these islands Flinders Island is the only island with more than one permanent settlement, and is by far the largest in the Furneaux Group. The island is about from north to south, and from east to west.Google Earth measurements with a total land area of . Mount Strzelecki in the south west is the island's highest peak at . About a third of the island is mountainous and rugged with ridges of granite running the length of the island. The coastal areas are dominated by sandy deposits often taking the shape of dunes. Many coastal lagoons punctuate the eastern shore, formed by dunes blocking further drainage. This drainage is mainly provided by many small streams, few of them permanently flowing directly leading to the waters of Bass Strait or such a lagoon. The coastal areas are mainly covered in scrub or shrubs, whereas the vegetation at a higher elevation consists of woodland, mainly eucalyptus species. The total number of plant species in the Furneaux Group well exceeds 800, showing the great biodiversity of its ecosystem. Native bird species include the Cape Barren goose (Cereopsis novaehollandiae) and the short-tailed shearwater (Puffinus tenuirostris). Marsupial mammals are represented by Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus), brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), potoroo (Potorous apicalis), common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) and Tasmanian pademelon (Thylogale billardierii). The cape fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus) is the sole placental mammal commonly found on Flinders.

The video featured an actress portraying the abolitionist Harriet Tubman (1820‚Äì1913) having sex with her slave owner with the intent of filming the act and blackmailing him to convince him to work on the Underground Railroad. People from his own community, such as filmmaker Spike Lee, were offended by the controversial comedy sketch.

Simmons and Brett Ratner, who Khalighi accused of watching them without intervening when she asked for his help, both deny that the encounter was non- consensual. As the allegation was covered in the press, Terry Crews accused Simmons of attempting to influence him to take back sexual assault allegations that Crews had recently brought up against film executive Adam Venit, asking that Crews \\"give him a pass ... ask that he be reinstated.\\" Crews posted on his Twitter account a screenshot of the alleged e-mail he had received from Simmons. On November 30, 2017, writer Jenny Lumet claimed that Simmons had raped her in 1991. In response, Simmons said he would step down from his positions with his businesses.

In response to the allegations, Simmons stated he \\"never had a sexual encounter that was not consensual or lawful. Ever.\\" On February 9, 2018, Simmons denied the allegations to Rolling Stone, saying (in part), \\"I vehemently deny all the allegations made against me. They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women. I am blessed to have shared extraordinary relationships, whether through work or love, with many great women and I have enormous respect for the women's movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power. I am devastated by any reason I may have given to anyone to say or think of me in the ways that are currently being described. I have separated myself from my businesses and charities to not become a distraction.\\" On April 25, 2018, Jennifer Jarosik, a filmmaker who also alleged Simmons raped her, dropped her lawsuit. The suit was dismissed with prejudice, meaning Jarosik cannot refile allegations in court. =Accusers= A number of women, some of whom were aged 17 at the time of the alleged incidents, have accused Simmons of sexual harassment, assault or rape: Sexual harassment or assault Women who said they had been sexually harassed or assaulted (including attempted rape) by Simmons include: #Keri Claussen Khalighi, model #Kelly Cutrone, publicist and author #Luann de Lesseps, reality television personality #Lisa Kirk, an acquaintance of Simmons‚Äô #Toni Sallie, music journalist #Amanda Seales, actor and comedian (verbal harassment) #Natashia Williams-Blach, actress Rape Women who said they had been raped by Simmons include: #Tina Baker, singer-turned-lawyer #Drew Dixon, former music recording executive #Sherri Hines, musician #Jennifer Jarosik, filmmaker #Jenny Lumet, screenwriter #Sil Lai Abrams, writer and activist =Resignation= After the third assault allegation was published in a guest column by Jenny Lumet in The Hollywood Reporter on November 2017, Simmons stepped down from his roles in the label Def Jam Records, his yoga lifestyle brand, CNNMoney, and other media properties. Lumet, who is the daughter of filmmaker Sidney Lumet and the granddaughter of singer and civil rights activist Lena Horne, wrote: \\"As a woman of color, I cannot express how wrenching it is to write this about a successful man of color. ... I feel a pang to protect your daughters. I don't think you are inclined to protect mine.\\" HBO decided to remove Russell Simmons' name from All Def Comedy, a series he created to launch and showcase emerging comedians. = Documentary = A documentary film about the sexual assault allegations against Simmons, On the Record, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2020 and was released on HBO Max on May 27, 2020.

Until the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947, this was the northernmost part of Finland. In 1934 it was estimated that the deposits contained over five million tons of nickel. In 1935, Canadian and French corporations began mining operations there. The nickel deposits were a lesser known reason for Allied and German interest in the area during World War II, as potentially of great importance for production of arms and munitions. Both the planned Franco- British support of Finland in the Winter War, and German occupation of Denmark and Norway (Operation Weser√ºbung) were partly motivated by control of the nickel mines. During the period between the Winter War and the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, there were disputes between Finland and the Soviet Union over mining rights in Petsamo. Finland refused to allow the Soviet Union to mine nickel in Petsamo. This was one of the causes of hostility between the Soviet Union and Finland, which led to the Continuation War. As part of the German invasion, troops from Norway occupied the Petsamo region in 1941, securing the nickel supply. The Continuation War ended in September 1944, with the Moscow armistice of 19th September 1944. Finland ceded Petsamo to the Soviet Union. All subsequent nickel production there has been under Soviet or Russian authority.

Following his receiving the Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism in 2009 for his Collected Critical Writings, and the publication of Broken Hierarchies (Poems 1952‚Äì2012), Hill is recognised as one of the principal contributors to poetry and criticism in the 20th and 21st centuries. Biography Geoffrey Hill was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, England, in 1932, the son of a police constable. When he was six, his family moved to nearby Fairfield in Worcestershire, where he attended the local primary school, then the grammar school in Bromsgrove. \\"As an only child, he developed the habit of going for long walks alone, as an adolescent deliberating and composing poems as he muttered to the stones and trees.\\"Sherry, Vincent. The Uncommon Tongue: The Poetry and Criticism of Geoffrey Hill. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1987. 2. On these walks he often carried with him Oscar Williams' A Little Treasury of Modern Poetry (1946), and Hill speculates: \\"there was probably a time when I knew every poem in that anthology by heart.\\" In 1950 he was admitted to Keble College, Oxford, to read English, where he published his first poems in 1952, at the age of twenty, in an eponymous Fantasy Press volume (though he had published work in the Oxford Guardian‚Äîthe magazine of the University Liberal Club‚Äîand The Isis). Upon graduation from Oxford with a first, Hill embarked on an academic career, teaching at the University of Leeds from 1954 until 1980, from 1976 as professor of English Literature. After leaving Leeds, he spent a year at the University of Bristol on a Churchill Scholarship before becoming a teaching fellow at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he taught from 1981 until 1988. He then moved to the United States, to serve as University Professor and Professor of Literature and Religion at Boston University. In 2006, he moved back to Cambridge, England. Hill was married twice. His first marriage to Nancy Whittaker, which produced four children, Julian, Andrew, Jeremy and Bethany, ended in divorce. His second marriage to the American poet, and later Anglican priest, Alice Goodman occurred in 1987. The couple had a daughter, Alberta. The marriage lasted until Hill's death. Hill was a Christian.Potts, Robert (10 August 2002), \\"The praise singer\\", The Guardian. =Awards and honours= Mercian Hymns won the Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize and the inaugural Whitbread Award for Poetry in 1971. Hill won as well the Eric Gregory Award in 1961. Hill was awarded an honorary D.Litt. degree by the University of Leeds in 1988, the same year he received an Ingram Merrill Foundation Award. Hill was also an Honorary Fellow of Keble College, Oxford; an Honorary Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge; a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature; and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

He was ultimately successful, and delivered his 15 lectures in the academic years 2010 to 2015.\\"Professor Sir Geoffrey Hill lectures\\", Faculty of English, University of Oxford. The lectures progressed chronologically, beginning with Shakespeare's sonnets and concluding with a critique of Philip Larkin's poem \\"Church Going\\". Writing Hill's poetry encompasses a variety of styles, from the dense and allusive writing of King Log (1968) and Canaan (1997) through the simplified syntax of the sequence \\"The Pentecost Castle\\" in Tenebrae (1978), on to the more accessible poems of Mercian Hymns (1971), a series of 30 poems (sometimes called \\"prose-poems\\", a label whthatich Hill rejects in favour of \\"versets\\")In \\"An Interview\\" with John Haffenden Hill remarks: \\"They're versets of rhythmical prose. The rhythm and cadence are far more of tuned chant than I think one normally associates with the prose poem. I designed the appearance on the page in the form of versets.\\" See also: Elisabeth Mary Knottenbelt, Passionate Intelligence: The Poetry of Geoffrey Hill, p. 190. which juxtapose the history of Offa, eighth-century ruler of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, with Hill's own childhood in the modern Mercia of the West Midlands. Seamus Heaney said of Hill: \\"He has a strong sense of the importance of the maintenance of speech, a deep scholarly sense of the religious and political underpinning of everything in Britain.\\"\\"Interview with Seamus Heaney\\", The Telegraph, 11 April 2009. Kenneth Haynes, editor of Broken Hierarchies, commented: \\"the annotation is not the hard part with Hill's poems... the difficulty only begins after looking things up\\".Email to Sameer Rahim, 2013, quoted in an interview with Sameer Rahim, \\"Poetry as History\\", Telegraph Review, 14 December 2013. Elegy is Hill's dominant mode; he is a poet of phrases rather than cadences.Schmidt, Michael, The Great Modern Poets, London: Quercus Books, 2006, . Regarding both his style and subject, Hill is often described as a \\"difficult\\" poet. In an interview in The Paris Review (2000), which published Hill's early poem \\"Genesis\\" when he was still at Oxford, Hill defended the right of poets to difficulty as a form of resistance to the demeaning simplifications imposed by 'maestros of the world'. Hill also argued that to be difficult is to be democratic, equating the demand for simplicity with the demands of tyrants. He makes circumspect use of traditional rhetoric (as well as that of modernism), but he also transcribes the idioms of public life, such as those of television, political sloganeering, and punditry. Hill has been consistently drawn to morally problematic and violent episodes in British and European history and has written poetic responses to the Holocaust in English, \\"Two Formal Elegies\\", \\"September Song\\" and \\"Ovid in the Third Reich\\". His accounts of landscape (especially that of his native Worcestershire) are as intense as his encounters with history. Hill has also worked in theatre - in 1978, the National Theatre in London staged his 'version for the English stage' of Brand by Henrik Ibsen, written in rhyming verse. Hill's distaste for conclusion, however, has led him, in 2000's Speech! Speech! (118), to scorn the following argument as a glib get-out: 'ACCESSIBLE / traded as DEMOCRATIC, he answers / as he answers m√≥st things these days  easily.' Throughout his corpus Hill is uncomfortable with the muffling of truth-telling that verse designed to sound well, for its contrivances of harmony, must permit. The constant buffets of Hill's suspicion of lyric eloquence‚Äîcan it truly be eloquent?‚Äîagainst his talent for it (in Syon, a sky is 'livid with unshed snow') become in the poems a sort of battle in style, where passages of singing force (ToL: 'The ferns / are breast-high, head-high, the days / lustrous, with their hinterlands of thunder') are balanced with prosaic ones of academese and inscrutable syntax. In the long interview collected in Haffenden's Viewpoints there is described the poet warring himself to witness honestly, to make language as tool say truly what he believes is true of the world.Hill's 'seriousness' as a poet is examined in Robert Maximilian de Gaynesford 'The Seriousness of Poetry' Essays in Criticism 59, 2009, 1-21. The main point is that Hill's poetry reveals what his critical reflections in prose sometimes deny: that poetry is capable of performative utterance (in particular of commitment-issuing utterance). Criticism The violence of Hill's aesthetic has been criticised by the Irish poet-critic Tom Paulin, who draws attention to the poet's use of the Virgilian trope of 'rivers of blood' ‚Äì as deployed infamously by Enoch Powell ‚Äì to suggest that despite Hill's multi-layered irony and techniques of reflection, his lyrics draw their energies from an outmoded nationalism, expressed in what Hugh Haughton has described as a 'language of the past largely invented by the Victorians'.Tom Paulin, Minotaur: Poetry and the Nation State, p. 283. Yet as Raphael Ingelbien notes, \\"Hill's England ... is a landscape which is fraught with the traces of a history that stretches so far back that it relativizes the Empire and its aftermath\\".Raphael Ingelbien, Misreading England: Poetry and Nationhood since the Second World War, p. 34. Harold Bloom has called him \\"the strongest British poet now active.\\" For his part, Hill addressed some of the misperceptions about his political and cultural beliefs in a Guardian interview in 2002. There he suggested that his affection for the \\"radical Tories\\" of the 19th century, while recently misunderstood as reactionary, was actually evidence of a progressive bent tracing back to his working-class roots. He also indicated that he could no longer draw a firm distinction between \\"Blairite Labour\\" and the Thatcher-era Conservatives, lamenting that both parties had become solely oriented toward \\"materialism\\".\\"The Praise Singer\\" The Guardian 10 August 2002 Hill's style has been subjected to parody: Wendy Cope includes a two-stanza parody of the Mercian Hymns entitled \\"Duffa Rex\\" in Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis.

There are two main types of dextrocardia: dextrocardia of embryonic arrest (also known as isolated dextrocardia) and dextrocardia situs inversus. Dextrocardia situs inversus is further divided. Classification=Dextrocardia of embryonic arrest= In this form of dextrocardia, the heart is simply placed further right in the thorax than is normal. It is commonly associated with severe defects of the heart and related abnormalities including pulmonary hypoplasia. =Dextrocardia situs inversus= Dextrocardia with situs inversus refers to the heart being a mirror image situated on the right side. For all visceral organs to be mirrored, the correct term is dextrocardia situs inversus totalis. Although statistically people with dextrocardia do not have any medical problems from the disorder, they may be prone to a number of bowel, esophageal, bronchial and cardiovascular disorders (such as double outlet right ventricle, endocardial cushion defect and pulmonary stenosis). Certain cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders related to dextrocardia can be life- threatening if left unchecked (see reference). Kartagener syndrome may also be present in patients with dextrocardia but this must be in the setting of situs inversus and may include male infertility. Dextrocardia with situs solitus In contrast to dextrocardia, situ inversus which is only rarely associated with congenital heart disease, dextrocardia, situs solitus is often associated with intracardiac anomalies. Dextrocardia, situs solitus presents a surgical challenge not per se due to associated cardiac malformation, but because achieving adequate exposure is difficult. Right sided structures such as right atrium, right ventricle and tricuspid valve are oriented posteriorly in dextrocardia with situs solitus ( in contrast to dextrocardia with situs inversus). This presents a surgical challenge to the surgeons operating on the right sided cardiac structures in a case of dextrocardia with situs solitus. Diagnosis Medical diagnosis of the two forms of congenital dextrocardia can be made by ECG or imaging. =Technical dextrocardia= Technical dextrocardia refers to an ECG reading that has no basis in the patient's anatomy. This apparent presentation is typically caused by the accidental lead placement of the left and right arm electrodes. Usually this would show as an extreme axis deviation. Management ECG leads must be placed in reversed positions on a person with dextrocardia. In addition, when defibrillating someone with dextrocardia, the pads should be placed in reverse positions. That is, instead of upper right and lower left, pads should be placed upper left and lower right. When heart transplantation is required in a person with situs inversus, reconstruction of the venous pathways to accommodate a normal donor heart is a major, but not insurmountable, challenge.  Epidemiology  Dextrocardia is estimated to occur in approximately 1 in 12,019 pregnancies. A Japanese study of 1,753 fetal cardiac echocardiograms over five years revealed only two cases.

History The Counties Bill of 1876 was initiated to merge 314 road boards into 39 counties. However, as a result of lobbying the number of counties had grown to 63 by the time the bill was enacted. They had chairmen, not mayors as boroughs and cities had; many legislative provisions (such as burial and land subdivision control) were different for the counties. By 1966, there were 112 counties.NZART, counties map During the second half of the 20th century, many counties received overflow population from nearby cities.

She is best known as the first Australian woman to serve as a member of parliament. Cowan has been featured on the reverse of Australia's 50-dollar note since 1995. Cowan was born on a horse breeding station near Geraldton, Western Australia. She was the granddaughter of two of the colony's early settlers, Thomas Brown and John Wittenoom. Cowan's mother died when she was seven, and she was subsequently sent to boarding school in Perth. At the age of 15, her father, Kenneth Brown, was executed for the murder of her stepmother, making her an orphan. She subsequently lived with her grandmother in Guildford, Western Australia until her marriage at the age of 18. She and her husband would have five children together, splitting their time between homes in West Perth and Cottesloe. In 1894, Cowan was one of the founders of the Karrakatta Club, the first women's social club in Australia. She became prominent in the women's suffrage movement, which saw women in Western Australia granted the right to vote in 1899. Cowan was also a leading advocate for public education and the rights of children (particularly those born to single mothers). She was one of the first women to serve on a local board of education, and in 1906 helped to found the Children's Protection Society, whose lobbying resulted in the creation of the Children's Court the following year. Cowan was a co- founder of the Women's Service Guild in 1909, and in 1911 helped establish a state branch of the National Council of Women. Cowan was a key figure in the creation of the King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women, and became a member of its advisory board when it opened in 1916. She was made a magistrate in 1915 and a justice of the peace in 1920. In 1921, Cowan was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia as a member of the Nationalist Party, becoming Australia's first female parliamentarian. She was defeated after just a single term, but maintained a high profile during her tenure and managed to secure the passage of several of her private member's bills. Early life Cowan as a teenager, c. 1876 Cowan in her wedding dress Cowan was born on 2 August 1861 at Glengarry, a sheep station near Geraldton, Western Australia. She was the second child of Kenneth Brown, pastoralist and son of early York settlers Thomas and Eliza Brown, and his first wife Mary Eliza Dircksey Wittenoom, a teacher and the daughter of the colonial chaplain, J. B. Wittenoom. Edith's mother died in childbirth in 1868 when Edith was only seven. She went to a Perth boarding school run by the Misses Cowan, sisters of her future husband. Her adolescence was shattered in 1876 by the ordeal of her father's trials and hanging for the murder, that year, of his second wife. He murdered his second wife by shooting her when they were packing. She was a solitary person, committed nevertheless to social reforms which enhanced women's dignity and responsibility and which secured proper care for mothers and children. After her father's death, she left her boarding school and moved to Guildford to live with her grandmother. There, she attended tuition of Canon Sweeting, a former headmaster of Bishop Hale's School who had taught a number of prominent men including John Forrest and Septimus Burt. According to her biographer, Sweeting's tuition left Brown with \\"a life-long conviction of the value of education, and an interest in books and reading\\". Community work Cowan in 1921, the year she was elected to parliament Cowan became involved with social issues and injustices in the legal system, especially with respect to women and children. In 1894, she helped found the Karrakatta Club, a group in which women \\"educated themselves for the kind of life they believed they ought to be able to take\\". In time, she became the club's president, life member, and trustee. The Karrakatta Club became involved in the campaign for women's suffrage, successfully gaining the vote for women in 1899. After the turn of the century, she turned her eye to welfare issues. She was particularly concerned with women's health and the welfare of disadvantaged groups, such as disadvantaged children and prostitutes. She became extraordinarily active in women's organisations and welfare organisations, serving on numerous committees. The building of Perth's King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women in 1916 was largely a result of her efforts. She helped form the Women's Service Guilds in 1909 and was a co- founder of the Western Australia's National Council of Women, serving as president from 1913 to 1921 and vice-president until her death. Cowan was also a Western Australian delegate to the national assembly for 19 years. In 1916, she became Freemason, admitted to the Australian federation of Droit Humain. She believed that children should not be tried as adults and, accordingly, founded the Children's Protection Society. The society had a major role in the subsequent introduction of children's courts. In 1915, she was appointed to the bench of the new court and continued on in this position for eighteen years. In 1920, she became one of the first female Justices of the Peace. Her great great nephew David Malcolm followed in her footsteps, by becoming Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia in 1988. During World War I, she collected food and clothing for soldiers at the front and coordinated efforts to care for returned soldiers. She became chairperson of the Red Cross Appeal Committee and was rewarded when, in 1920, she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).It's an Honour: OBE. Retrieved 16 December 2015 In her final years, she was an Australian delegate to the 1925 International Conference of Women held in the United States. She helped to found the Royal Western Australian Historical Society in 1926 and assisted in the planning of Western Australia's 1929 Centenary celebrations. Though she remained involved in social issues, illness forced her to withdraw somewhat from public life in later years. = Community positions held = Beside being a Member of Parliament, Cowan held positions on many boards in Western Australia, in 1929 during the Centenary The West Australian published a list of these; Politics Quote Signed Edith Cowan In 1921, Western Australia passed legislation allowing women to stand for parliament. At the age of 59, she stood as the Nationalist candidate for the Legislative Assembly seat of West Perth because she felt that domestic and social issues were not being given enough attention. She won a surprise victory, defeating the Attorney General, Thomas Draper, who had introduced the legislation that enabled her to stand. Cowan was the first woman to be elected to an Australian parliament. She campaigned for women's rights in parliament, pushing through legislation which allowed women to be involved in the legal profession. She succeeded in placing mothers in an equal position with fathers when their children died without having made a will and was one of the first to promote sex education in schools. However, she lost her seat at the 1924 election and failed to regain it in 1927. Personal life Cowans residence from 1883-1896 and then again from 1912-1919, added to the State register of heritage properities in 2016 At the age of 18, on 12 November 1879, Edith married James Cowan, then Registrar of the Supreme Court. They lived at Scotstoun, 71 Malcolm Street, West Perth for most of their lives, but are also well known for having one of the first houses in Avonmore Terrace, Cottesloe, where they lived from 1896 to 1912. Cowan was married in St George's Cathedral, Perth, Perth. She was one of the first women elected to the Anglican Synod in 1916. Following an extended period of ill-health Cowan died at the Avro Hospital, Subiaco on 9 June 1932, at the age of 70. After a short service at St. Mary's Church, West Perth, a large public funeral was held at Karrakatta Cemetery where she was buried. Legacy The Edith Dircksey Cowan Memorial, formerly known as the Edith Cowan Memorial Clock Edith Cowan's portrait appears on the back of Australia's fifty dollar note. Two years after her death, the Edith Cowan Memorial Clock was unveiled at the entrance to Perth's Kings Park. Believed to be the first civic monument to an Australian woman, it was built in the face of persistent opposition which has been characterised as \\"representative of a gender bias operating at the time\\".Heritage Council of Western Australia, 2000 Her portrait was featured on an Australian postage stamp in 1975,Australian Women stamps series: Edith Cowan http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0011310.jpg as part of a six-part \\"Australian Women\\" series. During the WAY 1979 sesquicentennial celebrations, a plaque was laid in St Georges Terrace in her honour. In 1984, the federal Division of Cowan was created and named after her, and in January 1991 the Western Australian College of Advanced Education was renamed Edith Cowan University (ECU).History of Edith Cowan University and its Predecessor institutions http://www.ecu.edu.au/GPPS/rams/history.html Her portrait appears on the Australian fifty dollar note, a polymer banknote that was first issued in October 1995. In 2019 the release of the latest $50 note caused a sensation when it was discovered that the word 'responsibility' in Edith Cowan's speech was incorrectly spelt, missing the last 'i'. She is also commemorated in the naming of Edith Cowan University and the federal Division of Cowan, and by the Edith Dircksey Cowan Memorial in Kings Park. In 1996, a plaque honouring her was placed in St George's Cathedral, Perth. There are references to her in the Centenary of Western Australian Women's Suffrage Memorial in Kings Park, and in a tapestry that was hung in King Edward Memorial Hospital in 2000 to honour women involved in the hospital.

She won the Olympic title twice, in 1972 and 1984. She is the youngest Olympic champion ever in women's high jump, and at the time of her 1984 triumph, she also was the oldest ever.Ulrike Meyfarth. sports-reference.com Biography Meyfarth on a stamp of Ajman The athletic career of Meyfarth took off quickly. In 1971, when she was only fifteen, she already placed second at the West German Championships, and the following year she qualified as the third member of the West German team for the 1972 Summer Olympics that were held in Munich. Meyfarth was one of the few jumpers who had already adopted the new high jumping style first displayed by Dick Fosbury at the Mexico Olympics four years earlier. Not much was expected from Meyfarth, who had a 1.85-meter personal best. Yet in front of the patriotic home crowd, she rose to the occasion and improved her best by 5 cm to reach 1.90 meters ‚Äì enough to secure the gold medal. She added another 2 cm to equal the standing world record and became the youngest Olympic champion in athletics in an individual event, at only 16 years old. Her career stagnated after this surprising victory, and she didn't improve on her 1.92-meter mark until 1978. She did not win any titles in the meantime, placing 7th and 5th at the 1974 and 1978 European Championships, and not reaching the final of the high jump competition at the 1976 Montreal Games. Because of the West German boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, she did not compete there. 1982 was Meyfarth's comeback year. She won the European championships indoor and outdoor, and set a new world record of 2.02 m at the latter occasion. In 1983, she finished second at the first World Championships, after a close fight with Tamara Bykova, whom she had beaten at the European Championships the year before. At a competition in London, both Bykova and Meyfarth cleared 2.03 m, again a new world record. Bykova added another centimetre to this mark just four days later. The 1984 Summer Olympics event in Los Angeles was Ulrike Meyfarth's last major championship. Several of her toughest competitors, including Bykova, were absent because most of the East Bloc nations boycotted the Olympics. She defeated the reigning Olympic champion ‚Äì Italy's Sara Simeoni ‚Äì and cleared 2.02 meters to win her second Olympic title. This time, Meyfarth was the oldest woman to win the Olympic high jump title. She started her career in the club LG Rhein-Ville, becoming West German national silver medalist in 1971 and bronze medalist in 1972. She then moved to ASV K√∂ln, and became West German champion in 1973, 1975, 1979 and 1980‚Äì1983.

The film, which was directed by Mark Robson, was produced by Paramount Pictures. Dennis Weaver and Earl Holliman make early screen appearances in the motion picture. The screenplay is based on the 1953 novel The Bridges at Toko-Ri by Pulitzer Prize winner James Michener. The story, which closely follows the novel, is about the U.S. Navy pilots assigned to bomb a group of heavily defended bridges in North Korea. It emphasizes the lives of the pilots and crew in the context of the Korean War; a conflict that seems remote to all except those who fight in Korea. Plot U.S. Navy Lieutenant Harry Brubaker is a Naval Reserve officer and Naval Aviator who was called back to active duty from his civilian profession as an attorney to fly fighter-bombers in the Korean War. Returning from a mission with battle damage, he is forced to ditch into the sea and is rescued by a Sikorsky HO3S-1 manned by Chief Petty Officer (NAP) Mike Forney and Airman (NAC) Nestor Gamidge. Forney had often been in trouble for brawling and sporting a non- regulation green top hat and scarf while flying his helicopter as encouragement to downed pilots in the water. Back aboard his ship, the aircraft carrier USS Savo Island, Brubaker is called to the quarters of Rear Admiral Tarrant, the Carrier Task Force 77 commander, who has taken an interest in Brubaker because he reminds Tarrant of his son, a Navy Pilot killed in World War II. Brubaker complains about the unfairness of his recall when most actively flying/actively drilling Naval Reserve pilots weren't recalled (Brubaker hadn't been flying in the Reserve), America is not actually \\"at war\\", and most Americans have no involvement. Tarrant advises that, \\"All through history, men have had to fight the wrong war in the wrong place, but that's the one they're stuck with.\\" Grace Kelly as Nancy Brubaker. The Savo Island returns to port in Japan, where Brubaker is given a three-day shore leave in Tokyo with his wife Nancy and their children. The reunion is interrupted when Gamidge comes to Brubaker asking his help in bailing Forney out of the brig after a brawl. Nancy expresses her bewilderment to Tarrant, who explains that Forney saved her husband from freezing to death when he had to ditch his jet at sea and warns her that when they return to Korea, Brubaker will have to attack the dangerous bridges at Toko-Ri. He advises her to face the reality that Harry might be killed, which neither his wife nor daughter- in-law did, and thus were crushed by despair. Late that night Nancy asks Brubaker about the bridges. Back on a carrier off Korea, Brubaker flies as wingman for Commander Lee, the carrier air group commander known as \\"CAG,\\" on a dangerous reconnaissance to photograph the bridges. Lee briefs his pilots on the coming mission using the film he took and Brubaker loses his nerve. However, he cannot bring himself to quit the mission or write a final letter to Nancy. Forney crosses the captain of the Savo Island once too often, and then he is exiled to a helicopter scow. As he is leaving the ship, he notices Brubaker's distress, and relates a \\"cure\\" for bad nerves that has worked for him. Brubaker follows his advice and finds renewed strength within himself. In the attack on the bridges, the antiaircraft fire is intense, but the jets destroy the bridges without a loss. Lee then leads them to attack a secondary target, where Brubaker's jet is hit. Leaking fuel and descending, he tries to return to the carrier, but he cannot and crash-lands on land. Forney and Gamidge attempt to pick him up, but communist troops shoot down the helicopter. Gamidge is killed, and Forney takes cover in a muddy ditch with Brubaker. They try to hold off the enemy with pistols and Forney's and Gamidge's M1 carbines until they can be rescued, but both are killed by the North Korean and Red Chinese soldiers. Tarrant, angered by the news of Brubaker's death, demands an explanation from Commander Lee of why he attacked the second target. Lee defends his actions, noting that Brubaker was his pilot too, and that despite his loss, the mission was a success.

In the attacks against the historical bridges, the McDonnell F2H Banshee fighter-bombers (represented by Grumman F9F Panther) that are at the heart of the story did not bomb the bridges themselves, since they did not have the capability of carrying the heavy aerial bombs that were needed. Instead, they carried out the perilous mission of suppressing enemy anti- aircraft fire.Sisk, Richard. \\"Hollywood Captured Armstrong's Korean War Missions.\\" Military.com News, 2012.

He was also a member of the Def Squad in the late 1990s. Early life Raised in Newark, New Jersey, Redman attended Speedway Avenue School and 13th Avenue School before attending West Side High School, an experience he described as \\"off the hook\\".\\"The Spots: Redman's New Jersey\\", Street League Skateboarding, August 21, 2013.

And within the next two or three months, he moved to Long Island, to my crib. He moved right into my apartment.\\" After moving in with Erick Sermon, Redman went out on tour with EPMD.

Polymyxins B and E (also known as colistin) are used in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. They work mostly by breaking up the bacterial cell membrane. They are part of a broader class of molecules called nonribosomal peptides. They are produced in nature by Gram-positive bacteria such as Paenibacillus polymyxa.  Medical use  Polymyxin antibiotics are relatively neurotoxic and nephrotoxic, so are usually used only as a last resort if modern antibiotics are ineffective or are contraindicated. Typical uses are for infections caused by strains of multiple drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Polymyxins have less effect on Gram-positive organisms, and are sometimes combined with other agents (as with trimethoprim/polymyxin) to broaden the effective spectrum. Polymyxins B are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, so they are only administered orally if the goal is to disinfect the GI tract. Another route of administration is chosen for systemic treatment, e.g., parenteral (often intravenously) or by inhalation. They are also used externally as a cream or drops to treat otitis externa (swimmers ear), and as a component of triple antibiotic ointment to treat and prevent skin infections.  Mechanism of action  After binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, polymyxins disrupt both the outer and inner membranes. The hydrophobic tail is important in causing membrane damage, suggesting a detergent-like mode of action. Removal of the hydrophobic tail of polymyxin B yields polymyxin nonapeptide, which still binds to LPS, but no longer kills the bacterial cell. However, it still detectably increases the permeability of the bacterial cell wall to other antibiotics, indicating that it still causes some degree of membrane disorganization. Gram-negative bacteria can develop resistance to polymyxins through various modifications of the LPS structure that inhibit the binding of polymyxins to LPS. Antibiotic resistance to this drug has been increasing, especially in southern China. Recently the gene mcr-1, which confers the antibiotic resistance, has been isolated from bacterial plasmids in Enterobacteriaceae. Chemistry Numbers denote sequence of amino acid loading. Polymyxins are a group of cyclic non-ribosomal polypeptide (NRPs) which are biosynthesized by bacteria belonging to the genus Bacillus, more specifically the subgenus Paenibacillus. Polymyxins consist of 10 amino acid residues, six of which are L-Œ±,Œ≥-diaminobutyric acid (L-DAB). The DAB residues cause polymyxins to have multiple positively charged groups at physiological pH. Seven amino acid residues form the main cyclic component, while the other three extend from one of the cyclic residues as a linear chain terminating in either 6-methyloctanoic acid or 6-methylheptanoic acid at the N-terminus. During cyclization, residue 10 is bound to the bridging residue 4. The amino acid residues and DAB monomers are generally in the L (levo) configuration, however certain strains such as P. polymyxa PKB1 have been observed to incorporate DAB with the D (dextro) configuration at position 3 producing variations of polymyxin B.Shaheen, M.; Li, J.; Ross, A. C.; Vederas, J. C.; Jensen, S. E. Chem. Biol. 2011, 18, 1640‚àí1648. Polymyxin M is also known as \\"mattacin\\". =Biosynthesis= Multiple enzyme domains to form Polymyxin D natural product The polymyxins are produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetase systems in Gram-positive bacteria such as Paenibacillus polymyxa. Like other NRPs, polymyxins are assembled by synthetases with multiple modules, each containing a set of enzyme domains that sequentially operate on the growing chain by adding the next residue and extending the chain through peptide-bond formation and condensation reactions. The final steps involve a thioesterase domain at the C-terminal of the last module to cyclize the molecule and liberate the chain from the enzyme.  Research  Polymyxins are used to neutralize or absorb LPS contaminants in samples, for example in immunological experiments. Minimization of LPS contamination can be important because LPS can evoke strong reactions from immune cells, distorting experimental results. By increasing permeability of the bacterial membrane system, polymyxin is also used in clinical work to increase the release of secreted toxins, such as Shiga toxin, from Escherichia coli. The global problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance has led to a renewed interest in their use.

The municipal area includes a large lake ('; Wolsztyn Lake), next to which is a former palace built in Classical style in the early 20th century, now used as a hotel and restaurant, and a park. Nearby tourist destinations include the Pszczew Landscape Park and the Przemƒôt Landscape Park.  History  The current settlement was established about 1285 on a causeway across the swampy Dojca River, probably by Cistercian monks descending from Obra Abbey. It developed as a centre of wool () trade and cloth manufacturing on the road from Pozna≈Ñ to Lusatia, vested with market rights in 1424. Wolsztyn's town privileges were confirmed in 1519.

It is south- west of Pozna≈Ñ, the voivodeship capital. It is the seat of Grodzisk Wielkopolski County, and also of the smaller administrative district called Gmina Grodzisk Wielkopolski. The suffix \\"Wielkopolski\\" distinguishes it from the town of Grodzisk Mazowiecki in east-central Poland. History Saint Hedwig, High Duchess consort of Poland The settlement was first mentioned in 1257 by the name of Grodisze in a document by Przemys≈Ç I of Greater Poland. It was referred to as a village belonging to the Cistercians. The exact date when the town received its charter is unknown. Documents say that the town definitely had its town charter in 1303. It was a private town of Polish noble families of Ostror√≥g and Opali≈Ñski, administratively located within the Pozna≈Ñ Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The first Jews settled in the town at the beginning of the 16th century. The first document to back this up was in 1505, mentioning the Jew Abraham of Grodzisk In Yiddish and Hebrew, the town is known as ◊í◊®◊ô◊ì◊• (Gritz or Gritza) Stanis≈Çaw Ostror√≥g as a Lutheran in 1563 gave the local church to Protestants and he also founded a new school in the town. Grodzisk became an important printing center for the Polish Reformation, however in 1594 Jan Ostror√≥g as a supporter of Catholicism reintroduced Catholicism in the town. In 1593, the census for Grodzisk Wielkopolski said that the population was approximately 1,160. The town charter was renewed with the inclusion of a new town about 150 metres from the old town. In 1601, the first privileges for the brewery were awarded. The town quickly became important for the production of beer (Grodziskie style). At the end of the 18th century, there were 53 breweries in the city. In 1626, the mayor of the city changed to the Opali≈Ñski family. They remained as mayors until 1775. Micha≈Ç Drzyma≈Ça in Grodzisk in 1908 In 1793, the town was annexed by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland. Grodzisk was an important insurgent center during the Polish Ko≈õciuszko Uprising in 1794. In 1807 it became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 it was reannexed by Prussia, under the Germanized name Gr√§tz. In the Greater Poland uprising (1848) during the Revolutions of 1848 a battle was fought between the Polish insurgents and Prussian troops in the present-day district of Doktorowo. From 1887 to 1918, it was the seat of Kreis Gr√§tz. Commemorative well \\"of the blessed Bernard\\" In November 1918, after World War I, Poland regained independence, and in December local Poles formed armed units in attempt to rejoin Poland. Poles took control of the town without fighting, however volunteers from Grodzisk participated in the Greater Poland uprising in other places, as well as in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. The town was confirmed as part of Poland in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, and was until 1932 the seat of a county or powiat. During World War II, the town was under German occupation. In M≈Çyniewo, a nearby village, a transit camp was formed for onward transport to Nazi concentration camps, initially for Jews and later for Poles and French, Serbian, English and Soviet prisoners of war. Poles were also subjected to expulsions, the first of which was carried out in November 1939,Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, Wysiedlenia ludno≈õci polskiej z okupowanych ziem polskich w≈ÇƒÖczonych do III Rzeszy w latach 1939-1945, IPN, Warszawa, 2017, p. 155 (in Polish) nevertheless, the Polish resistance movement was active in the town. On January 27, 1945, the city was taken by the Red Army, and afterwards restored to Poland. After World War II, beer production declined and was discontinued in 1993. In 1999, Grodzisk again became a powiat seat when the powiats were reintroduced in the Polish administrative reforms. As well as Grodziskie beer, Grodzisk is also known for its mineral water. A commemorative pump stands in the central market square in front of the town hall. Culture A historical museum called Muzeum Ziemi Grodziskiej is located in the town.

According to local rumour, in 1002 Boleslaw the Bold was once caught offside on the banks of Wronki River. The oldest known mention of Wronki comes from 1279. Trade and crafts developed in the Late Middle Ages, due to the town's location both on the Warta river and on the trade route which connected major cities Pozna≈Ñ and Szczecin.

The population was subjected to Germanisation policies, nevertheless it remained a center of Polish resistance, and Poles established various educational, industrial and sporting organizations, also one of the oldest Polish volunteer fire departments was founded in the town. At the beginning of the 20th century, Jews were 18% of the total population. After World War I, the number decreased because Wronki was restored to Poland after the country regainede independence, and the Jews of Wronki belonged to the German culture.http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/wronki/5,history/ During the German occupation of Poland (World War II), the Polish population was subjected to mass arrests, imprisonment, massacres, deportations to forced labour to Germany and expulsions (see Nazi crimes against the Polish nation). In November and December 1939, inhabitants of Wronki were among Poles murdered in mass executions in Mƒôdzisko and Szamotu≈Çy, and in 1940 the Germans murdered 280 Poles, previously held in the local prison, in the Kobylniki forest.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939.

Before Hata became a town, it was three villages: Kami-Hata (‰∏äÊ≥¢Â§ö), Shimo-Hata (‰∏ãÊ≥¢Â§ö), and Samizo (‰∏âÊ∫ù). In 1973, these three villages merged into a town under the enforcement of the town system. On March 31, 2010, Hata (Ê≥¢Áî∞Áî∫; -machi) was merged into the expanded city Matsumoto. Originally, Hata was written as Ê≥¢Â§ö (Hata) in kanji. Ê≥¢ means \\"wave\\" and Â§ö means \\"much\\". The name meant \\"many waves\\", reflecting the abundance of clean water the town had. In 1932, the name was changed from Ê≥¢Â§ö to the current Ê≥¢Áî∞. Áî∞ means \\"rice paddies\\" and reflected the town's hope for abundant water and rice cultivation. Hata's main industry is farming and produces various vegetables and fruits, including watermelons, corn, apples, peaches, and so on. Hata is built on a river terrace. The town's slogan is \\"A Fascinating Town on a River Terrace\\" reflects this. Hata is considered the gateway to Kamik≈çchi and the Northern Japan Alps because of Shin-Shimashima Station, which is used by tourists to access the park. Geography Hata sits on the left bank of the Azusagawa River on a river terrace, 700 meters above sea level. History Hata was made up of small communities in the J≈çmon period. Many artifacts from stone masks to remains of houses from that period have been found in archaeological digs in Hata and have been displayed in the Tokyo National Museum. Local tradition recalls a large flood which caused enormous damage to Hata in the early Edo period. During the cleanup, snake bones were found in the mud. The bones were enshrined to give thanks that the flood had killed all the snakes. In the beginning of the Meiji Period, some students from Nyakutakuji helped start the Industrial Revolution in Japan. They also helped Hata become a modern town by constructing an irrigation channel and inventing a spinning machine. After that, Hata started rice production and other agriculture as well as a silk industry. In 2007, Asian black bears entered Hata, in search of food. Crops of local farmers suffered a lot of damage. Between 10 and 15 bears were caught using mustard spray, and then the bears were returned to the mountains. The bears were tracked with radar tracking technology, and follow-up surveys were conducted. Bears continue to enter Hata, due to dwindling food supplies in their habitats. =Nyakutakuji Temple= It is said that Nyakutakuji Temple was founded by Gyoki (668-749) a Buddhist priest between 749 and 758, in the Nara period. During the Edo period, Nyakutakuji Temple was given ten koku of territory (koku is a denomination of land) by the feudal lord of Matsumoto, so its perimeter was about 13 kilometers and it established five branch temples. The temple prospered until the late Edo Period, and the famous author, Jippensha Ikku, stopped there. The temple prospered and was considered the \\"Nikk≈ç of the Hida District\\". A small sub-temple, Tamura Temple, was built in the Muromachi period and enshrined the famous conquest of the Ezo by sh≈çgun Sakanoue no Tamuramaro. During the Meiji Era however, the Japanese government passed policies which popularized Shintoism (the native Japanese religion of nature worship) and boycotted Buddhism. Thus the Nyakutakuji Temple was destroyed in 1871, leaving only the small sub-temples. Later, people tried to rebuild the temple, but they failed because of lack of support. Some of the buildings that remained were transferred to different locations, and now all that remains is a stone fence. Among the Nyakutakuji Temple Ruins, there is a Japanese cedar called Shinobu-suji. Local legend says that this tree can hear a couple's secret wish for marriage. =Deva Kings= Saikoji Temple, one of the sub-temples of Nakutakuji Temple, held two Deva Kings, or guardians of the temple. They were made during the Kamakura Period. Now, the statues are located next to Kami-Hata Shrine, though they are not attached to the shrine itself, for the Deva Kings are of Buddhist origin while the shrine is Shinto. The statues were sculpted by Myokai, a monk of Zenkoji Temple. After completing the statues, Myokai inscribed his name on them. It was rare for a sculptor of Buddhist images to do this. The statues are 256 cm tall and made from Japanese cypress. During the Edo Period, the Japanese government destroyed many temples all over Japan in order to promote the national religion of Shinto. The government destroyed Saikoji Temple, but the Deva Kings were hidden and so escaped destruction. Services Health Care Hata is served by one general hospital, Hata Sogo Hospital (ÊùæÊú¨Â∏ÇÁ´ãÊ≥¢Áî∞Á∑èÂêàÁóÖÈô¢). The hospital also serves patients from the surrounding area. Senior Services Chikumano is the local senior care home and also houses a welfare office. The home offers health examinations and other care services. Community Centers Hata has two community event facilities. The first is Chuou Kouminkan (Central Community Center) for culture and study. Over sixty culture clubs covering art, history, cooking, language, etc. meet there. The second is Jouhou Bunka Center (Information and Cultural Center), which houses Hata's media center and public library. Act Hall Located next to public library is Act Hall, the local stage space for dramas, lectures and music concerts. Built in 1995, it can seat about 310 people. The Hall also offers practice rooms (band, dance, etc.) available to rent by the hour (charges range from 500 to 900 yen depending upon the hour). In 2009, the Japanese world-famous pianist Kumamoto Mari, held a piano concert here. In Act Hall, there is a Bosendorfer piano. It is one of the most famous models of piano. \\"Piano Carnival\\" is held once a year in Hata. This piano concert opens the Bosendorfer to local citizens. However, from 2011, whether it will be held or not is still unknown because of the merger with Matsumoto City. Recreation Hata has a number of parks, a sports gym, tennis courts, and an indoor pool. Hot Springs Ryujima Hot Spring \\"Seseragi no Yu\\" There is a small hot spring in Hata called Ryujima Onsen (Dragon Island Hot Spring). It is located in the far west of Hata. If you travel on Route 158 towards Kamik≈çchi, you will see a sign for it on the left. Past the signboard, turn left and go across a long narrow bridge which spans the Azusagawa River. The onsen itself is located on the sandbank of the Azusagawa River and is surrounded by beautiful nature. The hot spring was first dug in 1997, and opened to the public in 2000. There are both inside and outside baths available at Ryujima Onsen. The inside bath is a soothing stone bubble bath, while outside the bath is made from Japanese cypress. There is nice private garden which the baths look out upon. The hot spring water itself is slightly clouded and thick which is said to be good for relieving nerve and muscle pain, stiff shoulders, paralysis, and fatigue. We can relax by taking a bath while viewing the mountains and listening to the murmur of the Azusagawa River. Outside the baths, there is a casual restaurant and a large resting room. Free barely tea was available to enjoy after your bath. Now there is only hot water served (May 2014). Cost: Ôø•510 (adults), Ôø•250 (children) For more information about hot spring culture see Onsen. Education Hata has four nursery schools that enroll preschool age children. Hata has one elementary school, Hata Elementary School (ÊùæÊú¨Â∏ÇÁ´ãÊ≥¢Áî∞Â∞èÂ≠¶Ê†°), one junior high school, Hata Junior High School (ÊùæÊú¨Â∏ÇÁ´ãÊ≥¢Áî∞‰∏≠Â≠¶Ê†°), and one high school, Azusagawa High School (Èï∑ÈáéÁúåÁ´ãÊ¢ìÂ∑ùÈ´òÊ†°). In 1935, Nakata Yoshikazu, a practical science teacher at Hata Secondary School planted the first apple trees in Hata in the school's garden. Because the cultivation of apples went well, it spawned a large apple industry in Hata. In 2006, Hata Elementary School students helped to design the town's summer festival's fireworks display. Industry and Agriculture Hata mainly serves as a bedroom community to Matsumoto City; however, it does have a few precision factories including Miyaji Iron Works, which contributed iron frames to structures such as the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and the Great Seto Bridge. Hata's agriculture consists of many temperate climate fruits including apples, pears, and peaches. =Watermelons= The watermelons of Hata have been rated the best in Japan due to their sweetness, size, and juiciness by Japan Agricultural Cooperatives. Highly prized, the watermelons are the subject of three different town festivals and are shipped throughout Japan during late July/early August each year where they command a high price. The local climate and regional soil make Hata an ideal place to grow watermelons. History In 1935, people began to grow watermelons in Shimohara (a region of Hata). By 1950, Shimohara watermelons already had a great reputation in Matsumoto and were famous in the surrounding areas. Around 1960 the most common variety of watermelon was \\"Kyokuto.\\" In the mid-1960s, trucks became widespread and farmers could bring their watermelons directly to vegetable and fruit markets. In 1981, Hata Town received 300 million yen in subsidies from the government to build a watermelon distribution center. From then on, all union members began to mark their watermelons with the brand Shimohara. Now farmers in the town, without going through the cooperatives to market, use direct sales, but sales are limited to facilities operating in cooperation with \\"Shimohara Watermelon.\\" Watermelon farmers in Shimohara learned their cultivation techniques from farmers in the Namiyanagi Region(now a part of Matsumoto City), which was famous for watermelon production. People Hatakoshi Rokuza (Ê≥¢Â§öËÖ∞ÂÖ≠Â∑¶) (1839‚Äì1900) was the headman of Hata Village. He constructed an irrigation channel, \\"Hata Segi\\" in Hata in 1871. It was built with great difficulty. The success of the irrigation channel allowed agriculture in Hata to flourish. Gaun Tacchi ÔºàËá•Èõ≤Ëæ∞Ëá¥Ôºâ (1842‚Äì1900) was born in the Edo period, he invented the \\"Gara Bouki\\" in 1876. Gara Bouki is a cotton spinning machine. This was the greatest invention at the start of the modern cotton fabrics industry in Japan and is said to have started the Industrial Revolution in Japan. Gaun and his invention was supported by Hatakoshi Rokuza and others. Local events=Spring= The Deva Kings' Festival Children crawl between the legs of a Deva King statue for health on the third Saturday and Sunday of April. According to legend, a child who goes between the Deva King's legs was cured of measles. The festival honors that event. Some children cry due to the carved image of the Deva King. Parents usually help out by encouraging their children. Dogtooth Violets Festival Ôºà„Åã„Åü„Åè„ÇäÁ•≠„ÇäÔºâ The Dogtooth Violet Festival is held in the middle of April at Kami-Gaito in the west of Hata. Dogtooth violets are wild flowers which grow in the northern Japanese mountains. They bloom early in April. The flower has six beautiful violet petals. On the leaves, there are unique purple spots. From the roots, people used to make a kind of white starch called \\"Katakuriko.\\" But nowadays, the starch is made from potatoes instead. Years before the dogtooth violet garden was a mulberry field. The landowners have since protected the wild flowers in the field. Since 1997, the neighborhood has made a sidewalk and taken care of the area. Now, the garden has about 20 kinds of wild flowers and about 30,000 flowers in total. During the festival, which lasts for two weeks, there is a 200 yen entrance fee to the garden. Weeping Cherry Blossoms Anyou- ji Temple, located across from the Moriguchi Station on the Kamik≈çchi train line, is famous for its beautiful cherry trees in spring. Upon the temple grounds there are two dozen weeping cherry trees, two of which are between 300 and 500 years old. During the cherry blossom season, visitors can pay a small fee to enter the temple and enjoy a cup of tea while enjoying the view. But of course, simply walking around the temple grounds is also quite a fulfilling experience. The temple itself belongs to the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect. =Summer= Hata Summer Festival (Ê≥¢Áî∞„Åï„ÅÑ„Åï„ÅÑÁ•≠) Hata Sai Sai-Sai is the town's summer festival and most of the town's people participate in it. The festival is held the last Saturday of July every year. It is a harvest festival for Hata's delicious watermelon. The festival is famous for the watermelon that is handed out free of charge. During the daytime there is a flea market and children's games and sports. The local International Club also hosts a booth for international exchange. In the evening there are food stalls, various live performances by the brass band club from Hata Elementary School, Japanese taiko drumming, ocarina club, and the young men's music club. At 8:00 PM, there is a wonderful fireworks display. Fireworks designed in the shape of watermelons and apples can only be seen here in Hata. So this summer, take a straw mat and go to see the fireworks. You will be able to spend a wonderful time while looking up into the summer sky. =Fall= Fall Harvest Festivals ÔºàÁßãÁ•≠„ÇäÔºâ In September, three shrines in Hata (San-Shrine, Suwa-Shrine, and Hata- Shrine) have their fall festivals. Festive floats that are decorated with lanterns are paraded through the streets to each shrine. =Winter= Winter Story From December to January, the Hata Chamber of Commerce and Industry along with volunteers from the people of Hata decorate the area around Hata Station with a Christmas tree made from plastic bottles and Christmas lights. Features Lovers‚Äô Hill Salad Market is named after Lovers‚Äô Cape in the town of Toi, Shizuoka Prefecture, which was Hata Town's sister town, before the merger with Matsumoto City. Some local people believe there is a ghost in Hata. The ghost of a child sometimes appears around Akamatsu Ground near Shin- Shimashima Station. Some people say the ghost wears an orange shirt. Only children playing baseball on the ground have seen it. Locals attribute the ghost to a girl who drowned in the Azusa River.

The daughter of a Bombay Parsi merchant, she was married against her will to the Hindu ruler of Bundelkhand, an Indian princely state. At the death of her husband, she is about to be sacrificed by Hindu monks as a sati at her husband's funeral pyre. At first, Fogg attempts simply to deliver her to relatives along the way on his trip. However, when that proves impossible, she is their permanent companion who becomes more and more attracted to the intriguing and noble Fogg as she shares in the adventures. When they finally reach Britain and appear to have arrived too late to meet the deadline, Aouda fears that she ruined Fogg by causing him delays in his journey, although he firmly denies she was a problem. Now in love with the gentleman and also wishing to help him in his impoverishment, Aouda proposes to Fogg, and he joyously accepts. As it turns out, this gesture by Aouda saves the day for them all for it prompts Passepartout to discover that by traveling east, they inadvertently arrived in London a day early and now have just enough time to sprint to the Reform Club to win the wager. The company set off for the club and arrive just in time. Afterward, Aouda offers to end the engagement since the original motivation has been removed. However, Fogg, deeply in love and grateful for all Aouda is and has done for him, will not hear of it and they are happily married with Passepartout given the honor of giving her away at the wedding. Adaptations In the novel, Aouda changes out of her traditional sari for a typical European dress provided by Fogg. However, to emphasise the concept of the character as an Indian princess, most adaptations have her keeping her sari at least until the company completes the challenge. The popular Spanish animated adaptation, Around the World with Willy Fog, compromises on this detail by having Fog invite Aouda, here named \\"Romy\\", to change out of the dark-coloured funeral sari she was forced to wear for her sati and into a lighter-coloured one which she wears for remainder of the voyage. In the sequel series, Willy Fog 2, Romy eventually dons a European dress that mirrors her old dress' color-scheme although she keeps her Bindi mark.

It is not certain when the festival started, but records from 1863 suggest that it was already well-established by then. The festival is organised by the men of the village who are 40, 41, and 42 years' old; hence there is a three-year period when every male villager is closely involved in the festival. They are directed by a master carpenter chosen for his experience. The other group involved are the 25-year-old men of the village. The ages of 42 and 25 are unlucky ages, or ages where spiritual cleansing is needed, and are called yakudoshi. Participation in the event is a mandatory rite of passage for all males living in the village, regardless of whether they were born in the village or not, and is also a way to create bonds and relationships. Part of the significance of the festival is to celebrate boys born during the previous year, and lucky families will create totem poles (ÂàùÁÅØÁ±† Hatsuakarikago). These are elaborate 9-10m tall umbrella-like structures, made of oak at the bottom and cedar at the top. The family crest sits on top of the pole. The next layer down are wind chimes, and the lower layer consists of long strips of paper with charms and well-wishes written by relatives and friends. The structure is made in the autumn, and displayed outside the house from January 11. On January 15 it is taken to the fire festival ground, where it will form part of the final conflagration. The wood that will make the shadan is chosen, cut, and brought down from the mountain to the village during the previous autumn. The 20m-long Japanese Beech is dragged from the Hikage ski area through the village, on January 13, by teams of chanting yakudoshi villagers. Sake is handed out to onlookers. The shadan is built all day on the 14th, and until early afternoon on the 15th. Standing 10m high and 8m wide, construction can be dangerous so the work is carried out in silence and without sake. No nails or wire are used in the construction, and the construction is exactly the same every year. At 7pm the representatives gather to light the fire by striking a flint, which has been handed down for generations. They sing the dosojin song while drinking large amounts of sake. The flame is used to light large torches, and the procession heads to the temporary shrine at 8pm. Sake is handed out to onlookers. The night of January 15th At about 8:30pm the procession reaches the grounds. The torches are used to light a bonfire, from which other torches are lit, and are used to attack the shadan. The festival organisers are the first to attack the shrine, followed by children, followed by all the men of the village. Their objective is to burn down the shrine, and the methodology is to light a large torch from the bonfire, and then run to the shadan, attempting to charge through the 25-year old yakudoshi who are stationed at the bottom of the shrine, and set fire to the structure. The 25-year old yakudoshi use physical force to prevent the attacks. The 42-year old yakudoshi are seated at the top of the shrine. The attacks succeed in setting fire to the structure after one and a half to two hours, and the shadan burns through the night. Safety is an issue and the 25-year old yakudoshi are assigned guardians who do not drink sake. The festival attracts many visitors and accommodation is often booked a year in advance. Sake is handed out to onlookers. Dosojin Dosojin statues are common throughout Japan, but the wooden, pencil-like figures found in Nozawaonsen are unusual as (i) they are ubiquitous throughout the village (ii) they are made of wood, and painted. They represent a male and female deity. There is a folk tradition that they represent a man and a woman who were not particularly attractive, but nevertheless married and had baby boys, therefore representing the happiness of marriage.

Biography  Poli won the gold medal in the Team Time Trial at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, together with Claudio Vandelli, Marcello Bartalini and Marco Giovannetti. He also rode at the 1988 Summer Olympics. Following Cipollini's abandonment of the 1994 Tour de France, Poli won the Montpellier to Carpentras stage (the 15th) which featured an ascent of Mont Ventoux. Poli calculated that if he broke away from the peloton by a sufficient margin on the flat run to the base of the climb of the Mont Ventoux, he would reach the summit in front in spite of his relatively poor climbing speed due to his heavy 197 cm frame. In the event, his gap of some 20 minutes was nearly closed, but he crested the climb in front and was not caught by the chasing pack on the run down to the finish of the stage in Carpentras. In that Tour, Poli won the Combativity award. Poli rode mainly in the days before cycle helmets were compulsory in professional racing, and normally wore a casquette from which he cut out the top part, leaving just the elasticated headband and the peak to shade his eyes from the sun. He was praised for his calculated cycling style and called the \\"bus driver\\", by cyclists such Chris Boardman, for his ability to lead the gruppetto through tough stages, ensuring they all reached the cut- off time.Ward, T.

Additionally, women and the rest of society were not allowed to eat foods that were uncommon or foods that were only served during special occasions. However, in 1819, King Kamehameha II removed all the religious laws that were practiced. King Kamehameha II performed a symbolic act by eating with the women, thus ending the Hawaiian religious kapu (taboo) system. This is when the l≈´ ªau parties were first created.

The modern name comes from that of a food often served at a l≈´ ªau; squid or chicken l≈´ ªau, which consist of meat, l≈´ ªau (or taro) leaves, and coconut milk. The main dish of the l≈´ ªau is kƒÅlua pua ªa (kƒÅlua pig), slow- cooked in an imu (earth oven). Another dish that is served is poi, made from the roots of taro. This feast was usually served on the floor, on the mats often decorated with large centerpieces typically made of tƒ´ leaves. Utensils were never present during a l≈´ ªau; everything was eaten by hand. For example, varieties of poi were identified by the number of fingers needed to eat it: \\"three-finger, two-finger, or the thickest, one-finger poi\\".

Many sources suggest 27 February 1914, but there is a strong suggestion that her birthday was 27 April. Most sources give her year of birth as 1914, but her gravestone states that she died at the age of 73, suggesting that she was born in 1910. ‚Äì 28 February 1983) was a Trinidadian pianist who enjoyed great popularity in Britain and Australia from the 1950s with a series of boogie-woogie and ragtime hits, selling over 20 million records.\\"Atwell, Winifred\\", in David Dabydeen, John Gilmore, Cecily Jones (eds), The Oxford Companion to Black British History, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 33. She was the first black person to have a number-one hit in the UK Singles Chart and is still the only female instrumentalist to do so.George McKay, 2014. 'Winifred Atwell and her \\"other\\" piano: 16 hit singles and a \\"blanket of silence\\", sounding the limits of jazz'. Biography=Childhood= Atwell was born in Tunapuna in Trinidad and Tobago. She and her parents lived in Jubilee Street. Her family owned a pharmacy and she trained as a pharmacist herself and was expected to join the family business. She played the piano from a young age and achieved considerable popularity locally. She played for American servicemen at the Air Force base (which is now the main airport). It was while playing at the Servicemen's Club at Piarco that someone bet her that she could not play something in the boogie-woogie style that was popular back home in the United States. She went away and wrote \\"Piarco Boogie\\", which was later renamed \\"Five Finger Boogie\\". =Leaving Trinidad= Atwell left Trinidad in the early 1940s and travelled to the United States to study with Alexander Borovsky and, in 1946, moved to London, where she had gained a place at the Royal Academy of Music. She became the first female pianist to be awarded the academy's highest grading for musicianship. To support her studies, she played rags at London clubs and theatres. These modest beginnings in variety would one day see her topping the bill at the London Palladium. She said later, \\"I starved in a garret to get onto concert stages.\\" =Life in the UK= Atwell attracted attention with an unscheduled appearance at the Casino Theatre, where she substituted for an ill star. She caught the eye of entrepreneur Bernard Delfont, who put her on a long-term contract. She released three discs that were well received. The third, \\"Jezebel\\", went to the top of the bestseller lists. It was her fourth disc that catapulted her to huge popularity in the UK. A complex arrangement called \\"Cross Hands Boogie\\" was released to show her virtuoso rhythmic technique, but it was the B-side, a 1900s tune written by George Botsford called \\"Black and White Rag\\", that was to become a radio standard. Atwell was championed by popular disc jockey Jack Jackson, who introduced her to Decca promotions manager Hugh Mendl, who launched his career as a staff producer at Decca producing Atwell's recordings. \\"Black And White Rag\\" started a craze for her honky-tonk style of playing. The rag was originally performed on a concert grand for the occasion, but Atwell felt it did not sound right, and so got her husband to buy a honky tonk piano for 30 shillings, which would then be used for the released version of the song. Atwell's husband, former stage comedian Lew Levisohn, was vital in shaping her career as a variety star. The two had met in 1946, and married soon after. They were inseparable up to Levisohn's death in Hong Kong in December 1977; they had no children. He had cannily made the choice, for stage purposes, of her playing first a concert grand, then a beaten-up old upright piano. The latter was purchased from a Battersea junk shop for 50 shillings. This became famous as \\"my other piano\\". It would later feature all over the world, from Las Vegas to the Sydney Opera House, travelling over half a million miles by air throughout Atwell's concert career. While contributing to a posthumous BBC radio appreciation of Atwell's career, Richard Stilgoe revealed that he was now the owner of the famous \\"other piano\\". When Atwell first came to Britain, she initially earned only a few pounds a week. By the mid-1950s, this had shot up to over $10,000. By 1952, her popularity had spread internationally. Her hands were insured with Lloyd's of London for ¬£40,000 (the policy stipulating that she was never to wash dishes). She signed a record contract with Decca, and her sales were soon 30,000 discs a week. She was by far the biggest selling pianist of her time. Her 1954 hit \\"Let's Have Another Party\\" was the first piano instrumental to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart. She is the only holder of two gold and two silver discs for piano music in Britain, and was the first black artist in the UK to sell a million records. Millions of copies of her sheet music were sold, and she went on to record her best- known hits, including \\"Let's Have a Party\\", \\"Flirtation Waltz\\", \\"The Poor People of Paris\\" (which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in 1956), \\"Britannia Rag\\" and \\"Jubilee Rag\\". Her signature \\"Black and White Rag\\" became famous again in the 1970s as the theme of the BBC snooker programme Pot Black, which also enjoyed great popularity in Australia when screened on the ABC network. It was during this period that she discovered Matt Monro and persuaded Decca to sign him. Atwell's peak was the second half of the 1950s, during which her concerts drew standing room only crowds in Europe and Australasia. She played three Royal Variety Performances, appeared in every capital city in Europe, and played for over twenty million people. At a private party for Queen Elizabeth II, she was called back for an encore by the monarch herself, who requested \\"Roll Out the Barrel\\". She became a firm television favourite. She had her own series in Britain. The first of these was Bernard Delfont Presents The Winifred Atwell Show. It ran for ten episodes on the new ITV network from 21 April to 23 June 1956, and the BBC picked up the series the following year. On a third triumphal tour of Australia, she recorded her own Australian television series, screened in 1960‚Äì1961. Her career earned her a fortune, and would have extended further to the US but for issues of race. Her breakthrough appearance was to have been on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956, but on arrival in America she was confronted with problems of selling the show in the south with a British-sounding black woman. The appearance was never recorded. In 1955, Atwell arrived in Australia and was greeted as an international celebrity. Her tour broke box-office records on the Tivoli circuit, bringing in ¬£600,000 in box office receipts. She was paid AUS$5,000 a week (the equivalent of around $50,000 today), making her the highest paid star from a Commonwealth country to visit Australia up to that time. She toured Australia many times and took on Australian guitarist Jimmy Doyle as her musical director in the 1960s. In 1962 she made a nationwide tour of Britain, with \\"The Winifred Atwell Show\\". She was accompanied by the Cy Bevan Group, who were with her then current radio series \\"Pianorama\\". From Monday, 17 September 1962, for one week only, she gave twice nightly performances at the Brighton Hippodrome. Also appearing with her on the same bill was Ronnie Carroll, a radio and television recording star. However, her popularity in Australia led to her settling in Sydney in the 1970s. She became an Australian citizen two years before her death. Keith Emerson noted her influence on his playing in an interview: \\"I've always been into ragtime. In England‚Äîand I'm sure Rick Wakeman would concur‚Äîwe loved Winifred Atwell, a fantastic honky-tonk and ragtime player.\\" Atwell was also a skilled interpreter of classical music. On 1 and 2 December 1954, at London's Kingsway Hall, she made one of the first stereo classical recordings in the UK, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Stanford Robinson, of a major repertoire work, the \\"Piano Concerto in A-minor, Op. 16\\", by Grieg. The two- channel version (engineered by Decca's Roy Wallace) appears not to have been released, but a transfer of the Decca LP (mono) LF1206 has been produced and issued by Pristine Audio as an available download. Another Decca recording by Atwell is George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue with Ted Heath's band, which contained an arrangement in the slow section in the Glenn Miller style. =Later life= Atwell bought an apartment on the beach front in the Flightdeck at Collaroy in Sydney, as jumping-off bases for her worldwide performance commitments. She was a member of the Moby Dick Surfer's Club at Whale Beach where she performed regularly in support of the surf club. Enjoying the affection of the public, she was nevertheless keenly aware of prejudice and injustice and was outspoken about racism in Australia. She always donated her services in a charity concert on Sundays, the proceeds going to orphanages and needy children. She spoke out against the third world conditions endured by Australian Aborigines, which made headlines during an outback tour of the country in 1962. Dismissing racism as a factor in her own life, she said she felt she was \\"spoiled very much by the public.\\" She left her estate to the Australian Guide Dogs for the Blind and a small amount to her goddaughter. However a cousin of Lew Levisohn contested Atwell's will and is reported to have been granted $30,000 from her estate. Atwell also created headlines in the 1960s with her dieting (slimming from sixteen to twelve stone on what would today be called a protein diet). In 1978, she appeared on Australian TV's This Is Your Life. She played her \\"other\\" piano at the end of the show with a few bars from \\"Black and White Rag\\" after the piano being in retirement for many years. Though a dynamic stage personality, Atwell was, in person, a shy, retiring and soft-spoken woman of modesty. Eloquent and intellectual, she was well read and keenly interested in and informed about issues and current events. Voracious in her reading habits and a devotee of crosswords, she confessed to an inordinate love of mangoes, a dislike of new shoes, and a keen interest in televised cricket (she backed England). She was also a devout Catholic, who unpretentiously played the organ for her parish church. Atwell often returned to her native Trinidad, and on one occasion she bought a house in Saint Augustine, a home she adored and later renamed Winvilla and which was later turned into the Pan Pipers Music School by one of her students, Louise McIntosh. In 1968 she had recorded Ivory and Steel, an album of standards and classics, with the Pan Am Jet North Stars Steel Orchestra (director/arranger Anthony Williams), and supported musical scholarships in the West Indies. In the early 1980s, Atwell's sense of loss following her husband's death made her consider returning to Trinidad to live, but she found the weather too hot. Atwell suffered a stroke in 1980. She officially retired on The Mike Walsh Show, then Australia's highest rating television variety programme, in 1981. She categorically stated that she would retire and not return as a public performer, and that she had had an excellent career. Her last TV performance was \\"Choo Choo Samba\\" followed with a medley of \\"Black and White Rag\\" and \\"Twelfth Street Rag\\". Her only non-private performances from this point were as an organist in her parish church at Narrabeen. In 1983, following an electrical fire that destroyed her Narrabeen home, she suffered a heart attack and died while staying with friends in Seaforth. She is buried beside husband Lew Levisohn in South Gundurimba Private Cemetery in northern New South Wales, just outside Lismore. Awards In 1969 she was awarded Trinidad and Tobago's national award, the Gold Hummingbird Medal, for her achievements in music.National Awards Database, The Office of the President, Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.

A phrase is not pitches only but also has a rhythmic dimension, and further, each phrase in a work contributes to that work's large rhythmic organization.\\"Burkhart, Charles. \\"The Phrase Rhythm of Chopin's A-flat Major Mazurka, Op. 59, No. 2\\" cited in Stein 2005.

A phrase will end with a weaker or stronger cadence, depending on whether it is an antecedent phrase or a consequent phrase, the first or second half of a period. However, the absolute span of the phrase (the term in today's use is coined by the German theorist Hugo RiemannSystem der musikalischen Rhythmik und Metrik (Leipzig, 1903)) is as contestable as its pendant in language, where there can be even one-word- phrases (like \\"Stop!\\" or \\"Hi!\\"). Thus no strict line can be drawn between the terms of the 'phrase', the 'motiv' or even the separate tone (as a one-tone-, one-chord- or one-noise-expression). Thus, in views of the Gestalt theory the term of the phrase is rather enveloping any musical expression which is perceived as a consistent gestalt separate from others, however few or many beats, i. e. distinct musical events like tones, chords or noises, it may contain.

Phrase rhythm is the rhythmic aspect of phrase construction and the relationships between phrases, and \\"is not at all a cut-and-dried affair, but the very lifeblood of music and capable of infinite variety.

W. Dijkstra which argues that computer programming should be understood as a branch of mathematics, and that the formal provability of a program is a major criterion for correctness. Despite the title, most of the article is on Dijkstra‚Äôs attempt to put computer science into a wider perspective within science, teaching being addressed as a corollary at the end. Specifically, Dijkstra made a ‚Äúproposal for an introductory programming course for freshmen‚Äù that consisted of Hoare logic as an uninterpreted formal system.  Debate over feasibility  Since the term \\"software engineering\\" was coined, formal verification has almost always been considered too resource-intensive to be feasible. In complex applications, the difficulty of correctly specifying what the program should do in the first place is also a common source of error. Other methods of software testing are generally employed to try to eliminate bugs and many other factors are considered in the measurement of software quality. Until the end of his life, Dijkstra maintained that the central challenges of computing hadn't been met to his satisfaction, due to an insufficient emphasis on program correctness (though not obviating other requirements, such as maintainability and efficiency).  Pedagogical legacy  Computer science as taught today does not follow of Dijkstra's advice. The curricula generally emphasize techniques for managing complexity and preparing for future changes, following Dijkstra's earlier writings. These include abstraction, programming by contract, and design patterns. Programming techniques to avoid bugs and conventional software testing methods are taught as basic requirements, and students are exposed to certain mathematical tools, but formal verification methods are not included in the curriculum except perhaps as an advanced topic.MIT Courses : * Eric Grimson, Peter Szolovits, and Trevor Darrell. 6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

Newly formed curricula in software engineering have adopted Dijkstra's recommendations. The focus of these programs is the formal specification of software requirements and design in order to facilitate the formal validation of system correctness. In Canada, they are often accredited engineering degrees with similar core competencies in physics-based engineering.

The station is on the District line and Hammersmith & City line. The station was opened on 31 March 1858 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway on a new more direct route from Fenchurch Street to Barking. The large Edwardian station building was constructed to accommodate the electric District Railway services on an additional set of tracks opened in 1905. It has high and growing usage for a suburban station with 13.1 million entries and exits in 2010. It is in London fares zones 3 and 4. History The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&SR;) direct line from Bow to Barking was constructed east to west through the middle of the Parish of East Ham in 1858. Prior to the building of the line trains took a longer route via Stratford and Forest Gate to the north. The new line initially also had stations at Bromley and Plaistow, with Upton Park added as the next station to the west of East Ham in 1877. District line, then known as the District Railway, service began in 1902.Rose, D., The London Underground: A diagrammatic history, (1999) The District line was electrified in 1905 over a second pair of tracks, and the service was cut back from Upminster to East Ham; the station then served as the eastern terminus, where passengers transferred to steam trains, until 1908 when electrification was extended to Barking. In 1936 the Metropolitan line service was introduced. In 1990 the station, along with other stations beyond Aldgate East, was transferred to the new Hammersmith & City line. A short spur line to Woodgrange Park was opened in 1894 and was closed in 1958.Chronology of London Railways by H.V.Borley page 20 =Accidents and incidents= *On 12 November 1959, a passenger train overran signals and was in a rear-end collision with another standing at the station. Thirteen people were injured. *On 14 February 1990, an empty stock train formed of a Class 305 and a Class 308 electric multiple unit was derailed.

Their history and lingua franca is linked to the Songhai Empire which dominated the western Sahel in the 15th and 16th century. Predominantly a Muslim community, the Songhai are found primarily throughout Nigeria and Niger in the Western sudanic region (not the country). The name Songhai was historically neither an ethnic nor linguistic designation, but a name for the ruling caste of the Songhay Empire. Speakers in Mali have adopted it as an ethnic designationHeath, Jeffrey. 1999. A grammar of Koyraboro (Koroboro) Senni: the Songhay of Gao. K√∂ln: K√∂ppe. 402 pp but other Songhay-speaking groups identify themselves by other ethnic terms such as Zarma (or Djerma, the largest subgroup of the Songhai) or Isawaghen. The dialect of Koyraboro Senni spoken in Gao is unintelligible to speakers of the Zarma dialect of Niger, according to at least one report. The Songhay languages are commonly taken to be Nilo-Saharan but this classification remains controversial: Dimmendaal (2008) believes that for now it is best considered an independent language family.Dimmendaal, Gerrit. 2008. Language Ecology and Linguistic Diversity on the African Continent. Language and Linguistics Compass 2(5): 843ff. History It was from one of Mali's former conquests, the kingdom of Gao, that the last major empire of the western Sudan emerged. Although the city of Gao had been occupied by a Songhai dynasty prior to being conquered by Mansa Musa's forces in 1325, it was not until much later that the Songhai Empire emerged. The empire saw its pre-eminent rise under the military strategist and influential Songhai king, Sonni Ali Ber. It began its rise in 1468 when Sonni Ali conquered much of the weakening Mali empire's territory as well as Timbuktu, famous for its Islamic universities, and the pivotal trading city of Djenn√©. Among the country's most noted scholars was Ahmed Baba‚Äîa highly distinguished historian frequently quoted in the Tarikh al-Sudan and other works. The people consisted of mostly fishermen and traders. Following Sonni Ali's death, Muslim factions rebelled against his successor and installed Soninke general, Askia Muhammad (formerly Muhammad Toure) who was to be the first and most important ruler of the Askia dynasty (1492‚Äì1592). Under the Askias, the Songhai empire reached its zenith. Following Askia Muhammad, the empire began to collapse. It was enormous and could not be kept under control. The kingdom of Morocco saw Songhay's still flourishing salt and gold trade and decided that it would be a good asset. The Dendi people are a subgroup of the Songhai. Society and culture A Gorom- Gorom market selling Songhai pottery. The language, society and culture of the Songhai people is barely distinguishable from the Zarma people. Some scholars consider the Zarma people to be a part of and the largest ethnic sub-group of the Songhai.Songhai people, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Some study the group together as Zarma-Songhai people. However, both groups see themselves as two different peoples. =Social stratification= The Songhai people have traditionally been a socially stratified society, like many West African ethnic groups with castes., Quote: \\"[Castes] are found among the Soninke, the various Manding-speaking populations, the Wolof, Tukulor, Senufo, Minianka, Dogon, Songhay, and most Fulani, Moorish and Tuareg populations\\". According to the medieval and colonial era descriptions, their vocation is hereditary, and each stratified group has been endogamous.I. Diawara (1988), Cultures nig√©riennes et √©ducation : Domaine Zarma-Songhay et Hausa, Pr√©sence Africaine, Nouvelle s√©rie, number 148 (4e TRIMESTRE 1988), pages 9-19 (in French) The social stratification has been unusual in two ways; it embedded slavery, wherein the lowest strata of the population inherited slavery, and the Zima, or priests and Islamic clerics, had to be initiated but did not automatically inherit that profession, making the cleric strata a pseudo-caste. Louis Dumont, the 20th-century author famous for his classic Homo Hierarchicus, recognized the social stratification among Zarma-Songhai people as well as other ethnic groups in West Africa, but suggested that sociologists should invent a new term for West African social stratification system. Other scholars consider this a bias and isolationist because the West African system shares all elements in Dumont's system, including economic, endogamous, ritual, religious, deemed polluting, segregative and spread over a large region. According to Anne Haour ‚Äì a professor of African Studies, some scholars consider the historic caste-like social stratification in Zarma- Songhay people to be a pre-Islam feature while some consider it derived from the Arab influence. The different strata of the Songhai-Zarma people have included the kings and warriors, the scribes, the artisans, the weavers, the hunters, the fishermen, the leather workers and hairdressers (Wanzam), and the domestic slaves (Horso, Bannye). Each caste reveres its own guardian spirit. Some scholars such as John Shoup list these strata in three categories: free (chiefs, farmers and herders), servile (artists, musicians and griots), and the slave class. The servile group were socially required to be endogamous, while the slaves could be emancipated over four generations. The highest social level, states Shoup, claim to have descended from King Sonni 'Ali Ber and their modern era hereditary occupation has been Sohance (sorcerer). The traditionally free strata of the Zerma people have owned property and herds, and these have dominated the political system and governments during and after the French colonial rule. Within the stratified social system, the Islamic system of polygynous marriages is a norm, with preferred partners being cross cousins.Songhai people Encyclop√¶dia Britannica This endogamy within Songhai- Zarma people is similar to other ethnic groups in West Africa.Tal Tamari (1998), Les castes de l'Afrique occidentale: Artisans et musiciens endogames, Nanterre: Soci√©t√© d‚Äôethnologie, (in French) =Livelihood= The Songhai people cultivate cereals, raise small herds of cattle and fish in the Niger Bend area where they live.

The numbers are assigned by the London Stock Exchange, on request by the security issuer. SEDOLs serve as the National Securities Identifying Number for all securities issued in the United Kingdom and are therefore part of the security's ISIN as well. The SEDOL Masterfile (SMF) provides reference data on millions of global multi-asset securities each uniquely identified at the market level using a universal SEDOL code. Description SEDOLs are seven characters in length, consisting of two parts: a six-place alphanumeric code and a trailing check digit.http://www.londonstockexchange.com/products-and- services/reference-data/sedol-master-file/documentation/sedol-technical- specification.pdf SEDOLs issued prior to January 26, 2004 were composed only of numbers. For older SEDOLs, those from Asia and Africa typically begin with 6. Those from the UK and Ireland (until Ireland joined the EU) typically begin with 0 or 3. Those from the rest of Europe typically began with 4, 5, or 7. Those from the Americas began with 2. After January 26, 2004, SEDOLs were changed to be alpha-numeric and are issued sequentially, beginning with B000009. At each character position numbers precede letters and vowels are never used. All new SEDOLs, therefore, begin with a letter. Ranges beginning with 9 are reserved for end user allocation. The check digit for a SEDOL is chosen to make the total weighted sum of all seven characters a multiple of 10. The check digit is computed using a weighted sum of the first six characters. Letters have the value of 9 plus their alphabet position, such that B = 11 and Z = 35. While vowels are never used in SEDOLs, they are not ignored when computing this weighted sum (e.g. H = 17 and J = 19, even though I is not used), simplifying code to compute this sum. The resulting string of numbers is then multiplied by the weighting factor as follows: \\\\+ First 1 \\\\+ Second 3 \\\\+ Third 1 \\\\+ Fourth 7 \\\\+ Fifth 3 \\\\+ Sixth 9 \\\\+ Seventh 1 (the check digit) The character values are multiplied by the weights. The check digit is chosen to make the total sum, including the check digit, a multiple of 10, which can be calculated from the weighted sum of the first six characters as (10 ‚àí (weighted sum modulo 10)) modulo 10. For British securities, SEDOLs are converted to ISINs by padding the front with two zeros, then adding the country code on the front and the ISIN check digit at the end.

In 1928 he used the money to travel around the world, intending to write about his travels. He made it to Shanghai that summer, and stayed in China for thirteen years. He quickly found work with the China Weekly Review, edited by J.B. Powell, a graduate of the Missouri School of Journalism. He became friends with numerous prominent Chinese writers and intellectuals, including Soong Ching-ling. During his early years in China, he supported Chiang Kai-shek, noting that Chiang had more Harvard graduates in his cabinet than there were in Franklin Roosevelt's. He arrived in India in 1931 with an introduction letter to Nehru from Agnes Smedley, an American journalist living in China. He delivered it in Mumbai and Sarojini Naidu introduced him to her Communist sister Suhasini, who took him around to see mill workers. He met Gandhi in Simla, but was not impressed. He covered the Meerut conspiracy case trial in which three British communists were involved, and wrote three articles about India. In 1932 he married Helen Foster, who was working in the American Consulate until she could begin her own career in journalism, writing under the pen-name \\"Nym Wales.\\" Through much of the 1930s, while he was living in Shanghai, Snow widely traveled throughout China, often on assignment for the Chinese Railway Ministry. While he was working in Shanghai, he toured famine districts in Northwest China. He also visited what would later become the Burma Road, and reported on the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. He became a correspondent for the Saturday Evening Post. In 1933, after a honeymoon in Japan, Snow and his wife moved to Beiping, as Beijing was called at that time. They taught journalism part-time at Yenching University, the leading university in China at that time. He and his wife studied Chinese and the two of them became modestly fluent in it. In addition to writing a book on Japanese aggression in China, Far Eastern Front, he also edited a collection of modern Chinese short stories (translated into English), Living China.Fairbank, John D. \\"Introduction\\". In Snow, Edgar. Red Star Over China: The Classic Account of the Birth of Chinese Communism. New York, NY: Edgar Snow. 1968. . pp.11-12 They borrowed works on current affairs from the Yenching library and read the principal texts of Marxism. The couple became acquainted with student leaders of the anti-Japanese December 9th Movement. Through their contacts in the underground communist network, Snow was invited to visit Mao Zedong's headquarters.Thomas, Season of High Adventure, 107-125. =Writing Red Star Over China= Edgar Snow with Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi in Beijing in 1960. In June 1936, Snow left Beiping with a letter of introduction from Soong Ching-ling (who was a politically important supporter of the Communists) and arrived at Xi'an. The Nationalist army was formally blockading areas controlled by the Communists, but Zhang Xueliang‚Äôs Manchurian army soldiers stationed in Xi'an wanted to work with the Communists in order to oppose the Japanese, and it allowed Snow to enter. Snow was accompanied on the journey by George Hatem (a friend of Agnes Smedley), who had written about the Chinese communists, but whose presence was kept secret for many years. Snow had been preparing to write a book about the Communist movement in China for several years, and he had even signed a contract at one point. However, his most important contribution was the interviews that he had conducted with the top leaders of the party. When Snow wrote, there were no reliable reports reaching the West about what was going on in the Communist-controlled areas. Other writers, such as Agnes Smedley, had written in some detail about the Chinese Communists before the Long March, but none of these writers had ever visited them or even conducted first-hand interviews with the new leadership which had emerged during the Long March. pp. 42-46. Snow was taken through the military quarantine lines to the Communist headquarters at Bao'an, where he spent four months (until October 1936) interviewing Mao and other Communist leaders. He was greeted by crowds of cadets and troops who shouted slogans of welcome, and Snow later recalled \\"the effect pronounced upon me was highly emotional.\\" Over a period spanning ten days, Mao met with Snow and narrated his autobiography. Although Snow did not know it at the time, Mao was quite cautious during these interviews, and although he claimed that he had been under no constraint, Snow made a number of revisions at the request of Mao or Zhou.Brady p. 46-47. After he returned to Beiping in the fall, he wrote frantically. First he published a short account in China Weekly Review, then a series of publications in Chinese. Red Star Over China, published first in London in 1937, was given credit for introducing both Chinese and foreign readers not so much to the Communist Party, which was reasonably well known, but to Mao Zedong. Mao was not, as had been reported, dead, and Snow reported that Mao was a political reformer, not the purely military or radical revolutionary that he had been during the 1920s.Brady p. 47. In the first four weeks after its publication, Red Star over China sold over 12,000 copies,Israel, Jerry. \\"'Mao's Mr. America': Edgar Snow's Images of China\\". Pacific Historical Review. 47.1. (Feb. 1978): 107-122. p.107. Retrieved July 7, 2014. and it effectively made Snow world- famous. The book quickly became a \\"standard\\" introduction to the early Communist movement in China. =Activities in China during World War II= After the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the Snows became founding members of the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association (Indusco). The goal of Indusco was to establish workers' cooperatives in areas not controlled by the Japanese, through which Chinese workers would be provided with steady employment, education, consumer and industrial goods, and the opportunity to manage their own farms and factories. Snow's work in Indusco mainly involved his chairmanship of the Membership and Propaganda Committee, which managed public and financial support. Indusco was eventually successful in creating 1,850 workers' cooperatives.Hamilton, John Maxwell. Edgar Snow: A Biography. United States of America: John Maxwell Hamilton. 1988. . p.2 Retrieved July 7, 2014. Snow again visited Mao in Yan'an in 1939. Edgar Snow reported on the Nanking Massacre (December 1937), and even reported Japanese reactions to it, stating: > In Shanghai a few Japanese deeply felt the shame and the humiliation. I > remember, for example, talking one evening to a Japanese friend, a liberal- > minded newspaper man who survived by keeping his views to himself, and whose > name I withhold for his own protection. \\"Yes, they are all true,\\" he > unexpectedly admitted when I asked him about some atrocity reports, \\"only > the facts are actually worse than any story yet published.\\" There were tears > in his eyes and I took his sorrow to be genuine. His report on the Nanking Massacre appeared in his 1941 book Scorched Earth. Snow met Wataru Kaji, and his wife, Yuki Ikeda. Both Kaji and Ikeda survived a Japanese bombing attack on Wuchang and met him at the Hankow Navy YMCA. Snow met them again a year later in Chongqing and he was reminded that: > Japan was full of decent people like them who, if they had not had their > craniums stuffed full of Sun goddess myths and other imperialist filth, and > been forbidden access to 'dangerous thoughts,' and been armed by American > and British hypocrites, could easily live in a civilized co-operative world > if any of us could provide one. =Later journalism= Shortly before the United States entered World War II, in 1941, Snow toured Japanese-occupied areas of Asia and wrote his second major book, Battle for Asia, about his observations. After writing the book, Snow and his wife returned to the United States, where they separated. In April 1942, the Saturday Evening Post sent him abroad as a war correspondent. Snow traveled to India, China, and Russia to report on World War II from the perspectives of those countries. In Russia he shared his observations of the Battle of Stalingrad with the American Embassy. At times, Snow's defenses of various undemocratic Allied governments were denounced as blatant war propaganda, not neutral journalistic observation, but Snow defended his reporting, stating: > In this international cataclysm brought on by fascists it is no more > possible for any people to remain neutral than it is for a man surrounded by > bubonic plague to remain 'neutral' toward the rat population. Whether you > like it or not, your life as a force is bound either to help the rats or > hinder them. Nobody can be immunized against the germs of history. By 1944, Snow was wavering on the question of whether Mao and the Chinese Communists were actually \\"agrarian democrats,\\" rather than dedicated communists who were bent on totalitarian rule.Hamilton, John M., Edgar Snow: A Biography, LSU Press, (2003) , , p. 167; Shewmaker, Kenneth E., Americans and Chinese Communists, 1927-1945: A Persuading Encounter, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press (1971) His 1944 book, People On Our Side, emphasized their role in the fight against fascism. In a speech, he described Mao and the Communist Chinese as a progressive force which desired a democratic, free China. Writing for The Nation, Snow stated that the Chinese Communists \\"happen to have renounced, years ago now, any intention of establishing communism [in China] in the near future.\\" After the war, Snow retreated from the view that the Chinese communists were a democratic movement. While working as a correspondent in Russia, he wrote three short books about Russia's role both in World War II and world affairs: People on Our Side (1944); The Pattern of Soviet Power (1945); and, Stalin Must Have Peace (1947). In 1949 Snow divorced Helen Foster and married his second wife, Lois Wheeler. They had a son, Christopher (born 1949) who died of cancer in October 2008,Sian Snow in her comment, August 29, 2012 to: \\"A compelling, historical and bittersweet film\\" by local filmmaker on Edgar Snow, U.S Journalist, an article by Catherine, in Living in Nyon, April 20, 2012 and a daughter, Sian (born 1950), named after the Chinese city Sian (now Xian),Ailleurs, ma maison (A Home Far Away), documentary by Peter Entell, 100 min., Show and Tell Films, ARTE G.E.I.E., Radio T√©l√©vision Suisse, SRG SSR, 2012 who lives and works as a translator and editor in the Geneva region, not far from where her mother lived for many years prior to her death in 2018. =McCarthy period, exile in Switzerland= Because of his relationships with communists and his highly favorable treatment of them as a war correspondent, Snow became an object of suspicion following World War II. During the McCarthy period, he was questioned by the FBI and asked to disclose the extent of his relationship with the Communist Party. In published articles, Snow lamented what he saw as the one-sided, conservative, and anti-communist mood of the United States. Later in the 1950s, he published two more books about China: Random Notes on Red China (1957), a collection of previously unused China material which was of interest to China scholars; and Journey to the Beginning (1958), an autobiographical account of his experiences in China before 1949. During the 1950s, Snow found it difficult to make a living through his writing, and he decided to leave the United States. He moved with his wife to Switzerland in 1959, but he remained an American citizen. =Return visits to China= He returned to China in 1960 and 1964, interviewed Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, traveled extensively, and talked with many people. His 1963 book, The Other Side of the River, details his experience, including his reasons for denying the fact that China's 1959-1961 crisis the Great Leap Forward was actually a famine. In 1970, he ‚Äì this time with his wife, Lois Wheeler Snow ‚Äì made a final trip to China. In December 1970, Mao Zedong called Snow to his office one morning before dawn for an informal talk lasting over five hours, during which Mao told Snow that he would welcome Richard Nixon to China either as a tourist or in his official capacity as President of the United States.Edgar Snow: Citizen of the World, University of Missouri ‚Äì Kansas City Archives (UMKC) and Lois Wheeler Snow, The Edgar Snow Project (http://edgarsnowproject.org edgarsnowproject.org)http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB145/index.htm Snow reached an agreement with Time magazine to publish his final interview with Mao, including the Nixon invitation, provided the earlier interview with Zhou Enlai was also published. The White House followed this visit with interest but distrusted Snow and his pro-communist reputation. When Snow came down with pancreatic cancer and returned home after a surgery, Zhou Enlai dispatched a team of Chinese doctors to Switzerland, including George Hatem. =Death= Half of Edgar Snow's ashes are buried on the campus of Peking University, Beijing, alongside Weiming Lake. Snow died on February 15, 1972, the week President Nixon was traveling to China, before he could see the normalization of relations.Thomas, Season of High Adventure pp. 335-6. He died of cancer, at the age of 66, at his home in Eysins near Nyon, Vaud, Switzerland. After his death, his ashes were divided into two parts at his request. One half was buried at Sneden's Landing, near the Hudson River. The other half was buried on the grounds of Peking University, which had taken over the campus of Yenching University, where he had taught in the 1930s. His final book, The Long Revolution, was published posthumously by Lois Wheeler Snow. In 1973 Lois Wheeler Snow went to China to bury half of her husband's ashes in the garden of Peking University. In 2000 ‚Äì together with her son Chris ‚Äì she traveled to Beijing in support of women who lost their children in the Tian An Men massacre of 1989. One of these mothers was under house arrest and refused visits by others, while another was arrested after receiving financial assistance from Wheeler Snow. Wheeler Snow issued statements of protest to the international press and threatened to remove her husband's remains from Chinese soil. In her letter to the Chinese ambassador in Geneva, Wheeler Snow expressed her wish that the people of China be liberated from oppression, corruption and misuse of power ‚Äì just as she and her husband had expressed in 1949. Evaluation by China scholars Snow's reporting from China in the 1930s has been both praised as prescient and blamed for the rise of Mao's communism. Some China historians have judged Snow's writing very positively. John K. Fairbank praised Snow's reporting for giving the West the first articulate account of the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership, which he called \\"disastrously prophetic.\\" Writing thirty years after the first publication of Red Star Over China, Fairbank stated that the book had \\"stood the test of time... both as a historical record and as an indication of a trend.\\"Fairbank, John D. \\"Introduction\\". In Snow, Edgar. Red Star Over China: The Classic Account of the Birth of Chinese Communism. New York, NY: Edgar Snow. 1968. . p.13 Fairbank agrees that Snow was used by Mao, but defended Snow against the allegation that he was blinded by Chinese hospitality and charm, insisting that \\"Snow did what he could as a professional journalist.\\" Other historians have been more critical of Snow. Jung Chang and Jon Halliday's anti-communist biography, Mao: The Unknown Story, describes Snow as a Mao spokesman and accuses him of supplying myths, asserting that he lost his objectivity to such an extent that he presented a romanticized view of communist China.Chang, Jung and Halliday, Jon, Mao: The Unknown Story, Jonathan Cape, London (2005), , p. 106. Jonathan Mirsky, a critical voice, stated that what Snow did in the 1930s was \\"to describe the Chinese Communists before anyone else, and thus score a world-class scoop.\\" Of his reporting in 1960, however, he says that Snow \\"went much further than those who reckoned that Mao and his comrades would take power.\\" He contented himself with assurances from Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong that while there was a food problem, it was being dealt with successfully,\\" which was not true, and \\"had Snow still been the reporter he had been in the 1930s he would have discovered it.\\" Jonathan Mirsky, \\"Message from Mao\\" (review of Hamilton. Edgar Snow: A Biography) New York Review (February 16, 1985). In Mao: A Reinterpretation, a work sympathetic to Mao, Lee Feigon criticizes Snow's account for its inaccuracies, but praises Red Star for being \\"[the] seminal portrait of Mao\\" and relies on Snow's work as a critical reference throughout the book.Feigon, Lee, Mao: A Reinterpretation, Chicago: Ivan R.

The purpose of a collaboration tool is to support a group of two or more individuals to accomplish a common goal or objective. Collaboration tools can be either of a non-technological nature such as paper, flipcharts, post-it notes or whiteboards. They can also include software tools and applications such as collaborative software.  Collaboration tools before Web 2.0  The first idea to use computers in order to work with each other was formed in 1945 when Vannevar Bush shared his thoughts on a system he named \\"memex\\" in his article \\"As We May Think\\". A system that stores books, records and communications of an individual and makes them available at any time. At this stage he called it \\"an enlarged supplement to his memory\\". = Computerized office automation = In 1968 computer systems were brought in connection with communication and the potential way of working together when not at the same place by Dr. J. C. R. Licklider, head of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In his article ‚ÄúThe Computer as a Communication Device‚Äù he envisioned the idea that there should be a way of ‚Äúfacilitating communication among people without bringing them together in one place‚Äù , which eventually led to ARPANET, commercial time-sharing systems and finally the Internet. When the Microcomputer was invented in 1970, everyone learned about office automation, which led to the first collaborative software called Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES) that allowed to do surveys, threaded replies and group-structured approaches. In 1991 educator C. A. Ellis came up with the definition of the term \\"groupware\\" as ‚Äúcomputer- based systems that support groups of people engaged in a common task (or goal) and that provide an interface to a shared environment‚Äù . Paul Wilson then shaped the term ‚ÄúComputer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). He described it as ‚Äúa generic term which combines the understanding of the way people work in groups with the enabling technologies of computer networking, and associated hardware, software, services, and techniques‚Äù. This laid the foundation to develop further on the ideas of groupware and in the 1990s Lotus Notes, Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook were invented. In 2002 at the Social Software Summit Clay Shirky introduced the phrase ‚Äúsocial software‚Äù as a \\"software that supports group interaction\\".  Main types  Three aspects of collaboration: communication, coordination and cooperation can be used to categorize collaboration tools. = Communication = Communication tools provide exchange of information between individuals: E-Mail The invention of email as a collaboration tool changed the way we used to communicate in the workplace. It is the easiest method to make contact within an organization and is well established. Especially for organizing daily correspondence, email can reach various people with just one click. Although email is still the most common used tool in communication collaboration it is not very efficient on a big scale and other forms of communication seem to take over. Besides its flexibility it is not very good for group conversations as they grow too fast. There is no way to be sure that a person has the latest version of a document that has been sent to them and it is impossible to always track via their email what tasks need to be done and by which deadline. As Cisco states in their Cisco Blog about the \\"Future of Email\\", emails \\"will improve productivity by organizing your data for you\\" and try to bring more transparency in their work with email.  Voicemail  Voicemail as a collaboration tool is more and more integrated in services such as Google Voice. As pointed out in an IBM future scenario the role of voicemail could be that of what email is for us today.  Instant messaging (IM)  Through instant messaging as a collaboration tool we are able to reach people within an organisation in real-time. In the future instant messaging is not a stand- alone software anymore, but very well integrated in bigger solutions such as Unified Communication.  VoIP (voice over IP) / video call  Voice over IP as a collaboration tool has quickly gained popularity among companies and is part of their communication portfolio. As a report from Eclipse Telecom is pointing out, the VoIP is moving towards the state to totally replace our telephones in our offices and also integrate in existing collaboration service environments. = Coordination = Coordination is defined as \\"the deliberate and orderly alignment or adjustment of partners‚Äô actions to achieve jointly determined goals\\". Collaboration tools supporting this are the ones who allow a person to set up group activities, schedules and deliverables.  Online Calendars  Online calendars are part of professional behaviour at work and fully integrated in other systems. As a research paper from University of Bath explains, online calendars could in the future be much closely linked to other data such as social media and have even a larger effect.  Time trackers  Time trackers are especially used to measure the performance of employees. Its effect on productivity is discussed as being controversial.  Spreadsheets  Spreadsheets are like emails very popular within the corporate environment and as a collaboration tool essential for financial analysis or modelling. Although very popular, several studies found out that many spreadsheets contain inaccurate data and are therefore inefficient. = Cooperation = Cooperation tools allow groups to have real-time discussions and to shape an idea or thought together. Trends in terms of collaboration target on helping to maintain the \\"main idea\\" within big organizations and make connections visible. Also the idea of bringing people who are not working in a company on a regular basis into the organization and make use of their knowledge.  Video conferencing  In most cases video conferencing is part of the overall communication and collaboration strategy of organisations. Especially now when all services are cloud-based and therefore implementation costs became more affordable. The longterm vision for video conferencing lies in the correct usage of computer processing power, data storage or mobile bandwidth speeds to further decrease the obstacles of collaboration.  IM teleconferencing  Bringing teams, meetings or events as close as possible is what teleconferencing solutions want to do. Apart from business environments Teleconferencing is currently used in a variety of fields, such as telemedicine, where they contribute enormously to the efficiency and productivity as distance and time are limited factors.  Classification based on dimensions = Asynchronous collaboration tools = A collaboration tool is asynchronous when its users are collaborating at a different time:  E-Mail, mailinglists and newsgroups  E-Mail is the best known asynchronous collaboration tool and the most common used \\\\- it offers intuitive features for forwarding messages, creating mailing groups and attaching documents. Furthermore, information can be automatically chronologically sorted and assigned to tasks or calendar events.  Group calendar  Through group calendars meetings can be scheduled, projects managed and people coordinated. It is a great tool to help a person overlook their deliverables and deadlines. A group calendar includes functions such as the detection of conflicting schedules with other people in a team or organization or coordination of meeting times that suit everybody in a team. Besides the positive effects of group calendar there is also controversy about privacy and control that might influence a person's productivity.  Workflow systems  With workflow systems files or documents can be communicated to the organization by following a strict and organised process. They provide services for routing, development of forms and support for roles. As current workflow systems are controlled from one point, individuals within an organization normally do not have the permission to manage their own processes so far - this should be changed by implementing collaborative planning tools to current workflow systems.  Hypertext  Hypertext technology connects our files to each other and makes sure that always the latest version is available to us. When people work on different documents the system automatically updates the information of other people. = Synchronous collaboration tools = A room designed to encourage collaboration. A collaboration tool is synchronous, when its users are collaborating at the same time:  Shared whiteboards  Shared whiteboards give its users the capability to work efficiently on a task through a web-based platform. They can be used for informal discussions and also for communications that need structure, involve drawing or are in general more sophisticated. This might also be very useful in to realise virtual classrooms.  Video communication systems  Video communication systems offer two-way or multi-way calling with a live videostream. It can be best compared to a telephone system with an additional visual element.  Chat systems  Chat systems allow people to write and send messages in real- time. They are usually structured in chat rooms which show usernames, number of people, location, discussion topic and more.  Decision support systems  Decision support systems support groups to manage the decision making process. They give people the ability to exchange their brainstorming, analyzing their ideas and even are used for voting. Decision making is becoming more and more a core function of modern work. According to studies 50% of organizational decisions fail.  Multiplayer video games  Computer games are a good example of how a multi-user situation could look like in the future. They are constantly developed and expanded with features such as chat and video systems.  Online Collaboration Tools  Online collaboration tools are web-based applications that offer basic services such as instant messaging for groups, mechanisms for file sharing and collaborative search engines (CSE) to find information distributed within the system of the organization, community or team. Additionally, the functionality is sometimes further expanded by providing for example integrated online calendars, shared online-whiteboards to organize tasks and ideas or internet teleconferencing integrations. The focus of online collaboration tools ranges from simple to complex, inexpensive to expensive, locally installed to remotely hosted and from commercial to open source. = Background = New gadgets and devices are invented every day with the goal in mind to make our daily work easier. Online collaboration tools currently try to tackle problems like these: * '38% of employee time is lost duplicating work and 58% of people waste an hour a day looking for information'. * '28 hours a week is spent on writing e-mails, searching for information and collaborating internally'. * '59% of managers miss vital information because they cannot find it or never see it'. * 'Six weeks per year are wasted by executives searching for lost documents'. These aspects point out that the problem we are facing is not a technological problem - it is about people and their interactions. Although technology really helps us in this way, the key to solve these problems can be found in the way how we use these tools. Although video conferencing tools such as Skype or FaceTime connect us with everyone, they do not always give us all the contextual information. What we see might not be the reality, as there might be other people in the room that one does not know about while skyping with one's colleagues at work. More connectivity also allows more interruption: A person can work from home but is always interrupted by their neighbours or the lawnmower. This is why the future of collaboration tools looks for models that allow companies to collaborate in a focused and structured manner. One such application is the Finnish company Fingertip Ltd, which enables companies to facilitate collaboration and decision making. = Evolvement = From simple communication solutions to Unified Communications (UC)  The way we communicate with each other is constantly changing and disrupts our workplace environment. In 1971 programmer Ray Tomlinson sent the first message between two computers. Eight years later Usenet, a multi-network online forum, changed the way how we exchange information. With IRC in 1986, instant-messaging and group chatting became accessible for non-technical users for the first time and after the launch of AOL/AIM in 1992 we already faced the first global community. The invention of Wikipedia in 2001 and various social networks (MySpace, Linkedin and Facebook) forms a community that is connected to the digital world, globally oriented and willing to use collaboration tools not only for social interaction, but to enhance the efficiency at the workplace.  From local to global - the needs of a global workforce  Apart from enhancing our efficiency, online collaboration tools face the change that organizations operate globally and the application of flexible working becomes even more important. Collaborative working environments are one of the drivers of the corporate globalization as they offer new business opportunities through innovation and help to and allow to collect knowledge from all over the world. Especially SME‚Äôs and large organizations are capable to do business on a global scale by using them. Since 1950 the intensity of collaboration has extremely risen, the flow of information has become faster and the needed skills to carry out work has dramatically increased. Online collaboration tools therefore enable companies to survive in their globally oriented industries. IBM conducted a study with CIO‚Äôs of organizations to find out which trends will most affect business in 2010, coming up with six main points: # The participatory internet # Changing workforce demographics # The rise of software as a service # The virtualization of data and devices # Increasing of simplicity of technology‚Äôs design and use All of these points are stressing the importance of collaboration and define certain requirements for the future of online collaboration tools in order to consistently enable a wide business collaboration. Online collaboration tools such as social networking websites and web conferencing are demonstrating how fast the environment is changing ‚Äì ‚Äúby 2010, the average salaried worker will actively participate in at least five different ad hoc teams simultaneously‚Äù. When asking participants of ‚ÄúThe New Global Study‚Äù, a report done by the European Commission in 2009, about the benefits of online collaboration, the following three points were mentioned most: # Supports coordination within a team (73% of respondents) # Supports knowledge and learning (69%) # Allows dispersed team-members to be a better part within the team  See also  * List of collaborative software * Collaborative software * Cloud collaboration * Document collaboration * Mass collaboration * Collaborative project management * Virtual collaboration  References  Collaboration Collaborative software ","title":"Collaboration tool"},{"id":"624666","text":"Generally, a partition is a division of a whole into non-overlapping parts.

It is used to supplement normal sleep, especially when a sleeper has accumulated a sleep deficit. Various durations are recommended for power naps, which are very short compared to regular sleep.

Depending on duration and intensity, awakenings out of SWS results in sleep inertia, a phenomenon associated with grogginess, disorientation, and even more fatigue than prior to napping. Since sleep is the most effective and beneficial recovery method from fatigue, experts recommend considering duration vs. risk of entering SWS. Benefits Power naps restore alertness, performance, and learning ability. A nap may also reverse the hormonal impact of a night of poor sleep or reverse the damage of sleep deprivation. A University of D√ºsseldorf study found superior memory recall once a person had reached 6 minutes of sleep, suggesting that the onset of sleep may initiate active memory processes of consolidation which‚Äîonce triggered‚Äîremains effective even if sleep is terminated. According to clinical studies among men and women, power nappers of any frequency or duration had a significantly lower coronary mortality ratio (MR) than those not napping. Specifically, those occasionally napping had a 12% lower coronary mortality, whereas those systematically napping had a 37% lower coronary mortality. A Flinders University study of individuals restricted to only five hours of sleep per night found a 10-minute nap was overall the most recuperative nap duration of various nap lengths they examined (lengths of 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 30 minutes): the 5-minute nap produced few benefits in comparison with the no-nap control; the 10-minute nap produced immediate improvements in all outcome measures (including sleep latency, subjective sleepiness, fatigue, vigor, and cognitive performance), with some of these benefits maintained for as long as 155 minutes; the 20-minute nap was associated with improvements emerging 35 minutes after napping and lasting up to 125 minutes after napping; and the 30-minute nap produced a period of impaired alertness and performance immediately after napping, indicative of sleep inertia, followed by improvements lasting up to 155 minutes after the nap. The NASA Ames Fatigue Countermeasures Group studied the effects of sleep loss and jet lag, and conducts training to counter these effects. A major fatigue countermeasures recommendation consists of a 40-minute nap (\\"NASA nap\\") which empirically showed to improve flight crew performance and alertness with a 22% statistical risk of entering SWS. For several years, scientists have been investigating the benefits of napping, both the power nap and much longer sleep durations as long as 1‚Äì2 hours. Performance across a wide range of cognitive processes has been tested. Studies demonstrate that naps are as good as a night of sleep for some types of memory tasks. A NASA study led by David F. Dinges, professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, found that naps can improve certain memory functions. In that NASA study, volunteers spent several days living on one of 18 different sleep schedules, all in a laboratory setting. To measure the effectiveness of the naps, tests probing memory, alertness, response time, and other cognitive skills were used. Power Napping Enablers and sleep timers allow properly timed power napping. The National Institute of Mental Health funded a team of doctors, led by Alan Hobson, MD, Robert Stickgold, PhD, and colleagues at Harvard University for a study which showed that a midday snooze reverses information overload. Reporting in Nature Neuroscience, Sara Mednick, PhD, Stickgold and colleagues also demonstrated that \\"burnout\\" irritation, frustration and poorer performance on a mental task can set in as a day of training wears on. This study also proved that, in some cases, napping could even boost performance to an individual's top levels. The NIMH team wrote: \\"The bottom line is: we should stop feeling guilty about taking that 'power nap' at work.\\" Sara Mednick conducted a study experimenting on the effects of napping, caffeine, and a placebo. Her results showed that a 60‚Äì90-minute nap is more effective than caffeine in memory and cognition.Mednick, S. C. et al. (2008). Comparing the benefits of caffeine, naps, and placebo on verbal, motor and perceptual memory. Behavioural Brain Research. 193: 79-86. Stimulant nap A coffee nap is drinking a cup of coffee before a short 15-minute nap. A brief period of sleep of around 15 to 20 minutes, preceded by consuming a caffeinated drink or another stimulant, may combat daytime drowsiness more effectively than napping or drinking coffee alone. A stimulant nap (or coffee nap, caffeine nap, occasionally nappuccino) was discovered by British researchers, Horne and Reyner, to be more effective than regular naps in improving post-nap alertness and cognitive functioning. In a driving simulator and a series of studies, Horne and Reyner investigated the effects of cold air, radio, a break with no nap, a nap, caffeine pill vs. placebo and a short nap preceded by caffeine on mildly sleep-deprived subjects. A nap with caffeine was by far the most effective in reducing driving accidents and subjective sleepiness as it helps the body get rid of the sleep-inducing chemical compound adenosine. Caffeine in coffee takes up to half an hour to have an alerting effect, hence \\"a short (<15min) nap will not be compromised if it is taken immediately after the coffee.\\" One account suggested that it was like a \\"double shot of energy\\" from the stimulating boost from caffeine plus better alertness from napping. This procedure has been studied on sleep-deprived humans given the task of driving a motor vehicle afterwards, although it has not been studied on elderly populations. Nap rooms and tech aided naps EnergyPod, a sleeping pod, located in a small nap room of the Olin library at Wesleyan University Some companies have nap rooms to allow employees to take power naps. This may be in a form of a nap room with a recliner, or chairs specially designed for power napping installed in a designated area. Companies with nap rooms say that employees are happier and become more productive at work. Similar nap rooms and stations also exist in higher education institutions. Many colleges and universities provide napping furnitures such as cots and giant bean bags in libraries for students to take naps after long periods of study. At least one university has a nap room set up in a gym. Some medical schools also set up nap rooms at teaching hospitals. The nap rooms may include sleeping pods or cots, white noise machines, and antimicrobial pillows.

It runs southwards from the River Wey at Shalford, Surrey to the River Arun at Pallingham, in West Sussex. The canal comprises parts of two separate undertakings - the northern part of the Arun Navigation, opened in 1787 between Pallingham and Newbridge Wharf, and the Wey and Arun Junction Canal, opened in 1816, which connected the Arun at Newbridge to the Godalming Navigation near Shalford, south of Guildford. The canal was built with 26 locks. Passing through a rural landscape, there was little freight traffic to justify its continued existence - the canal was officially abandoned in 1871. Without maintenance, the canal gradually became derelict over much of its length. However, since 1970, restoration by The Wey & Arun Canal Trust has led to several miles being restored to the standard navigable by narrowboats and small tour barges. Work is continuing, with the ultimate aim of reopening the entire canal to navigation. Arun Navigation The River Arun was used in an unimproved condition for centuries, but work was carried out on the river itself and the port of Arundel in the 16th century, which allowed boats to reach Pallingham Quay against the north of the parish of Pulborough by 1575.https://www.achurchnearyou.com/search/?lat=50.99&lon;=-0.52 Parish Map: at approximate point of Pallingham Quay showing border of Pulborough and Wisborough Green being the river. An Act of Parliament received the Royal Assent on 13 May 1785, entitled \\"An Act for amending and improving the Navigation of the River Arun, from Houghton Bridge, in the parish of Houghton, in the county of Sussex, to Pallenham Wharf, in the parish of Wisborough Green, in the said county; and for continuing and extending the Navigation of the said River Arun, from the said Wharf, called Pallenham Wharf, to a certain Bridge, called New Bridge, situate in the parishes of Pulborough and Wisborough Green, in the said county of Sussex\\". Baldwin's Knob Lock: lock number 4 on the Wey and Arun Canal Houghton Bridge was the absolute tidal limit; Newbridge lay much closer south-west of foundry-rich Billingshurst than to Pulborough. The route involved a new artificial cut of alongside the river, crossing the river by an aqueduct on three strong brick arches at Lordings Lock before its north end. Completed in 1787, an undershot waterwheel of a design unique in British waterways was built into the aqueduct. Driven by the flow of the river this had scoops on the back of the blades which raised some water into the canal. A shortcut cut was added in 1790 from Coldwaltham to Stopham, including a 375-yard (343 m) tunnel under Hardham Hill, which avoided the meander of the parish of Hardham (facing the south of Pulborough), saving . The route from Newbridge down to Houghton became with six locks. The river continues a further to the sea at Littlehampton. The last barge to ascend between Pallingham to Newbridge was recorded in 1888. Hardham tunnel closed in 1889. The cuts were officially abandoned in 1896, but some traffic continued on the old by-river cuts into the 20th century, notably bricks from Harwoods Green below Pallingham and chalk from Houghton Bridge; most south coastal traffic was stopped in 1938 by a new, fixed bridge on the Havant to Brighton railway line at Ford. Wey and Arun Junction Canal The first scheme to link the Wey and the Arun was proposed in 1641. Headwaters of the rivers were apart, and a canal to bridge them down to a navigable upper reach was submitted as a bill to Parliament, but was dropped when it reached the committee stage. Another scheme, to tie in, additionally, the Adur and Mole was suggested in 1663, but was not pursued. In 1810, the 3rd Earl of Egremont began to promote the idea of a canal to link the Wey and Arun, the case being they were separated by 15 miles (24 km). Part of the justification for this canal through these overwhelmingly rural counties, with few of the cargoes which made canals profitable, was to provide an inland route from London to Portsmouth and the south coast of England, an important consideration as England was at war with France and thus coastal shipping at risk of attack. Josias Jessop (son of the more well known William Jessop) was appointed consulting engineer in 1811. It was his first job as an independent consulting engineer since he had established his reputation constructing Bristol Harbour. He made an estimate of ¬£72,217 for construction of the canal, which he increased to ¬£86,132 in May 1812, when he re-surveyed the route and part of it was changed. A survey was carried out in 1811 by Francis and Netlam Giles for an alternative, long, from the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway at Merstham to Newbridge, via Three Bridges, Crawley and Horsham. A petition was presented to Parliament, but the scheme got no further. An Act of Parliament received the Royal Assent on 19 April 1813, entitled \\"An Act for making and maintaining a navigable Canal, to unite the Rivers Wey and Arun, in the counties of Surrey and Sussex\\". This authorised the construction of the canal from the Godalming Navigation (an extension of the River Wey) near Shalford, south of Guildford to the northern terminus of the Arun Navigation at Newbridge. May Upton was appointed resident engineer in July, and work began. Jessop designed all the main structures, including aqueducts, bridges, locks and cottages for the lock-keepers. The canal was long, had 23 locks and was suitable for 30-ton barges. Construction was completed in September 1816, having cost ¬£103,000. By the time it was opened, however, the war with France was over and thus one of the key reasons for its construction was removed. As a result, it was never very prosperous, but did reasonably well. Its record maximum: 23,000 tons was carried in 1839. However, railway competition hit hard in 1865 with the opening of the Guildford and Horsham Railway, which was in much competition with the canal. There were also engineering problems with few sources of water to tap into, compounded by porous subsoils at summit level, which led to water shortages. In 1867, some tourists cruised the canal whose trip was the subject of a book called The Thames to the Solent by Canal and Sea, which was published in 1868 by J. B. Dashwood, the same year in which an Act of Parliament authorised closure. The canal was offered for sale in 1870, but officially abandoned in 1871, with the land sold to many along its route, although the canal company was not wound up until 1910. Restoration Brewhurst lock undergoing restoration After a century of disuse, restoration began by The Wey & Arun Canal Trust. Interest in the canal was sparked by the publication in 1965 of P.A.L. Vine's book London's Lost Route to the Sea. As a result, the Daily Telegraph weekend magazine carried a 5-page article about the canal. In 1968, a local group of enthusiasts became interested in the canal, and having carried out some research into its history, formed the Wey & Arun Canal Society in 1970, with a view to reopening it. The Society evolved into The Wey & Arun Canal Trust in 1973, a private company limited by guarantee with no share capital, the present custodians of the canal restoration. In 1990, the restoration was identified by the Inland Waterways Association's Restoration Committee as one of those where significant progress was being made, and which would benefit from the backing of the Association. The Waterway Recovery Group, which gave active support to restoration schemes, developed a strategy of \\"a guaranteed labour force for guaranteed work\\" in 1992, which ensured that local societies would have the funding and relevant planning permission in place before a group of volunteers arrived to carry out the work. The Wey and Arun Canal was one of three schemes where working parties were run in this way. The practical outworking of this approach was demonstrated in the following year, when a section of the canal at Billingshurst was cleared, and three accommodation bridges were rebuilt by a working party of 250 people, as part of a Waterway Recovery Group initiative called \\"Dig Deep\\". The Trust has reached agreements with several landowners to allow restoration work to be undertaken over half the length of the canal. By 2009, twenty-four bridges had been reconstructed, eleven locks restored, two aqueducts re-instated, and several miles of canal bed cleared and dredged. The Lordings Lock waterwheel was reconstructed by Winston Harwood during the first decade of the 21st century. In 2010 the main spindle of the wheel broke and the wheel was rebuilt to a more effective design. Having completed a multimillion-pound B2133 road bridge-centred project (see below), restoration has continued northwards. Devil's Hole Lock (lock 6) had been partially destroyed by the Canadian army as part of a training exercise in 1942. It has been rebuilt and extended to take narrow boats. The lock was reopened on 17 April 2010, and the opening ceremony was carried out by Colonel Paul Rutherford, the Senior Army Adviser to the Canadian High Commissioner. Southland Lock (lock 7) required significant rebuilding, as many of the original bricks were removed in the 1930s, to be re-used by a local religious order. The lock was reopened on 21 June 2014 by Simon Carter, a local landowner with land adjoining this section of the canal. Working parties have since concentrated on the building of Gennets Bridge Lock (lock 8), a major exercise requiring the construction of a new concrete shell, faced with locally made bricks, and a bridge for a bridleway as nothing was left of the original lock structure. Southland Lock is the current northern limit of navigation on the restored section, some from Drungewick Lock (lock 3) in the south. A photo-history of the canal's restoration to date and the latest progress reports may be found on the Trust's website. =The B2133 Bridge= The new Loxwood Lock, under construction, in May 2006 The hump-backed road bridge at Loxwood was removed and in-filled in 1905, (to be confirmed) severing the canal in two and leaving a major obstacle to restoration. The last boat passed under the bridge in 1869. Modern regulations prevented the installation of a replacement hump- backed bridge, so restoration required the canal to burrow underneath, leaving the road at its existing level. This was a major engineering exercise, achieved by lowering a length of canal so that there is adequate headroom for a boat to pass under the road. At the southern end of the length, Brewhurst Lock was reconstructed reducing its fall to from the original drop of , and hence lowering the level of the water in the pound crossed by the bridge. At the other end, a new lock (Loxwood Lock) was constructed, to provide for the difference between the new and original levels of the canal. In between, the canal bed was lowered by , the banks shored up with piling, and a new winding hole created. The new bridge crosses the canal on a skew angle, the resulting 'tunnel' through which the canal passes measures . The towpath runs through the tunnel, alongside the canal, and also allows pedestrians to cross the road safely; however, the restricted bridge height means horse riders must cross at road level. Suitable access pathways had to be designed-in as the towpath is a bridleway at this point. The work was completed, and the first boat passed under the new bridge into the new Loxwood Lock in April 2009. The project cost ¬£1.8 million, making it one of the most expensive projects to be undertaken by a volunteer canal trust, and was officially opened by Lord Sterling of Plaistow on 9 May. The Canal Trust website includes a comprehensive photo- diary of the construction work. The completed Loxwood Lock The design of the bridge was not appreciated by many of the residents of Loxwood, because of its steel barriers, and following a period of consultation and fund-raising, planning permission was obtained to replace them with lower, brick-faced parapets, to match the adjacent lock and footbridge. The lock and footbridge achieved second place in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Community Benefit Awards in 2010. The Trust's success was particularly welcome, as it was the only entry in the category by a voluntary organisation, rather than a professional one. The scheme, which cost ¬£1.9 million, was also the winner in the Community category of the 2011 Waterways Renaissance Awards. The Awards are made annually by the Waterways Trust.

A highly appreciated associate and friend of Tsar Peter the Great, he was the de facto ruler of Russia for two years. Early life Portrait of Menshikov by Michiel van Musscher (1698) Menshikov was born on in Moscow. Historian Paul Bushkovitch argues that Menshikov was not an aristocrat and was most likely descended from servants of the palace stables, who among others made up the first soldiers of Peter's 'toy armies.' P. Bushkovitch, Peter the Great. The Struggle for Power, 1671-1725 (Cambridge 2001) p. 182 As the legend (dating from around 1710) goes, he was making a living on the streets of Moscow as a vendor of stuffed buns known as pirozhkiAnne Volokh. The Art of Russian Cuisine. Collier Books, New York, 1983. p.289 at the age of twenty. His fine appearance and witty character caught the attention of Franz Lefort, Peter's first favourite, who took him into his service and finally transferred him to the tsar. On the death of Lefort in 1699, Menshikov succeeded him as Peter's prime favourite and confidant. He took an active part in the Azov campaigns (1695‚Äì1696) against the Ottoman Empire. During the tsar's first foreign tour in the next year, Menshikov worked by his side in the dockyard of Amsterdam, and acquired a thorough knowledge of shipbuilding and colloquial Dutch and German. He acted as subordinate to Boris Sheremetev, who was commander-in-chief during the retreat before Charles XII in 1708, subsequently participating in the battle of Holowczyn, the reduction of Mazepa, and the crowning victory of Poltava (), where he won his field-marshal's baton. Corruption Around 1706 he had a conflict with Andrew Vinius; Vinius lost all of his land and goods. From 1709 to 1714 he served during the Courland, Holstein and Pomeranian campaigns, but then, as governor-general of Ingria, with almost unlimited powers, was entrusted with a leading part in the civil administration. Menshikov understood perfectly the principles on which Peter's reforms were conducted and was the right hand of the tsar in all his gigantic undertakings. But he abused his powerful position, and his corrupt practices frequently brought him to the verge of ruin. Every time the tsar returned to Russia he received fresh accusations of plunder against \\"his Serene Highness.\\" Peter's first serious outburst of indignation (March 1711) was due to the prince's looting in Poland. On his return to Russia in 1712, Peter discovered that Menshikov had turned a blind eye to wholesale corruption in his own governor-generalship. Peter warned him \\"for the last time\\" to change his ways. Yet, in 1713, he was implicated in the \\"Solovey process\\", in the course of which it was demonstrated that he had defrauded the government of 100,000 roubles. He only owed his life on this occasion to a sudden illness. On his recovery Peter's fondness for his friend overcame his sense of justice. In 1714 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In the last year of Peter's reign new allegations of fraud by Menshikov came to light, and he was obliged to appeal for protection to the empress Catherine. It was chiefly through the efforts of Menshikov and his colleague Tolstoi that, on the death of Peter, in 1725, Catherine was raised to the throne. Menshikov was committed to the Petrine system, and he recognised that, if that system were to continue, Catherine was, at that particular time, the only possible candidate. Her name was a watchword for the progressive faction. The placing of her on the throne meant a final victory over ancient prejudices, a vindication of the new ideas of progress, and not least security for Menshikov and his ill-gotten fortune. Supremacy and disgrace Menshikov with his children in Exile; by Vasily Surikov. During Catherine's short reign (February 1725May 1727), Menshikov was practically the absolute ruler of Russia. He promoted himself to the unprecedented rank of Generalissimus,\\"Menschikow und Stalin waren die einzigen Heerf√ºhrer der russischen Geschichte, die sich \\"Generalissimus\\" nennen lie√üen.\\" [Menshikov and Stalin were the only military leaders in Russian history who declared themselves 'generalissimus']. Jena, Detlev (1996): Die russischen Zaren in Lebensbildern, Graz, p. 520. and was the only Russian to bear a ducal title. Upon finishing the construction of the Menshikov Palace on the Neva Embankment in St Petersburg (now assigned to the Hermitage Museum), Menshikov intended to make Oranienbaum a capital of his ephemeral duchy. Pushkin in one of his poems alluded to Menshikov as \\"half-tsar\\". On the whole he ruled well, his difficult position serving as some restraint upon his natural inclinations. He contrived to prolong his power after Catherine's death by means of a forged will and a coup d'√©tat. While his colleague Peter Tolstoi would have raised Elizabeth Petrovna to the throne, Menshikov set up the youthful Peter II, son of the tsarevich Alexei, with himself as dictator during the prince's minority. He now aimed at establishing himself definitely by marrying his daughter Mary to Peter II. But the old nobility, represented by the Dolgorukovs and the Galitzines, united to overthrow him, and he was deprived of all his dignities and offices and expelled from the capital (). Subsequently, he was deprived of his enormous wealth, stripped of the titles, and he and his whole family were banished to Beryozovo in Siberia, where he died on . His wife Darya Mikhailovna (born Arseneva) died on their way into exile in 1728 near Kazan. According to Simon Sebag Montefiore in his book The Romanovs 1613‚Äì1918 Menshikov was once punched twice by Tsar Peter the Great, once in the nose and once on the side of the head, after Tsar Peter saw Menshikov dancing with his sword still on, considered highly rude and offensive. In Beryozovo Menshikov built a wooden church. He buried his daughter who died in exile there. Menshikov's younger children survived the exile and were eventually returned to the court.

New York & London: Garland Publishing, Inc. 1994 (1992) =Student uses= Students often highlight passages in books in order to refer back to key phrases easily, or add marginalia to aid studying. Annotated bibliographies add commentary on the relevance or quality of each source, in addition to the usual bibliographic information that merely identifies the source. =Mathematical expression annotation= Mathematical expressions (symbols and formulae) can be annotated with their natural language meaning. This is essential for disambiguation, since symbols may have different meanings (e.g., \\"E\\" can be \\"energy\\" or \\"expectation value\\", etc.). The annotation process can be facilitated and accelerated through recommendation, e.g., using the \\"AnnoMathTeX\\" system that is hosted by Wikimedia. =Learning and instruction = From a cognitive perspective annotation has an important role in learning and instruction. As part of guided noticing it involves highlighting, naming or labelling and commenting aspects of visual representations to help focus learners' attention on specific visual aspects. In other words, it means the assignment of typological representations (culturally meaningful categories), to topological representations (e.g. images).Pea, R. D. (2006).

Both the federal United States Code and state statutes are subject to interpretation by the courts, and the annotated statutes are valuable tools in legal research. =Linguistics= One purpose of annotation is to transform the data into a form suitable for computer-aided analysis. Prior to annotation, an annotation scheme is defined that consists of tags. During tagging, transcriptionists manually add tags into transcripts where required linguistical features are identified in an annotation editor. The annotation scheme ensures that the tags are added consistently across the data set and allows for verification of previously tagged data. The Linguistic Annotation Wiki also describes formats for creating and managing linguistic annotations.

Uys also directed the 1974 documentary film Animals Are Beautiful People. Early life Before his foray into film, Uys was a mathematics teacher in his hometown of Boksburg. He then married Hettie, a fellow mathematics teacher and the couple started farming and opening trading posts along the Palala River. He was later appointed local magistrate and Justice of the Peace. In an interview, he stated, \\"Every Tuesday I crossed the wildest country and swam through rivers to get to the police post where I could hold court\\". Career He made his debut as a film director in 1951 with the Afrikaans-language film Daar doer in die bosveld. He directed 24 films. He founded a company with Tommie Meyer but later they split up. Uys received the 1981 Grand Prix at the Festival International du Film de Comedy Vevey for The Gods Must Be Crazy, and in 1974 he received the Hollywood Foreign Press Association award for best documentary for Animals Are Beautiful People. Animals Are Beautiful People is about the plant and animal life in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, especially desert creatures. A highlight of the film includes a scene with elephants, warthogs, monkeys and other animals staggering around after eating rotten, fermented marula fruit. Jamie Uys's most financially successful and well-known film is The Gods Must Be Crazy, a comedy first released in 1980. The film features a San farmer named N!xau in the lead role. Its plot concerns a Coca-Cola bottle that was thrown out of an airplane, fell into the Kalahari Desert and was found by a San tribe. As this was the only \\"modern\\" object in their world, it led to strife and it was decided that the bottle had to be returned to the Gods, who must have sent it in the first place. The character played by N!xau was given the task to return it. The movie generated extensive word-of-mouth success in Europe, Japan and North America, with the movie rights initially being sold to 45 countries. It spawned a less successful sequel, The Gods Must Be Crazy II. Uys had earlier made another film set substantially in the Kalahari Desert: Lost in the Desert, which tells the story of 8-year-old Dirkie Hayes's efforts to survive in the desert after surviving a plane crash, whilst his father Anton mounts increasingly desperate efforts to find him. As well as directing the film, Jamie Uys also played the part of Anton, and his son Wynand Uys played the part of Dirkie. Some early sources and credits name the director and actor of Anton's part as Jamie Hayes, and name Wynand Uys as Dirkie Hayes, but the relatively recent DVD release of the movie is attributed to their real names. Uys's other well-known film was Funny People in 1977, which was a comedy in the same genre as Candid Camera in the United States, putting unsuspecting people in embarrassing positions. These included a talking postbox, with the voice of a man claiming to be trapped inside, who asks a passerby for help. When the passerby returns with his friends, the 'talking' postbox is silent, and his friends accuse him of being drunk. The sequel, Funny People II, was released in 1983, and features a young Arnold Vosloo who later found fame in Hollywood. Uys loved the outdoors and to get away from the hubbub of Johannesburg where he lived. He had a modest A-frame dwelling at Paradise Beach (262, Die Heide St), a quiet coastal resort 5 km west of the surfers' paradise Jeffreys Bay (Eastern Cape). It was about 300 metres from the sea and for most of the years it had no electricity - only paraffin lamps and (later) gas lights. He at times would slip away to his favourite holiday retreat where he was seen collecting plant specimens, as a very keen amateur botanist who had his own herbarium. Uys would ride around on his bicycle to get to interesting spots in the veld. He also was a keen builder of model aeroplanes, on which he spent many hours during his Paradise Beach visits. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he had a luxurious house built on the beachfront, a couple of hundred metres away from his old A-frame. Uys died of a heart attack in 1996 at the age of 74.

It is mainly known for medieval Hohenwerfen Castle and the Eisriesenwelt ice cave, the largest in the world. Geography Aerial view of the Salzach valley Werfen is located in the northwest of the historic Pongau region, about south of the city of Salzburg. The settlement is situated in the Salzach valley south of the Lueg Pass, between the Berchtesgaden Alps (Hagen Mountains and the Hochk√∂nig massif) in the west and the Tennen Mountains in the east. The Salzburg-Tyrol Railway line (Giselabahn) and the Tauern Autobahn run parallel to the river. The region is known as the type locality of the geologic Werfen Formation, a Triassic stone layer of the Limestone Alps. The municipality comprises the cadastral communities (Katastralgemeinden) of Reitsam, Scharten, Sulzau, Werfen Markt, and Wimm. History Important trade routes passed through the Salzach valley since ancient times, when the area was part of the Roman Noricum province. Werven was first mentioned about 1140 AD. The settlement arose south of Hohenwerfen Castle, erected from 1075 at the behest of the Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg during the Investiture Controversy with King Henry IV of Germany. It is one of the oldest markets in the former Archbishopric of Salzburg, with market privileges documented since 1425. At about the same time, the nearby parish of Pfarrwerfen was established, like the neighbouring settlement of Werfenweng in the east. Parish church As the seat of the local administration, Werfen and the castle were heavily attacked during the German Peasants' War in 1525/26. From 1675 onwards, numerous people in the environment of the local knacker Barbara Koller and her son Jakob were sentenced and executed in the Zaubererjackl witch trials. Werfen was also a centre of the expulsion of Salzburg Protestants under the rule of Prince-Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian in 1731. In the late 18th century, a large limonite deposit was developed in Sulzau, which from 1770 became the most important ironworks (Konkordiah√ºtte) in the Salzburg archbishopric. With the lands of the secularised prince-archbishopric, Werfen finally fell to the Austrian Empire by resolution of the Vienna Congress in 1816. The Salzburg-Tyrol Railway line from Salzburg to W√∂rgl opened in 1875, with stations in Sulzau, Tenneck, and Werfen. The secluded above the village of Tenneck is the site of the Baroque , a former hunting lodge of Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau, which in 1908 was acquired by Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. After the archduke's assassination in 1914, the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty sold the castle to the German Krupp industrial magnates. The Krupp dynasty held the premises until the death of Arndt von Bohlen und Halbach in 1986, today the estates are privately owned by Frederick R. Koch. A small portion of a picnic scene from The Sound of Music was filmed on a hillside of the village of Werfen. Julie Andrews and crew filmed the opening shots of the \\"Do-Re-Mi\\" sequence with Hohenwerfen Castle in the background.See \\"The Sound of Music Filming Locations\\" at The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations. http://www.movie- locations.com/intromovies/soundmusic.html.

The fortress is surrounded by the Berchtesgaden Alps and the adjacent Tennen Mountains. Hohenwerfen is a \\"sister\\" of Hohensalzburg Fortress, both built by the Archbishops of Salzburg in the 11th century. History Night view The fortification was built between 1075 and 1078 at the behest of Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg during the Imperial Investiture Controversy, meant as a strategic bulwark atop a high rock. Gebhard, an ally of Pope Gregory VII and the anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden, had three major castles extended to secure the route across the Eastern Alps along the Salzach river against the forces of King Henry IV of Germany: Hohenwerfen, Hohensalzburg and Petersberg Castle at Friesach in Carinthia. Nevertheless, King Henry had Gebhard expelled in 1077 and the archbishop could not return to Salzburg until 1086, only to die at Hohenwerfen two years later. Johann Michael Sattler: Festung Hohenwerfen, 1827/28 In the following centuries Hohenwerfen served Salzburg's rulers, the prince-archbishops, not only as a military base but also as a residence and hunting retreat. The fortress was extended in the 12th century and to a lesser extent again in the 16th century during the German Peasants' War, when in 1525 and 1526 riotous farmers and miners from the south of Salzburg moved towards the city, laying fire and severely damaging the castle. Shot from the castle, overlooking the gardens. 2019 Courtyard. 2019 Cannons Alternatively it was used as a state prison and therefore had a somewhat sinister reputation. Its prison walls have witnessed the tragic fate of many 'criminals' who spent their days there ‚Äì maybe their last ‚Äì under inhumane conditions, and, periodically, various highly ranked noblemen have also been imprisoned there including rulers such as Archbishop Adalbert III, arrested by his own ministeriales in 1198; Count Albert of Friesach (in 1253); the Styrian governor Siegmund von Dietrichstein, captured by insurgent peasants in 1525; and Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau, who died here in 1617 after six years of imprisonment. In 1931 the fortress, owned by Archduke Eugen of Austria since 1898, was again damaged by a fire and, though largely restored, finally had to be sold to the Salzburg Reichsgau administration in 1938. In World War II, the castle served as a Gauf√ºhrerschule, a nazi education camp under Gauleiter administration. After the war it was used as a training camp by the Austrian Gendarmerie (rural police) until 1987. Currently, the bastion functions as a museum. Among the numerous attractions offered by the fortress are guided tours showing its extensive weapons collection, the historical Salzburg Falconry with the falconry museum as well as a fortress tavern. The historic Falconry Centre is a special attraction, offering daily flight demonstrations using various birds of prey, including eagles, falcons, hawks, and vultures.

His research included a determination of the difference in longitude of various locations in Europe, around the Mediterranean, and in North Africa. Early life Peiresc's father was a higher magistrate and city surgeon in Provence from a wealthy noble family, who with his wife fled their home town of Aix-en-Provence to avoid the plague raging there, settling in Belgentier in Var. Peiresc was born in Belgentier and educated in Aix-en-Provence, Avignon, and at the Jesuit college at Tournon. At Toulon, he first became interested in astronomy. Studying law and becoming interested in archaeology, he travelled to Italy, Switzerland and France in 1599, and finally finished his legal studies in 1604 at the University of Montpellier. It was also in 1604 that he assumed the name Peiresc after a domain in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence (now spelled Peyresq) which he had inherited from his father, although he himself never visited it. After receiving his degree, he travelled to Paris (in 1605‚Äì1606, with his patron Guillaume du Vair, president of the Parlement of Provence), London and Flanders before returning to Aix in 1607 to take over his uncle's position as conseiller in the Parlement of Provence under du Vair. He held this post until 1615. Intellectual and collector Terracotta bust of Peiresc by Jean- Jacques Caffieri in the Biblioth√®que Mazarine From 1615 until 1622, Peiresc again visited Paris with du Vair. He then returned to Provence to serve as senator of the sovereign court. He became a patron of science and art, studied fossils, and supported the astronomer Pierre Gassendi from 1634 to 1637. Virginio Cesarini proposed him for membership of the Accademia dei Lincei in 1621, but it is not certain whether he joined.http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/ItalianAcademies/PersonFullDisplay.aspx?RecordId=022-000005398&searchAssoc;=Assoc accessed 9/7/2017 Peiresc's position as a great intellectual at the time of the scientific revolution has led to his being called a \\"Prince of the Republic of Letters\\". He was also a noted politician in his home region, and a tireless letter-writer (10,000 of his letters survive, and he was in constant correspondence with Fran√ßois de Malherbe, Hugo Grotius, the brothers Dupuy, Alphonse-Louis du Plessis de Richelieu, and with his great friend Rubens. His correspondence to Malherbe throws light on the personality of Malherbe's troubled son Marc-Antoine Malherbe. Peiresc became one of the first admirers and supporters of Caravaggio in France. He first discovered Caravaggio's works in the Contarelli chapel in Rome in 1600 when he was only 20 years old.Dossier de Presse, Les caravages de Peiresc, Conf√©rence de Presse Organis√©e par la mairie de Cavaillon et l‚Äôassociation des amis de l‚ÄôH√¥tel d‚ÄôAgar (reconnue d‚Äôint√©r√™t g√©n√©ral). Cavaillon salle du conseil le 21 Mars 2019 In his hometown, he gathered around him a sort of 'caravaggesque workshop of Southern France' with artists including Flemish artist Louis Finson, Martin Hermann Faber, Trophime Bigot and other painters.Olivier Morand, Le Finson de Toulouse, 2019 He promoted the Caravaggesque style by arranging commissions for these artists. He was instrumental in obtaining a number of commissions for Finson, including for history paintings and portraits.Paul Smeets (editor) , Louis Finson, The four elements: The four elements Responsibility; R. Smeets, c. 2007 Finson also painted a portrait of de Peyresc. Peiresc was an avid art collector and relied on Finson's contacts in Italy to acquire two works of Caravaggio from the Pasqualini family of Rome. Peiresc's house in Aix-en-Provence was a veritable museum, and held a mix of antique sculptures, modern paintings, medals, books and gardens with exotic plants. He acquired the Byzantine Barberini ivory (it is not known how or from whom) and offered it to Francesco Barberini: the work is now in the Louvre. He had the Codex Luxemburgensis, the surviving Carolingian copy of the Chronography of 354 in his possession for many years; after his death it disappeared. He owned over 18,000 coins and medals, and was also an archaeologist, amateur artist, historian (he demonstrated that Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain set out not from Calais but from St Omer), Egyptologist, botanist, zoologist (studying chameleons, crocodiles, the elephant and the alzaron, a sort of Nubian gazelle with a bull-like head, now disappeared), physiologist, geographer (put on the project of linking Aix to Marseilles), and ecologist. Detail of Peiresc's notes recording his first observation of the Orion Nebula on 26 November 1610 Astronomer Peiresc was also an astronomer. In 1610 du Vair purchased a telescope, which Peiresc and Joseph Gaultier used for observing the skies, including Jupiter's moons; his courtly suggestion that individual names from the Medici family be applied to these \\"Medicean stars\\" was not taken up. Peiresc also made detailed observations of the Orion Nebula in 1610; Gaultier became the second person to see it in the telescope. To determine longitude with greater precision, he coordinated the observation of the lunar eclipses of 28 August 1635 right across the Mediterranean; this allowed him to work out that the Mediterranean sea was in fact 1,000 km shorter than had previously been thought. Peiresc also wrote letters to Galileo, Pierre Gassendi and Tommaso Campanella, two of whom he defended when they were arrested by the Inquisition. Final years Peiresc wrote an \\"abridged history of Provence\\", but died before editing it: it was only published (edited by Jacques Ferrier and Michel Feuillas) in 1982. With Gassendi's support, notably financially, he and the engraver Claude Mellan began to produce a map of the Moon's surface, but again Peiresc died before completing it. Peiresc died on 24 June 1637 in Aix-en-Provence. Works Peiresc's works include: *Histoire abr√©g√©e de Provence *Lettres √† Malherbe (1606‚Äì1628) *Traitez des droits et des libert√©s de l'Eglise gallicane (1639) *Vita Peireskii (1641) *M√©moires *Bulletin Rubens *Notes in√©dites de Peiresc sur quelques points d'histoire naturelle Bust of Peiresc in Aix-en-Provence Legacy A bronze bust of Peiresc stands on the square of the university in Aix-en-Provence, facing the cathedral of Saint Sauveur. His home near the palais de Justice was demolished to build the present Palais, and has completely disappeared. The village museum in Peyresq near Digne-les-Bains is wholly given over to his work. Peiresc was honored in 1935 by the naming of the lunar crater Peirescius (46.5S, 67.6E, 61 km diameter); and in 1993 by the naming of the asteroid 19226 Peiresc.

Usually, this involves additive or multiplicative persistence of an integer, which is how often one has to replace the number by the sum or product of its digits until one reaches a single digit. Because the numbers are broken down into their digits, the additive or multiplicative persistence depends on the radix. In the remainder of this article, base ten is assumed. The single-digit final state reached in the process of calculating an integer's additive persistence is its digital root. Put another way, a number's additive persistence counts how many times we must sum its digits to arrive at its digital root.  Examples  The additive persistence of 2718 is 2: first we find that 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18, and then that 1 + 8 = 9\\\\. The multiplicative persistence of 39 is 3, because it takes three steps to reduce 39 to a single digit: 39 ‚Üí 27 ‚Üí 14 ‚Üí 4\\\\. Also, 39 is the smallest number of multiplicative persistence 3\\\\.  Smallest numbers of a given multiplicative persistence  For a radix of 10, there is thought to be no number with a multiplicative persistence > 11: this is known to be true for numbers up to 1020000. The smallest numbers with persistence 0, 1, ... are: :0, 10, 25, 39, 77, 679, 6788, 68889, 2677889, 26888999, 3778888999, 277777788888899. The search for these numbers can be sped up by using additional properties of the decimal digits of these record-breaking numbers. These digits must be sorted, and, except for the first two digits, all digits must be 7, 8, or 9. There are also additional restrictions on the first two digits. Based on these restrictions, the number of candidates for n-digit numbers with record-breaking persistence is only proportional to the square of n, a tiny fraction of all possible n-digit numbers. However, any number that is missing from the sequence above would have multiplicative persistence > 11; such numbers are believed not to exist, and would need to have over 20,000 digits if they do exist. Smallest numbers of a given additive persistence The additive persistence of a number, however, can become arbitrarily large (proof: For a given number n, the persistence of the number consisting of n repetitions of the digit 1 is 1 higher than that of n). The smallest numbers of additive persistence 0, 1, ... are: :0, 10, 19, 199, 19999999999999999999999, ... The next number in the sequence (the smallest number of additive persistence 5) is 2 √ó 102√ó(1022 ‚àí 1)/9 ‚àí 1 (that is, 1 followed by 2222222222222222222222 9's). For any fixed base, the sum of the digits of a number is proportional to its logarithm; therefore, the additive persistence is proportional to the iterated logarithm.

It was originally established in 1904, and became part of UCL's biology department in 1996. The ancestor of the Galton Laboratory was the Eugenics Record Office founded by Francis Galton in 1904. In 1907 the Office was reconstituted as the Galton Eugenics Laboratory as part of UCL and under the direction of Karl Pearson the Professor of Applied Mathematics. Galton financed the Laboratory and on his death left UCL enough money to create a chair in National Eugenics which Pearson filled. The Laboratory published a series of memoirs and in 1925 Pearson created the Annals of Eugenics, which continues as the Annals of Human Genetics. The journal has always been edited at the Galton. Pearson was succeeded as Galton Professor by R. A. Fisher in 1934. The post-war Galton Professors were Lionel Penrose up to 1965, Harry Harris to 1976 and Bette Robson until 1994. J. B. S. Haldane held the Chair of Biometry here and was succeeded by C. A. B. Smith. The Galton Laboratory became part of the Department of Biology in UCL in 1996.

It is the low-energy limit of Compton scattering: the particle's kinetic energy and photon frequency do not change as a result of the scattering. This limit is valid as long as the photon energy is much smaller than the mass energy of the particle: u\\\\ll mc^2/h , or equivalently, if the wavelength of the light is much greater than the Compton wavelength of the particle. Description of the phenomenon In the low-energy limit, the electric field of the incident wave (photon) accelerates the charged particle, causing it, in turn, to emit radiation at the same frequency as the incident wave, and thus the wave is scattered. Thomson scattering is an important phenomenon in plasma physics and was first explained by the physicist J. J. Thomson. As long as the motion of the particle is non-relativistic (i.e. its speed is much less than the speed of light), the main cause of the acceleration of the particle will be due to the electric field component of the incident wave. In a first approximation, the influence of the magnetic field can be neglected. The particle will move in the direction of the oscillating electric field, resulting in electromagnetic dipole radiation. The moving particle radiates most strongly in a direction perpendicular to its acceleration and that radiation will be polarized along the direction of its motion. Therefore, depending on where an observer is located, the light scattered from a small volume element may appear to be more or less polarized. right The electric fields of the incoming and observed wave (i.e. the outgoing wave) can be divided up into those components lying in the plane of observation (formed by the incoming and observed waves) and those components perpendicular to that plane. Those components lying in the plane are referred to as \\"radial\\" and those perpendicular to the plane are \\"tangential\\". (It is difficult to make these terms seem natural, but it is standard terminology.) The diagram on the right depicts the plane of observation. It shows the radial component of the incident electric field, which causes the charged particles at the scattering point to exhibit a radial component of acceleration (i.e., a component tangent to the plane of observation). It can be shown that the amplitude of the observed wave will be proportional to the cosine of œá, the angle between the incident and observed waves. The intensity, which is the square of the amplitude, will then be diminished by a factor of cos2(œá). It can be seen that the tangential components (perpendicular to the plane of the diagram) will not be affected in this way. The scattering is best described by an emission coefficient which is defined as Œµ where Œµ dt dV dŒ© dŒª is the energy scattered by a volume element dV in time dt into solid angle dŒ© between wavelengths Œª and Œª+dŒª. From the point of view of an observer, there are two emission coefficients, Œµr corresponding to radially polarized light and Œµt corresponding to tangentially polarized light. For unpolarized incident light, these are given by: : \\\\varepsilon_t = \\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\sigma_t} 2 In : \\\\varepsilon_r = \\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\sigma_t} 2 In \\\\cos^2\\\\chi where n is the density of charged particles at the scattering point, I is incident flux (i.e. energy/time/area/wavelength) and \\\\sigma_t is the Thomson cross section for the charged particle, defined below. The total energy radiated by a volume element dV in time dt between wavelengths Œª and Œª+dŒª is found by integrating the sum of the emission coefficients over all directions (solid angle): : \\\\int\\\\varepsilon \\\\, d\\\\Omega = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} d\\\\varphi \\\\int_0^\\\\pi d\\\\chi (\\\\varepsilon_t + \\\\varepsilon_r) \\\\sin \\\\chi = I\\\\sigma_t n (2 + 2/3)\\\\pi^2 = I\\\\sigma_t n \\\\frac 8 3 \\\\pi^2. The Thomson differential cross section, related to the sum of the emissivity coefficients, is given by : \\\\frac{d\\\\sigma_t}{d\\\\Omega} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{q^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0mc^2}\\\\right)^2 \\\\frac{1+\\\\cos^2\\\\chi} 2 expressed in SI units; q is the charge per particle, m the mass of particle, and \\\\varepsilon_0 a constant, the permittivity of free space. (To obtain an expression in cgs units, drop the factor of 4Œµ0.) Integrating over the solid angle, we obtain the Thomson cross section : \\\\sigma_t =\\\\frac{8\\\\pi} 3 \\\\left(\\\\frac{q^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0mc^2}\\\\right)^2 in SI units. The important feature is that the cross section is independent of photon frequency. The cross section is proportional by a simple numerical factor to the square of the classical radius of a point particle of mass m and charge q, namely : \\\\sigma_t = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi} 3 r_e^2 Alternatively, this can be expressed in terms of \\\\lambda_c, the Compton wavelength, and the fine structure constant: : \\\\sigma_t = \\\\frac{8 \\\\pi} 3 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha \\\\lambda_c}{2\\\\pi}\\\\right)^2 For an electron, the Thomson cross-section is numerically given by: : \\\\sigma_t =\\\\frac{8 \\\\pi} 3 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha \\\\hbar c}{m c^2}\\\\right)^2 = 6.6524587158 \\\\ldots\\\\times 10^{-29} \\\\text{ m}^2 = 66.524587158 \\\\ldots \\\\text{ (fm)}^2 Examples of Thomson scattering The cosmic microwave background contains a small linearly-polarized component attributed to Thomson scattering. That polarized component mapping out the so-called E-modes was first detected by DASI in 2002. The solar K-corona is the result of the Thomson scattering of solar radiation from solar coronal electrons. The ESA and NASA SOHO mission and the NASA STEREO mission generate three-dimensional images of the electron density around the sun by measuring this K-corona from three separate satellites. In tokamaks, corona of ICF targets and other experimental fusion devices, the electron temperatures and densities in the plasma can be measured with high accuracy by detecting the effect of Thomson scattering of a high-intensity laser beam. Inverse-Compton scattering can be viewed as Thomson scattering in the rest frame of the relativistic particle. X-ray crystallography is based on Thomson scattering.

Design and development Sales of the 10‚Äì14 passenger Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra, which first flew in 1937, had proved disappointing, despite the aircraft's excellent performance, as it was more expensive to operate than the larger Douglas DC-3, already in widespread use. In order to improve the type's economics, Lockheed decided to stretch the aircraft's fuselage by , allowing an extra two rows of seats to be fitted. The prototype for the revised airliner, designated Model 18 by Lockheed, was converted from the fourth Model 14, one of a batch which had been returned to the manufacturer by Northwest Airlines after a series of crashes. The modified aircraft first flew in this form on September 21, 1939, another two prototypes being converted from Model 14s, with the first newly built Model 18 flying on February 2, 1940. A total of 625 Lodestars of all variants were built. Operational history Lockheed Lodestar Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar over Houston, 1947 or 1948 The Lodestar received its Type certificate on March 30, 1940, allowing it to enter service with the first customer, Mid-Continent Airlines that month. As hoped, the extra seats greatly improved the Model 18's economics, reducing its seat-mile costs to a similar level to that of the DC-3, while retaining superior performance. Despite this, sales to US domestic customers were relatively slow as most US airlines were already committed to the DC-3, with only 31 Lodestars going to US airlines. Overseas sales were a little better, with the biggest airline customers being South African Airways (21), New Zealand National Airways Corporation (13), Trans-Canada Air Lines (12) and BOAC (9); another 29 were bought by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force. Various Pratt & Whitney and Wright Cyclone powerplants were installed. When the United States started to build up its military air strength in 1940‚Äì41, many American-operated Lodestars were impressed as the C-56. This was followed by the construction of many new-build Lodestars which were flown by the U.S. Army Air Forces as the C-60 and by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as the R5O. Lend-lease aircraft were used by the RNZAF as transports. One was purchased in 1942 to serve as Brazilian President Get√∫lio Vargas' personal aircraft. This aircraft was specially designed for that purpose and had 11 seats. Howard 250 Lodestar conversion fitted with tri-gear. At Opa Locka Airport near Miami in 1981 After the war many Lodestars were overhauled and returned to civilian service, mostly as executive transports such as Dallas Aero Service's DAS Dalaero conversion, Bill Lear's Learstar (produced by PacAero), and Howard Aero's Howard 250.Taylor 1965, p. 244. A few of the latter were converted to tricycle landing gear. While the surviving New Zealand NZNAC aircraft were sold back overseas in 1951/52, six more were later imported and converted for aerial topdressing. A single Lodestar served with the Israeli Air Force during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. A number of skydiving operations in the United States used Lodestars during the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1949, a Lockheed Lodestar in airline service in Australia crashed immediately after takeoff. All 21 occupants died in the crash or the ensuing conflagration. The cause of the accident was determined to be that the center of gravity was behind the rear limit. It is also likely the elevator trim tab was set for landing rather than takeoff.Job, Macarthur. \\"Horror at Coolangatta.\\" Flight Safety Australia, via casa.gov.au, November‚ÄìDecember 1999, p. 47. Retrieved: December 5, 2011. On March 22, 1958, Mike Todd's private plane Lucky Liz, named after his wife Elizabeth Taylor, crashed near Grants, New Mexico. The plane, a twin-engine Lockheed Lodestar, suffered engine failure while being flown overloaded, in icing conditions at too-high an altitude for the loading. The plane went out of control and crashed, killing all four on board. On September 4, 1962, a Lockheed 18-56-24 Lodestar operated by the Ashland Oil and Refining Company crashed near Lake Milton, Ohio. The flight was in-route to Ashland Regional Airport (KDWU) from Buffalo Airport, NY. Eleven passengers and two crew- members were killed. Investigation determined the crash a result of a malfunction of the electric elevator trim tab, which caused the loss of the plane's right wing during flight. On August 21, 1983, a Lockheed L-18 LEARStar operated by Landry Aviation, Inc. crashed near Sylvania, Washington. The flight was a planned parachute drop carrying two pilots and 22 parachutists. Nine parachutists and two crew-members were killed while 13 were able to parachute to safety after the pilots lost control and entered a vertical descent from 12,500 feet. Investigation determined the crash a result of a failure of the operator and pilot-in-command to assure proper load distribution during the parachute drop.https://ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR8406.pdf Surviving aircraft=Brazil= * FAB 2006 ‚Äì C-60A on static display at the Museu Aeroespacial in Rio de Janeiro. =Canada= * c/n 18-2064 ‚Äì L18-08 under restoration by students at the Aerospace Centre of the University of the Fraser Valley for static display at the Canadian Museum of Flight.

He is a member of the Iona Community, a broadcaster, and former student activist. He works throughout the world, lecturing in theological colleges in the UK, Canada and the United States, but is primarily concerned with the renewal of congregational worship at the grass roots level. Student activism Bell studied at the University of Glasgow where in 1974 he was elected President of the Students' Representative Council. His election represented a significant development as it was the start of a few years' control by the left wing of the SRC. Bell was quite open about his Christian religious beliefs, wearing a wooden cross-shaped pendant. In 1977 he was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow,University of Glasgow Story-John Bell while he was still a student. This was part of a trend for student rectors in Scotland at that time (which included Gordon Brown at the University of Edinburgh) but the rules were later changed to prevent students from standing for this post. Music career After a period in the Netherlands and two posts in church youth work, Bell became employed full-time in the areas of music and worship with the Wild Goose Resource Group. He is a past convener of the Church of Scotland's Panel on Worship and also convened the committee to revise the Church Hymnary. In 1987, he wrote the hymn \\"The Summons\\". In 1999, Bell was honoured by the Presbyterian Church in Canada and the Royal School of Church Music which bestowed a Fellowship on him. In 2002, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Glasgow. Bell has produced (sometimes in collaboration with Graham Maule) many collections of original hymns and songs and two collections of songs of the World Church. These are published by the Iona Community in Scotland and by G.I.A. Publications (Chicago) in North America. Several collections of his work have been published in translation in Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Dutch, Frisian, Japanese and German. Broadcasting He is a frequent broadcaster, and often presents programmes on the BBC, majoring on contemporary religious songs from various parts of the world. He is quite a regular contributor to \\"Thought for the Day\\", part of Radio 4's Today programme. In 2005, the BBC apologised for a broadcast by Bell in which he suggested that a Muslim corporal conscripted into the Israeli army had been jailed for refusing to shoot Palestinian children. Neither the BBC nor the Israeli military were able to find any evidence supporting the story or the existence of a soldier fitting the description. It was further pointed out that Israeli Arabs are not subject to conscription. Bell acknowledged that parts of his story were incorrect and that the broadcast could have been interpreted by some parties as \\"furtive racism\\", though he countered that \\"such a conjecture would be completely untrue\\".\\"BBC apologies for Thought for the Day's soldier story\\", Daily Telegraph, 18 February 2005 Public speaking Bell speaks to audiences across the world. In the UK, he has been associated with the Christian Arts Festival Greenbelt for many years. Personal life In 2017, responding to the story of Lizzie Lowe who committed suicide because she was afraid to tell her parents about her sexuality, he shared that his sexuality was that of a gay man. He had remained celibate and without a partner because he believed that this enabled him to work without hindrance or compromise as a public Christian and fulfil his commitments in the area of worship in the Church of Scotland.

'chain', definition 4g A chain or a ring shape may be open if its ends are not bonded to each other (an open-chain compound), or closed if they are bonded in a ring (a cyclic compound). Catenation occurs most readily with carbon, which forms covalent bonds with other carbon atoms to form longer chains and structures. This is the reason for the presence of the vast number of organic compounds in nature. Carbon is most well known for its properties of catenation, with organic chemistry essentially being the study of catenated carbon structures (and known as catenae). Carbon chains in biochemistry combine any of various other elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and biometals, onto the backbone of carbon, and proteins can combine multiple chains encoded by multiple genes (such as light chains and heavy chains making up antibodies). However, carbon is by no means the only element capable of forming such catenae, and several other main-group elements are capable of forming an expansive range of catenae, including silicon, sulfur and boron. The ability of an element to catenate is primarily based on the bond energy of the element to itself, which decreases with more diffuse orbitals (those with higher azimuthal quantum number) overlapping to form the bond. Hence, carbon, with the least diffuse valence shell p orbital is capable of forming longer p-p sigma bonded chains of atoms than heavier elements which bond via higher valence shell orbitals. Catenation ability is also influenced by a range of steric and electronic factors, including the electronegativity of the element in question, the molecular orbital n and the ability to form different kinds of covalent bonds. For carbon, the sigma overlap between adjacent atoms is sufficiently strong that perfectly stable chains can be formed. With other elements this was once thought to be extremely difficult in spite of plenty of evidence to the contrary. The versatile chemistry of elemental sulfur is largely due to catenation. In the native state, sulfur exists as S8 molecules. On heating these rings open and link together giving rise to increasingly long chains, as evidenced by the progressive increase in viscosity as the chains lengthen. Selenium and tellurium also show variants of these structural motifs. Silicon can form sigma bonds to other silicon atoms (and disilane is the parent of this class of compounds). However, it is difficult to prepare and isolate SinH2n+2 (analogous to the saturated alkane hydrocarbons) with n greater than about 8, as their thermal stability decreases with increases in the number of silicon atoms. Silanes higher in molecular weight than disilane decompose to polymeric polysilicon hydride and hydrogen.W. W. Porterfield, Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach, 2nd Ed.\\", Academic Press (1993), p. 219.Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, John Wiley & Sons (2001) p. 844. But with a suitable pair of organic substituents in place of hydrogen on each silicon it is possible to prepare polysilanes (sometimes, erroneously called polysilenes) that are analogues of alkanes. These long chain compounds have surprising electronic properties - high electrical conductivity, for example - arising from sigma delocalization of the electrons in the chain. Phosphorus chains (with organic substituents) have been prepared, although these tend to be quite fragile. Small rings or clusters are more common. Even silicon‚Äìsilicon pi bonds are possible. However, these bonds are less stable than the carbon analogues. Disilane is quite reactive compared to ethane. Disilene and disilynes are quite rare, unlike alkenes and alkynes. Examples of disilynes, long thought to be too unstable to be isolated were reported in 2004. In recent years a variety of double and triple bonds between the semi-metallic elements have been reported, including silicon, germanium, arsenic, bismuth and so on. The ability of certain main group elements to catenate is currently the subject of research into inorganic polymers.

The Helvellyn ridge lies to the east of Thirlmere. To the west of Thirlmere are a number of fells; for instance, Armboth Fell and Raven Crag both of which give views of the lake and of Helvellyn beyond. It runs roughly south to north and is bordered on the eastern side for much of its length by the A591 road and on the western side by a minor road. It occupies the site of a former natural lake: this had a fordable waist so narrow that it was (and is) sometimes regarded as two lakes. In the 19th century Manchester Corporation constructed a dam at the northern end, raising the water level, flooding the valley bottom, and creating a reservoir to provide the growing industrial city of Manchester with water supplies via the 96 mile-long Thirlmere Aqueduct. The reservoir and the aqueduct still provide water to the Manchester area, but under the Water Act 1973 ownership passed to the North West Water Authority; as a result of subsequent privatisation and amalgamation they (and the catchment area surrounding the reservoir) are now owned and managed by United Utilities, a private water and waste water company. The natural lake > We now approached the lake of Wyburn, or Thirlmer, as it is sometimes > called; an object every way suited to the ideas of desolation which surround > it, No tufted verdure graces banks, nor hanging woods throw rich reflections > on surface: but every form which it suggests, is savage, and desolate. Before the construction of the reservoir there was a smaller natural lake, known by various names including Leathes Water, Wythburn Water Thirle Water, and Thirlmere. (The Leathes were the lords of the manor, the valley in which the lake sat was Wythburndale (after the hamlet of Wythburn at its head), 'Thirlmere' probably is derived from \\" 'the lake with/at the narrowing' from OE √æyrel 'aperture', pierced hole' plus OE mere 'lake'\\") The Ordnance Survey six-inch map of 1867Map published 1867, based upon a survey carried out in 1862: shows a single lake (Thirlmere) with its narrowest point at Wath Bridge roughly level with Armboth; at this point \\"The water is shallow and crossed by a bridge, so that piers are easily built and connected with little wooden bridges, and that difficult problem in engineering - crossing a lake - accomplished\\" and the map shows both a bridge and a ford between the west and east banks. ('Wath' = 'ford' in Cumbrian placenames: the 'Bridge' itself can be seen in a photograph of the pre-reservoir valley: it was repeatedly carried away by floods (e.g. in November 1861.)) Because of this constriction there were \\"practically at low water two lakes, the river connecting them being crossed at the Narrows by a little wood and stone bridge\\", and the natural lake is sometimes characterised as two lakes. The stream exiting the lake (St John's Beck) flowed north to the River Greta, which flowed west through Keswick to join the Cumbrian Derwent. The 'Thirlmere scheme'=Use as a reservoir suggested= Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox, and 1st Duke of Gordon - chairman of the Royal Commission on Water Supply In 1863, a pamphlet urged that Thirlmere and Haweswater should be made reservoirs, and their water conveyed (via Ullswater (used as a distributing reservoir)) 240 miles to London to supply it with two hundred million gallons a day of clean water; the cost of the project was put at ten million pounds. The pamphlet's authors were G.W.Hemans CE (the son of Felicia Hemans) and R. Hassard CE. The latter had successfully engineered the supply of Dublin with clean water from the Wicklow mountains The scheme was considered by a Royal Commission on Water Supply chaired by the Duke of Richmond, but its report of 1869 dismissed such long-distance schemes, preferring to supply London by pumping from aquifers and abstraction from the Thames.conclusions and recommendations as reported in The scheme continued to be proposed; by 1876, it had grown to include a branch feeder from Bala Lake and the cost had risen accordingly to ¬£m 13.5;paragraph beginning however nothing ever came of it. The original scope specified for the Duke of Richmond's Royal Commission had been the water supply of London and other large cities, but the Commission had found itself fully occupied by consideration of the metropolitan water supply.untitled paragraph beginning : the Duke had been President of the Board of Trade from March 1867 to December 1868 For water supply elsewhere, its report had merely made general recommendations: > ... that no town or district should be allowed to appropriate a source of > supply which naturally and geographically belongs to a town or district > nearer to such source, unless under special circumstances which justify the > appropriation. That when any town or district is supplied by a line or > conduit from a distance, provision ought to be made for the supply of all > places along such lines. That on the introduction of any provincial water > bill into Parliament, attention should be drawn to the practicability of > making the measure applicable to as extensive a district as possible, and > not merely to the particular town. =Manchester looks to Thirlmere= The Corporations of both Manchester and Liverpool had already constructed a series of reservoirs to support their growth (Liverpool at Rivington, Manchester at Longdendale) but saw no possibility of further reservoirs there. Concerned that their existing water supplies would be rendered inadequate by their growth, they were now seeking further supplies: to comply with the Royal Commission's \\"no poaching\\" recommendation any further reservoirs would have to be much further afield. In 1875 John Frederick Bateman suggested that Manchester and Liverpool should supply themselves with water from Haweswater and Ullswater (made reservoirs) as a joint undertaking. Both Liverpool and Manchester Corporation rejected this, feeling that the interests of their city required its water supply to be independent of that of any other city. Instead in 1877, Liverpool initiated a scheme for a reservoir on the headwaters of the Vyrnwy in North Wales; at the instigation of their chairman (a native of Cumberland with a second home at Portinscale on Derwentwater),where he - 'John Grave, 52, Mayor of Manchester, Calico Printer' can be found in the 1871 Census (RG10/5235, Folio 23, page 3) the Waterworks Committee of Manchester Corporation proposed to supply Manchester with water from a Thirlmere reservoir. J F Bateman (in 1859): engineer for the Longdendale reservoirs, advisor on the Thirlmere Scheme In their report to the full Council, it was noted that water consumption had been 8 million gallons a day in 1855, 11 million gallons a day in 1865, in 1874 18 million gallons a day on average with peak demand 21 million gallons a day. The reliable supply from the Longdendale reservoirs in periods of drought was only 25 million gallons per day, but in the last two years demand had increased by 2.4 million gallons a day. Demand therefore was predicted to exceed the reliable supply in about seven years; it would take at least that to bring any major additional water supply on stream. Any major new works should aim to secure adequate supplies for the next thirty or fifty years; these could only be found in the mountains and lakes of northern Lancashire, Westmorland or Cumberland. Only Ullswater, Haweswater and Thirlmere were high enough to supply Manchester by gravity flow; the natural drainage of all three was to the north, but Thirlmere lay immediately below the pass of Dunmail Raise and the engineering to bring its waters south of the watershed would be significantly easier than for (for example) Ullswater. Thirlmere water had been analysed by Professor Roscoe who pronounced it superior even to that of Loch Katrine and thus one of the best waters known. Speaking to the report, the chairman of the Waterworks Committee noted that the catchment area was over 11,000 acres (in which there were not more than 200 inhabitants) and the annual rainfall about 110 inches; fifty million gallons a day could be collected and sent to Manchester; unlike the massive dams in Longdendale, all that was needed was a wall fifty foot high across a gorge he could throw a stone across. As regards aesthetic objections: \\"he was himself a native of the district where this water was to be found, and ‚Ä¶ there was no man living who would protect the beauties of the scenery with greater ardour and zeal than he would, but no man with common sense would say that in the works they were contemplating they were destroying any of the beauties of the place\\" The report had predicted little opposition to the scheme, by which it asserted the \\"beauty of the lake will be rather enhanced than otherwise\\". Other councillors were less sure of this, one noting that \\"they were going for a scheme which however they might gloss it over themselves, would arouse an amount of feeling on a question of sentiment of which the council had little conception, and therefore they must prepare for a very heavy parliamentary contest\\" =The Thirlmere Defence Association= Octavia Hill: \\"Could not a committee be formed to inquire into the matter, and, if found necessary to devise plans of opposition, and receive funds for the purpose?\\" To protect the purity of Thirlmere water, Manchester Corporation set about buying up all the land in its catchment area; the price it offered was such that there was little truly local opposition to the scheme. In Keswick, the nearest town, over 90% of ratepayers signed a petition in favour (Keswick had suffered repeatedly from flooding after heavy rainfall in the Thirlmere area).letter from 'One of the Committee' published as To the south, the only town council in Westmorland (Kendal) voted to support the scheme (hoping that a supply from the aqueduct would be a cheaper solution to their water supply problems than the new waterworks which would otherwise be needed): a local paper noted that \\"the inhabitants of Westmorland are not much alarmed at it ‚Ä¶so far they have stolidly refused to lose their tempers, or even waste many words over it\\". At a meeting to form a Lake District Association to promote tourism in the region, it was quickly agreed not to take a view on the Thirlmere scheme; otherwise the Association would break up before it was fairly started. The aqueduct, however, was objected to by owners of land through which it would pass: under normal procedure they would be the only objectors with sufficient locus standi to be heard against the private bill necessary to authorise the scheme. Those who objected to the change in the appearance (as they saw it destruction of the beauty) of the lake would be unable to demonstrate any financial interest in the matter. They therefore needed to stop the project by mobilising opinion against the scheme; in 1876 this - together with economic hard times - had seen off a scheme to link the existing railheads at Keswick and Windermere by a railway running alongside Thirlmere.and had done so without a Bill ever coming before parliament (Post-Thirlmere, where Lake District railway Bills reached committee stage, instructions to the committee required it to consider the impact on scenery, but in both cases the Bill was rejected on other grounds) \\"If every person who has visited the Lake District, in a true nature-loving spirit would be ready, when the right time comes, to sign an indignant protest against the scheme, surely there might be some hope...\\" that Parliament would reject the Bill, urged one correspondent, who went on to urge legal protection for natural beauty, along the lines of that proposed for ancient monuments by Sir John Lubbock or for the Yellowstone area in the United States.Letter dated \\"Keswick, June 4\\" from \\"J Clifton Ward HM Geological Survey\\" (but clearly in a private capacity) printed as Octavia Hill called for a committee to organise (and collect funds for) an effective opposition. A meeting at Grasmere in September 1877, considered a report on the Thirlmere scheme from H J Marten CE and formed a Thirlmere Defence Association with over ¬£1000 of subscriptions pledged.advertisement - By February 1878, members of the TDA included Thomas Carlyle, Matthew Arnold, William Morris, Thomas Woolner R.A., John Gilbert R.A. and Derwent Coleridge. Aesthetic opposition to the scheme was aggravated by the suggestion that Manchester Corporation would improve on naturesee Bishop of Manchester's speech (the inaugural address) reported in and varied in tone and thoughtfulness: the Carlisle Patriot thought Manchester welcome to take all the water it needed, provided only that it must not \\"destroy or deface those natural features which constitute the glory of the Lake District\\" and advised against any attempt to mitigate the offence by tree-planting; Thirlmere had \\"..a character of its own which makes the suggested artificiality intolerable. The rocky walls that hem it in boast no verdure: wild precipices, grand in the austerity of their barrenness cast their reflections on the mere, and by their wildness scout the municipal device of decoration..\\" Ruskin: \\"as to these Manchester robbers ... there is 'no profit' in the continuance of their lives\\" James Fraser, Bishop of Manchester: \\"two millions of people had a right to the necessaries of life from any portion of England\\" John Ruskin denounced Manchester in general > I am quite aware that there are many amiable persons in Manchester - and > much general intelligence. But, taken as a whole, I perceive that Manchester > can produce no good art, and no good literature; it is falling off even in > the quality of its cotton; it has reversed, and vilified in loud lies, every > essential principle of political economy; it is cowardly in war, predatory > in peace... and thought it would be more just if instead of Manchester Corporation being allowed to \\"steal and sell for a profit the water of Thirlmere and clouds of Hevellyn\\" it should be drowned in Thirlmere.Letter LXXXII (dated 'Brantwood, 13 September 1877') in The Mancunian press thought it detected a similar (if less blatant) prejudice and an 'essentially Cockney agitation'untitled editorial beginning when papers such as the Pall Mall Gazette editorialised \\"The visible universe was not created merely to supply materials towards the manufacture of shoddy\\" Speaking at the opening of the new Town Hall in Manchester, the Bishop of Manchester declared himself surprised at the language of the scheme's opponents, many of whom, he thought, had no idea where Thirlmere was but although he thought their aesthetic judgement wrong his counter-argument was not aesthetic, but political > ..one man in eight was interested more or less in the vital interests of > Manchester, and he thought when some of the carpings which dainty clubmen in > London indulged in at their expense - that they had no right to take water > from a Cumberland or Westmorland lake - he thought they had a right to stand > up and claim their inheritance, and to claim that two millions of people had > a right to the necessaries of life from any portion of England. =Private Bill of 1878= Manchester gave the required notice of its forthcoming Bill in November 1877. It sought powers to dam the outflow from Thirlmere and to divert into it a number of neighbouring gills which did not already drain into it, to build an aqueduct from Thirlmere to Manchester, and to extract water from Thirlmere. In addition a section of the existing Keswick-Ambleside turnpike north of Wythburn was to be diverted to run at a higher level, and a new carriage road was to be built on the western side of Thirlmere. Compulsory purchase powers were sought to allow these works to be carried out, and to allow Manchester Corporation to buy and keep land in the Thirlmere catchment area.advertisement : In response, the TDA issued a statement of its case. The scheme would destroy the distinctive charm of Thirlmere which was 'entirely free from modern erections out of harmony with the surroundings', raising the level would destroy the many small bays which gave the west shore its character, the 'picturesque windings' of the existing road on the east side were to be replaced by a dead level road, at the northern end 'one of the sweetest glens in Cumberland' was to be the site of an enormous embankment. Worst of all, in a dry season, the lake would be drawn down to its old level, exposing over three hundred acres of 'oozy mud and rotting vegetation'. \\"Few persons, whose taste is not utterly uneducated, are likely to share the confidence of the water committee in their power to enhance the loveliness of such a scene, or will think that the boldest devices of engineering skill will be other than a miserable substitute for the natural beauties they displace.\\" Furthermore, the scheme was unnecessary: Manchester already had an ample supply of water; its apparent consumption was so high because it was selling water to industrial users, and to areas outside Manchester and Manchester sought to increase such sales because they were profitable. Manchester could easily get more (and of a superior quality) from wells tapping the New Red Sandstone aquifer; if they were still unsatisfied there were vast untouched collecting grounds in the moorlands of Lancashire. There was also a more general point; the Thirlmere scheme if approved would set a precedent for municipalities to buy up whole valleys in the Lake District, leaving them at the mercy of \\"bodies of men, skilful and diligent enough in managing local affairs, but having little capacity to appreciate the importance of subjects beyond their daily sphere of action\\" with painful consequences for their natural beauty. Second Reading debate In January 1878, Edward Howard, the MP for East Cumberland who had given notice of a motion calling for a Select Committee looking at the problems of water supply to Lancashire and Yorkshire (which would have prevented progress of the Thirlmere Bill until the Select Committee had reported), announced that he would delay introducing the motion until the Thirlmere Bill had been defeated at second reading. Normally, private Bills were not opposed at Second Reading; their success or failure was determined by the Committee stage which followed. However, when the Second Reading of the Thirlmere Bill was moved, Howard spoke against it, and was supported by William Lowther, MP for Westmorland. Two Manchester MPs spoke for the Bill, as did the MP for Cockermouth, a West Cumberland mine-owner and industrialist. The Chairman of Ways and Means said it was impossible that the Bill could be considered by an ordinary Private Bill Committee, and suggested that it should be referred to a Hybrid Committee, where \\"persons might be examined who have not those sharply-defined interests which are usually represented before a Private Committee. Such a Committee might consider this question through all its bearings, public as well as private; and they might, at all events, lay down a principle for the guidance of the House in dealing with future questions connected with the water supply of populous districts.\\" Only if this was promised could he vote for the Second Reading; other speakers followed his lead, and it was on this basis that the Bill then passed its Second Reading. Committee Stage Lyon Playfair, chairman of the committee The bill was considered by a committee chaired by Lyon Playfair: its terms of reference were (bulleting added for clarity) > * to inquire into, and report upon the present sufficiency of the water > supply of Manchester and its neighbourhood, and of any other sources > available for such supply; * to consider whether permission should be given > to make use of any of the Westmoreland and Cumberland lakes for the purpose, > and if so, how far and under what conditions, to consider the prospective > requirements of the populations situated between the lake district and > Manchester; * to inquire, and report, whether any, and, if so, what, > provisions should be made in limitation of proposals for the exclusive use > of the water of any of the said lakes =Manchester's case= Manchester fielded a legal team headed by Sir Edmund Beckett QC, a leading practitioner at the parliamentary bar: they called witnesses to make the case for the scheme. Manchester waterworks supplied an area containing 800,000 inhabitants, about 380,000 of whom lived within the city boundary. In dry summers, the water supply had to be cut off at night to conserve stocks. In 1868, admittedly before the works in Longdendale were complete, this had happened for 75 days.evidence of ex-Mayor Grundy Water consumption was about 22 gallons a day per person, but it was that low because Manchester had discouraged water-closets and baths in working-class housingevidence of Sir John Heron, Town Clerk of Manchester: The waterworks did not make a profit; by Act of Parliament the total water rate could not exceed 10d per pound rental within the city; 12d in the supplied area outside the city (to have equal rates would be unfair to the rate payers who stood as guarantors for very large capital expenditure) Manchester was not profiteering from its present water supply, nor was it out to profit from the scheme: it would accept whatever obligation to supply areas along the aqueduct route (and/or price cap on sales outside the city) the committee saw fit to impose. There was no possibility of adding further reservoirs in Longdendale and no suitable unclaimed sites south of the Lune; the headwaters of the Lune were in limestone country, making both water quality (soft water was preferred by domestic customers and needed for textile processing) and reservoir construction problematical.evidence of Mr Bateman C.E. Thirlmere water was exceptionally pure whereas water pumped from the sandstone even when drinkable generally had considerable permanent hardnessevidence of Professor Roscoe Taking water from Ullswater rather than Thirlmere would cost about ¬£370,000 more. Thirlmere had higher rainfall than Longdendale (even in the driest year, 72 inches should be expected) and (by raising the water level) storage sufficient to allow the supply of fifty million gallons a day through any reasonably sustained drought: the reliable supply from Longdendale was only half that.further evidence of Mr Bateman The aqueduct to Manchester would (at different points on its route) be a tunnel through rock, a buried culvert constructed by cut-and-cover, or cast-iron pipes (for example where the aqueduct crossed a river, it would normally do so by an inverted syphon in pipes). Five 40-inch diameter pipes would be provided to take the full fifty million gallons per day, but initially only one pipe would be laid - others would be added as demand increased. 'A gravel shore': Deergarth How, Thirlmere in the dry summer of 2003 The former secretary of the Duke of Richmond's Royal Commission gave evidence of the scheme they had considered, which involved raising the level of Thirlmere 64 feet. Examination of the area around the outlet showed that Thirlmere had previously overflowed at a level 65 feet higher than at present. evidence of Dr Pole Hence \\"it would only be necessary to dam up the present outlet ... to raise the lake to its original level\\"; were this done \\"the lake when filled will be more in keeping with the grandeur of the hills around\\" Variations in reservoir water level would only expose a gravel or shingle shore (as happened now with natural fluctuations in level): there was nothing in the water to support the formation of mudbanks. The Commission had thought it would be unreasonable for London to take water from the Lakes without considering the needs of the industrial North; it had remarked favourably on Manchester supplying nearby towns as an instance of how by combination small towns might secure a better supply than they could by their own efforts. The same principle applied to supplying towns on the route of the aqueduct. =Independent witnesses= A number of independent witnesses were then called by the committee. Professor Ramsay, Director- General of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, confirmed the previous higher level of the lake: Playfair said he considered the evidence of the 'degradation of the lake by the gorge being opened' most important. Robert Rawlinson, chief engineering inspector to the Local Government Board favoured the Thirlmere scheme (thirty years earlier he had proposed a similar scheme to supply Liverpool from Bala Lake) and vouched for the competence of Bateman. =Opposition on aesthetic grounds= After calling witnesses with a straightforward locus standi under Private Bill standing orders and hearing their objections (detriment to salmon fishing in the Greta if floods and spates were eliminated, the dangers to gentlemen's residences from aqueduct bursts, interference of the aqueduct with natural drainage, and the undesirable disturbance from constructing the aqueduct through gentlemen's private pleasure grounds (and doing so on five occasions where pipes were used).) witnesses with aesthetic objections were heard. A Stourbridge solicitor owning a house and 160 acres in Grasmere objected to the trace of the aqueduct as 'a great scar on the landscape'; he had laid out ¬£1000 on building roads on his land in hopes of selling plots for the construction of houses: 'you may build houses without disfiguring the district', but the aqueduct would destroy the essential local feature of the district.evidence of G Haward A Keswick bank manager objected because the dam would be vulnerable to a waterspout, experienced in St John's Vale many times. He was supported by William Wordsworth (the only surviving son of the poet) who spoke of waterspouts at Rydal, and went on to object that raising the level of Thirlmere would remove its natural indentations: repeated attempts by him to dilate on the lake's associations with the Lake Poets were treated unsympathetically by counsel for Manchester and eventually ended by the committee chairman. Witnesses then testified to Thirlmere having a muddy bottom (but one said it was only found at more than twelve feet down.) The brother (and heir) of the lord of the manor gave evidence that the beauty of Thirlmere lay in it being more secluded than other lakes: his counsel used his examination to suggest that Manchester Corporation was buying excessive amounts of land with a view to selling off building plots should the waterworks scheme be defeated.examination of Mr Stanleigh Leathes A Grasmere villa-owner likened the scheme to 'some modern Cockney' daubing paint on a picture in the National Gallery and claiming it to be an improvement; he predicted stinking mud around the edges of Thirlmere because that was what found around Grasmere.evidence of Sir Robert Farquhar W E Forster held both that if Manchester needed water and could get it nowhere other than Thirlmere, the scheme should go ahead; but that - if it did - beauty more valuable than any picture that was or was to come would be lost to the people of England, who would not be recompensed by any amount of compensation to landed proprietors: Parliament should ensure that beauty was not lost unnecessarily. (Forster was not only a prominent politician with a house near Ambleside, but also a partner in a West Riding worsted manufacturer, and Beckett pressed him on why the generation of dust and smoke and 'turning rivers into ink' in the valleys of the West Riding was not in greater need of Parliamentary scrutiny than raising the level of Thirlmere was.) =Need for the Thirlmere scheme questioned= Manchester's current and future needs for water were then disputed, the adequacy of the Thirlmere scheme queried, and alternative schemes for increasing the supply of water to Manchester suggested. Edward Hull, director of the Irish section of the Geological Survey, gave evidence on the ready availability of water from the New Red Sandstone aquifer around Manchester. He estimated that one square mile could yield 139,000 gallons a day; a single well would give up to two million gallons a day. The Delamere Forest region, 25 miles from Manchester, had 126 square miles of the sandstone and was untapped: it should be possible to extract 16,500,000 gallons a day from it.evidence of Professor Hull F.R.S. George Symons gave evidence on rainfall. He predicted that in the driest year, the rainfall at Thirlmere would be no more than 60 inches; about ten inches of this would be lost in evaporation, and Manchester were promising to maintain flows down St John's Beck equivalent to another nine inches. In cross-examination he conceded that he had had a rain gauge at Thirlmere since 1866 and the lowest annual rainfall it had recorded was 82 inches; re-examined he thought Manchester could not get 50 million gallons a day from Thirlmere; the most they could rely upon was 25 million gallons a day.evidence of G.J.Symons, F.R.S. Alderman King, the only Manchester alderman to have voted against the scheme, reported that since 1874 the water consumption had decreased and in his opinion Manchester's present supply was adequate for the next ten years. He pointed out that Bateman had originally suggested using Ullswater, rather than Thirlmere, as a reservoir, and had at the start of the Longdendale scheme been over-optimistic in his estimate of its cost and yield; he therefore thought the Thirlmere scheme imprudent from the point of view of Manchester ratepayers.evidence of Alderman King Henry Marten MICE thought that Manchester's high consumption in the early 1870s had been due to wastage; his calculations were that it would be fifteen years before Manchester needed more water. When it did, it could increase reservoir capacity in Longdendale; much of the rain falling there currently ran to waste.evidence of Mr H.J. Martin MICE It might also be prudent to reduce the amount of 'compensation water' released from the Longdendale reservoirs to feed mills downstream, and to have contingency arrangements to pump water from the sandstone aquifer in time of droughtfurther evidence of Mr H.J. Martin MICE He also objected to Manchester claiming so productive a source of water for itself, and doubted if it would deal fairly with other towns wanting Thirlmere water; if it did, the scheme would be of general public benefit. Playfair 'perhaps speaking more as a sanitarian' queried whether Liverpool was so sanitary a town as to be a good example of how Manchester might reduce consumption, and whether the existing restrictions on consumption in Manchester should not eased by increasing the water supply: Marten disagreed (if Liverpool was insanitary, it was because of the presence of foreigners, it being a seaport.) further evidence of Mr H.J. Martin MICE =Alternative sources suggested= Edward Easton agreed with Marten that the restrictions on consumption in Manchester were not too stringent and was astonished at Bateman's claim that there were no further suitable reservoir sites in Longdendale; in one weekend he had identified four or five suitable sites. After Longdendale there were other possible sites, amongst many others those on the headwaters of the Derbyshire Derwentevidence of Mr C Easton Thomas Fenwick gave evidence on the practicality of using reservoirs on the Derwent, but had to admit that he did so on the basis of the work of one weekend visit to the area, that the Derwent catchment area did not naturally belong to Manchester, and that the Derwent flowed past Chatsworth so any interference with its natural flow would have to be agreeable to the Duke of Devonshire. The Derwent valley was almost as beautiful as the lakes, but lacked a lake; its beauty would be improved by a reservoir. Aqueducts (like one he had built for Dewsbury) were scarcely visible once built, and much more care was now taken in the construction of dams; dam failure was a thing of the past.evidence of Mr Fenwick Playfair declined the offer of further evidence from Manchester on getting water from the Derwent catchment area, as its proponents had given no real detail, nor any notice to potential objectors: a brief comment by Bateman would suffice.guidance on points on which Bateman was to be examined (immediately before his further evidence) Bateman was then re- examined on the possibility of increasing storage at Longdendale. Easton's suggestion of additional sites was 'utterly absurd'; all practicable sites were already taken: \\"He had been working in these valleys for nearly thirty years, and he thought he knew something more about them than a man who made a galloping journey over them in one day\\". Taking water from the Derwent catchment area would require a nine-mile-long tunnel, and cost nearly as much as Thirlmere for half the yield.further evidence of Mr Bateman =Closing submissions= Counsel for the TDA conceded that if Manchester needed the water, then it must have it; but it had been shown the beauty of the lake would be greatly damaged, and therefore Manchester needed to show that there was no other way to meet its needs: it was not for the objectors to provide a worked-up alternative scheme. It had been shown there was no necessity; Manchester would not need more water for many years to come. The scheme had been brought forward to gratify the ambition of Manchester Corporation, and of Mr Bateman, its engineer. In purchasing land around Thirlmere they had exceeded their powers, as they had done for many years by supplying water outside their district, as though they were a commercial water company, not a municipal undertaking.Mr Cripps Bateman's calculations were based upon aiming to fully meet demand in a dry year, but failure to do so would cause only temporary inconvenience: one might as well build a railway entirely in a tunnel to ensure the line would not be blocked by snow. In any case more storage could be provided in Longdendale and the Derwent headwaters, and more water could be extracted from the sandstone.Mr Cripps' further remarks He was followed by counsel for various local authorities, arguing against the Bill being passed without it laying any obligation on Manchester to supply water at a reasonable price to neighbouring authorities and to districts through which the aqueduct passed. As counsel for the TDA objected, these 'objectors' were - in everything but name - supporters of the scheme speaking in favour of it. Beckett began by attacking the aesthetic issue head on. He objected to the false sentimentality of \\"people calling themselves learned, refined, and aesthetical, and thinking nobody had a right to an opinion but themselves\\", and in particular to Forster who thought himself entitled to talk about national sentiment and British interests as though there were no two views of the case. The lake had been higher in the past, and there was no good reason to think it would not look better covering 800 acres than covering 350. Forster talked of Parliament interfering to protect natural beauty, just as it interfered to protect the commons, but the analogy failed: Forster wanted to interfere (on the basis of 'national sentiment') with the right of people to do they saw fit with their own property; this was communism. Forster was not even consistent: he saw no need for Parliament to have powers to prevent woollen mills being built at Thirlmere, and turning its waters as inky as the Wharfe. Aesthetics disposed of, the case became a simple one. Manchester was not undertaking the project because it loved power: nothing in the Bill increased its supply area by a single acre; it sold water to other authorities because Parliament expected it to; it was nonsense to suggest that the town clerk of Manchester needed instruction on the legality of doing so. It was clear that the population of South Lancashire would continue to increase; it was absurd for counsel for the TDA to object to this as an unwarranted assumption upon which the argument that Manchester would need more water in the foreseeable future rested. As for the suggestion that more water might be got in Longdendale, this rested on overturning the settled views of an engineer with thirty years' experience in the valley by a last-minute survey lasting under thirty hours by Mr Easton, whose conduct was shameful and scandalous. Other schemes had been floated; the Derwent, the Cheshire sandstone, but they were too hypothetical to be relied upon. The Thirlmere scheme, which by its boldness ensured cheap and plentiful water to South Lancashire for years to come, was the right solution . If it was rejected, Manchester would not pursue 'little schemes here and there, giving little sups of water'; they would wait until Parliament was of their turn of mind. Committee findings and loss of Bill The committee agreed unanimously to pass the bill in principle, provided introduction of a clause allowing for arbitration on aesthetic issues on the line of the aqueduct, and of one requiring bulk supply of water (at a fair price) to towns and local authorities demanding it, if they were near the aqueduct (with Manchester and its supply area having first call on up to 25 gallons per head of population from Thirlmere and Longdendale combined.) Suitable clauses having been inserted, the committee stage of the bill was successfully completed 4 April 1878. The report of the committee said that * Manchester was justified in seeking additional sources of supply; there were already nearly a million inhabitants of its statutory supply area and a shortfall could arise within ten years. It would be unwise to expect any increase in the supply from Longdendale. The Derwent scheme was too costly (and given in insufficient detail) to require consideration, and it would be unjust to other Lancashire towns to allow Manchester to appropriate catchment areas closer than the Lakes. * Thirlmere was of great natural beauty. Formation of the reservoir would restore the lake to a former level; characteristic features would be lost, but new ones would be formed. The purchase of the land in the catchment area (with a view to prevent mines and villas) would preserve its natural state for generations to come; the construction of roads would make its beauty more accessible to the public. Fluctuations in level (except in prolonged drought) would not be significantly greater than the current natural variation, and (the margin of the lake being shingle, not mud) would be unimportant. Hence, \\"the water of Lake Thirlmere could be used without detriment to the public enjoyment of the lake\\". As for the aqueduct, beyond temporary inconvenience and unsightliness during construction, there would be little or no permanent injury to the scenery. * the interest of water authorities on or near the line of the aqueduct in securing a supply of water from it had been considered. In accordance with the recommendation of the Richmond Commission, an appropriate clause had been inserted, and the preamble of the bill adjusted accordingly. The Bill received its Third Reading in the Commons 10 May 1878 (the TDA, however, appealing to its supporters for ¬£2,000 to fund further opposition in the Lords.) The TDA then objected that the Bill, as it left the Commons, did not meeting the standing orders of the House of Lords, as the required notice had not been given of the new clauses. This objection was upheld, and the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Lords therefore rejected the Bill.untitled paragraph under general heading =Bill of 1879= Manchester returned with another Thirlmere Bill in the next session: the Council's decision to do so42 for, 2 against was endorsed by a town meeting and, when called for by opponents, a vote of ratepayers (43,362 votes for; 3524 against) The 1879 Bill as first advertised was essentially the 1878 Bill as it had left the Commons, with some additional concessions to the TDA (most notably that Thirlmere was never to be drawn down below its natural pre-reservoir level) being made later. In February 1879, Edward Howard introduced a motion calling for a Select Committee looking at the problems of water supply to Lancashire and Yorkshire (which would have prevented progress of the Thirlmere Bill until the Select Committee had reported). In doing so, he criticised (without prior notice) the conduct of the hybrid committee of 1878. The President of the Local Government Board thought a Royal Commission unnecessary (much information had already been gathered and was freely available), and Howard's motion was too transparently an attempt to block the Thirlmere Bill. Forster regretted the decision of the hybrid committee, but it had been an able committee, and its conclusions should be respected. Playfair also defended the committee; it had (as required by the Commons) carefully examined the regional and public interest issues which a Royal Commission was now supposedly needed to re-examine properly. As a result of this, a clause had been introduced which made the Bill effectively a public one; the Lords had then refused to consider the Bill because the additional clauses fell foul of requirements for a purely private Bill. Howard withdrew his motion. At committee stage, the preamble was unopposed and the only objector against the clauses was unsuccessful. Committee stage was completed 25 March 1879; the same objection was made at the Lords Select Committee, and was again unsuccessful; the Bill received Royal Assent in May 1879.; it became 42 & 43 Vict. c. 36 Conversion to Manchester's reservoir 'Oozy mud': Woodhead reservoir in the dry summer of 2005 =The scheme on pause= The Act set no time limit for completion of the work, but the compulsory purchase powers it gave were to expire at the end of 1886. There was no immediate shortage of water, and it was decided to undertake no engineering until purchasing of property and way-leaves was essentially complete. However, these were not pursued with any great urgency (especially after the replacement of the chairman of the waterworks committee, Alderman Grave), and 1884 Grave began a series of letters to the press calling for greater urgency.eg letter from John Grave dated Cheetham Hill, Manchester, 28 January 1884, printed as He was answered by Alderman King, long opposed to the scheme, who urged that it be dropped, pointing out that in 1881 the average daily consumption of water had been under 19 million gallons a day, less than 2 million gallons a day more than in 1875; on that basis not until 1901 would average daily consumption reach the limits of supply from Longdendale. In turn, Bateman (complaining \\"Where almost every statement is incorrect, and the conclusions, therefore, fallacious, it is difficult within any reasonable compass to deal with all\\") responded: the reassuring calculation reflected a recent period of trade depression and wet summers; the question was not of the average consumption over the year, but of the ability of supply and storage to meet demand in a hot and dry summer; as professional adviser to the water committee he would not have dared incurred the risk of failing to do so by delaying the start of work for so long. The waterworks committee steered a middle course; the Thirlmere scheme was not to be lost sight of, they argued in July 1884, but - in view of the current trade depression - it should not be unduly hastened. The summer of 1884 was, however, one of prolonged drought. At the start of July, after three months with little rain, there was still 107 days' supply in the reservoirs; by the start of October there was no more than 21 days': \\"The great reservoirs‚Ä¶ are, with one or two exceptions, empty - literally dry. The banks are parched, the beds of the huge basins are in many places sufficiently hard owing to the long continued absence of water to enable one to walk from one side to the other, or from end to end, almost without soiling one's boots.\\" Furthermore, the water drawn down from the reservoirs had had 'a disagreeable and most offensive odour'letter from Tom Smith Dickenson Road Longsight 16 June 1884, printed under title , analysis of the water was reported by 'Oswald Wilkinson FCS Public Analyst for the Borough of Stockport Victoria Laboratory, 28 & 51, Arcade Chambers, St Mary'sgate, Manchester' in a letter published as The drought broke in October; it had lasted a month longer than that of 1868, but the water supply had not had to be turned off at night; the waterworks committee thought the council could congratulate itself on this but in January 1885 the committee sought, and the council (despite further argument by Alderman King) gave permission to commence the Thirlmere works. =Construction work= The dam at the north end of Thirlmere (seen from Raven Crag) The first phase was to construct the aqueduct with a capacity of ten thousand gallons a day, and to raise the level of Thirlmere by damming up its natural exit to the north. The engineer for the project was George Hill (formerly an assistant, and then partner of Bateman). Contracts for the aqueduct went out for tender in autumn 1885; by April 1886 excavation of the tunnels had begun and hutted camps had sprung up (at White Moss, and elsewhere) to house the army of navvies (who were paid 4d an hour): The original contractor suspended work in February 1887, and the contract had to be re-let. A further Bill (supported by the Lake District Defence Society and Canon Rawnsley) was contemplated for 1889 to allow Thirlmere to be raised only 20 ft in the first instance, and defer improvement of the road on the west side of the lake but was not proceeded with. Boring of the tunnel under Dunmail Raise was completed in July 1890, and work then began on the dam at the north end of Thirlmere. There were then between five and six thousand men working on the Thirlmere project. Before any supply from Thirlmere became available, there were two dry summers during which Manchester experienced a 'water famine'. The summer of 1887 was the driest for years,statistics are given in with stocks falling to 14 days' supply in early August, and the water supply consequently being cut off from 6 pm to 6 am. Stocks at the start of 1888 were markedly lower than in previous years, and as early as March 1888 the water supply was again cut off overnight (8pm - 5am), but spring rain soon allowed a resumption of the constant supply. 1893 saw another dry summer, with stocks falling to twenty-four days' supply by the start of September and that - a councillor complained - of inferior quality with 'an abundance of animal life visible to the naked eye' in tap water. By now, the aqueduct and dam were complete, but under the 1879 Act the roads around Thirlmere had to be completed before any water could be taken from it. The summer of 1894 was wet, and starting to use Thirlmere water would mean charges of ¬£10,000 a year; the opening was therefore delayed until October 1894. There were two opening ceremonies; one at Thirlmere followed next day in Manchester by the turning-on of water to a fountain in Albert Square. Thirlmere as Manchester's reservoir=First phase: 10 million gallons a day, lake 20 ft above natural= Thirlmere from lower slopes of Raven Crag in the 1890s: water level 20ft above natural For the next ten years, the level of Thirlmere was twenty feet above that of the old lake: lowland pasturage was lost, but little housing. The straight level road on the east bank was favourably commented upon in accounts of cycling tours of the lakes, and it was widely thought - as James Lowther (MP for Penrith and the son of the Westmorland MP who had spoken against the 1878 Bill at its Second Reading) said at the Third Reading of a Welsh Private Bill - \\"the beauty of Thirlmere had been improved\\" by the scheme. Thirlmere water reached Manchester through a single 40-inch diameter cast iron pipe; due to leakage, only about 80% of the intended 10 million gallons a day supply reached Manchester. and, as early as May 1895 more than half the additional supply was accounted for by increased consumption. An Act of 1891 had allowed Manchester to specify water-closets for all new buildings and modification of existing houses; Manchester now encouraged back-fitting of water-closets, and reduced the additional charge for baths. The average daily consumption in 1899 was 32.5 million gallons a day, (stocks at the start of 1900 were under 90 days' supply; at the start of 1899 they had been over 140 days') with 41 million gallons being consumed in a single day at the end of August In June 1900, Manchester Corporation accepted the recommendation of its Waterworks Committee that a second pipe be laid from Thirlmere; it insisted that despite any potential shortfall in water supply a 'water-closet' policy should be continued. The first section of the second pipe was laid at Troutbeck in October 1900. Hill noted that it would take three or four years to complete the second pipe, at the current rate of increase of consumption as soon as the second pipe was completed it would be time to start on the third. In April 1901, the Longdendale reservoirs were 'practically full'; by mid-July they held only 49 days' supply, and it was thought prudent to cut off the water supply at night; by October stocks were down to 23 days', even though water was running to waste at Thirlmere; stocks went as low as 19 days' at the start of November In 1902, the constant supply was maintained throughout the summer and the Longdendale stocks never dropped below 55 days' consumption, but 1904 again saw the suspension of supply at night, with stocks falling as low as 17 day's supply at the start of November just before the second pipe came into use. =Subsequent phases and consequent criticism= A. Heaton Cooper painting): water level 35ft above natural (Hawes How now an island with satellite islets) The second pipe could deliver 12 million gallons a day, giving a total capacity of the aqueduct of twenty million gallons a day. The water level was raised to 35 ft above natural; the area of the lake now increasing to 690 acres.: the extent of the 35ft lake does not appear to have been mapped Seventy-nine acres of Shoulthwaite Moss (north of Thirlmere) were reclaimed as winter pasture to compensate for the loss of acreage around Thirlmere. A third pipe was authorised in 1906, construction began in October 1908, and was completed in 1915: this increased the potential supply from Thirlmere to thirty million gallons a day against an average daily demand which had now reached forty-five million gallons: in the summer of 1911 it had again been necessary to suspend the water supply at night. The lake was then raised to fifty feet above natural; a fourth and final pipeline was completed in 1927, its authorisation having been delayed by the First World War until 1921; as early as 1918 Manchester Corporation had identified the need for a further source of water, and identified Haweswater as that source. At the committee stage of Manchester's 1919 Bill to tap Haweswater, the average daily demand on Manchester's water supply in 1917 was said to have been 51.2 million gallons a day, with the reliable supply from Longdendale being no more than 20 million gallons a day and Thirlmere being able to supply 30 million gallons a day, which would rise to 40 million gallons a day when the fourth pipe was laid. The aqueduct capacity could be increased to fifty million gallons a day by laying a fifth pipe, but could not be increased beyond that whilst the aqueduct was still being used to deliver water to Manchester. Looking across Thirlmere from Fisher Crag to Helvellyn - showing 'tide-mark', diverted Keswick-Ambleside road, and tree-planting At the committee stage of the Haweswater bill, objectors made no mention of the aesthetic concerns raised against the Thirlmere bills: \\"The world now knows that many of the fears then expressed were very foolish ones, and would never be realised under any circumstances, or at any place\\" said the Yorkshire Post although Manchester countered the suggestion that it should not annex Haweswater, but instead further raise the level of Thirlmere because \\"it would mean such injury to the Lake District that they would have the whole country up against them\\" The modern reservoir (Ordnance Survey one-inch map 1947) When the Lords defeated Manchester's Bill for abstraction of water from Ullswater in 1962, however, many speakers pointed to Manchester's stewardship of Thirlmere to show why the Bill should be defeated: * to improve the retention of water in the catchment area, from 1907 onwards Manchester had planted extensive stands of conifers on both banks of the reservoir; as they grew, they had radically altered the appearance of the area, and (as James Lowther - now Lord Ullswater - complained) destroyed the views from the road on the west bank provided to give the public views of Helvellyn * As Thirlmere water became more essential as a supply to Manchester, the draw-down of the reservoir in dry weather increased to double the 8‚Äì9 foot promised in the 1870s. * \\"Large flooding of a valley bottom means an end to farming, and Thirlmere and Mardale are farmless and depopulated\\" but this was not just because of the higher water level. There was no provision for water treatment downstream of Thirlmere (or Longdendale), and Manchester therefore relied on minimising pollution at source. To achieve this, it minimised human activity in the catchment area. Much of the settlement around Wythburn church (including the Nag's Head, a coaching inn with Wordsworthian associations) remained above water level but it was suppressed, accommodation for necessary waterworks employees being provided at Fisher End and Stanah east of the northern end of the reservoir. Eventually Manchester Corporation closed Wythburn churchyard, St John's in the Vale being now more convenient for its future customers. * To protect the water from contamination by tourists and visitors, bathing boating and fishing were prohibited, and access to the lake effectively banned. This policy was supported by \\"...barbed wire, wire netting, regimented rows of conifers and trespass warning notices, as common as 'Verboten' notices in Nazi Germany‚Ä¶\\" said the Yorkshire Post in 1946. Thirlmere after Manchester Under the Water Act 1973 ownership passed from Manchester to the North West Water Authority; this was privatised (as North West Water) in 1990 and a subsequent merger created United Utilities, a private water and waste water company, which now owns and manages the reservoir and its catchment area. Keswick is now supplied with Thirlmere water (via a water treatment works at Bridge End to the north of the dam), and (as of 2017) it is intended to also supply West Cumbria from Thirlmere by 2022, thus allowing cessation of water abstraction from Ennerdale Water. The crenelated building housing the original 'straining well' at the northern end of the tunnel under Dunmail Raise (made redundant by a water treatment plant at the southern exit of the tunnel under the Raise) which began operation in 1980 ) is now a Grade II listed building.first listed in 1985 The new water treatment plant has permitted greater public access to the lake, and the views across the lake from the roads on either side have been restored by the selective felling of non-native trees between them and the lake shore. \\\\- apparently part of a larger document (title unknown, and not accessible from the LDNPA website) The landscape remains heavily influenced by land management policies intended to protect water quality; in April‚ÄìMay 1999 there were 282 cases of cryptosporidiosis in Liverpool and Greater Manchester and the outbreak was thought to be due to the presence of the Cryptosporidium parasite in livestock grazing in the Thirlmere catchment area. South of the lake, the only habitation is the occasional hill farm around Steel End. From the south end of the lake to the dam, the reservoir completely covers the floor of a narrow steep-sided valley whose sides have extensive and predominantly coniferous forestry plantations, without dwellings or settlements. During periods of dry weather the water level drops revealing a wide band of bare exposed rock. According to the Lake District National Park Authority: > If the damming of the valley and the enlargement of two small lakes to form > a large reservoir was landscape change on a large scale, so was the > afforestation of nearly 800 hectares of land to prevent erosion, protect > water quality and to profit from harvested timber.

The basilica was constructed between 1985 and 1989 with different cost estimates given by various groups. Some stated that it cost US$175 million, US$300 million, ranging as high as US$600 million. The designs of the dome and encircled plaza are clearly inspired by the Basilica of Saint Peter in Vatican City, although it is not an outright replica. The cornerstone was laid on 10 August 1985, and it was consecrated on 10 September 1990 by Pope John Paul II, who had just formally accepted the basilica as a gift from F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny on behalf of the Catholic Church. The basilica is not to be confused with a cathedral. Our Lady of Peace is located in the Diocese of Yamoussoukro; the Cathedral of Saint Augustine ‚Äî less than away ‚Äî is smaller in size than the basilica but the principal place of worship and seat of the bishop of the diocese. Guinness World Records lists it as the largest church in the world, having surpassed the previous record holder, St. Peter's Basilica, upon completion. It has an area of and is high. However, it also includes a rectory and a villa (counted in the overall area), which are not strictly part of the church. It can accommodate 18,000 worshippers, compared to 60,000 for St. Peter's. Ordinary liturgies conducted at the basilica are usually attended by only a few hundred people. The basilica is administered by Polish Pallottines at a cost of US$1.5 million annually.  Architecture  The structure was criticized because of the comparison between the lavish building and the impoverished surroundings in 1995 View of the basilica While designing it after the Vatican Basilica, Lebanese architect Pierre Fakhoury constructed the dome to be slightly lower than the Basilica of Saint Peter, but ornamented with a larger cross on top. The finished height is . The dome is more than twice the diameter of St. Peter's in Rome, 90 metres versus 41 metres (300 ft versus 136 ft). The base of the dome is much lower than St. Peter's, so the overall height is slightly less. The basilica is constructed with marble imported from Italy and is furnished with of contemporary stained glass from France. Columns are plentiful throughout the basilica but are not uniform in style; the smaller columns are there for structural reasons, while the bigger ones are decorative and contain elevators, rainwater evacuation from the roof and other building mechanical devices. There is enough space to seat 7,000 people in the nave, with standing room for an additional 11,000 people. Apart from the basilica are two identical villas. One of the villas accommodates the clergymen who operate the basilica. A room in the other villa is reserved for papal visits, of which only one has occurred, when the basilica was consecrated. The wood chosen for the 7000 pews in the Our Lady of Peace Basilica is Iroko wood.  Construction  The choir The Basilica was built by Dumez, the French construction company. The cost of the basilica was met with some controversy globally when construction began, especially as the C√¥te d'Ivoire was going through an economic and fiscal crisis at the time. Pope John Paul II agreed to consecrate the basilica on the condition that a hospital also be built nearby. This hospital, whose construction was frozen during the politico-military crisis from 2002 to 2011, was finally completed in 2014 and opened in January 2015, at a cost of ‚Ç¨21.3 million.  Memorial  C√¥te d'Ivoire President Houphou√´t-Boigny chose his birthplace of Yamoussoukro to be the site of the new capital city of his country in 1983. As part of the plan of the city, the president wanted to memorialize himself with the construction of the basilica. He is even pictured beside Jesus ascending to heaven in one stained-glass panel.\\"C√¥te d'Ivoire's capital: Better late than never: Africa‚Äôs largest and most grandiose church gets a new neighbour\\", The Economist, dated 16 June 2012. Due to the location of the Basilica, it was dubbed by the media as \\"basilica in the bush\\". Houphou√´t-Boigny believed it would become a pilgrimage site for African Catholics.

King Richard II is thought to have died there. It was the site of a series of famous sieges during the 17th- century English Civil War. History Model reconstructing Pontefract Castle The castle, on a rock to the east of the town above All Saints' Church, was constructed in approximately 1070 by Ilbert de Lacy. on land which had been granted to him by William the Conqueror as a reward for his support during the Norman Conquest. There is, however, evidence of earlier occupation of the site. Initially the castle was a wooden structure which was replaced with stone over time. The Domesday Survey of 1086 recorded \\"Ilbert's Castle\\" which probably referred to Pontefract Castle. Robert de Lacy failed to support King Henry I during his power struggle with his brother, and the King confiscated the castle from the family during the 12th century. Roger de Lacy paid King Richard I 3,000 marks for the Honour of Pontefract, but the King retained possession of the castle. His successor, King John gave Lacy the castle in 1199, the year he ascended the throne. Roger died in 1213 and was succeeded by his eldest son, John. However, the King took possession of Castle Donington and Pontefract Castle. The de Lacys lived in the castle until the early 14th century. It was under the tenure of the de Lacys that the magnificent multilobate donjon was built. In 1311 the castle passed by marriage to the estates of the House of Lancaster. Thomas, Earl of Lancaster (circa 1278‚Äì1322) was beheaded outside the castle walls six days after his defeat at the Battle of Boroughbridge, a sentence placed on him by King Edward II himself in the great hall. This resulted in the earl becoming a martyr with his tomb at Pontefract Priory becoming a shrine. It next went to Henry, Duke of Lancaster and subsequently to John of Gaunt, third son of King Edward III. He made the castle his personal residence, spending vast amounts of money improving it. =Richard II= The ruins of Pontefract Castle's keep In the closing years of the 14th century, Richard II had banished John of Gaunt‚Äôs son Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford from the country and with the death of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster in 1399, much of Bolingbroke's patrimony was being given away by Richard II to his favourites. The castle at Pontefract was among such properties under threat which roused Bolingbroke to return to England to claim his rights to the Duchy of Lancaster and the properties of his father. Act 2, scene 1, of Shakespeare's play Richard II relates Bolingbroke‚Äôs homecoming in the words of Northumberland in the speech of the eight tall ships:- When he landed at Ravenspur on the Humber he made straight way for his castle at Pontefract. The King, being in Ireland at the time, was in no position to oppose Bolingbroke who deposed Richard and took the crown for himself as Henry IV. Flint on 16 August 1399 and imprisoned. Richard II was captured by Henry Bolingbroke's supporters in August 1399 and initially imprisoned in the Tower of London. Sometime before Christmas that year he was moved to Pontefract Castle (via Knaresborough) where he remained under guard until his death, perhaps on 14 February 1400. William Shakespeare's play Richard III mentions this incident: Various chroniclers suggest that Richard was starved to death by his captors, and others suggest he starved himself. A contemporary French chronicler suggested that Richard II had been hacked to death, but this is, according to the ODNB, \\"almost certainly fictitious\\". =Richard III= Richard III had two relatives of Elizabeth Woodville beheaded at Pontefract Castle on 25 June, 1483 - her son, Sir Richard Grey, and her brother, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers. =Tudor Era= In 1536, the castle's guardian, Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy handed over the castle to the leaders of the Pilgrimage of Grace, a Catholic rebellion from northern England against the rule of King Henry VIII. Lord Darcy was executed for this alleged \\"surrender,\\" which the king viewed as an act of treason. In 1541, during a royal tour of the provinces, it was alleged that King Henry's fifth wife, Queen Catherine Howard, committed her first act of adultery with Sir Thomas Culpeper at Pontefract Castle, a crime for which she was apprehended and executed without trial. Mary, Queen of Scots was lodged at the castle on 28 January 1569, travelling between Wetherby and Rotherham.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.2 (1900), p.612 =Royalist stronghold= John Lambert on 24 March 1649. Royalists controlled Pontefract Castle at the start of the English Civil War. The first of three sieges began in December 1644 and continued until the following March when Marmaduke Langdale, 1st Baron Langdale of Holme arrived with Royalist reinforcements and the Parliamentarian army retreated. During the siege, mining and artillery caused damage and the Piper Tower collapsed as a result. The second siege began on 21 March 1645, shortly after the end of the first siege, and the garrison surrendered in July after hearing the news of Charles I's defeat at the Battle of Naseby. Parliament garrisoned the castle until June 1648 when Royalists sneaked into the castle and took control. Pontefract Castle was an important base for the Royalists, and raiding parties harried Parliamentarians in the area. Oliver Cromwell led the final siege of Pontefract Castle in November 1648. Charles I was executed in January, and Pontefract's garrison came to an agreement and Colonel Morrice handed over the castle to Major General John Lambert on 24 March 1649. Following requests from the townspeople, the grand jury at York, and Major General Lambert, on 27 March Parliament gave orders that Pontefract Castle should be \\"totally demolished & levelled to the ground\\" and materials from the castle would be sold off. Piecemeal dismantling after the main organised activity of slighting may have further contributed to the castle's ruined state. It is still possible to visit the castle's 11th-century cellars, which were used to store military equipment during the civil war. Preservation The ruins of St Clement's Chapel within the castle Little survives of what \\"must have been one of the most impressive castles in Yorkshire\\" other than parts of the curtain wall and excavated and tidied inner walls. It had inner and outer baileys. Parts of a 12th-century wall and the Piper Tower's postern gate and the foundations of a chapel are the oldest remains. The ruins of the Round Tower or keep are on the 11th-century mound. The Great Gate flanked by 14th-century semi-circular towers had inner and outer barbicans. Chambers excavated into the rock in the inner bailey possibly indicate the site of the old hall and the North Bailey gate is marked by the remains of a rectangular tower. The castle has several unusual features. The donjon has a rare Quatrefoil design. Other examples of this type of Keep are Clifford's Tower, York and at the Ch√¢teau d'√âtampes in France. Pontefract also has an torre albarrana, a fortification almost unknown outside the Iberian Peninsula. Known as the Swillington Tower, the detached tower was attached to the north wall by a bridge. Its purpose was to increase the defender's range of flanking fire. Wakefield Council, who own the site, commissioned William Anelay Ltd to begin repairs on the castle in September 2015, but work stopped in November 2016 when Anelay went into administration. The Council then engaged Heritage Building & Conservation (North) Ltd, who began work on the site in March 2017. A new visitor centre and cafe were opened in July 2017; but in April 2018 the council announced that they had terminated the contract with HB&C; (North) Ltd, as no work had been done since mid-March, and they had not had any reassurances that the work would restart. On Yorkshire Day 2019, the restoration was completed, and the castle was removed from Historic England's \\"Heritage At Risk\\" list.

Gubbins was also responsible for setting up the secret Auxiliary Units, a commando force based around the Home Guard, to operate on the flanks and to the rear of German lines if the United Kingdom were invaded during Operation Sea Lion, Germany's planned invasion. Early life Gubbins was born in Japan on 2 July 1896, the younger son and third child of John Harington Gubbins (1852‚Äì1929), Oriental Secretary at the British Legation. In the 1901 census he is shown living with his grandparents, Colin Alexander McVean and four siblings at Killiemore House on the Isle of Mull. He was educated at Cheltenham College and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich where he graduated 56th out of 70 cadets.Gubbins and SOE by Peter Wilkinson and Joan Brightly 1993 Military service=First World War= Gubbins was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery in 1914. On the outbreak of war he was visiting the German city of Heidelberg in order to improve his German language skills and had to make a perilous journey back to Britain via Belgium, arriving in Dover the day before Britain entered the conflict. Gubbins served as a battery officer on the Western Front ‚Äì initially with the 126th Battery as part of the British Army's 3rd Corps. He first saw action on 22 May 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres and on 9 June was promoted to lieutenant. In July 1916 he participated in the Battle of the Somme and received the Military Cross for rescuing wounded men under fire. On 7 October he was wounded in the neck by a gunshot but recovered fully. In the spring of 1917 Gubbins participated in the Battle of Arras and in the winter suffered the effects of mustard gas. In early 1918 Gubbins was promoted to captain and took part in the Battle of St Quentin. Shortly afterwards he was evacuated from the front with a case of trench fever (17 April 1918).Gubbins and SOEGubbins Private Papers29 Brigade War Diary =Interwar period= In 1919 he joined the staff of General Sir Edmund Ironside in the North Russia Campaign serving as his ADC in Murmansk from 13 April to 27 September 1919. On 2 December 1919 Gubbins was posted to the 47th Battery of the 5th Division in Kildare during the Anglo-Irish War. He served as an intelligence officer and in 1920 attended a three-day course in guerrilla warfare organized by the HQ 5th Division. Gubbins characterised his service in the conflict as \\"being shot at from behind hedges by men in trilbys and mackintoshes and not allowed to shoot back\\".Gubbins Private Papers Promoted to Brigade Major, he provided 18-pounder artillery pieces to the Irish Free State Army for the attack on the secessionist-held (IRA-held) Dublin Four Courts on 28 June 1922. That August he reluctantly provided a gun carriage and six black horses for the funeral of ex-IRA leader Michael Collins who had been assassinated by his former comrades. Eventually he was posted back to England, that October. His experiences in the Russian Civil War and the Anglo-Irish War stimulated his lifelong interest in irregular warfare. One of the lessons drawn from the latter war was the importance of captured enemy documents which had provided the security forces with a wealth of invaluable intelligence on the IRA.British Voices from the Irish War of Independence by William Sheehan p134Michael Collins Intelligence War by Michael T Foy p196A Winter's Tale by Sir Ormonde Winter p295 Upon later establishing SOE, one of the key security features introduced was \\"Commit as little as possible to writing. Memorise if you can. If you must carry documents, select what you must carry. Burn all secret waste and carbons\\".The World War 2 SOE Training Manual p39 After a period with signals intelligence at GHQ India, Gubbins graduated from the Staff College at Quetta in 1928, and in 1931 was appointed GSO3 in the Russian section of the War Office. Having been promoted to brevet major, in 1935 he joined MT1, the policy-making branch of the Military Training Directorate. In October 1938, in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement, he was sent to the Sudetenland as a military member of the International Commission. Promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel, he joined GS(R) ‚Äî later to become MI(R) ‚Äî in April 1939 he co-wrote training manuals on irregular warfare tactics for resistance movements, later translated and dropped into occupied Europe. He also made a visit to Warsaw to discuss sabotage and subversion with the Polish General Staff. =Second World War= When British forces were mobilized in August 1939, Gubbins was appointed Chief of Staff to the military mission to Poland led by Adrian Carton de Wiart. Gubbins and some of a contingent from MI(R) arrived in Warsaw on 3 September, within hours of the British declaration of war, but after only a few days the mission was forced by the rapidly deteriorating situation to abandon Warsaw. They finally crossed into Roumania in late September.Wilkinson and Astley (2010), pp.40‚Äì46 Gubbins and Carton de Wiart were among the first people to report on the effectiveness of the German Panzer tactics. In October 1939, following his return to Britain, Gubbins was sent to Paris as the head of a military mission to the Czech and Polish forces under French command. He was summoned from France in March 1940 to raise the Independent Companies, forerunners of the British Commandos, which he later commanded in several actions in Nordland during the Norwegian Campaign (9 April ‚Äì 10 June 1940). Although he was criticized in some quarters for having asked too much of untried troops, he proved to be a bold and resourceful commander. During the operations around Bod√∏, he assumed command of 24th (Guards) Brigade, and was ruthless in dismissing a Guards battalion commander whose nerve had apparently failed. Gubbins was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his service in the campaign. Although he was recommended for command of a division by Lieutenant General Claude Auchinleck, the commander of all troops in the Norwegian campaign,Wilkinson and Astley (2010), pp.67, 68 on his return to Britain he nevertheless rejoined MI(R) and was directed by General Headquarters Home Forces to form the secret Auxiliary Units, a commando force based around the Home Guard together with regular army sabotage teams, to operate on the flanks and to the rear of German lines if Britain were ever invaded. In November 1940 Gubbins became acting Brigadier and, at the request of Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare, was seconded to the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which had recently been established to \\"coordinate all action by way of sabotage and subversion against the enemy overseas\\". Besides maintaining his existing connections with the Poles and Czechs, Gubbins was given three tasks: to set up training facilities; to devise operating procedures acceptable to the Admiralty and Air Ministry; and to establish close working relations with the Joint Planning Staff. Despite many frustrations and disappointments, mainly due to shortage of aircraft, he persevered with training organizers and dispatching them into the field. The first liaison flight to Poland took place in February 1941, and during 1942 and 1943 European resistance movements aided by SOE scored notable successes, including a raid on a heavy water production plant in Norway. In September 1943 GHQ Middle East, the Foreign Office, and the Joint Intelligence Committee sought to remove SOE's autonomy. Despite having the firm support of Dalton's successor, Lord Selborne, the resulting modus vivendi placed SOE's field operations under the direction of theatre commanders. Sir Charles Hambro, the executive head of SOE, resigned in protest. Gubbins was appointed as his replacement. SOE's position nevertheless remained precarious, and in January 1944 there was a further attempt to dismantle SOE, following the revelation that SOE's operations in the Netherlands had been penetrated by Nazi intelligence. As head of SOE, Gubbins co-ordinated the activities of resistance movements worldwide. Gubbins' role involved consultation at the highest level with the Foreign Office, the Chiefs of Staff, representatives of the resistance organizations, governments-in-exile, and other Allied agencies including particularly the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS). It turned out that the organized resistance was more effective than Whitehall had expected; in northwest Europe, where SOE's activities were under Gubbins's personal control, General Dwight D. Eisenhower later estimated that the contribution of the French Resistance alone had been worth six divisions. Later life When SOE was shut down in 1946 the War Office could offer Gubbins no suitable position, and when he retired from the army he became the managing director of a carpet and textile manufacturer. He remained in touch with people in many of the countries he had helped to liberate, and was invited by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands to join the Bilderberg group. He was also a supporter of the Special Forces Club, which he had co-founded. Personal life Gubbins's first marriage was to Norah Creina (b. 1894) on 22 October 1919. The couple had two sons, the elder, Michael, served in the SOE and was killed at Anzio in 1944. The couple were divorced in 1944 and on 25 September 1950 he married the Norwegian-born Anna Elise Tradin, n√©e Jensen (b. 1914, d. 2007).Obituary in Aftenposten 22 August 2007 No. 385 Death A shooter and fisherman, Gubbins spent his last years at his home in the Hebrides, on the Isle of Harris. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the islands area of the Western Isles in 1976. Gubbins died at Stornoway in the Hebrides on 11 February 1976. Testimonials His star cryptographer at SOE was Leo Marks, whose book Between Silk and Cyanide (1998) contains a detailed portrait of Gubbins and his work as Marks knew it. At one point (p. 222), Marks describes Gubbins: In the book Virtual History (1997), Andrew Roberts and Niall Ferguson call Gubbins \\"one of the war's unsung heroes\\".

The burial place of the MacDonald clan of Glencoe lies on an island - Eilean Munde, St.Munda's or St Munn's or Saint Fintan Munnu's Island, opposite the village. The island burial place was also shared by the Camerons of Callart, on the north shore of the loch, the Stewarts of Ballachulish and Appin and other local families.Tombstone Inscriptions on the Burial Isle of St. Munda (Eilean Munde) on Loch Leven recorded by Alexander MacDonald, 2002 and 2003, for the Glencoe Heritage Trust Ltd. The village of Kinlochleven at the head of the loch was established when the aluminium smelter was built there during the first decade of the twentieth century. It was originally the hamlets of Kinlochmore (Inverness-shire) and Kinlochbeg (Argyll) either side of the River Leven. A road connecting the village to Glencoe and the south was not constructed until 1922: until this date the village could only be reached from the south by boat or on foot. The road on the north of the loch continues on to Fort William (),Dwelly's Illustrated Gaelic to English Dictionary by Edward Dwelly, Gairm Publications, 29 Waterloo Street, Glasgow G2 6BZ (1988) and was built in 1927. For many years the Ballachulish Ferry plied the route across the mouth of the loch, providing a key link on the A82 between Glasgow and Fort William. In 1975 the Ballachulish Bridge replaced the ferry. Under the bridge lie the narrows of Caolas Mhic Ph√†draig. The settlements either side of this point are North and South Ballachulish - Baile a' Chaolais (the settlement on the narrows). There is a fast tidal stream through the narrows, running at up to seven knots at springs; it is wise, therefore, to time and match any passage through the narrows with the tides. Further up the loch, there are several other narrows - principally Caolas na Con - with significant, but diminishing tidal streams. The Caolas na Con represented a considerable barrier to shipping, restricting the size of vessels that could reach Kinlochleven, however in 1907 the channel was dredged and the silt- bearing Allt Gleann a' Chaolais diverted to allow ships bringing alumina to reach the smelter at Kinlochleven.

Located from the Delaware River and from Manhattan, New York City, the lake forms part of the border between Sussex and Morris counties in the state's northern highlands region. Lake Hopatcong was produced by damming and flooding of two ponds, known as the Great Pond and Little Pond, and the Musconetcong River, its natural outlet. Historically known as a resort lake for vacationing New Yorkers, it is now a mostly rural/suburban residential lake. Name The exact origin of the name Hopatcong is unknown, though it is most commonly attributed to the Lenape Indian word for \\"stone water,\\" or \\"stone over water\\".Koppenhaver, Bob. \\"Ye Olde Lake\\". Skylands Visitor. Summer 2013: 8-13. (Print) Some linguists believe \\"Hopatcong\\" to be a derivative of the Lenape word hapakonoesson, meaning \\"pipe stone\\". One explanation of the origin of the word Hopatcong is that it was a derivation from the Lenni Lenape word Huppakong meaning \\"honey waters of many coves\\", but this wording was probably invented at the beginning of the 20th century to stimulate tourism.Welcome to Hopatcong, Historical Information Lakelubbers.com, Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey, USA, Retrieved August 20, 2016,...\\"The origins of the unusual name, Hopatcong, are disputed. Some say that the name derives from the Native American Lenni Lenape word \\"huppakong,\\" meaning \\"honey waters of many coves.\\"...\\"Bob Koppenhaver, NJ Skylands, Lake Hopatcong  Ye Olde Lake, Retrieved August 20, 2016, \\"...One thing is for certain: the name does not mean \\"honey waters of many coves\\", as fanciful early travel writers claimed....\\" Before the late 1700s, Lake Hopatcong was known by several names, including Great Pond and Little Pond (before flooding into a single lake), Sandhay Sea (circa 1648), Brookland Pond (mid-1700s), and Musconetcong Pond (1769). Lake formation Before the last ice age, the waters of the prehistoric Hopatcong basin fed into the Raritan River. The glacier that shaped much of the New Jersey Highlands formed a long terminal moraine that forced water from the basin into the Musconetcong River. The glacier left behind two ponds, nearly apart. In the early 1700s, the Great Pond stretched between Henderson Bay and today's Hopatcong State Park. Little Pond was a small body of water to the south of Woodport. The two lakes were first dammed in 1750. By 1831, Lake Hopatcong had been flooded to nearly its current shape. History=Native Americans= The Lenape Indians discovered the area of Lake Hopatcong about 12,000 years ago. They settled near the Great Pond and Little Pond, which provided abundant fish and forested shores with ample game. The waters became important to the traditions of the matrilineal clans of Native Americans. =Colonial development= Colonial exploration of the Great and Little Ponds began in the 1600s. Between 1750 and 1764, a dam was built on the Musconetcong River for the Brookland forge and mill where the river empties from the lake (now the area of Hopatcong State Park), raising the water level by about and joining the Great and Little Ponds into one. By this time, most of the local Lenape population had died of disease or left the area. In the years that followed the American Revolution, little development occurred near Lake Hopatcong because of the mountainous terrain. =Industrialization= More than 900 feet above sea level, Lake Hopatcong served as a natural high point and primary water supply for the Morris Canal between the Delaware River and New York Harbor. In 1831, the Morris Canal Company purchased the Brookland forge site and replaced the dam with its own, with the intention of using the lake water to supply the Morris Canal, which would connect Phillipsburg to Newark. This new dam raised the water above the original level of Great Pond, and caused the Great Pond to connect with Little Pond and form the current Lake Hopatcong. The flooding and subsequent formation of a single, large lake created a new geography of the area. Halsey Island and Raccoon Island, the only two true islands on Lake Hopatcong, were disconnected from the mainland. Bertrand Island and Liffy Island formed as peninsulas. Other changes included the creation of Prospect Point, the backflowing of the River Styx in Hopatcong to create an inlet, and King Cove and the south end of the lake near Landing. In the 1850s, the Morris and Essex became the first railroad to reach Lake Hopatcong on the southern end. In the 1860s, the Ogden Mine Railroad used Nolan's Point to transfer ore from northern New Jersey mines into canal boats. The railroad and canal system were the chief means of transporting coal, iron and zinc across New Jersey in the 1860s. In 1866, over 880,000 tons of freight was transported on the canal.NJ Dept of Environmental Protection, Hopatcong State Park Website =Resort destination= The Isles Bridge, circa 1911 In 1882, passenger rail service came to Lake Hopatcong, brought by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, which terminated at Nolan's Point. This turned the lake into a popular summer resort. Among the hotels built to support the growing tourism industry was the luxurious Breslin Hotel, constructed in Van Every Cove in Mount Arlington with 250 rooms and electricity.Then and Now: Breslin Hotel. Lake Hopatcong News. October 8, 2009. During peak summer season, the lake was so popular that hotel rooms were difficult to come by and some visitors resorted to camping near the lake.Lake Hopatcong: Hotels are All Crowded and Visitors Obliged to Camp Out. The New York Times. August 19, 1902. Various amusements sprang up around the lake. Bertrand Island Amusement Park was open for the late spring, summer, and early fall seasons. The island also hosted beauty pageants, including an unofficial 1934 Miss America. The Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club, constructed in 1910 on Bertrand Island, remains a landmark. Lake Hopatcong hosted several strong chess tournaments in the 1920s, including the Ninth American Chess Congress in 1923, which was won by Frank Marshall and Abraham Kupchik, and another tournament in 1926, which was won by world champion Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca. Lake Hopatcong flourished in the 1920s, and many famous people owned property on the lake, including Vaudeville's Joe Cook, who owned Sleepless Hollow in Davis Cove; Vaudeville's Owen McGiveney (father to Maura McGiveney), who owned a house in the River Styx section for more than 30 years;Famous Vaudevillian‚Äôs family returns to Lake Hopatcong this month.

Their presence attracted many famous visitors, including Babe Ruth, Bud Abbot, Bert Lahr, and Milton Berle. =Conversion to residential lake= Tourism and other business endeavors near the lake, hit hard by the Great Depression, waned in the 1930s and 1940s. Permanent residences were constructed in the area, including small bungalows, in the 1940s and '50s. Much of the modern residential development surrounding the lake was completed in the 1960s and '70s. =21st century=2000 flood More than 14 inches of rain fell in a small area of southeastern Sussex and northwestern Morris County in northwestern New Jersey during August 11‚Äì14, 2000. Doppler radar estimates of total rainfall for the 4-day period reached about 15 inches along the border between Sussex and Morris Counties. A severe thunderstorm on August 12 dropped so much rain in six hours that it was judged a 1,000-year event. Peak flows at the USGS gauges on Lake Hopatcong (01455400) and Musconetcong River (01455500), among others, were the highest ever recorded. These gauges are at sites that drain areas that received 10 or more inches of rain during August 11‚Äì14. Peak flows on Lake Hopatcong and on the Musconetcong River just downstream from the lake exceeded those of a 100-year flood.SPARTA, NEW JERSEY, FLOOD OF AUGUST 11-14, 2000, U.S. Geologic Survey Lake Hopatcong sustained flooding damage, particularly the Great Cove area at Nolan's Point.Photos of Lake Hopatcong 2000 Flood 2008-09 drawdown Every five years, starting the day after Labor Day, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection‚Äôs (DEP) water level management plan allows the lake to be lowered five feet to allow for inspection of the dam structure, property owners‚Äô repairs to lakeshore structures, aquatic vegetation control, and silt and drainage material removal from areas around the lake.DEP Allows Temporary Water Flow Reduction from Lake Hopatcong. NJDEP Website. April 3, 2009. From December 2008 to January 2009, the DEP left the dam open almost three weeks too long, which caused the water level to drop almost a foot below the normal drawdown level. A coalition of residents and business owners filed suit against the DEP and the State of New Jersey, as of 2009 it was being appealed in local court. The suit claims that the DEP, against their own policy, carelessly allowed an excess of of water to be released through the dam.Wright, Peggy. Lake Hopatcong merchants' suit vs. DEP sent to appeals court. Daily Record. May 1, 2009. On May 11, 2009, the American Power Boat Association (APBA) and the Lake Hopatcong Racing Association (LHRA) decided to postpone their annual races due to the low water level.Zusman, Charles. Powerboat racing postponed at the lake. NJ.com website. May 12, 2009. However, with the large amount of rainfall that was recorded in the month of June, the lake returned to its proper level above the normal average depth. The return of the water level came just in time for the beginning of summer and the arrival of the weather required for boating. In July 2014, there were reports of a boa constrictor seen in the lake,Star-Ledger, July 15, 2014, JANE PRIMERANO, Reptile expert to search for boa constrictor reportedly seen in Lake Hopatcong, Accessed July 15, 2014, \\"...the search for a boa constrictor that has been spotted by several individuals in Lake Hopatcong....\\" but officials by August mostly figured it was a myth or a hoax.August 1, 2014 DEP shuts down snake in Lake Hopatcong theory, others not so sure, Retrieved August 21, 2016, \\"...Larry Ragonese, the DEP‚Äôs chief spokesman, didn‚Äôt discount the idea that a pet owner got tired of the maintenance...

Today Lake Hopatcong is now mostly a residential lake whose few public access points include Hopatcong State Park and Lee's County Park Marina.Morris County Park Commission Website for Lee's County Park Marina Most of the shoreline is privately owned by individual lakefront residents, homeowner or community associations, or private businesses (e.g., restaurants and marinas). Lake Hopatcong, unlike most lakes in New Jersey (other than Greenwood Lake on the New York border and Lake Lackawanna in Byram), has bars and restaurants that are accessible directly by boat. Popular tourist attractions on the lake include the Hopatcong State Park, the Lake Hopatcong Historical Museum, and the Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club. Sandcastle at Lake Hopatcong. On November 22, 2005, the EPA gave the Lake Hopatcong Commission a federal grant of $745,000 to improve the water quality and prevent phosphorus from entering the lake.EPA brings $745K to Lake Hopatcong. Roxbury Register. December 1, 2005. pp. 1‚Äì2. Lake management Lake Hopatcong is shared by two counties (Sussex and Morris) and four boroughs and townships (Mount Arlington, Hopatcong, Jefferson Township, and Roxbury Township). At some point in the 20th century, decisions about lake management were shaped by the state-funded Lake Hopatcong Regional Planning Board, which made recommendations to the state. Made up of representatives from each town, county, and the state, the board proved ineffective. Weeds proliferated, water quality declined, and recreation suffered.Zoschak, Aughey named to new Lake Hopatcong Commission. New Jersey Hills. March 22, 2001. In January 2001, Governor of New Jersey Christine Whitman signed a bill to create the Lake Hopatcong Commission, a state-funded governing body with an annual budget to maintain, upgrade and protect the lake.Whitman signs bill creating lake commission. New Jersey Hills. January 18, 2001. The commission consists of 11 members: a representative from Morris county, Sussex county, Hopatcong, Jefferson Twp, Mount Arlington, and Roxbury Twp, and five state members, including one from the Department of Environmental Protection and one from Community Affairs. The chairperson of the commission and two other public members are appointed by the governor. But the commission has seen annual budget cuts since its inception, and has provided little more than weed harvesting services.Lake Hopatcong Commission on last legs? Condon, Mike. October 17, 2012.

With the probable exception of the Delaware River, Lake Hopatcong is home to the greatest variety of gamefish species of any waterway in New Jersey. Each spring, the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife stocks the lake with rainbow trout, and in past years also stocked brook and brown trout, although they have not typically held over and survived the summers, due to an absence of cold, deep, oxygenated pockets of water in the lake. Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, sunfish, yellow and white perch, rock bass, bluegill, crappie, chain pickerel, channel catfish, bullhead, and carp all inhabit the lake. Eels also have been caught. Hybrid striped bass, walleye, and most recently, muskellunge have been stocked within the last few decades and now are thriving. Catfish also are stocked from time to time. The main forage is the abundant alewife herring, (Clupea vernalis), the basis of the lake's fish food chain.

The suburbs that make up the Inner West are predominantly located along the southern shore of Port Jackson (Parramatta River), stretching south to the shores of the Cooks River. The western boundary of the Inner West is the A3 arterial road (Homebush Bay Drive / Centenary Drive), which divides the Inner West from the Greater Western Sydney region. The Inner West is much larger than the Inner West Council local government area. The Inner West roughly corresponds with the Parish of Petersham and Parish of Concord, two cadastral divisions used for land titles. Suburbs The boundaries of the Inner West region are customary, not administrative or legal, and as such are defined differently in different contexts. The northern and southern boundaries are natural and thus generally well defined: they are the Parramatta River and the Cooks River respectively. In the west, the upper reaches of the Cooks River flow close to, but do not meet, the Parramatta River, and the western boundary is thus ill-defined. However, in many contexts this boundary is defined as the A3 arterial road (Homebush Bay Drive / Centenary Drive), which runs north-south close to the source of the Cooks River and the point at which the two rivers run closest to each other. The area immediately to the west of the A3 near the source of the Cooks River is largely occupied by Rookwood Cemetery, Sydney Olympic Park and other parkland, railways and industrial land, and so forms a convenient and well defined dividing strip between the Inner West and the Greater Western Sydney region. The eastern boundary is less well defined, as many suburbs immediately to the west of the Sydney city centre are alternatively regarded as part of the Inner West or as part of the City or \\"inner city\\" region. The Inner West is alternatively defined as corresponding to the Parish of Petersham and Parish of Concord, two cadastral divisions used for land titles. This largely agrees with the customary definition above, except for some suburbs immediately to the east or west of the cadastral boundaries. For example, the western boundary of the Parish of Concord follows the course of a creek that approximates the boundary between Homebush and Homebush West. The parish therefore excludes Homebush West even though that suburbs lies mostly east of the A3 road. Conversely, the suburb of Rhodes is mostly west of the A3 road but in the Parish of Concord. The Australian Bureau of Statistics also defines a statistical region (Statistical Area Level 4) called \\"Inner West\\". This region is mostly a subset of the regions in the two definitions outlined above, excluding the inner western and southwestern suburbs such as Glebe, Enmore and Marrickville. As it is based on suburb boundaries, it also includes some small areas that fall outside the definitions outlined above, such as the part of the Municipality of Strathfield that lie south of the Cooks River and west of the A3 road.2016 Census QuickStats - Sydney - Inner West Based on the former distribution area of the Inner West Courier local newspaper and various Inner West Courier and media articles, the Inner West generally includes the suburbs: * Abbotsford * Annandale * Ashbury * Ashfield * Balmain * Balmain East * Belfield * Birchgrove * Breakfast Point * Burwood * Burwood Heights * Cabarita * Camperdown * Campsie * Canada Bay * Canterbury * Chiswick * Concord * Concord West * Croydon * Croydon Park * Drummoyne * Dulwich Hill * Enfield * Enmore * Erskineville * Five Dock * Forest Lodge * Glebe * Haberfield * Homebush * Homebush West * Hurlstone Park * Leichhardt * Lewisham * Liberty Grove * Lilyfield * Marrickville * Mortlake * Newington * Newtown * North Strathfield * Petersham * Rhodes * Rodd Point * Rozelle * Russell Lea * St Peters * Stanmore * Strathfield * Strathfield South * Summer Hill * Sydenham * Tempe * Wareemba * Wentworth Point History=Indigenous land= Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet, the Sydney region was home to the Darug people. This nation was broken up into a number of Aboriginal clans who tended to live in a certain geographic area. Each clan contained about 50 to 100 people and, to avoid genetic problems, the men would marry women from other clans. So the clans were interrelated and members from one clan would frequently travel in the territory of others, including to hunt, trade and perform ceremonies. They didn't consider themselves owners of the land, rather custodians.Speed the Plough ‚Äî Ashfield 1788-1988, by Sheena & Robert Coupe, published by Ashfield Municipal Council, 1988 What is now the Inner West was formerly home to two clans, the Cadigal, whose land stretched along Port Jackson from South Head to Lewisham, and the Wangal, whose land was immediately to the west of the Cadigals and stretched to about Homebush Bay. Other clans that would have been regular visitors to the area would have included the Birrabirragal and Muru-ora-dial in what is now the Eastern Suburbs, the Bediagal and Kameygal from the Cooks River area to the south, the Burramattagal from the Parramatta area to the west, and the Wallumattagal, Cammeraigal and Gorualgal from the northern shores of the Parramatta River. =European arrival= A coach, marked \\"Ashfield-Burwood\\", is heading down Parramatta Road towards Sydney in the 1870s (the University of Sydney is in the background). Yasmar, in Haberfield, built in the 1850s. Land grants in the Inner West area began in the late 18th century. By 1814, a stage coach was running between the two major settlements of Sydney (to the east) and Parramatta (to the west), then further west to Richmond. This spurred the development of several settlements along the stage coach route, now Parramatta Road. A number of the large land grants in the area were subdivided for commercial and residential development, such as Ashfield Park in 1838. The construction of the Main Suburban railway line in 1855 spurred further development, especially at the original stations of Newtown, Ashfield, Burwood and Homebush. Many of the original land grants in the area were subdivided for commercial and residential development in the decades following the arrival of the railway, such as the Village of Homebush in 1878. The colony's elite - politicians, judges, industrialists and businessmen - began to build grand homes in the \\"outer\\" parts of the Inner West, such as the Arnott family (of the biscuit empire) and the family of David Jones (the retailer), who built various homes in Strathfield. As a result of population growth, local governments formed in the area in the 19th century, such as the Municipality of Newtown in 1862, the Municipality of Petersham, the Municipality of Leichhardt and the Municipality of Ashfield in 1871, the Municipality of Ashfield in 1874, the Municipality of Concord in 1883 and the Municipality of Strathfield in 1885. During the last quarter of the 19th century, Sydney's tram network expanded into the Inner West, and continued expanding into the early 20th century, eventually serving almost all of the Inner West, as far afield as Cabarita, Enfield and Canterbury. In 1895, a suburban railway line was built, branching from the Illawarra Line at Sydenham, which provided access to the railway for suburbs in the south of the Inner West, such as Marrickville and Dulwich Hill. =Industrial and residential development= Commercial premises along Parramatta Road and suburban housing in Five Dock, in the 1930s. The Lever Brothers factory in Balmain, an example of industrial use of the Inner West waterfront, in 1939. Due to its central location and easy access by water, rail and road, large scale industrial development occurred in the Inner West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A number of large residences were turned to industrial use, such as Arthur Renwick's Abbotsford House, which became Nestl√©'s chocolate factory. However, the residential suburbs continued to be popular. For example, Australian prime ministers who lived in the Inner West in this period include William McMahon, Earle Page, George Reid, Frank Forde and Billy Hughes. A number of the high quality residential developments in the period immediately after the Federation of Australia are highly regarded ensembles of Australian residential architecture and heritage protected, including the large scale Haberfield \\"garden suburb\\" development, which began in 1901, the smaller Malvern Hill Estate in Croydon, which began in 1909, and the Hoskins Estate in Appian Way, Burwood, which began in 1903. Suburbanisation accelerated in the interwar years, resulting in the outer suburbs of the Inner West, such as Strathfield, Burwood and Concord, growing in prestige while the dense inner suburbs, such as Newtown, Enmore and Erskinville, declined. =Post-war migration and gentrification= Historic bank, Balmain An influx of migrants to Australia following the end of World War II brought a large number of migrants to the Inner West, primarily from European countries. Many migrants were attracted to the area by the availability of industrial jobs, proximity to the City and the good availability of public transport. The change in demographics also brought ethnically distinct shops, cafes and restaurants, giving a cosmopolitan character to the commercial areas of a number of commercial centres in the Inner West. For example, Haberfield and Leichhardt became distinguished by the concentration of Italian businesses, while Petersham became the hub of Sydney's Portuguese community. Continued industrial development and the influx of blue collar workers, including European immigrants, accelerated the disparity between suburbs. In 1977, Strathfield was the most expensive suburb in metropolitan Sydney measured by median house price, while inner suburbs of the Inner West, such as Leichardt, were cheaper than outer Western suburbs such as Bankstown.Domain, What Sydney prices looked like 40 years ago when Bankstown was more expensive than Leichhardt The pattern of immigrant settlement continued and radiated further west after the end of the White Australia Policy changed the ethnic makeup of Australia's migrant intake. For example, in the late 20th century, Ashfield became a hub for Chinese immigrants, especially those from Shanghai, known as \\"Little Shanghai\\". Burwood has likewise become a hub for Chinese immigrants and overseas students. Towards the end of the 20th century, the proliferation of alternative cultures in the inner suburbs such as Newtown led to a wave of gentrification. Geography The geography in the northern part of the Inner West is dominated by a series of large bays (Hen and Chicken Bay and Abbostford Bay pictured) and the peninsulas between them. The geography of the Inner West is defined by the southern catchments of the Parramatta River, the northern boundary of the region, and the northern catchment of the Cooks River, the southern boundary. The western boundary of the region is near the source of the Cooks River. The Hume Highway approximately follows the ridgeline between the two catchments. In this region, Parramatta River widens via a series of bays and transitions into the drowned valley that forms Sydney Harbour. This forms a series of large bays along the southern shore, the largest of these being (from west to east) Homebush Bay, Hen and Chicken Bay and Iron Cove. The presence of these bays have had a significant effect on patterns of development in the region and the placement of infrastructure such as roads and railways. In between the two rivers, the topography is characterised by rolling hills intersected by shallow valleys through which waterways flow to the two rivers, including Iron Cove Creek, Hawthorne Canal (formerly Long Cove Creek), Whites Creek and Johnstons Creek. These waterways have been drastically altered since the late 19th century by the means of concrete lining. In the 1860s iron Cove Creek was a freely flowing waterway which in places broadened into ponds that made excellent and picturesque swimming holes. It is now barely a trickle lined by residential areas, parkland and fast-food restaurants. Housing The housing stock within the Inner West reflects the distinct waves of development in its history. The inner-most suburbs of the Inner West were developed early in the life of the colony, and preserve stone houses from the Victorian era and earlier. The inner suburbs of the Innwer West were largely subdivided in the 19th century for suburban development, and a large number of two-storey terraced houses and one-storey terraced and timber cottages survive in suburbs such as Glebe, Newtown and Annandale. Further away from the City, a large number of grand houses of the Victorian era are stills standing, though many have been subdivided or are no longer in residential use. After these suburbs were subdivided around the turn of the 20th century, Federation architecture dominated the style of suburban houses, simplifying over time to the Australian Californian bungalow style which is still found throughout most of the inner west. While many of the older houses have been replaced by new constructions, a number of areas have retained contiguous areas of housing stock from the early 20th century or earlier, and a number of heritage conservation zones have been created to preserve the character of these areas. During the 20th century, low- to medium-rise apartment blocks began to proliferate, especially along the railway line. These have in turn been succeeded by the construction of medium- to high-rise apartment blocks in the late 20th century, especially around major stations such as Strathfield and Burwood, and in the redevelopment of formerly industrial land throughout the region and especially along the Parramatta River waterfront. Nevertheless, government planning controls seek to preserve the low-density residential land use throughout much of the Inner West.

Schools School of the Arts, Newtown Fort Street High School, Petersham It is also the location of several tertiary institutions such as Australian Catholic University, Catholic Institute of Sydney, the University of Sydney, which is reflected in the high student population, both in the areas around these institutions, and in the suburbs further away that are well connected to educational institutions by public transport. The Inner West has a high concentration of public and private secondary schools, many of which were established in the 19th century. Government high schools located in the Inner West include the selective secondary schools Fort Street High School and Sydney Secondary College, and the public comprehensive high schools Burwood Girls High School, Homebush Boys High School, Strathfield Girls High School and Ashfield Boys High School. Private schools in the Inner West include the Presbyterian Ladies' College in Croydon, Meriden School, St. Patrick's College and Santa Sabina College all in Strathfield, MLC School in Burwood, Trinity Grammar School in Summer Hill (preparatory school in Strathfield), Newington College in Stanmore and Rosebank College in Five Dock. Transport Petersham railway station Public transport in the region includes trains, buses, ferries and light rail. Sydney Trains Inner West & Leppington Line runs from Central station, largely running south of Parramatta Road to Strathfield and then to Macarthur via Granville. The Northern Line follows the same route to Strathfield and then branches off to the north to Epping, with stops at North Strathfield, Concord West and Rhodes. The Bankstown Line follows a more southerly alignment, and provides train services to suburbs such as Erskineville, St Peters, Sydenham, Marrickville and Dulwich Hill. There are various bus routes provided largely by State Transit and Transit Systems. Sydney Ferries operates services in the inner harbour and Parramatta River, with a number of wharves serving suburbs in the northern part of the Inner West. The Dulwich Hill Line of Sydney's light rail network connects to to the Inner West via Pyrmont, with stops in Glebe, Lilyfield, Leichhardt, Lewisham and , where it connects to the Bankstown railway line. Parramatta Road is a major arterial road that runs through the middle of the Inner West, connecting it with the major centres of Sydney City in the east and Parramatta in the west. At Summer Hill, Liverpool Road (the Hume Highway) branches from Parramatta Road and proceeds in a southwesterly direction towards Melbourne. The M4 road largely runs as a motorway tunnel under the western part of the Inner West, parallel to Parramatta Road. At the eastern end of the tunnel in Ashfield, it branches north to become the A4 road which runs to the Sydney CBD, while another branch joins Parramatta Road. The ongoing WestConnex project will eventually extend the tunnel further east to bypass the surface road section of the A4 and also to connect with the M8 motorway. Although still playing only a small part in the overall transport task, use of bicycles for transport has increased significantly in the Inner West since the 1990s. Denser populations and shorter distances mean cycling is often quicker and more convenient than driving or taking public transport. A network of bicycle paths, signed bicycle routes on local streets and other aids to safe and convenient cycling is developing. Main bicycle routes include an East-West route from Five Dock to the Anzac Bridge cycleway, a Northwest route from Gladesville Bridge to Anzac Bridge, a Southwest Route from Marrickville to the City via Newtown. Groups of local bicycle user groups (BUGs) provide help for new cyclists, under the parent banner of Bicycle New South Wales.Home - Bicycle NSW Government In the state parliament, the region is represented by the electoral districts of Balmain, Canterbury, Drummoyne, Newtown, Strathfield and Summer Hill. Following the 2015 state election, these seats were divided amongst the three main parties with Drummoyne represented by the Liberal Party, Canterbury, Strathfield and Summer Hill represented by the Australian Labor Party, and Balmain and Newtown represented by The Greens. In the federal parliament, the area is represented by the electorate of Grayndler and part of the electorates of Reid, Sydney and Watson (which also encompasses a substantial section of the Canterbury-Bankstown area). Three of these four seats are currently held by the Labor Party, with the seat of Reid represented by the Liberal Party at the 2013 federal election, which won the seat for the first time in 91 years. =Local Government areas= The Inner West is an imprecise geographical region. The Australian Government Bureau of Statistics, the New South Wales Government Department of Planning and Infrastructure, and local media variously describe the Inner West region to include all (or some) of the following local government areas: * Municipality of Burwood * City of Canada Bay * Inner West Council * Municipality of Strathfield * The northeastern part of the City of Canterbury-Bankstown * The western part of the City of Sydney. Sport The Inner West is represented in the National Rugby League by the Wests Tigers, a merger of the Balmain and Western Suburbs clubs. The Region also has another team that represents the region, they're the Canterbury- Bankstown Bulldogs. In the tier below known as the New South Wales Cup, the area is represented by the Newtown Jets and Wests Tigers. In rugby union, the area is represented by Sydney Uni (the University of Sydney) and West Harbour in the Sydney grade competition. The Inner West also has many semi- professional soccer teams playing in the various divisions of the NSW State Leagues. The most high profile club is NSW Premier League side APIA Leichhardt Tigers. Religion St Paul's Anglican Church, Burwood In the 2016 Census, the most common responses for religion in the Sydney Inner West were No Religion, 31.7%, Catholic 27.4%, Not stated 9.4%, Anglican 6.9% and Hinduism 5.4%.

The school was founded in 1584 by Robert Johnson, the Archdeacon of Leicester who also established Oakham School. The school's Headmaster, Richard J. Maloney, is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the school is a member of the Rugby Group of independent schools in the United Kingdom. The Reverend Edward Thring (headmaster 1853‚Äì1887) was perhaps the school's best-known headmaster. His changes to the school's curriculum were later adopted in other English public schools. John Wolfenden, headmaster from 1934 to 1944, was notable for later chairing the Wolfenden Committee whose report recommending the decriminalisation of homosexuality was published in 1957. Uppingham has a tradition of high musical standards, based on the work of Paul David and Robert Sterndale Bennett and has opened a new music school, a fusion of new and old buildings named after the first Director of Music, Paul David. Uppingham has the greatest area of playing fields of any school in England, in three separate areas on different sides of the town: the Leicester to the west, the Middle to the south, and the Upper to the east.I Never Knew That About England, by Christopher Winn, Ebury Press, 2005 History Old School In 1584 Uppingham School was founded with a hospital, or almshouse, by Archdeacon Robert Johnson. The original 1584 Schoolroom in Uppingham churchyard is still owned by the school and is a Grade I listed building. The original hospital building is now incorporated in the School Library. The first recorded Uppingham schoolboy was Henry Ferne from York, who was Chaplain to Charles I. Another prominent early schoolboy was the Jesuit Anthony Turner, one of the martyrs of the Popish Plot. In the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries Uppingham remained a small school of 30‚Äì60 pupils, with two staff. Despite its small size, pupils then, (as now,) regularly gained places and scholarships to Oxford and Cambridge universities. During that period, various features of life in the school developed which are still in evidence today. Uppingham became a full boarding school, with all pupils having individual studies. This pattern was established around 1800, and some of these original studies still survive, although they are no longer in use. The first recorded school play was performed in 1794 and Uppingham has a thriving theatre. The main recreation in the 19th century was cricket ‚Äì the first recorded cricket match, described in the school magazine, was in 1815 ‚Äì and the game still thrives at Uppingham. In 1846 the Institution of School Praepostors, or Prefects, was established and still operates. The Praepostors are universally called \\"Pollies\\" around the school. As now, certain pupils were to gain distinction in later life, an early example being Professor Thomas Bonney, at Uppingham in the 1850s, the most distinguished geologist of his time, and President of the Alpine Club. Edward Thring transformed the school from a small, high-quality local grammar school into a large, well-known public school, with 330 pupils. During his headship on 4 April 1876 the entire school, consisting of 300 boys, 30 masters and their families, moved temporarily to Borth in Wales after an outbreak of typhoid ravaged the town as a result of the poorly maintained water system. In Borth the school took over the disused Cambrian Hotel and a number of boarding houses, for a period of 14 months. The move was successful in saving the school from a serious epidemic. The move to Borth is commemorated in an annual service, held in the school chapel. Thring also won national and transatlantic reputation as an original thinker and writer on education. His ideas are still important today: every pupil must receive full and equal attention; as much time should be spent in class on an ordinary as on a brilliant pupil; those not intellectually gifted should have opportunities to succeed in other occupations; scattered boarding house enshrine a different and higher life; each pupil must have a small study of his own. At a time when Maths and Classics dominated the curriculum he encouraged many ‚Äòextra‚Äô subjects: French, German, Science, History, Art, Carpentry and Music. In particular Thring was a pioneer in his introduction of Music into the regular system of education; thus were the foundations laid for Uppingham‚Äôs present flourishing musical life. He also opened the first gymnasium in an English school, the forerunner of the present Sports Hall, and later added a heated indoor swimming pool. He also commissioned a number of impressive buildings, notably the chapel designed by the famous Gothic Revival architect G. E. Street. Ernest William Hornung was at the school in the 1880s; he wrote several novels but his fame rests upon his creation of the character A. J. Raffles. School cricket pavilion by Walter Tapper, built as a war memorial in 1923 During this period the school continued to grow, with numbers reaching well over 400. These years saw the formation in 1889 of the Combined Cadet Force; the creation in 1890 of the first school orchestra; in 1896 the re-introduction of hockey; and the adoption of rugby football, with the first match being against Rugby. Uppingham pupils still take part in all these activities today. Uppingham School football team, 1862 The buildings of the school also continued to grow with the construction of the Tower block, through which you still enter the school, and the combined gymnasium and concert hall ‚Äì which in 1972 was converted into the school theatre. Throughout the Second World War the buildings of Kingswood School in Bath were used by the Admiralty for strategic planning. During that time Kingswood School lodged with Uppingham School sharing Uppingham's resources. Pupils have continued to go on to later fame ‚Äì Patrick Abercrombie, pioneer Town Planner; Sir Malcolm Campbell, motor racer; James Elroy Flecker, poet and playwright: CRW Nevinson, official war artist in both world wars; WH Pratt (Boris Karloff), film actor; E.J. Moeran, composer; Lt General Sir Brian Horrocks, Commander of the XXX Corps under Montgomery, and later a TV lecturer on battles and war; and Percy Chapman, captain of the England cricket team 1926‚Äì30, who won the Ashes. The growth of the school continued with numbers of well over 600 pupils being reached in the 1960s. In 1973 the first girl attended Uppingham, as a day- girl; with a few more added in 1974. Then in 1975 the first Sixth Form Girls' House, Fairfield, was opened, with its full complement of 50 girls achieved by 1976. This venture proved so successful that in 1986 a second Girls' House, Johnson's, was opened; and in 1994 the Lodge House (formerly a Boys' House) was converted into the third Girls' House. In 2001 the first 13-year-old girls entered the school, with the opening of a new house, Samworths', the first house for girls aged 13‚Äì18; followed in 2002 by the conversion of Fairfield into a second house for 13‚Äì18-year-old girls and another new house, New House, opened in 2004. Johnson's was converted to a 13‚Äì18 girls' house in 2011 with an extension and significant internal reconstruction. The buildings of the school continued to expand. Four hundred and fifty ex-pupils died in the First World War and the School Hall was built in their memory. Also built in this period were the main classroom block in the centre of the school, the cricket and rugby pavilions, and a school sanatorium. In 1956 the new Science Block was opened by the Duke of Edinburgh; it was extended in the 1960s. In 1989 a new Maths Block, to house Mathematics and Computing was opened by Professor Stephen Hawking. New squash courts were built and in 1970 the Sports Centre, incorporating the old swimming pool was opened, with the later addition of a climbing wall and a weights room. In 1981 a new Music School and a new Buttery, where the pupils can buy snacks, were built. In 1995 the new Arts and Design Faculty was built, the Leonardo Centre, designed by old pupil Piers Gough. In 2003 the Language Centre (TLC), housing all the Modern Languages classrooms, opened. In 2006 a third Music facility, the Paul David Music School (PDMS), opened on School Lane, incorporating all the old houses that were there, to accommodate the growing demand for music at the school. In 2010 the Uppingham School Sports Centre (USSC) was completed, and the old sports centre demolished to create space to develop the new Science Centre, all part of the new 'Western Quad'. In the post-war period, sports other than the main ones of rugby, hockey, cricket, athletics, swimming and shooting began to be introduced including tennis, basketball, badminton, fencing, squash, sailing, soccer and golf. School Lane; on the right is the Memorial Hall, built in the 1920s. The buildings on the left are now part of the school's Music Centre. The building beyond the arch is the library, originally the hospital In 1945 Douglas Guest succeeded Robert Sterndale Bennett as Director of Music and this area of school life developed even further. The concert choir was increased until it contained over half the school: a bandmaster was appointed; music scholarships were introduced; and various music societies were created. All these innovations still flourish. In the 1960s Uppingham pioneered the introduction of Design and Technology into the curriculum, with Uppingham being the first independent school, and one of the first 5 schools in Britain, to evolve and introduce A-level Design. Design was taught in the Thring Centre, opened in 1965. These subjects were then transferred with Art, Woodwork and Metalwork to the Leonardo Centre, opened in 1995. The years since the 1970s have also seen a considerable expansion in the subjects taught, particularly at A-level, with the introduction of Politics, Ancient History, Design, Business Studies, Theatre Studies, Classical Civilisation, Spanish, Italian, Philosophy & Religious Studies, ICT and Physical Education. Uppingham is considered one of Britain's best schools for music, and the school's music facilities have been improved considerably recently. The school houses two large three-manual pipe organs, in the Memorial Hall and the chapel; the latter was substantially rebuilt in the summer of 2007 by Nicholson Organs of Malvern. A completely new choir division is now situated high on the south wall, and a new console and action has been installed, along with new pipework. The organ is notable for its smooth Harrison tone and rare two independent sets of Swell shutters ‚Äì one opening westwards into the nave extension and one southwards across the repositioned choir stalls. Uppingham has one of the largest private theatres in the country, in a building based on the original Leipzig Gewandhaus. An extension to the main theatre houses a Drama studio to be used for the teaching of Theatre Studies as well as for performances of smaller productions. There is also a large workshop to provide storage and workspace for technical equipment. =Recent developments= In 2005 the school was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by The Times, which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of ¬£10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. However, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long- established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, \\"They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.\\" In May 2010, a pupil rebellion was staged over the expulsion of several Sixth-Form pupils. For an entire day, 500 pupils failed to attend classes and formed protests in aid of the dismissed pupils. In March 2011, twice Olympic gold medalist Lord Coe officially opened the school's new sports centre. The building includes a large sports hall, 25m swimming pool, a 50-station fitness studio, squash courts, gymnasium and two dance studios. It was designed by ORMS Architecture Design and is part of the School's plans to develop the western campus buildings. The school also now has, in a converted squash court behind the theatre, a climbing wall facility, installed in 2010. In November 2014, Professor Sir Alan Jeffreys officially opened the school's new Science Centre which, along with an extension to the Leonardo Centre, completed the new 'Western Quad'. In 2018, the cricket pavilion was listed as Grade II by Historic England. Houses There are nine boys' boarding houses at Uppingham, informally split into three groups: *The 'Hill Houses' are Brooklands, Fircroft and Highfield (1863); *The 'Town Houses' are School House, Lorne House, West Deyne (1859) and West Bank; *The 'Country Houses' are Meadhurst and Farleigh. There are six girls' boarding houses: Johnson's, The Lodge (sixth form only), Fairfield, New House, Constables and Samworths'. Samworths' was built in 2001 as the first house for girls aged 13 to 18. It was named after the Samworth Brothers, Old Uppinghamians who helped to finance the construction. Quatercentenary Elizabeth II visited the school on the occasion of the Quatercentenary, on 16 November 1984.

It resulted in the deaths of over 200 people, and is the worst rail disaster in British history. The Quintinshill signal box controlled two passing loops, one on each side of the double-track Caledonian Main Line linking Glasgow and Carlisle (now part of the West Coast Main Line). At the time of the accident, both passing loops were occupied with goods trains and a northbound local passenger train was standing on the southbound main line. The first collision occurred when a southbound troop train travelling from to Liverpool collided with the stationary local train. A minute later the wreckage was struck by a northbound sleeping car express train travelling from London Euston to Glasgow Central. Gas from the Pintsch gas lighting system of the old wooden carriages of the troop train ignited, starting a fire which soon engulfed all five trains. Only half the soldiers on the troop train survived. Those killed were mainly Territorial soldiers from the 1/7th (Leith) Battalion, the Royal Scots heading for Gallipoli. The precise death toll was never established with confidence as some bodies were never recovered, having been wholly consumed by the fire, and the roll list of the regiment was also destroyed in the fire. The official death toll was 227 (215 soldiers, 9 passengers and three railway employees), but the army later reduced their 215 by one. Not counted in the 227 were four victims thought to be children, but whose remains were never claimed or identified. The soldiers were buried together in a mass grave in Edinburgh's Rosebank Cemetery, where an annual remembrance is held. An official inquiry, completed on 17 June 1915 for the Board of Trade, found the cause of the collision to be neglect of the rules by two signalmen. With the northbound loop occupied, the northbound local train had been reversed onto the southbound line to allow passage of two late-running northbound sleepers. Its presence was then overlooked, and the southbound troop train was cleared for passage. As a result, both were charged with manslaughter in England, then convicted of culpable homicide after trial in Scotland; the two terms are broadly equivalent. After they were released from a Scottish jail in 1916, they were re-employed by the railway company, although not as signalmen. Background Site of the disaster photographed in 2014. Left to right: up loop; up main (where the first collision occurred); down main; down loop. The signal box was on the outside of the up loop. The disaster occurred at Quintinshill signal box, which was an intermediate box in a remote location, sited to control two passing loops, one on each side of the double-track main line of the Caledonian Railway. On that section of the main line between Carlisle and Glasgow, in British railway parlance, Up is towards Carlisle and Down is towards Glasgow. The area around was thinly-populated countryside with scattered farms. The Ordnance Survey 1:2500 map of 1859 (but not modern maps) shows a house named Quintinshill at approximately 55.0133¬∞N 3.0591¬∞W, around south-south-east of the signal box. The nearest settlement was Gretna, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to the south of the box, on the Scottish side of the Anglo-Scottish border. Responsibility for Quintinshill signal box rested with the stationmaster at Gretna station who, on the day of the accident, was Alexander Thorburn. The box was staffed by one signalman, on a shift system. In the mornings, a night-shift signaller would be relieved by the early-shift signaller at 6.00 am. On the day of the disaster, George Meakin was the night signalman, while James Tinsley was to work the early day shift. At the time of the accident, normal northbound traffic through the section included two overnight sleeping car expresses, from London to Glasgow and Edinburgh respectively, which were due to depart Carlisle at 5.50 am and 6.05 am. They were followed by an all-stations local passenger service from Carlisle to , which was advertised in the public timetable as departing Carlisle at 6.10 am but which normally departed at 6.17 am. If the sleepers ran late, the local service could not be held back to depart from Carlisle after them, because precedence would then need to be given to the scheduled departure of rival companies' express trains at 6.30 am and 6.35 am. Also, any late running of the local train would cause knock-on delays to a Moffat to Glasgow and Edinburgh commuter service, with which the stopper connected at Beattock. Therefore, in the event of one or both of the sleepers running late, the stopping train would depart at its advertised time of 6.10 am, and then be shunted at one of the intermediate stations or signal boxes to allow the sleeper(s) to overtake it. One of the locations where that could take place was Quintinshill, where there were passing loops for both Up and Down lines. If the Down (northbound) loop was occupied, as it was on the morning of the accident, then the northbound local train would be shunted, via a trailing crossover, to the Up (southbound) main line. Although not a preferred method of operation, it was allowed by the rules and was not considered a dangerous manoeuvre, provided the proper precautions were taken. In the six months before the accident, the 6.17 am local train had been shunted at Quintinshill 21 times, and on four of those occasions it had been shunted onto the Up line.  Accident = Preceding train movements = Animation of the series of events causing the crash. The disaster occurred on the morning of 22 May. On this morning, both of the northbound night expresses were running late, and the northbound local train required to be shunted at Quintinshill, but the Down passing loop was occupied by the 4.50 am goods train from Carlisle. Two southbound trains were also due to pass through the box's section of track - a special freight train consisting of empty coal wagons, and a special troop train. With the Down loop occupied, night shift signalman Meakin decided to shunt the local passenger train onto the Up main line. At this point, the southbound empty coal train was standing at the Up Home signal to the north of Quintinshill, and accordingly it was still occupying the section from Kirkpatrick (the next signalbox to the north). This meant that signalman Meakin had not yet telegraphed Kirkpatrick the \\"train out of section\\" signal for the empty coal train, which in turn meant that he could not send the \\"blocking back\\" signal to advise the Kirkpatrick signalman that the local train was standing on the Up main line. Once the local train had crossed onto the Up main line, Meakin allowed the empty coal wagon train to proceed into the Up loop. Arriving late aboard the local train, the early day shift signalman Tinsley reached Quintinshill signalbox shortly after 6.30 am. At 6.34 am one of the signalmen (it was never established which) gave the \\"train out of section\\" bell to Kirkpatrick for the coal train. At this point, two crucial failures in signalling procedure occurred (see Rules breaches). After being relieved by signalman Tinsley, the night duty signalman Meakin remained in the signalbox reading the newspaper which Tinsley had brought. Both guards from the freight trains had also entered the signal box, and war news in the newspaper was discussed. Shortly afterwards, because the local train had stood on the main line for over three minutes, pursuant to Rule 55 its driver sent fireman George Hutchinson to the box, although he left at 6.46 am, having failed to fully perform the required duties (see Rules breaches). At 6.38 am the first of the northbound expresses from Carlisle passed Quintinshill safely. At 6.42 am Kirkpatrick \\"offered\\" the southbound troop train to Quintinshill. Signalman Tinsley immediately accepted the troop train, and four minutes later he was offered and accepted the second northbound express from Gretna Junction. At 6.47 am Tinsley received the \\"train entering section\\" signal from Kirkpatrick for the troop train and offered it forward to Gretna Junction, having forgotten all about the local passenger train (aboard which he had himself arrived that morning), which was occupying the Up line. The troop special was immediately accepted by Gretna Junction, so Tinsley pulled \\"off\\" his Up home signal to allow the troop train to run forward. = Collisions = The troop train collided head on with the stationary local train on the up line at 6.49 am. Just over a minute later, the second northbound express train ran into the wreckage, having passed the Quintinshill Down Distant signal before it could be returned to danger. The wreckage also included the goods train in the down loop and the trucks of the empty coal train in the up loop. At 6.53 am Tinsley sent the \\"Obstruction Danger\\" bell signal to both Gretna and Kirkpatrick, stopping all traffic and alerting others to the disaster. = Fire = The burned out remains of a carriage at the disaster scene. Many men on the troop train were killed as a result of the two collisions, but the disaster was made much worse by a subsequent fire. The great wartime traffic and a shortage of carriages meant that the railway company had to press into service obsolete Great Central Railway stock. These carriages had wooden bodies and frames, with very little crash resistance compared with steel-framed carriages, and were gas-lit using the Pintsch gas system. The gas was stored in reservoirs slung under the underframe and these ruptured in the collision. Escaping gas was ignited by the coal-burning fires of the engines. The gas reservoirs had been filled before leaving Larbert, and this, and the lack of available water, meant that the fire was not extinguished until the morning of the next day, despite the best efforts of railway staff and the Carlisle fire brigade. The troop train had consisted of 21 vehicles; all were consumed in the fire, apart from the rear six, which had broken away during the impact and rolled back along the line a short distance. The fire also affected four coaches from the express train and some goods wagons. Such was the intensity of the fire that all the coal in the locomotive tenders was consumed. = Rescue efforts = Amongst the first rescuers to arrive at the scene were Mr and Mrs Dunbar, caretakers at The Old Blacksmith's Shop, Gretna Green. Mrs Dunbar stated that when she heard the crash, her immediate thought was that the Germans had come. Mrs Dunbar telephoned doctors in Carlisle for assistance. Mr Dunbar spent the day assisting the rescue efforts. The last known survivor of the accident, Peter Stoddart, was interviewed in Wisbech by Michael Simkins in around 1985.WSW London Equity Branch December 2015 Newsletter, p. 9. https://www.equity.org.uk/branches/west-south-west-london- branch/documents/wsw-london-equity-branch-dec-2015-newsletter/ (see download on the webpage). Simkins wrote in The Guardian in 2001: \\"I asked him about a story I had heard of an officer who went about the scene shooting men trapped in the burning wreckage. 'That was true. I saw that. He was a Scottish gentleman, eventually a millionaire. But he had to.' There was a suspicion of a chuckle in his voice as he added: 'And there were one or two other survivors who made themselves scarce. They took their opportunity.'\\" Peter Stoddart died on 4 July 1988 following a stroke. On 16 May 2015, the BBC reported Colonel Robert Watson, a senior retired army officer who had served with the Royal Scots, saying that he believed that some soldiers were \\"probably\\" shot in mercy killings. The BBC said that while no official army records of the alleged shooting existed, \\"many reports written in the press at the time of the accident suggested that some trapped soldiers, threatened with the prospect of being burnt alive in the raging inferno, took their own lives or were shot by their officers\\". The Colonel‚Äôs remarks were recorded for a BBC Scotland documentary made to mark the centenary of the disaster, Quintinshill: Britain's Deadliest Rail Disaster. He told the documentary makers: \\"All those that could be rescued were rescued. Many of them had amputations carried out underneath burning carriages so that they could be rescued. But many, of course, were trapped in such a position that they couldn't be got out or else the fire had taken hold and they couldn't be got to. And of course since then we've heard stories of some soldiers being shot and some soldiers possibly taking their own lives. It's never been formally documented. My own personal belief is that it probably did happen, in a sense of compassion, of mercy killing. It's almost impossible, sitting here, to comprehend what it was like that morning.\\" However, the BBC said that this section of the interview with Watson would not be broadcast. According to Earnshaw \\"Many were trapped inside the burning train; injured men with no hope of escape begged their rescuers to shoot them whilst gunfire added an eerie effect to the scene as small arms and rifle shells in the luggage vans began to explode in the intense heat.\\" Aftermath By 24 May, newspapers were already reporting the accident as the deadliest in the United Kingdom. The initial estimate was 158 dead, with over 200 injured. The bodies of the victims were initially laid in a field by the line and covered in white sheets. They were later taken to a nearby farm or to Gretna Green Village Hall. The Board of Trade appointed Lieutenant Colonel E. Druitt, R.E. to head the inquiry into the Accident. The King sent a telegram to Caledonian Railway general manager Donald Mathieson expressing sympathy and asking to be kept informed of the recovery of those injured. On 23 May, a recruitment meeting was held at the Usher Hall, Edinburgh to raise a new battalion. The railway was reopened through Quintinshill on the morning of 25 May, although not all the wreckage had been removed. The two locomotives of the express train stood in a siding with all their paint burnt off. Casualties The roll call of the survivors of 1/7th Royal Scots after the accident The overwhelming majority of fatalities were among the men of the Royal Scots and the precise number was not established as the roll list of the regiment was destroyed by the fire. Lt.-Col. Druitt's official report gives an estimated total of 215 deaths and a further 191 injured. Of the 500 soldiers of the 7th Battalion of the Royal Scots on the troop train, only 58 men were present for roll call at 4.00 pm that afternoon, along with seven officers. In total, around 226 people died and 246 were injured. The engine crew of the troop train also died in the first collision. Both driver Scott and fireman Hannah had driven the Royal Train. Considering the double collision and the fire, casualties in the other trains were lighter than might have been expected. On the local train, two passengers died, with none seriously injured; on the express seven passengers died, with a further 51 and 3 members of railway staff seriously injured. =Funerals= The funeral procession passes Pilrig Church on its way to the cemetery. Some of the bodies were never recovered, having been wholly consumed by the fire, and when the bodies of the men of the Royal Scots were returned to Leith on 24 May, they were buried together in a mass grave in Edinburgh's Rosebank Cemetery. The coffins were laid three deep, with each on the top row covered in the Union Flag. The public were excluded from the cemetery, although 50 wounded servicemen who were convalescing at a nearby military hospital were allowed to attend. The ceremony lasted three hours, at the end of which a volley of three shots was fired and the Last Post was sounded. The bodies were escorted by the 15th and 16th Battalions Royal Scots, the Edinburgh Pals battalions recently assembled and still undergoing training. The cortege took four hours to complete its task. A memorial to the dead troops was erected in Rosebank Cemetery in 1916. Of the troops, 83 bodies were identified, 82 were recovered but unrecognisable, and 50 were missing altogether, giving the total of 215, later revised by the army to 214. The soldiers were buried with full military honours. Among the coffins were four bodies which were unidentified, and appeared to be remains of children. One coffin was simply labelled as 'little girl, unrecognisable,' and another as 'three trunks, probably children'. As no children were reported missing, the railway company moved the bodies to Glasgow for possible identification, but no one came forward to claim the bodies; some think they may have been soldiers' bodies badly shrivelled and reduced by burning. The four were buried in Glasgow's Western Necropolis on 26 May. The engine crew of the troop train were both from Carlisle, and they were also buried on 26 May at Stanwix Cemetery. =Survivors= The surviving officers and men of the Royal Scots were taken to Carlisle on the evening of 22 May. The next morning, they went on by train to Liverpool, but on arrival there they were medically examined: all the enlisted men and one officer were declared unfit for service overseas and were returned to Edinburgh. Only Lieutenant Colonel W. Carmichael Peebles and five other officers were fit enough to sail from Liverpool for overseas service. It was reported in the Edinburgh Weekly that on their march from the port to the railway station the survivors were mistaken for prisoners of war and pelted by some children. Locomotives There were four steam locomotives hauling the three passengers trains directly involved in the collisions, the express train having been double headed. All were designs built for the Caledonian Railway. The two locomotives that collided head-on in the first impact (when the troop train hit the local train) were both written off and scrapped. The local train's locomotive had been No. 907 of the Cardean Class (4-6-0 wheel arrangement). The troop train's locomotive was No. 121 of the 139 Class (4-4-0). The two locomotives of the express train which hit the wreckage a minute later, were subsequently repaired and returned to traffic - No. 140 of the Dunalastair IV Class and No. 48 of the 43 Class (both 4-4-0). Investigations= Breaches of regulations = The sequence of events leading up to the collisions featured multiple breaches of the railway's regulations, which formed the basis of the later prosecution of both signallers. In total, 8 separate rules breaches by the signalmen were identified.  Shift change irregularity  For the 6.00 am shift change, the signalmen had developed an informal arrangement allowing whoever was working the early day shift to arrive for work at around 6.30 am. This allowed the day shift signalman to get up slightly later, and in the case of Signalman Tinsley (who lived in Gretna) it enabled him to travel to work on the local train on days when it was to be shunted at Quintinshill. The signalmen at Gretna Junction would let Tinsley know when this was to occur. To avoid this malpractice being detected by company management, whichever signalman was working the night shift would record all train register entries after 6.00 am on a piece of paper rather than in the register book itself. When the day shift man arrived, he would copy the entries from the paper into the train register in his own handwriting, making it appear that the shift change had occurred at the correct time. The changing of shifts was a safety-critical moment where it was essential that the signalman taking over the box was fully aware of the position of trains and for all block signalling requirements to be properly completed and recorded. The need for Signalman Tinsley to copy out the missing train register entries as soon as he took over the signalbox may have distracted him from his duties in relation to the handover of the box, and seems likely to have been a factor in his subsequent acceptance of the troop train.  Block signalling omissions  Immediately after the empty coal train had stopped in the Up loop, two crucial failures in block signalling procedure occurred. Firstly, as soon as the \\"train out of section\\" bell code had been telegraphed to Kirkpatrick signalbox to advise that the empty wagon train was out of the section and clear of the Up main line at Quintinshill, the Quintinshill signalman should have followed this up by sending the \\"blocking back\\" bell code to Kirkpatrick. This would have advised the Kirkpatrick signalman that another train (i.e. the Down local) was occupying the Up main line inside the Quintinshill home signal. On receipt of the \\"blocking back\\" bell the Kirkpatrick signalman would not have been permitted to offer another Up train to Quintinshill until he had received the \\"obstruction removed\\" bell from the Quintinshill signalman to confirm that the shunted train was clear of the Up line. However, although the \\"train out of section\\" signal was belled to Kirkpatrick the \\"blocking back\\" signal was never sent. Significantly, the \\"train out of section\\" signal was sent at 6.34 am immediately after Signalman Tinsley arrived in the signalbox and at the moment when responsibility for working the box was being handed over. Both of the Quintinshill signalmen subsequently claimed that the other man had been the one to send the \\"train out of section\\" signal. Secondly, the signalman at Quintinshill should have placed a signal lever collar over the relevant signal lever, which would have served as a physical reminder not to clear his signals for the Up line. Neither man did so, and Signalman Tinsley failed to check for the presence of a lever collar when he took over the working of the box.  Incomplete performance of Rule 55  Another important precaution designed specifically to prevent such signalling errors also failed to be implemented on that day - Rule 55. Under this rule, if any train was stopped on the main line for longer than three minutes, the driver was required to send one of the crew to the signalbox in order to remind the signalman of the presence of the train and to ensure that the necessary safeguards to protect the train (e.g. lever collars on the signal levers) were in place. The crewman was required to sign the train register to confirm that he had visited the signalbox and carried out these actions. Since the local train had been stopped for longer than three minutes, its fireman, George Hutchinson, was dispatched to the box. Contrary to the rule, Hutchinson merely signed the train register, using a pen which Tinsley (who was intent on filling in the missing entries in the train register) handed over his shoulder without looking up. Hutchinson then returned to his engine without reminding the signaller of his train's position or checking that the signalman had placed a lever collar on the signal lever.  Unauthorised persons in signalbox  Various railwaymen were required to visit the signalbox as part of their duties, but it was expressly forbidden for such visitors to stay any longer than necessary due to the potential for distraction of the signalman. However, signalboxes were relatively comfortable places to spend time (having a stove, kettle and the company of the signalman) so there was a temptation for such visitors to linger. When Signalman Tinsley arrived at Quintinshill signalbox on the morning of the accident, the guard of the down goods train was leaving the box having been there for around ten minutes, while the guard of the up empty wagon train arrived at the same time and was still in the box when the first collision occurred 15 minutes later. Furthermore, after handing over the working of the signalbox to Signalman Tinsley, Signalman Meakin remained in the box reading the newspaper. The unnecessary presence of these other railwaymen may have further distracted Tinsley from his duties.  Forgetfulness  The failure to carry out the \\"blocking back\\" procedure enabled the Kirkpatrick signalman to offer the up troop train to Quintinshill, but as the down local train was standing on the Up main line inside the Quintinshill home signal the block regulations prohibited Signalman Tinsley from accepting the troop train. However, despite the facts that he had travelled to work on the footplate of the local train minutes earlier and that the train was standing in clear sight directly in front of the signalbox, Tinsley forgot about its presence. He therefore accepted the troop train and offered it forward to Gretna Junction, where it was accepted. In the absence of a lever collar on the Up Home signal lever to remind him the line was blocked, he pulled off the Up line signals to allow the troop train to run through Quintinshill. =Board of Trade inquiry= The first official investigation into the disaster commenced in Carlisle on 25 May at County Hall, Carlisle. It was conducted by Lieutenant Colonel E. Druitt RE of the Railway Inspectorate on behalf of the Board of Trade. Lt.-Col. Druitt had already spent some time at the accident site and spent the day in Carlisle interviewing witnesses including both Meakin and Tinsley. Both men were honest about their failures to abide by the rules and their generally lax behaviour. Lt.-Col. Druitt presented his report to the Board of Trade on 17 June 1915 and laid the blame squarely on Meakin and Tinsley. > This disastrous collision was thus due to want of discipline on the part of > the signalmen, first by changing duty at an unauthorised hour, which caused > Tinsley to be occupied in writing up the Train Register Book, and so > diverted his attention from his proper work, secondly by Meakin handing over > the duty in a very lax manner; and, thirdly by both signalmen neglecting to > carry out various rules specially framed for preventing accidents due to > forgetfulness on the part of signalmen. Druitt was also critical of Fireman Hutchinson for his failure to comply properly with rule 55, and also of Gretna stationmaster Alexander Thorburn, who, in Lt.-Col. Druitt's opinion, cannot have been unaware of the irregular shift changes operated by Meakin and Tinsley. Druitt concluded that even had all the trains been lit by electricity, a fire would still have occurred as the wagons of the goods train in the down loop caught fire. He also concluded that had Quintinshill been equipped with track circuiting, then the accident would have been avoided as the electrical interlocking of the signals would have prevented Tinsley from pulling the relevant signal levers, but that with its simple layout and good visibility from the signal box Quintinshill was a low priority for track circuits to be installed. =Coroner's inquest in England= The legal position was complicated because although the accident occurred in Scotland, some of the injured subsequently died in England where the law was different. In Scotland, deaths were investigated by the procurator fiscal who, if he found culpability on the part of anyone, could order their arrest and charge them with culpable homicide. In England, the coroner investigated death and, if the coroner's jury found that death was due to neglect, then the coroner could indict charges of manslaughter against the named parties. The coroner for Carlisle, Mr T S Strong, asked for guidance from the Home Office and was instructed to conduct inquests on those who had died in England in the normal way. The inquest opened on 25 May but was immediately adjourned until 23 June to allow Lt-Col. Druitt to finish his investigation. After two days hearing evidence from, among others, Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson, Strong summed up the evidence to the nineteen-man jury. He highlighted that if Meakin and Tinsley had obeyed the rules on any of (a) blocking back, (b) lever collars or (c) a correctly kept train register, they could not have forgotten the stationary train. He concluded his summing up with: The jury retired and an hour later came back with a verdict that the 27 people who were the subject of the inquest had died due to the gross negligence of Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson. The coroner therefore committed all three to the next sitting of Cumberland Assizes on a charge of manslaughter; all three were granted bail. The solicitor representing the three railwaymen protested that the committing of them to trial was outside the coroner's jurisdiction, as the alleged offence had been committed in Scotland. The coroner stated that he had been instructed to proceed with the inquest by the Home Office. The verdict of the English inquest was to leave Tinsley in an unusual position, as he was arrested by the Scottish authorities on 29 May 1915, and charged with culpable homicide. He now faced a charge of manslaughter in England based on the same facts. After discussion between the Law Officers of England and Scotland, it was decided to proceed against the three men in Scotland. The three had become the first men ever to be indicted for the same crime in two UK countries. =Trial of Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson= The trial of the three men started on 24 September 1915 in the High Court in Edinburgh. The Lord Justice General, Lord Strathclyde, presided over the trial; the Lord Advocate, Robert Munro KC prosecuted and the three men were defended by Condie Sandeman KC. Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson all pleaded not guilty to the charges of culpable homicide and breach of duty against them. The trial lasted a day and a half; after the prosecution had concluded their case, Sandeman submitted to the Lord Justice General that there was no case to answer by Hutchinson. This submission was accepted by the Lord Justice General and the jury were instructed to find him not guilty at the conclusion of the trial. Sandeman called no witnesses on the part of Meakin and Tinsley but instead sought to persuade the jury that neither had been criminally negligent, but that Tinsley had just had a momentary loss of memory. After Sandeman's speech, Lord Strathclyde summed up to the jury, ending: > At 6.43 am on the morning of the day in question the men in the signal box > at Quintinshill were asked to accept the troop train coming from the north. > They accepted it. That meant that they gave the signal to the north that the > line was clear and that the troop train might safely come on. At that very > moment when the signal was given, there was before the very eyes of the men > in the signal box a local train which was obstructing the line on which the > troop train was to run. One man in the signal box had actually left the > train a few minutes before, just at the time when it was being shunted on to > the up line. The other man had a few minutes before directed the local train > to leave the down main and go on to the up main. > That is the staggering fact that confronts you. > If you can explain that fact consistently with the two men having > faithfully and honestly discharged their duties you should acquit them. If > you cannot explain that staggering fact consistently with the men having > faithfully discharged their duties then you must convict them. The jury retired to consider their verdicts at 12.40pm and returned only eight minutes later finding Hutchinson not guilty as directed, but finding Tinsley and Meakin guilty as charged. After hearing mitigation on behalf of the two Lord Strathclyde sentenced Tinsley to three years penal servitude and Meakin to eighteen months imprisonment. =Fatal accident inquiry in Scotland= The final legal inquiry into the disaster was held on 4 November 1915 in Dumfries and was an inquiry under the Fatal Accidents Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1895 into the deaths of the crew of the troop train. Presided over by Sheriff Campion, it came to the same conclusion as the English inquest and the trial that if Meakin and Tinsley had followed the rules then the accident would not have happened. After the trial Meakin and Tinsley were released from prison on 15 December 1916. After release, Tinsley went straight back to working on the Caledonian Railway as a lampman. He died in 1967. Meakin also returned to the railway, as a goods train guard. Some years later he was made redundant from that job and set himself up as a coal merchant, trading from Quintinshill siding, right next to the scene of the crash. In the Second World War, he worked in the Gretna munitions factory until he retired due to ill health. He died in 1953. The pair were not the first signalmen to be convicted for their part in causing an accident, nor the last. James Holmes was tried for manslaughter following the Thirsk rail crash of 1892, but was given an absolute discharge. Signalman Frost was gaoled for two years for his part in causing the Connington South rail crash in 1967. 2015 BBC re-examination In a BBC Television documentary, Britain's Deadliest Rail Disaster: Quintinshill, first aired on 20 May 2015, the disaster was re-examined from a modern perspective. It argued that both signalmen had been made scapegoats for the crashes, and found fault with both the railway company and the government (who ran the railway in war-time). Going further, citing the fact both men returned to work after their sentences, it postulated there had been some conspiracy between the company and the men to take sole blame for the accident. It criticised the railway company's attitude to its own rules, which the documentary alleged it must have known were not routinely followed to the letter - arguing that the tardy practices of turning up late for a shift change would have at the very least been known to their immediate managers. It also claimed the use of safety collars was not universal on the railway, and expecting it was impractical (citing that some railway companies did not use them for just that reason). It also found fault with the railway company's desire to run a peacetime service to maintain profits, even though the network was experiencing extra war-time traffic. Citing the pressure this would have put on signal staff to maintain the service, it also argued that the local train would not have even been on the main line if the passing loops had not been being used as storage sidings to store extra trains. It also criticised the railway company and the government for using the older wooden stock for the troop train, arguing that it was already known it was unsafe and in the process of withdrawal, and this was a risk that was not justified even in the environment of war. It also sought to take some blame away from Tinsley, because he may have been suffering from a form of epilepsy which affected his short term memory, which they argued would have explained why he might have simply not been aware of the waiting local train. The documentary at times showed only a superficial knowledge of railway operating practice, particularly at the time of the disaster. The sidings were being used in their normal way to hold slow-running freight trains, not for storage. It was common practice for railways to re-employ staff after a conviction, demoted to lesser roles. The multiple breaches of regulations by the signalmen were glossed over. Memorials Quintinshill Place, Edinburgh As well as the memorial in Rosebank Cemetery, there is a plaque at Larbert railway station, from where the soldiers originally departed. Two memorials have been erected by the Western Front Association, the first in 1995, half a mile to the south of the scene of the accident. The second is at Blacksyke Bridge, west of the scene; it was unveiled in September 2010. A memorial to the unknown children was erected at the Western Necropolis in Glasgow in 2011. There is also a memorial to Lt Cdr C H E Head, who died in the accident, in St Ann's Church at Portsea, Hampshire. Annual remembrance services are held at Rosebank Cemetery attended by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh and the Royal Scots association. There were commemorative services at Gretna for the centenary of the disaster on 22 May 2015 and at Rosebank Cemetery on 23 May. They were attended by the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, and the Princess Royal. {Leith tenement mural depicting the funeral procession The Rosebank Cemetery Memorial Remembrance Service at Rosebank Cemetery, 2010 } On 22 May 2015, a remembrance quarter peal was rung and new method named 'Quintinshill' by bellringers at St Peter's Church, Derby. In 2017 a new housing area in Leith was given the street names Quintinshill Place and Gretna Place in memory of the disaster.  Similar accidents  The Hawes Junction rail crash of 1910 also involved a busy signalman forgetting about a train on the main railway line. Likewise, at the Winwick rail crash of 1934, an overworked signalman forgot about a train in his section, and was misled by a junior.

It achieved its greatest electoral success in the 1994 elections, when it won 37.1% of the vote and 13 of 40 parliamentary seats. A factional conflict in 1998 led to the departure of 11 of these MPs, who then founded the Botswana Congress Party (BCP). In the 1999 elections, the BNF's vote share declined to 26% and it won 6 parliamentary seats. In the 2004 general election the party won 26.1% of the popular vote and 12 out of 57 seats. Its representation was sharply reduced in the 2009 elections, with the party reduced to only six seats in the National Assembly of Botswana. The BNF's parliamentary representation fell to 5 seats following the defection of the party's former Vice President, Olebile Gaborone, to the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) in July 2010. The BNF was founded in 1965, shortly after the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP)'s landslide victory in the self-government elections and just before Botswana gained independence. The initial goal of the BNF was to reunite the various strands of the Botswana People's Party, which had experienced a split in 1963‚Äì1964, and others opposed to the BDP. In 1969, Bathoen Gaseitsiwe resigned from his state-recognized position as chief of the Bangwaketse (a group in Southern Botswana) and joined the BNF. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the BNF was a loose alliance between conservative tribal leaders concerned with the preservation of traditional authority, led by Bathoen Gaseitsiwe, and socialists, led by Kenneth Koma, concerned over the bourgeois policies of the government. The first time that the party had been represented nationally was in 1969 when they won three seats in the Ngwaketse region. The BNF was largely a regional party associated with the Ngwaketse region in the 1970s, but it gradually gained support in other parts of the country. In the 1984 general elections, the BNF gained control of the Gaborone City Council and other urban councils; it also won five of 34 parliamentary seats. In 1994, 13 BNF candidates were elected as members of the National Assembly (out of 40 total). Prior to the elections, the party redefined itself in terms of the ideology of social democracy. It was an observer member of the Socialist International. By 1994 the party had adopted the motto \\"Time for change\\". The electoral success and change of motto largely reflected decreased standard of living, civil unrest and rising levels of AIDS in the country. There have been a number of internal squabbles in the party due largely to factionalism. This has led to the splitting of the party a number of times and the formation of splinter parties whose political ideologies are not appreciably different from that of the BNF. Several splinter parties formed in 1989 and 1994, but the most serious split occurred in 1998 when a dispute over Kenneth Koma's leadership resulted in the departure of the majority of the party's parliamentary wing (11 of 13 MPs) and the formation of the Botswana Congress Party (BCP). The split followed an aborted BNF party congress, dissolution of the central committee by Koma, and a bitter court case. In 2003, ongoing factional conflict prompted the BNF's founder, Kenneth Koma, to form the New Democratic Front. Of these splinter parties, the BCP has gained the most popular support. In elections in 1999 and 2004, vote-splitting between the BNF and the BCP reduced the parliamentary representation of both the BNF and the opposition as a whole. The BNF retained only 6 of its 13 parliamentary seats in 1999 and the BCP won only one seat. An increase in the number of constituencies from 40 to 57 allowed the BNF to win 12 seats in 2009 despite no meaningful change in its vote share. The BCP did not benefit from the expansion of seats and again won only one seat. Until July 2010, the party was led by Otsweletse Moupo. Moupo himself has emphasized the need to help the poor escape from poverty. Moupo experienced a number of public embarrassments in 2006 that led to serious and mounting challenges from within the party.http://www.gov.bw/cgi- bin/news.cgi?d=20060615&i;=Moupo_dismisses_allegationshttp://www.mmegi.bw/2006/October/Thursday12/81357110320.htmlhttp://www.mmegi.bw/2006/June/Friday2/4133655491.html http://www.mmegi.bw/2006/October/Thursday12/813571101991.html Moupo's leadership was reaffirmed at a special party congress in 2007, but his opponents continued to challenge his leadership. In 2008 and 2009, the BNF suspended or expelled several prominent members, including several of its parliamentary representatives, and fought several court battles related to primary elections. In the 2009 elections, several former members of the BNF ran as independent candidates, referring to themselves as the Temporary Platform. The BNF suffered significant losses; it won six seats. The BCP formed an electoral pact with the Botswana Alliance Movement and the NDF and increased its representation from one seat to five. Vote-splitting continues to be a problem in that the BDP often wins seats when all three parties are competitive. This occurs most often in urban areas. But the BDP also took seats from the BNF in rural constituencies where the BCP did not have a candidate. Otsweletse Moupo decided that he would not defend his position as party president and Duma Boko was elected as the new party president in July 2010. In 2013 congress that will be held in Gantsi, Comrade Monang will challenge Comrade Boko in what seems to be a David vs Goliath war.

The serial was produced by Peter Graham Scott, with Patrick Dromgoole as executive producer. A novelisation by the serial's writers, Jeremy Burnham and Trevor Ray, also appeared in 1977. In the United States, it was broadcast on the Nickelodeon television channel in the early 1980s as part of the series The Third Eye.Tripod - The Third Eye The series is today considered a landmark in quality children's drama and has been called \\"the scariest programme ever made for children\\". Overview The series follows the adventures of astrophysicist Adam Brake and his teenage son Matthew after they arrive in the small village of Milbury, which is built in the midst of a megalithic stone circle. Filmed at Avebury, Wiltshire during the hot summer of 1976, with interior scenes filmed at HTV's Bristol studios, it has sinister, discordant wailing voices heightening the tension in the incidental music. The music was composed by Sidney Sager who used the Ambrosian Singers to chant in accordance with the megalithic rituals referred to in the story.Children of the Stones music Director Peter Graham Scott was surprised on seeing the script that the series was intended for children's airtime due to the complexities of the plot and the disturbing nature of the series.Screenonline - Children of the Stones Cast as the leader of the village, Hendrick, was Iain Cuthbertson, while the leading role of Adam Brake was filled by Gareth Thomas. Cuthbertson and Thomas had previously worked together on the TV series Sutherland's Law. Veronica Strong (the wife of series co-writer Jeremy Burnham) played Margaret Smythe, the curator of the local museum, who partners with Brake to solve the mystery. The child actors Peter Demin (aged 17 at the time of filming)Peter Demin in 2009 and Katharine Levy played the teenage leads, Matthew (Brake's son) and Sandra (Smythe's daughter).

Plot outline The village within the stone circle exists in a time rift, in which the same actions are played out (with minor variations) over and over again, the end result being that the power of the circle will eventually be released to the outside world. Whenever this is faulted, however, the time circle resets and the same events attempt again to unfold. However, since time is passing in the outside world in a normal way, time within the time circle must also progress, matching the time period of the real world while still attempting to play out the events within. Four cycles of the time circle are clearly described in Children of the Stones. =The original circle= The Stones of Avebury (Milbury in the serial)The original stone circle was built during the megalithic era by a pagan folk led by a Druid priest. The village priest then witnessed the formation of a supernova and somehow deduced that a black hole had formed shortly afterwards. Using a variety of psychic powers, mixed with folk magic, the priest was able to harness the power of the stones, which are natural magnets, and focus negative energy, via a beam of light, through the centre of the circle towards the black hole. This energy, however, was drawn from the minds of the inhabitants within the circle, taking their anger and fear to the black hole, and turning them into docile but happy creatures (hence \\"happy day\\") under the control of the Druid priest. When a pair of travellers entered the village the Druid priest attempted to brainwash them as well, through the beam of light towards the black hole. The travellers outwitted the priest, however, and tricked him into thinking they had been brainwashed when the beam of light had not yet appeared. When the two travellers entered the circle of those who had already been taken in by the priest the circle of control was broken. The beam of light then appeared, much to the priest's horror, destroying his altar and turning the inhabitants of the circle to stone. The two travellers barely managed to escape the same fate and survived by hiding in a rock cave towards the edge of the stone circle, known as the sanctuary. The events of the original circle were later recorded in a painting, which eventually made its way to become a key point of another cycle of the time circle. =The barber-surgeon= The barber-surgeon was an inhabitant of the village of Milbury, which had been built on the site of the stone circle. The events of the first circle began to unfold again in Milbury. The barber- surgeon, seeing what is taking place, protected himself by use of an amulet. The amulet was palm-sized and inscribed with a winged serpent. The barber- surgeon presented a threat to whoever restarted the events of the First Circle and was crushed under a falling sarsen stone, also engraved with a serpent like the amulet the barber-surgeon carried. The amulet was crushed, along with the barber-surgeon; however, his bones were later removed and the stone that killed him was re-erected within the circle. Whoever caused the barber-surgeon to die did not succeed, and the time circle again reset itself into the modern age. Dai the poacher's life, death and activities are markedly similar to those of the barber-surgeon, suggesting a link between the two characters. =Children of the Stones= The Time Circle again took another loop in the 1970s, when an astronomer, Rafael Hendrick, uncovered an ancient Dog Latin text about the Druid priest who saw a supernova explode in ancient times. Hendrick discovered the location of the supernova, a discovery that made him famous, and further learned that the supernova was now a black hole in the constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear. Hendrick then travelled to Milbury, the site of the stone circle, and, through means left unexplained, learned how to harness the negative energy of the villagers into the beam of light towards the black hole. Through complex astronomical calculations he determined exactly when he could form the energy beam and began brainwashing the villagers into becoming what he called \\"Happy Ones\\". The one challenge to Hendrick is posed by a poacher named Dai, but Dai suffers a mysterious death in the same location as the Barber-Surgeon had years earlier. Dai's body is also apparently replaced by a fallen stone carved with a serpent, but then both the stone and the body vanish. After Dai is killed pieces of a broken amulet are found, with those pieces matching exactly the gaps in the broken amulet of the Barber-Surgeon. With nothing to stop Hendrick, one by one the villagers are brainwashed by the beam of light. Professor Brake's son, Matthew, is apparently psychic and has come across a painting that depicts the scene of the first circle. By the time Hendrick seeks to brainwash Brake and his son both have worked out that Milbury is replaying the events of the first circle and attempt to find a way to escape. In the final episode Professor Brake and Matthew set Hendrick's digital timekeeping system ahead by five minutes, tricking Hendrick into thinking that they have been brainwashed by the energy beam. When they enter the circle of \\"Happy Ones\\" the power is broken. Hendrick is exposed to the beam of light and is metamorphosed into an image of the ancient Druid priest, while his butler, Link, covers his eyes for protection. The villagers are then turned to stone when they look at the beam of light from Hendrick's house. Professor Brake and Matthew attempt to save their friends Margaret and her daughter Sandra, but they both ignore warnings not to look back at the light and meet the same fate as the other villagers. The professor and his son escape to the Sanctuary, just as the ancient travellers did. When Brake and Matthew awake the next morning the village has changed back to normal, with only minor variations, and there is no sign that Hendrick or his plan ever existed. Margaret, Sandra and the Brakes' housekeeper, who were all victims of the stone circle's power the previous evening, are now living their normal lives. Even the poacher, Dai, is alive and living in the Sanctuary, but he gives no indication that he knows Professor Brake or Matthew. Matthew wonders if the Time Circle has reset and if the events they have recently witnessed will happen again. Professor Brake jokingly asks Matthew if he would like to go back to the village and find out, but Matthew asks him to drive far away and to only stop off somewhere for something to eat. =Sir Joshua Litton= In the final scene of the series, shortly after Professor Brake and Matthew depart from the village a well- dressed man in an expensive motor car drives into Milbury. He looks identical to Rafael Hendrick. The man drives to Hendrick's old house, where he meets Link, Hendrick's former butler in the last round of the Time Circle, who now has a moustache and looks considerably younger. The gentleman introduces himself as Sir Joshua Litton, a former Professor at the University of Cambridge, and explains that he has come to Milbury from London. He comments on what a nice place Milbury will be to retire to and says that he will be very happy there.

Lee commented on depictions of teenagers on television in different decades, contrasting Children of the Stones with the Channel 4 drama Skins and arguing that Children of the Stones is still relevant to a modern audience. Several clips of the story were shown. In 2012 Lee narrated a documentary on the series for BBC Radio Four. It was introduced as \\"the scariest programme ever made for children\\" and the music was described as \\"the most inappropriate theme music ever used for a children's series\\". Among the interviewees were Gareth Thomas and Katharine Levy, who both gave credit to the high quality of the script. Levy said that the finished programme surpassed all their expectations and still stood up well. Jeremy Burnham, co-writer of the script, stated that although it was only seven episodes long, the series had stayed with him ever since due to the fans' interest.BBC Radio 4. Happy Days - The Children of the Stones. Transmitted: 4 October 2012  Avebury as a character  The depiction of Avebury as narrated by Adam Brack is not inaccurate given that it was penned in the 1970s. Avebury does indeed consist of a stone circle with two avenues leading away from it. One of the avenues does lead to a site called the Sanctuary but in reality the Sanctuary is some distance away at the top of the ridge, on The Ridgeway and is another stone circle. In the story, the Sanctuary is some sort of cave, but it is filmed, at least partly, in the West Kennet Long Barrow, which is not far from Avebury near to Silbury Hill. Ley lines are not generally accepted as archaeological facts. Availability Children of the Stones was first released on Guild Home Video in 1981, becoming one of the earliest children's dramas to be released on the format. Due to an error on the front and rear of the sleeve listing it as running 1hr 38 mins, it was assumed to be in a heavily edited form. The tape however ran at 2hrs 32mins, meaning only that the opening and closing credits from the middle episodes had been removed, and certain scenes reordered. For example; In episode 1, we see Matthew fall from his bike before his father touches the stone. In the video version, we see him fall immediately after that scene. The series was re-released in 1992, again as a single uninterrupted feature. The serial has been released on DVD by Second Sight in the UK and by Acorn Media in the US. The DVD includes interviews with actor Gareth Thomas and producer Peter Graham Scott. The series was released once more in 2011 by Network. Unusually for a children's series, it was given a 12 certificate.Network DVD - Children of the Stones The serial was novelised by series writers Jeremy Burnham and Trevor Ray and released by Carousel Books in 1977. It was released in the US two years later. The novelisation was released in audiobook format by Fantom Films in August 2014, read by Gareth Thomas. Sequel A sequel, Return to the Stones by Jeremy Burnham and Trevor Ray, was published as a Kindle e-book in November 2012 followed by the hardback edition on 8 July 2013. There is also an audio book, narrated by Gareth Thomas. Podcast The BBC issued a new audio adaptation as a podcast in October 2020. It starred Reece Shearsmith, India Brown, Steve Oram and Ralph Ineson.

Publisher's \\"Page Wizards\\" instead provided a set of forms to produce a complete document layout, based on a professionally designed template, which could then be manipulated with the standard tools. Wizards had been in development at Microsoft for several years before Publisher, notably for Microsoft Access, which wouldn't ship until November 1992. Wizards were intended to learn from how someone used a program and anticipate what they may want to do next, guiding them through more complex sets of tasks by structuring and sequencing them. They also served to teach the product by example. As early as 1989, Microsoft discussed using voice and talking heads as guides, but multimedia-capable hardware was not yet widespread. The feature spread quickly to other applications. In 1992, Excel 4.0 for Mac introduced wizards for tasks like building crosstab tables, and Windows later used wizards for tasks like printer or Internet configuration. By 2001, wizards had become commonplace in most consumer-oriented operating systems, although not always under the name \\"wizard.\\" On the Mac OS, starting with tools like the Setup Assistant introduced in Mac OS 8.0, similar tools were (and still are) referred to as \\"assistants\\" (this is not to be confused with the 'Assist' feature which was on the Apple Newton). The \\"Setup Assistant\\" is run when the Macintosh starts up out of the box or after a fresh installation, and a similar process also takes place on Apple iOS. Aside from first time setup, other assistants like the \\"Network Setup Assistant\\" are similar to the Windows \\"New Connection Wizard.\\" GNOME also refers to its wizards as \\"assistants\\". Today, a wizard-like experience is often used to \\"onboard\\" users the first time they open an app. Many web applications, for instance online booking sites, make use of the wizard paradigm to complete lengthy interactive processes. Oracle Designer also uses wizards extensively. The Microsoft Manual of Style for Technical Publications (Version 3.0) urges technical writers to refer to these assistants as \\"wizards\\" and to use lowercase letters. Example The following screenshots show the installation wizard for Kubuntu 12.04, a free and open-source operating system. The wizard consists of seven steps. By the end of the step seven, the operation will be completed.

Two examples of such algorithms are Karger‚ÄìStein algorithm and Monte Carlo algorithm for minimum Feedback arc set. The name refers to the grand casino in the Principality of Monaco at Monte Carlo, which is well-known around the world as an icon of gambling. The term \\"Monte Carlo\\" was first introduced in 1947 by Nicholas Metropolis. Las Vegas algorithms are the subset of Monte Carlo algorithms that always produce the correct answer. Because they make random choices as part of their working, the time taken might vary between runs even with the same input. If there is a procedure for verifying whether the answer given by a Monte Carlo algorithm is correct, and the probability of a correct answer is bounded above zero, then with probability one running the algorithm repeatedly while testing the answers will eventually give a correct answer. Whether this process is a Las Vegas algorithm depends on whether halting with probability one is considered to satisfy the definition. One-sided vs two- sided error Whereas the answer returned by a deterministic algorithm is always expected to be correct, this is not the case for Monte Carlo algorithms. For decision problems, these algorithms are generally classified as either false-biased or true-biased. A false-biased Monte Carlo algorithm is always correct when it returns false; a true-biased algorithm is always correct when it returns true. While this describes algorithms with one-sided errors, others might have no bias; these are said to have two-sided errors. The answer they provide (either true or false) will be incorrect, or correct, with some bounded probability. For instance, the Solovay‚ÄìStrassen primality test is used to determine whether a given number is a prime number. It always answers true for prime number inputs; for composite inputs, it answers false with probability at least and true with probability less than . Thus, false answers from the algorithm are certain to be correct, whereas the true answers remain uncertain; this is said to be a -correct false-biased algorithm. Amplification For a Monte Carlo algorithm with one-sided errors, the failure probability can be reduced (and the success probability amplified) by running the algorithm k times. Consider again the Solovay‚ÄìStrassen algorithm which is -correct false-biased. One may run this algorithm multiple times returning a false answer if it reaches a false response within k iterations, and otherwise returning true. Thus, if the number is prime then the answer is always correct, and if the number is composite then the answer is correct with probability at least 1‚àí(1‚àí)k = 1‚àí2‚àík. For Monte Carlo decision algorithms with two-sided error, the failure probability may again be reduced by running the algorithm k times and returning the majority function of the answers. Complexity classes The complexity class BPP describes decision problems that can be solved by polynomial-time Monte Carlo algorithms with a bounded probability of two-sided errors, and the complexity class RP describes problems that can be solved by a Monte Carlo algorithm with a bounded probability of one-sided error: if the correct answer is false, the algorithm always says so, but it may answer false incorrectly for some instances where the correct answer is true. In contrast, the complexity class ZPP describes problems solvable by polynomial expected time Las Vegas algorithms. , but it is not known whether any of these complexity classes is distinct from each other; that is, Monte Carlo algorithms may have more computational power than Las Vegas algorithms, but this has not been proven. Another complexity class, PP, describes decision problems with a polynomial-time Monte Carlo algorithm that is more accurate than flipping a coin but where the error probability cannot necessarily be bounded away from . Applications in computational number theory Well-known Monte Carlo algorithms include the Solovay‚ÄìStrassen primality test, the Baillie‚ÄìPSW primality test, the Miller‚ÄìRabin primality test, and certain fast variants of the Schreier‚ÄìSims algorithm in computational group theory.

It is mainly red in colour, with slightly darker pigmentation on the head. These ants live under stones and fallen trees, and in soil. They are aggressive, often attacking rather than running away, and are equipped with a sting, though they lack the ability to spray formic acid like the genus Formica. This species is very similar to M. ruginodis, but M. rubra is the commoner of the two. The larvae of the butterflies Phengaris alcon (Alcon blue) and P. teleius (scarce large blue) use M. rubra as their primary host.  Distribution and habitat  This is one of the most common and widespread Myrmica species of the Palaearctic. It occurs in the region stretching from Portugal to East Siberia (as far as Transbaikalia), and from northern Greece to the forest-tundra zone in the North. It is also colonizing Japan and North America, where it is considered a nuisance and an invasive species. These ants are very common in Europe and live in meadows and gardens. They live on a diet of honeydew excreted by aphids and feed on many types of insect and other invertebrates. They will attack any creature that disturbs their nest, but are not as aggressive as the red imported fire ant. They also consume pollen, a phenomenon rarely documented in ants of the temperate zone.  Behavior  This ant's colonies have a polygyne form and can include up to one hundred queens per nest. These queens will have gathered together after their nuptial flight, formed a nest and laid their eggs in it. The species is also polydomous, with many nest sites per individual colony. The queens can live up to fifteen years. Nuptial flights take place normally in late July to mid-August in Europe. Hundreds of young queens and males take to the air to mate together. Afterwards, the males die and the queens shed their wings to make a new colony. No nuptial flights have been witnessed yet from this species where it is living in North America, however male-only mating swarms have been recorded in Newfoundland, Canada. The ants explore the surrounding area around their nest and look for materials, both plant and animal, to feed their colonies. When they find dead bodies, undertakers pick up the dead bodies and quickly carry them away from their nest up to away. They choose locations randomly, and so this species does not create cemeteries.

The station was originally private for the exclusive use of visitors to the Royal Marine Commando Training Centre at Lympstone. Exit was originally through a locked gate into the commando base but a foot/cycle path was built between the station and the commando base enabling access to/from the station. History The station was opened on 3 May 1976 by British Rail. This caused some confusion with the older Lympstone railway station, but this has since been renamed \\"Lympstone Village\\". It was built using cast platform sections recovered from Weston Milton railway station where the track had been singled and so one platform was no longer needed. For many years troop trains were a feature of its operation about three times each year. The trains were operated with a locomotive at each end as there is no way to run around a train south of Topsham; the leading locomotive on arrival was dragged back to Exeter Central where it was detached. The trains were considerably longer than the platform and loading the passengers was a slow operation as they had to make their way through the train from the centre coaches. A similar operation today is difficult to arrange as the regular timetabled passenger service is much more intensive than in the 1980s. Description The station is situated on the banks of the estuary of the River Exe. It consists of a single platform, which is on the left of trains arriving from Exeter. On 28 May 2010 a section of the Exe Estuary Trail opened between Lympstone village and Exton. This runs between the platform and the entrance to the campSee Geograph photograph so the public can now access the station, although the sign on the platform still remains stating ‚Äúpersons alighting here must have business with the camp‚Äù. The Ministry of Defence have accepted that the station is the property of Network Rail and as such they cannot prohibit members of the public from using the station, although the gate remains locked.FOI request sent through Whatdotheyknow Services A train to Exeter About half the trains on the Avocet Line from to and call at Lympstone Commando. It is a request stop, meaning that passengers alighting here must tell the conductor that they wish to do so, and those waiting to join must signal clearly to the driver as the train approaches. Connections are available at for , and other stations including London Waterloo; passengers for other main line stations should change at Exeter St David's.

It was originally released as a 12\\" single (listed as \\"Flower (Use the Word)\\") in 1985 by UK record label Blast First, with \\"Satan Is Boring\\" as the B-side. This version was quickly withdrawn at the band's request. In January 1986, Blast First and the band's American label, Homestead Records, both released \\"Flower\\" as a 12\\" backed by \\"Halloween\\"; the first run of the UK edition was on yellow/orange vinyl. Blast First also issued the song as a 7\\" single in edited form, retitled \\"Flower (Anti-Fuckword Radio Edit)\\"), with a backwards version, \\"Rewolf (Special Natas Mix)\\", on the flipside. \\"Flower\\", \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Satan Is Boring\\" were all later included on the Geffen Records CD reissue of Sonic Youth's 1985 album Bad Moon Rising. Background \\"Flower\\" and \\"Halloween\\" were recorded and mixed at Radio Tokyo in Venice, California in January 1985. \\"Satan Is Boring\\" was a collage of live material recorded at concerts in Rotterdam and Aylesbury in April 1985. Cover controversy The cover of the January 1986 Blast First 12\\", a \\"smudged black-and-white photocopy of a topless model in a downward-gazing pose\\" taken from a calendar and previously used in Thurston Moore's fanzine Killer, caused a major controversy with Blast First's distributor, Rough Trade Records.. In a section on Blast First from his book How Soon Is Now?, Richard King said of the \\"Flower\\" cover, \\"The sleeve was a copy-shop approximation of the kind of sleeves Raymond Pettibon was producing for the SST label in California: illustrations of blank-eyed characters of SoCal suburbia inhabiting empty spaces, both physical and mental, that despite their best efforts, consumerism and sex couldn't fill. What made sense in the context of the American underground, where such signifiers formed part of the bands' running commentary on their surroundings, had an equal resonance with Sonic Youth's connections with the Artforum sensibilities of New York galleries. In the context of Collier Street, it was given short shrift, dismissed as either a piece of New Yorker know-it-all provocation, or the kind of straightforward exploitative misogynist artwork that belonged on a heavy metal album\\". Reception In his AllMusic review of Bad Moon Rising, critic Jason Birchmeier noted the inclusion of the \\"Flower\\" material, saying, \\"Similarly morose, these few songs are perhaps even more out-there than the Bad Moon Rising ones, especially 'Halloween', which is a subtle five minutes of creeping guitar tingles accented beautifully by Kim Gordon's whispery hallucinations\\". A 2015 reassessment of Bad Moon Rising by Pitchfork's Zoe Camp noted how \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Flower\\" fit with the album's themes of \\"sex and power\\", saying, \\"On 'Halloween', Gordon struggles to identify just what it is that makes her succumb to a man's wiles, finally theorizing 'it‚Äôs the devil in me': the female sex drive, corrupted\\". Camp also said that \\"Flower\\" prefigured the riot grrrl movement of the 1990s, claiming that the song \\"encapsulated the sex-positive sentiments, as well as the noise, of the forthcoming movement....granted, 'Flower' might scan as slightly hippie-dippy next to Kathleen Hanna‚Äôs acerbic prose, but its mangled punk instrumentation and feminist politics set a precedent\\". A retrospective on Bad Moon Rising by Sputnikmusic gave the \\"Flower\\" tracks a mixed review, opining that \\"Flower\\" and \\"Satan Is Boring\\" \\"amount to very little beyond vocals or drumming overtop of thick, layered distortion\\", but praising \\"Halloween\\", saying that Gordon's \\"whispered vocals create a hallucination that is accentuated perfectly with prickling guitar notes and distant-sounding drums\\". Cover versions \\"Halloween\\" was covered by Mudhoney for their split single with Sonic Youth, \\"Touch Me I'm Sick\\"/\\"Halloween\\", released in December 1988 by Sub Pop.

He played on the half-forward flank, kicked one goal, and although \\"not particularly impressive ‚Ä¶ [he] showed that he can kick well\\".'Kickeroo', \\"Play and Players\\", The Herald, (Friday, 20 August 1920), p.3. As one of Collingwood's four inexperienced players given a run that day (the others were Les Lobb, Len Ludbrooke, and Roy Outram), Gordon played his second match, again on the half-forward flank, which was also Dick Lee's return match, in the last home-and-away round of the season, against South Melbourne, on 4 September 1920. Then, just 18, and in his third match, Gordon played at centre half-forward in the Collingwood team (with Dick Lee at full-forward) that beat Fitzroy 4.17 (41) to 3.5 (23), at a muddy, rain-sodden MCG, in the 1920 Semi- Final on 11 September 1920. And then, once more at centre half-forward (with Harry Curtis replacing the injured Lee at full-forward), in the Collingwood team that beat Carlton 12.11 (83) to 8.11 (59) in the 1920 Preliminary Final on 25 September 1920, his nineteenth birthday. Then he played at centre half- forward, in the team (with Curtis at full-forward) that lost to Richmond 7.10 (52) to 5.5 (35) in the 1920 Grand Final on 2 October 1920 (Gordon kicked 3 goals). =Half-forward flanker= In 1921, his second VFL season, he was selected in a representative VFL side to play against a combined Bendigo team on 6 August 1921, but did not play (due to influenza).Football Team Selections, The Age, (Tuesday, 26 July 1921), p.8.'Old Boy', \\"Educational Football\\", The Argus, (Monday, 8 August 1921), p.7. He was unable to play in the last home-and-away rounds of the 1921 season due to his illness, although he was able to resume training. Unexpectedly, he was selected as a last minute replacement for Mal Seddon,The League: Collingwood v. Carlton, The Argus, (Saturday, 1 October 1921), p.17. who had declared himself unfit to play on the morning of the match, as a consequence of the injury to his thigh that he had sustained at the preceding Tuesday's training session in a collision with Percy Rowe.Football, The Age, (Friday, 30 September 1921), p.7. Gordon played at centre half-forward (kicking 3 goals) in the team that lost to Carlton 9.11 (65) to 7.10 (52) in the 1921 Semi-Final on 1 October 1921. He played the entire 1922 season playing on one half-forward flank, scoring 42 goals, with his brother, Syd, playing on the other. =Full-Forward= In 1923, with Dick Lee having retired at the end of the 1922 season, Gordon (by this stage a 34-game veteran) moved to full-forward, and was the club's leading goal-kicker that season, with 36 goals. He soon became one of the league's most prolific an consistent goal-kickers. He was Collingwood's best and fairest player in 1933. He was Collingwood's leading goal-kicker for 16 consecutive years, and the league's leading goal-kicker on six occasions (five of which were in consecutive years, 1927-1931). He kicked Collingwod's only two goals in the lowest-scores-ever VFL Grand Final in 1927, with Collingwood, in atrocious conditions, defeating Richmond 2.13 (25) to 1.7 (13). He was the first player to kick 100 goals in a VFL season (which he did in 1929, 1930, 1933, and 1934), kicked a total of 1299 goals in VFL football, and 100 goals in VFL representative teams. His tallies included: * 9 goals in a Grand Final: against Richmond, in the Grand Final, on 29 September 1928. An unbeaten Grand Final record, only equalled on one occasion: by Gary Ablett Sr., against Hawthorn, in the Grand Final, on 30 September 1989. * 10 goals in a match: against North Melbourne on 24 August 1929, and against Melbourne on 2 September 1933. * 11 goals in a match: against Footscray on 19 June 1926, against Fitzroy on 28 May 1927, against St Kilda on 11 June 1927, against South Melbourne on 11 May 1929, and against St Kilda on 5 September 1931. * 14 goals in a match: against Hawthorn on 18 August 1934. * 15 goals in a match: against Essendon on 8 July 1933. * 16 goals in a match: against Hawthorn on 27 July 1929. This broke the previous league record of 14 goals, set by South Melbourne's Harold Robertson ten years earlier in the match against St Kilda on 26 July 1919. * 17 goals in a match: against Fitzroy on 19 July 1930.

It is the traditional county town of the historic county of Montgomeryshire to which it gives its name. The town centre lies about west of the English border. Montgomery Castle was started in 1223 and its parish church in 1227. Other locations in the town include The Old Bell Museum, the Offa's Dyke Path, the Robber's Grave and the town wall.Ann and John Welton The Story of Montgomery Logaston Press 2003, 2nd revised edition 2010 The large Iron Age hill fort of Ffridd Faldwyn is sited northwest of the town and west of the Castle. In the 2011 census, the community of Montgomery had a population of 1,295. The community includes Hen Domen. History Montgomery from John Speed's map of Wales (1610) Montgomery Castle from the south The town was established around a Norman stone castle on a crag. The castle had been built in the early 13th century to control an important ford over the nearby River Severn and replaced an earlier motte and bailey fortification at Hen Domen, one mile away. An important supporter of King William I (the Conqueror), Roger de Montgomery, originally from Montgomery in the Pays d'Auge in Normandy, was given this part of the Welsh Marches by William and his name was given to the town surrounding the castle. The Treaty of Montgomery was signed 29 September 1267 in Montgomeryshire. By this treaty King Henry III of England acknowledged Llywelyn ap Gruffudd as Prince of Wales. Montgomery was sacked at the beginning of the 15th century by the Welsh Prince Owain Glynd≈µr. At that time, the castle and surrounding estates were held by the Mortimer family (the hereditary Earls of March) but they came into royal hands when the last Earl of March died in 1425. In 1485, King Richard III was defeated at the Battle of Bosworth and the Royal Estates, including Montgomery and its castle, passed into the hands of the new King, Henry VII, the first Tudor king, and a Welshman. The castle was then given to another powerful Welsh family, the Herberts. During the Civil War, the castle was captured by Parliamentary forces and subsequently slighted (damaged) to remove its military threat. As a county town, Montgomery prospered, and its buildings give the small town its current character. In 1923 the Montgomeryshire County War Memorial was completed to commemorate fallen servicemen from Montgomeryshire. The memorial is on a hill about 1 km SW of the town. Religious poet and orator George Herbert was born in Montgomery in 1593. After her divorce, Julie Christie lived for a long time on the outskirts of the town. She is reported to saying that the closest thing she had to home lay in the remembered magic of the few summers she had shared with her mother in Wales when she first returned from India. So she bought a basic farm near Montgomery in Wales ... invited some friends to stay with her, which is how she has lived most of her life since.

St Nicholas Parish Church The parish church was founded in the 1220s, with later additions including late 13th-century chancel and transepts and a 19th- century tower. The church is Grade I listed.Parish Church of Saint Nicholas, Montgomery, British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 2016-01-03. Perhaps the most remarkable features of the church are the ornate rood screen, misericords and stalls which were transferred to the church from Chirbury Priory in Shropshire after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. The south transept shows evidence of Montgomery's close association with the Herbert family. The centrepiece is the Elizabethan era tomb or church monument to Richard Herbert (died 1596) of Montgomery Castle, father of poet and Anglican divine George Herbert. This association is recalled in a memorial poem to a well-known local man J. D. K. Lloyd, who wrote this poem after the style of George Herbert. > This O, enclosed around, smoothe, with no entrance found, yet soone with > newest life to overflow So has thy tombe, by Pilate sealed, to us that third > day Life revealed, O grant that I, some morning bright, my earthly Shell, > then broke, may wear, in White, Thy Yoke.

Throughout his trial, and after the sentence, Davies declared his innocence and prayed that God would not allow the grass to grow on his grave for a hundred years as a sign of his innocence. His grave remained bare for at least a century, giving birth to the legend of the Robber's grave. The grave (now grassed) can still be seen in the churchyard. Besides the legendary Robber's Grave, the churchyard also contains the war graves of two soldiers of World War I and a soldier and two airmen of World War II. The Town Hall Town Hall, Broad Street The last remaining Georgian town hall in Montgomeryshire. The red brick Town Hall forms a striking termination to Broad Street, although the centre of the building is offset to the north of the line of the street. Built by William Baker of Audlem, 1748‚Äì51, for Henry Arthur Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis, for whom Baker had also in 1745 provided designs for a new Town Hall at Bishops Castle. In 1828 Thomas Penson, at the expense of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis, raised the roof level over the first floor and introduced sash windows. The clock tower was added in 1921. The predecessor of this building was probably a half- timbered structure, which the Speed map of 1610 shows was sited, lengthways, in the middle of Broad Street.Scourfield R and Haslam R, (2013) Buildings of Wales: Powys; Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire and Breconshire, 2nd edition, Yale University Press, p. 210-11 The Old County Gaol Gatehouse, Old Gaol, Montgomery The former Montgomeryshire County Gaol that once stood at the end of Gaol Road was designed by Thomas Penson, the County Surveyor, and built of brick faced with stone, c 1830‚Äì32. The tall octagonal governor's house, with the chapel above, was at the centre of four radiating two- and three-storey wings. One of the yards was fitted with a treadmill. The gatehouse was built into the wall to face a new approach in 1866 by J.W. Poundley; powerful ashlar triumphal arch with four giant semi-rusticated pilasters. The Gaol was closed in 1878 and all that now remains, apart from the gatehouse, is the Governor's House and the high wall of one cell block.Haslam R '\\"Powys:The Buildings of Wales'\\", (Nikolaus Pevsner advisory editor),1978,167,  Montgomery Primary School  Formerly the National School of 1864.

Retrieved 1 April 2010 Although the Government allows academies to select 10% of pupils by ability, ESF Academies do not do so, being fully comprehensive schools for local children. They have a Christian ethos, but are not faith schools and welcome staff and students of all faiths and of none. History= Establishment of Emmanuel College = In 1988, Sir Peter Vardy responded to the then Government‚Äôs appeal to local businessmen to become involved in the education of young people in the most socio-economically deprived parts of their home regions through sponsorship of the City Technology College initiative. The aim of the initiative was twofold: # To engage business people who had been successful in turning around failing businesses in using their experience to help turn around failing schools, and # To create beacons of academic excellence in inner-city areas which would be able to show other parents, teachers and students what was possible. The first ESF school, Emmanuel City Technology College, was founded in 1990 as Tyneside‚Äôs City Technology College and opened with just 150 students in Year 7. John Burn (Headteacher of Long Benton) had been instrumental in persuading Peter Vardy to engage in the CTC programme. Originally specialising in Technology, the College was awarded a second specialism in Business and Enterprise (2005), allowing it to build upon its Beacon School and current Leading Edge Status through its extensive work in delivering specialist teaching programmes within Primary Schools. = Expansion = The foundation was formally established when The King's Academy was established in Coulby Newham, Middlesbrough in 2003, as one of the earliest schools built under New Labour's academies programme. Vardy pledged to eventually build seven academies. The Foundation's approach was not universally welcomed, and in 2004 opponents blocked the Foundation's bid to take over Northcliffe School in Conisbrough, near Doncaster, which Ofsted had placed under special measures.Blow for Blair as campaign stops sponsored school, Daily Telegraph, 15 October 2004.

Specialising in Engineering and Enterprise, the school focuses on extending conventional perceptions of engineering by providing specialist insights into aspects of biotechnology, environmental science and recycling technologies, sound and computer network engineering, medical and animal science, and naval and automotive systems and design. In September 2009 it was announced that David Wootton would join from the Grace Foundation to become ESF's first Chief Executive.

Academic successes Emmanuel College claims that its students, taught as part of a mixed, non-selective comprehensive school, perform significantly above all value-add measures and their academic results have placed the College amongst the highest ranked schools in England for the past ten years.Emmanuel College on Emmanuel Schools Foundation website (retrieved 17 April 2009) A 2009 report on The King's Academy by Ofsted referred to many improvements, with the school officially ranked as \\"good, with many outstanding features\\". Inspectors said the academy was exceptional when it came to boosting students' personal development and well-being, and offering them care, guidance and support.King's Academy praised in Ofsted report, Teesside Evening Gazette, 4 March 2009 Controversy In 2002, a group of leading scientists including Richard Dawkins alleged that creationism was taught in biology classes at Emmanuel College. Steven Layfield, the College's Head of Science and a Young Earth creationism activist, had held a lecture urging teachers to promote creationism to pupils, parents, and colleagues, including in science classes. Layfield later resigned from the board of creationist body Truth in Science to state a separation between his private views and the school's teaching of science. After reviewing the material used to teach science at Emmanuel College, Mike Tomlinson, chief inspector of Ofsted, decided that the matter did not need to be pursued further. The next Ofsted inspection in 2006 described the school as 'Outstanding' and found no problem with its science provision. In 2005, John Harris in The Guardian accused Emmanuel Schools Foundation of promoting fundamentalist Christianity.What a creation... The Guardian, 15 January 2005 In 2006 Rod Liddle interviewed ex-pupils for a Channel 4 Dispatches programme titled \\"The New Fundamentalists\\", alleging that their teachers had promoted creationism both in and out of class. However, a later article by Martin Wainwright, writing in The Guardian in December 2006, said that associating ESF's schools with creationism \\"couldn't be more wrong.\\"They aren't faith schools and they don't select, The Guardian, 5 December 2006 Opponents of academies continued to refer to the original accusation.E.g.

In 1951, the name was changed to Sugar Corn PopsIn the beginning of the December 16, 1951 episode \\"Wheels of Doom\\" of the radio show The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok, Andy Devine noted the new name change to Sugar Corn Pops. and later it was called Sugar Pops. It was the sponsor for \\"The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok\\" radio and television show. The name was changed to Sugar Corn Pops in 1978, and finally to Corn Pops in 1984, a time when many cereals dropped the word \\"sugar\\" from their titles for marketing reasons. In January 2006, the name of the cereal was changed to Pops, but after a few months of poor reception, was changed back to Corn Pops. In mid-2007, Corn Pops launched its first line extension in many years called \\"Chocolate Peanut Butter Pops\\". In 2012, \\"Cinnamon Corn Pops\\" were introduced. Description A bowl of Corn Pops with milk Corn Pops are made from milled corn. Though the name of the cereal is 'Corn' Pops, since January 2004,http://www.peanutallergy.com/boards/kellogs- corn-pops-wheat-alert its ingredients have included wheat starch, essentially making the cereal multigrain. By 2007, Coconut Oil was added to the US ingredients. The American version features an irregular, flattened, smooth elliptical, shape; Canadian Corn Pops look very different; they are uniformly spherical and have a porous surface, similar to Kix. The taste and texture of the Canadian and American versions of the cereal differ considerably despite sharing the same name and manufacturer. Kellogg's says this is due to raw ingredients and the regulatory agencies that exist in a particular country, and that its cereal differs by country also by virtue of marketing and culture. Research is done in different countries to determine preferences, and the formula for the cereal is changed accordingly, affecting the texture, color, and nutrition. The fat, cholesterol, and protein content is the same. Unlike the vast majority of breakfast cereals, Corn Pops in the USA had been packaged in a foil-lined bag until the mid-2010s. This helped to prevent the Pops from going stale and from secreting a sticky substance that caused the corn pops to stick together (a problem caused by the method by which the cereal is processed).http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mfoilbag.html Honey Smacks, another Kellogg's puffed grain cereal, used the same bag Corn Pops used. However, the Canadian version of Corn Pops had long been packaged in a standard plastic cereal bag, now used for American pops as well. Ingredients Although the cereal contains partially hydrogenated fats, it is marketed as trans-fat free since the amount of trans fat per serving is less than the threshold 0.5 grams/serving. The cereal also contains monoglycerides and diglycerides, used to bind saturated fat, and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), a preservative.24/7 Wall St. Ten Brands That Will Disappear In 2012, 24/7 Wall St., 22-07-2011, access date 28-12-2011 Marketing=Mascots and spokespeople= Guy Madison, the star of The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok television show, appeared on the box from 1951 through 1958, occasionally replaced by sidekick Jingles played by Andy Devine. Between 1959 and 1967, the mascot was Woody Woodpecker. The next mascot for the cereal was \\"Sugar Pop Pete\\", a prairie dog dressed as a cowboy with two \\"six-shooters\\" with red and white spiral-striped barrels. Pete and the other actors in the commercial sang the jingle: \\"Oh, the Pops are sweeter and the taste is new. They're shot with sugar, through and through... Sugar Pops are tops!\\" From 1968 to 1977, the mascot was the \\"Whippersnapper,\\" a live-action, whip-cracking cowboy. 1979-80 introduced the mascot \\"Big Yella,\\" a cartoon cowboy in a huge yellow ten-gallon hat, yellow chaps, boots, shirt and vest who tried to trade his collection of giant yellow objects for a bowl of Corn Pops. From 1980 to 1983, a porcupine named \\"Poppy\\" represented the cereal. Poppy carried around a yellow suitcase which contained a complete breakfast setting, meeting the by-then industry-standard \\"part of a complete breakfast\\" tagline. In early 2009, a live actor dressed up as a Corn Pops puff became the new mascot of Corn Pops. Then, in mid-2009, Kellogg's introduced an alternative mascot named the \\"Sweet Toothasaur,\\" consisting of the upside down bottom half of an actor's face, with a green felt cap with googly eyes and red paper horns on the actor's chin. =Taglines= *Sugar Pops Are tops! (pre-1980s) *Gotta get... POPS! (1981‚Äì1988) *Poppin' in my head. (late 1980s, alternating with \\"Gotta Have My Pops\\") *You've gotta catch new Corn Pops!

(present in Canada) Numerous ad campaigns used John Williams' theme from Jaws. Elsewhere=Canada and France= Unlike the American Corn Pops, in Europe (in France it is called Miel Pops ‚Äì meaning Honey Pops) the cereal consists of small, spherical, uniform balls. Both versions are crunchier and have a different taste. = United Kingdom = In the early 1990s, Corn Pops were introduced in the United Kingdom but by 2004, they were no longer available. The tagline used in the UK was different: \\"You can't stop a corn popper popping more corn.\\" Corn Pops sponsored UK boy band Take That's 1994 tour, known as \\"The Pops Tour\\". However People have started petitions to bring it back to the U.K. market via social media sites.

Besides in Ljubljana, he worked in Vienna, Belgrade and on the Prague Castle. He influenced the avant-garde Czech Cubism. He is also a founding member of the Ljubljana School of Architecture, joining it upon an invitation by Ivan Vurnik, another notable Ljubljana architect. Life Pleƒçnik was born in Ljubljana, Carniola, Austria-Hungary, present-day Slovenia, the son of Helena (Molka) and Andrej Pleƒçnik.http://www.leksikon.si/Oseba/OsebaId/196 He studied with noted Viennese architect and educator Otto Wagner and worked in Wagner's architecture office until 1900. Work From 1900 through 1910, while practicing in the Wagner's office in Vienna, he designed the Langer House (1900) and the Zacherlhaus (1903‚Äì1905). His 1910‚Äì1913 Church of the Holy Spirit (Heilig-Geist-Kirche) is remarkable for its innovative use of poured- in-place concrete as both structure and exterior surface, and also for its abstracted classical form language. Most radical is the church's crypt, with its slender concrete columns and angular, cubist capitals and bases. In 1911, Pleƒçnik moved to Prague, where he taught at the college of arts and crafts. The first president of the new Czechoslovak Republic from 1918 onwards, Tom√°≈° Masaryk, appointed Pleƒçnik chief architect for the 1920 renovation of the Prague Castle. From 1920 until 1934 Pleƒçnik completed a wide range of projects at the castle, including renovation of gardens and courtyards, the design and installation of monuments and sculptures, and the design of numerous new interior spaces, including the Pleƒçnik Hall completed in 1930, which features three levels of abstracted Doric colonnades. His final work in Prague was the Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord (Roman Catholic, 1929‚Äì32). Upon the 1921 establishment of the Ljubljana School of Architecture in his hometown of Ljubljana, he was invited by the fellow Slovene architect Ivan Vurnik to become a founding faculty member and moved to teach architecture at the University of Ljubljana. Pleƒçnik would remain in Ljubljana until his death, and it is there that his influence as an architect is most noticeable. =Giving the city of Ljubljana its modern identity= Pleƒçnik gave the capital of Slovenia, the city of Ljubljana, its modern identity by designing iconic buildings such as the Slovene National and University Library building. He also designed other notable buildings, including the Vzajemna Insurance Company Offices, and contributed to many civic improvements. He renovated the city's bridges and the Ljubljanica River banks, and designed the Ljubljana open market buildings, the Ljubljana cemetery, parks, plazas etc. Buildings designed by Pleƒçnik were built by the constructor Matko Curk. During the Communist period of Slovene history Pleƒçnik fell out of favor as a Catholic and his teaching role at the university was gradually reduced because he was over 70 years old. In 1947, at the invitation of the president of the Slovene People‚Äôs Assembly to design a new Parliament building, Pleƒçnik proposed the Cathedral of Freedom (also known as the Pleƒçnik Parliament) where he wanted to raze the Ljubljana Castle and to build a monumental octagonal building instead. In 1952, Ljubljana city leaders asked Pleƒçnik to remodel the Kri≈æanke monastery into a venue for the Ljubljana Festival, his last big Ljubljana project. Other projects he completed at that time included the renovation of the Pre≈°eren Theater, plus the Pleƒçnik Arcades, stairway and fountain, all in Kranj, the reconstruction of churches, the design of the Pavilion on Brijuni Islands (Tito's summer state residence), and numerous National Liberation War monuments (in Ljubljana-Trnovo, Vipava, Radeƒçe, ƒårna na Koro≈°kem, Dolenja vas, Sevnica, La≈°ko, Split, Kraljevo, etc.). For his work he twice received the Pre≈°eren Award, in 1949 and 1952 for his life's work. Pleƒçnik died in 1957 and received an official state funeral in ≈Ωale, attended by many political, cultural and church leaders. Legacy In the 1980s, with postmodernist interest in Pleƒçnik's work, the general interest in him has been revived, as well, after being forgotten during the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, Pleƒçnik's legacy has been commemorated in various ways, most notably in the 1990s on the Slovene 500 tolar banknote, with the National and University Library of Slovenia depicted on the reverse.http://banknote.ws/COLLECTION/countries/EUR/SLV/SLV0016.htmShafer, N., Cuhaj, G. S., Thern, R., & Bruce, C. R. (2019). Standard catalog of world paper money. Iola, WI: Krause Publications. Pg. 996 The unrealized Cathedral of Freedom designed by Pleƒçnik is featured on the Slovene 10 cent euro coin. Slovenska akropola is the title of a 1987 album by the Slovene industrial music group Laibach. During August 2008, a maquette of the Parliament was featured at the Project Pleƒçnik exhibition on the architect's life, held at the Council of the European Union building in Brussels, Belgium on the occasion of the Slovene EU Presidency. The exhibition's curator Boris Podrecca described the Parliament as \\"the most charismatic object\\" of Pleƒçnik's opus.Triera.com: Podreccova slovenska trilogija v Bruslju In addition, on 23 January 2012, to celebrate the 140th anniversary of Pleƒçnik's birth, a picture of the Triple Bridge was featured as the official Google logo (Doodle) adaptation in Slovenia. Pleƒçnik's home in Ljubljana houses a museum of his life and work.https://www.visitljubljana.com/en/visitors/things-to- do/sightseeing/plecnik-house/ There are several busts and sculptures of him situated around the national capital (Ljubljana) as a tourist attractions or as proud reminders of his works and legacy.

Football  San Marino, along with Italy, enjoys football (soccer) as its most popular sport. = Domestic Football = The San Marino Championship, founded under the auspices of the FSGC (San Marino Football Federation), is the premier footballing competition in San Marino. The fifteen teams that take part in the competition are split into two groups of eight and seven teams. The top three from each section at the end of the regular season progress into a semi-knockout style Championship Playoff. Prior to 2007, the playoff champion earned a spot in the preliminary rounds of the UEFA Cup. In 2007, UEFA granted San Marino a spot in the 1st Qualifying Round of the Champions League. 2007 league champions S.S. Murata was the first team to represent San Marino in the Champions League when they participated in the 2007-08 competition, losing to Finland's Tampere team. San Marino also has a representative in the Italian system, with San Marino Calcio playing in the fourth tier of Italian football, Serie D. San Marino play their home matches in the Sanmarinese at the Stadio Olimpico of Serravalle. = International Football = The San Marino national team played its first unofficial international match in 1986, in which it suffered a 0‚Äì1 defeat to the Canadian Olympic team. Its first competitive outing was on November 14, 1990, a 0‚Äì4 loss against Switzerland in the European Championship qualifier. These defeats set the tone for most of the following outings of the team, who are regarded as whipping boys in the qualifying sections of the European Championship and the World Cup, calling into question the merits of San Marino and the other 'microstate' teams (Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Malta) being included in the main qualifying groups for said tournaments. They had a brief moment of glory when they faced England in a World Cup qualifier on November 17, 1993 and took the lead through Davide Gualtieri after just 8.3 seconds - still the fastest goal in World Cup competition. Despite this goal, only San Marino's third at international level, the microstate went on to lose 7‚Äì1. Until recently, San Marino's international record was one of almost total failure, with famous draws against Turkey and Latvia being the only partial successes in an international career that contains over 70 defeats. However, on 29 April 2004, San Marino recorded their first ever win, with a 1‚Äì0 victory over Liechtenstein in an international friendly. Andy Selva scored the only goal in a close game that finally gave this tiny republic a footballing victory. On September 6, 2006, San Marino suffered their biggest ever defeat, losing 13-0 to world giants Germany in the Stadio Olimpico. It was also the largest goal margin defeat in European Championship Qualifying history. In the same competition on February 7, 2007, they came within 8 seconds of the best result in their history. They were level at 1‚Äì1 with the Republic of Ireland after 94 minutes when Stephen Ireland scored within 8 seconds of the final whistle. The goal scored by San Marino was their European Qualifying first goal since losing 4-1 to Austria in 1998. As of January 2019, San Marino is 209th in the FIFA world rankings - almost last place with 824 points (bottom is Anguilla.) The most notable Sanmarinese footballer was Massimo Bonini, a midfielder, who played for the national team, but most notably for Italy's Juventus F.C. from 1981 to 1988. In 2020 San Marino made it through a round for the first time in a UEFA competition making it to the playoffs of the 2022 Futsal EURO. Motorsport Although named after the Republic, the San Marino Grand Prix of Formula One was actually held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about northwest of San Marino, along the Via Emilia. It was removed from the sport's calendar in 2007 due to no negotiations to renew the contract with the event organizers. This Grand Prix became etched in infamy after two fatal accidents occurred in 1994, when rookie Roland Ratzenberger and three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna were killed while competing. San Marino motorcycle Grand Prix has been held during the years in Imola, Misano and Mugello. Currently, Misano hosts both the Grand Prix and the World Superbike Race. Sammarinese Manuel Poggiali won two World Championship titles: 125cc in 2001 and 250cc in 2003. Alex de Angelis has won one 250cc race and is currently riding in the Moto2 class.

History Ruins of the Ducal Castle The town was established by Duke of Silesia Henry IV Probus, of the Piast dynasty, as Frankenstein in the early 13th century, following the Mongol invasion of Poland. The town was founded in the vicinity of the old Polish settlement of Sadlno, through which ran a trade route connecting Silesia and Bohemia. The town was sited on a piece of land that belonged partly to the episcopal lands of Zwr√≥cona and partly to the Monastery at Trzebnica. The town was located exactly halfway between the sites of two previously existing towns that had failed to attract enough settlers: Frankenberg and L√∂wenstein, and inherited its German name from both. Its positioning on the so-called King's Road between Prague and Wroc≈Çaw, not too far from the commercially important city of K≈Çodzko would favour the development of the town. The town received municipal rights around 1280, the first mention of civitas Frankenstein is dated 10 January 1287. At the beginning of the 14th century, the first town hall and the castle were erected. The city remained under rule of the Polish Piast dynasty before it was sold to the Bohemian (Czech) King in 1351. Preserved townhouses at the Market Square In 1428 the city was invaded by the Hussites. In 1456, Bohemian King Ladislaus the Posthumous gave the city in hereditary possession to the Czech noble Podiebrad family, to which it belonged until 1569. The city was heavily damaged in 1468, during the Bohemian‚ÄìHungarian War, and until 1490 it belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary, before becoming again part of Bohemia. In the 16th century, the castle and defensive walls were rebuilt. Trade and craft flourished. In the early 17th century the plague killed about one third of the population, and it has been speculated that events at that time may have inspired the Frankenstein story.Website describing events which might have inspired Mary Shelley's novel The Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) ended the town's prosperity. Austrian and Swedish troops marched through the city, which was severely damaged. Afterwards, until the late 19th century, it remained a small town. In 1742 it was annexed by Prussia. In 1858 the town burned down and had to be rebuilt. On this occasion, the upper part of the 15th-century leaning tower was reconstructed in a straight manner. The town was a county seat from 1816 to 1945. From 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany. The city was not destroyed during World War II. After Germany's defeat in World War II, the town once again became part of Poland, along with most of Silesia, and was renamed ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie in 1946. The totality of its population was expelled. ZƒÖbkowice ≈ölƒÖskie was repopulated by Poles expelled from former Eastern Poland, annexed by the Soviet Union, as well as those arriving from central Poland.

The screenplay concerns a group of villagers trying to keep their branch line operating after British Railways decided to close it. The film was written by T. E. B. Clarke and was inspired by the restoration of the narrow gauge Talyllyn Railway in Wales, the world's first heritage railway run by volunteers. The name \\"Titfield\\" is an amalgamation of the villages of Limpsfield and Titsey in Surrey, near Clarke's home at Oxted. Michael Truman was the producer. The film was produced by Ealing Studios and was the first of its comedies shot in Technicolor - one of the first such made in the UK. There was considerable inspiration from the book Railway Adventure by established railway book author L. T. C. Rolt, published in 1952. Rolt had acted as honorary manager for the volunteer enthusiasts running the Talyllyn Railway for the two years 1951‚Äì52. A number of scenes in the film, such as the emergency re-supply of water to the locomotive by buckets from an adjacent stream, or passengers being asked to assist in pushing the carriages, were taken from this book. Plot The residents of the village of Titfield are shocked to learn that their railway branch line to the town of Mallingford is to be closed. Sam Weech, the local vicar and a railway enthusiast, and Gordon Chesterford, the village squire, decide to take over the line by setting up a company through a Light Railway Order. Upon securing financial backing from Walter Valentine, a wealthy man with a fondness for daily drinking, the men learn that the Ministry of Transport will give them a month's trial period, in which they must pass an inspection at the end of this period to make the Order permanent. While Weech is helped by Chesterford and retired track layer Dan Taylor in running the train, volunteers from the village help to operate the station. Bus operators Alec Pearce and Vernon Crump, who bitterly oppose the idea and wish to set up a bus line between Titfield and Mallingford, attempt to sabotage the men's plans. Aided by Harry Hawkins, a steam roller operator who hates the railway, Crump and Pearce attempt to block the line on its first run and sabotage the line's water tower, but are thwarted by Weech and the line's supportive passengers. After Chesterford refuses to accept a merger offer from them, Crump and Pearce hire Hawkins to help them derail the line's steam locomotive and only passenger car, the night before the line's inspection. Blakeworth, the village's solicitor, is mistakenly arrested for this, despite trying to stop the attempt, while the villagers become disheartened that their line will now close without any rolling stock and a working locomotive. Valentine visits Taylor, who suggests that they borrow a locomotive from Mallingford's rail yards. Despite being both drunk, they manage to acquire one, but accidentally crash it after they're spotted taking it. Both men are promptly arrested by the police as a result. Meanwhile, Weech is inspired by a picture of the line's first locomotive, the Thunderbolt, which is now housed in the Mallingford's museum. Upon securing Blakeworth's release, he helps them to acquire the locomotive for the branch line. To complete their new train, the villagers use Taylor's home, an old railway carriage body, hastily strapped to a flat wagon. In the morning, Pearce and Crump drive to the village to prepare to take passengers, but are shocked to see the train waiting at the station. Distracted from his driving, Pearce crashes the bus into the police van transporting Valentine and Taylor, and when Crump lets slip that they have been involved in sabotaging the line they are promptly arrested. With Taylor arrested, Weech takes help from Ollie Matthews, a fellow railway devotee and the Bishop of Welchester, in running the Thunderbolt for the inspection run. The train departs late because the police demand transport to Mallingford for them and the arrested men. Despite a mishap with the coupling, the villagers help the train complete its run to Mallingford. Upon arriving, Weech learns that the line passed every requirement for the Light Railway Order, but barely. In fact, had they been any faster, their application would have been rejected. Cast *Stanley Holloway as Walter Valentine *George Relph as Vicar Sam Weech *Naunton Wayne as George Blakeworth *John Gregson as Squire Gordon Chesterford *Godfrey Tearle as Ollie Matthews, the Bishop of Welchester *Hugh Griffith as Dan Taylor *Gabrielle Brune as Joan Hampton *Sid James as Harry Hawkins *Reginald Beckwith as Coggett *Edie Martin as Emily *Michael Trubshawe as Ruddock *Jack MacGowran as Vernon Crump *Ewan Roberts as Alec Pearce *Herbert C. Walton as Seth *John Rudling as Clegg *Nancy O'Neil as Mrs Blakeworth *Campbell Singer as Police Sergeant *Frank Atkinson as Station Sergeant *Wensley Pithey as Policeman Driver Ted Burbidge, fireman Frank Green and guard Harold Alford were not actors: they were British Railways employees from the Westbury depot, provided to operate the train on location. Charles Crichton spoke with them on location and realised they \\"looked and sounded the part\\", so they were given speaking roles and duly credited. Production Lion (seen here in May 1980) masqueraded as Thunderbolt for the film. Shooting was largely carried out near Bath, Somerset, on the Camerton branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway, along the Cam Brook valley between Camerton and . The branch had closed to all traffic on 15 February 1951, but was reopened for filming. Titfield railway station was in reality Monkton Combe railway station, whilst Titfield village was nearby Freshford, with other scenes being shot at the disused Dunkerton Colliery. Mallingford railway station in the closing scene was Bristol Temple Meads railway station. The opening scene shows Midford Viaduct on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, where the branch passed under the viaduct. The scene featuring Sid James's character's traction engine, and the Squire's attempts to overtake it, was filmed in Carlingcott. The scene where a replacement locomotive is 'stolen' was filmed in the Oxfordshire town of Woodstock. The 'locomotive' was a wooden mock-up mounted on a lorry chassis: the rubber tyres can (just) be spotted between the locomotive's driving wheels. The earlier scene of No. 1401 crashing and getting wrecked as it heads down an embankment used realistic scale models. The Thunderbolt itself was represented by an actual antique museum resident, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway locomotive Lion, built in 1838 and so at the time 114 years old. Lion is one of the earliest British locomotives, built only nine years after Stephenson's Rocket and running under its own power in the film. It was repainted in a colourful red and green livery to suit the Technicolor cameras. When filming the scene in which the Thunderbolt is \\"rear- ended\\" by the uncoupled train, the locomotive's tender sustained some actual damage, which remains visible beneath the buffer beam to this day. The scene where Thunderbolt is removed at night from its museum was filmed in the (now demolished) Imperial Institute building near the Royal Albert Hall in South Kensington, London. All these shots were made using a studio-built model. Release The film had its gala premiere at London's Leicester Square Theatre on 5 March 1953, as part of the British Film Academy's award ceremony, before going on general release from the 6th. Critical reception The BFI's Monthly Film Bulletin for April 1953 found the script disconcertingly short on wit, and some of its invention seems forced.' The film has become compared unfavourably with other Ealing comedies. Ivan Butler in his Cinema in Britain called it 'A minor Ealing perhaps even a little tired towards the evening of their long comedy day but a very pleasant sunset for all that.' George Perry in his history of the Ealing Studios, Forever Ealing, pointed out that like Whisky Galore and Passport to Pimlico the film 'adopted the theme of the small group pitted against and universally triumphing over the superior odds of a more powerful opponent.' But, quoting a location report by Hugh Samson of Picturegoer, he suggests there was a lack of sympathy for the subject: 'Odd point about this railway location: not a single railway enthusiast to be found in the whole crew. T.E.B.'Tibby' Clarke, writer of the script, loathes trains. Producer Michael Truman can't get out of them fast enough. And director Crichton - well, you wouldn't find him taking engine numbers at Paddington Station.' Charles Barr in Ealing Studios felt that the film did not identify with audiences who for instance in Passport to Pimlico were yearning for the end of rationing; 'There is no grasp of a living community, or of the relevance of the train to people's daily needs.'

It is the northernmost populated place in the municipality of Ocampo, which lies within the Mexican state of Coahuila. Situated next to the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, visitors on foot from the United States can enter the village via the Boquillas Port of Entry and tourism is the principal industry in Boquillas. The village lies immediately west of the northern part of the Sierra del Carmen mountain range and at the south-west end of the Rio Grande's Boquillas Canyon. Boquillas del Carmen was founded as a mining town in the late 19th-century, after valuable minerals were found in the nearby mountains. Mining ceased in 1919 and the population rapidly declined. History=19th century= Silver was discovered in the Sierra del Carmen in the early 1890s. The arrival of miners led to the establishment of two border camps either side of the Rio Grande: Boquillas in Texas (now Rio Grande Village) and Boquillas del Carmen. In addition to the silver, lead and zinc were also discovered. The mined ore containing these metals was smelted in a small furnace by the banks of the river near Boquillas del Carmen before being transported by road to El Paso where it was further processed. The local mining company operated a cable car across the Rio Grande between the two Boquillas. At the height of mining operations, there were between 2,000 and 4,000 people living in Boquillas del Carmen.https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/geology/publications/state/tx/1968-7/sec2.htm =20th century= Around the turn of the 20th century up to 2000 people lived in Boquillas. The principal employment came from industries relating to the production of lead, silver and fluorite ore from nearby mines. Mining ceased in 1919 and the town's population rapidly declined.http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/For-Boquillas-del- Carmen-the-wait-for-6134542.php Efforts began in the 1930s to create a United States-Mexico International Peace Park in the area, joining Big Bend National Park with the Maderas del Carmen in Coahuila. Boquillas del Carmen would have been at the center of this proposed international peace park, but these efforts have not been realized. Despite this, Boquillas del Carmen interacted with Big Bend in other ways. Tourism from across the Rio Grande became the main trade. Country music star Robert Earl Keen was known to have frequented Boquillas and released an album in 1994 entitled Gringo Honeymoon whose title track is said to be about a day he and a female companion visited the village.http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=11572 During the 2000 census, the town's population was calculated as comprising 191 people. =21st century= Boquillas del Carmen, October 2013 The events of September 11, 2001, dramatically affected Boquillas del Carmen's 20th-century way of life. In May 2002, the border crossing from Big Bend National Park to Boquillas was closed indefinitely. By October 2006, only 19 families comprising around 90 to 100 residents remained in Boquillas. Most of the town's residents had been forced to move away by the closure of the tourist crossing and destruction of the town's traditional economy. At the time of the 2010 census, the town's population was recorded as comprising only 110 people. On January 7, 2011, the US National Park Service announced plans to reopen the crossing using a ferry and a passport control center planned to open in the spring of 2012. After multiple delays, the new Boquillas Port of Entry was finally officially opened on 10 April 2013. The hours of operation currently are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday, subject to seasonal changes. Since opening of the border crossing, the town of Boquillas del Carmen has seen substantial growth with the addition of electricity (from solar panels), a new medical care office, and enhancements at the public elementary school. The village's population is now said to be about 200 persons. Visitors are allowed to bring one bottle of alcohol back to the U.S. via this entry point. One may not bring tobacco back to the U.S. via this entry point. Economy After the end of the mining industry, tourism developed in Boquillas in the 20th century with Jose Falcon's restaurant opening in 1973.https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekelly/2019/03/07/passport-required-to- enjoy-this-magical-margarita-near-big-bend-national-park-in-texas/ In the late 1990s, Boquillas was a small town of around 300 residents primarily dependent on the Big Bend tourist trade with visitors crossing the Rio Grande to visit the village's bar, restaurant, and taco stands. Children posted adjacent to the village's Christian mission sold rocks collected in the desert or from nearby caves. Tourism options included pony and donkey rentals, drinks at Park Bar and overnight stays at a local bed and breakfast known as the Buzzard's Roost (since renamed as La Zappolita). The village continues to generate its income from tourists visiting on foot and in 2018 over 11,000 entered Boquillas from the United States.https://www.latinousa.org/2019/04/15/mexicanbordertown/ Local guides offer walking tours of the small village and locally produced handicrafts are on sale. Tours to the Boquillas Canyon, hot springs, archaeological sites and caves in the surrounding area by foot, truck, horse/burro, and canoe are also available.http://boquillas.org/tour/ There are at least two restaurants/bars in the village and several curio shops selling mostly bead craft work. Los Diablos, a firefighting team, lives in Boquillas. They work in the national park where they fight wildfires and sometimes support firefighting efforts in the United States.https://splinternews.com/meet-los-diablos-the-mexican- firefighters-who-chase-th-1793857787 Infrastructure In 2015 a solar farm was brought into operation, providing electricity throughout the village.http://www.newswest9.com/story/28773472/town-of-boquillas-gets- electricity-for-first-time-in-history Apart from the river crossing to Big Bend, Boquillas can be reached by road along Mexican Federal Highway 53. The nearest settlement of any size is Santa Rosa de M√∫zquiz which is 150 miles away with a journey time of at least 4 hours on account of the poor road condition. In 2013, it was noted that there was no mobile phone coverage or internet provision in Boquillas.https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/12/26/ragged- edges/ A single telephone line now comes into the village. When one calls that line, the operator states a specific time at which the caller should call back, promising that the operator will find the person being telephoned and ensure that he/she is at the phone in order to receive the call at the appointed time. Demographics Since 1990, the population has never been officially recorded as over 200. It suffered over a 40% drop over the period 2000 to 2010. By 2017 the population was estimated to have grown to around 300 people.https://www.saveur.com/boquillas-mexican-border-town The village has a Roman Catholic church and a small Baptist church (Boquillas Bautista Iglesia).https://visitbigbend.com/going-to-boquillas/ In 2010 the religious breakdown of Boquillas del Carmen was:Censo de Poblaci√≥n y Vivienda 2010 - Microdatos *Roman Catholic - 59 (53.6%) *Protestant/Evangelical/Biblical Christians - 44 (40.0%) *No religion/Atheist - 6 (5.4%) ClimateSee also *Big Bend National Park ReferencesExternal links *Virtual Reality Panorama Near Boquillas *Visit Boquillas Information and Tours *Mexican towns slowly recovering from closed borders *US to leave Mexican border crossing to rangers Populated places in Coahuila Populated places established in the 1890s Mining communities in Mexico ","title":"Boquillas del Carmen"},{"id":"624905","text":"A bar examination is an examination administered by the bar association of a jurisdiction that a lawyer must pass in order to be admitted to the bar of that jurisdiction. Australia Administering bar exams is the responsibility of the bar association in the particular state or territory concerned. Those interested in pursuing a career at the bar must first be admitted as lawyers in the Supreme Court of their home state or territory. This generally requires the completion of legal studies which can take up to 8 years depending on the mode of study, the particular degree being completed and the law school. After completing a law degree, law graduates are then usually required to complete a period of Practical Legal Training (PLT). During the PLT period, law graduates are provided with further legal education focusing more on the practical or technical aspects of the law, such as court practice, conveyancing and drafting statements of claim. Law graduates are also required to complete a minimum number of days under the supervision of a more senior lawyer. After the successful completion of practical legal training, law graduates must then apply to be admitted to the Supreme Court in their state or territory. This ceremony is usually held with the Chief Justice of the state or territory presiding. It is a formal ceremony which also includes taking an oath (or making an affirmation) to uphold the laws of the jurisdiction and results in the person's name being recorded on the Roll of Practitioners in that jurisdiction. Once admitted, those wishing to practise as barristers must contact the relevant bar association to register and sit the bar exam. The frequency and availability of these exams depends on the relevant bar association. Generally, the bar exams focus on three main areas of practice which are relevant to barristers; namely evidence, procedure and ethics. The exams are usually administered during the course of a day and comprise a variety of question types, usually answers are given in essay form. Candidates are informed of their results within a few months and pass rates are very competitive. Passing the bar exam in and of itself does not automatically allow one to practise as a barrister, in many jurisdictions (such as New South Wales) further requirements apply. = New South Wales = In New South Wales, successful bar exam candidates are required to complete the NSW Bar Association Bar Practice Course (BPC), which despite its name, is a mandatory course required to be taken after passing the bar exam. The BPC consists of lectures, assignments and a significant amount of further reading about court procedure and case law. At the conclusion of the BPC, candidates are then required to appear in a mock trial, often before real judicial officers, and argue their respective case. Once satisfied that the candidate has completed these requirements, the NSW Bar Association then provides each candidate with their practising certificate. Newly called barristers are referred to as readers for a period of usually one year and are required to have at least one tutor who is barrister with at least seven years of call but is not Senior Counsel. The term reader and tutor are similar to the term pupil and pupil master as used in the United Kingdom Inns of Court. The initial practising certificate often contains restrictions on what type of work readers are permitted to do. This may include restrictions such as appearing in court alone, undertaking direct access briefs or any other restriction which the bar association deems appropriate. After the 12-month period and upon completion of further requirements such as civil and criminal reading to the bar associations satisfaction, readers are then provided with an unrestricted practising certificate and are no longer readers but barristers. = Further Information = Further information can be obtained from the relevant bar association in each state or territory: New South Wales Bar Association Victorian Bar Association Queensland Bar Association Brazil The Order of Attorneys of Brazil (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil), the Brazilian bar association, administers a bar examination nationwide two to three times a year (usually in January, March and September). The exam is divided in two stages ‚Äì the first consists of 80 multiple choice questions covering all disciplines (Ethics, Human Rights, Philosophy of Law, Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, Civil Law, Consumer Law, Civil Procedure Law, Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, Labour Law and Labour Procedure Law). The candidate must score at least 40 questions correctly to proceed to the second part of the exam, four essay questions and a drafting project (motion, opinion or claim document) in Civil Law (including Consumer Law), Labour Law, Criminal Law, Administrative Law, Constitutional Law, Corporate Law or Tax Law, and their respective procedures. The Bar examination can be taken on the graduation year. Success in the examination allows one to practice in any court or jurisdiction of the country.  Canada  In Canada, admission to the bar is a matter of provincial or territorial jurisdiction. All provinces except for Qu√©bec follow a common law tradition. Lawyers in every common law province are qualified as both barristers and solicitors, and must pass a Barristers' Examination and Solicitors' Examination administered by the Law Society that governs the legal profession in their respective province or territory. The common law provinces all require prospective lawyers to complete a term of articles (usually 10 months) after graduation from law school during which they work under the supervision of a qualified lawyer. The bar exams may be taken after graduation from law school, but before the commencement of articling, or may be taken during or after articling is completed. Once the barristers' and solicitors' exams have been passed and the term of articles is successfully completed, students may then be called to the bar and admitted to the legal profession as lawyers (barristers and solicitors). People's Republic of ChinaEngland and Wales Since the UK has a separated legal profession, Law graduates in England and Wales can take examinations to qualify as a Barrister or a Solicitor by either undertaking the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) or the Legal Practice Course (LPC) respectively. These courses are the vocational part of the training required under the rules of the Bar Standards Board and the Solicitors Regulation Authority and are either undertaken on a full-time basis for one year or on a part-time basis over two years. After successfully completing these courses, which generally include various examinations and practical ability tests, graduates must secure either a training contract (for those who have completed the LPC) or a pupillage (for those who have completed the BPTC). These are akin to articling positions in other jurisdictions and are the final practical stage before being granted full admission to practice. The general timescale therefore to become fully qualified after entering Law School can range between 6‚Äì7 years (assuming no repeats are required). However some controversy remains about the lack of training contracts and pupillages available to graduates even after having completed the LPC/BPTC. These courses can vary in cost anywhere from ¬£9,000 to ¬£17,000 and are generally undertaken by students on a private basis making them incur additional costs. The final debt in student fees alone after having completed the academic and vocational training can range between ¬£20,000-¬£25,000. This is set to increase to ¬£40,000-¬£50,000 for students entering law school. France In France, Law graduates must obtain a vocational degree called certificat d'aptitude √† la profession d'avocat (or CAPA in everyday speech) in order to practice independently. The most common way to achieve the CAPA is by training in an √©cole d'avocats (Lawyer's School). This training includes academical and vocational courses and mandatory internships in law firms. Entrance to Lawyer's School is obtained by competitive examination. Germany To become a lawyer in Germany, one has to study law at university for four or five years. Then, one has to pass the First Juristic Examination (Erste Juristische Pr√ºfung) in Law, which is administered in parts by the Oberlandesgericht (Higher State Court) of the respective state and in parts by the university the person attends; the state part accounts for two thirds of the final grade, the university part for one third. This examination provides a very limited qualification, as there are no formal careers in the legal field that can be followed without further training. After the first juristic examination, candidates that wish to fully qualify must participate in a two-year practical training period (Referendariat) including practical work as judge, prosecutor, and attorney. At the end of this training, candidates must take and pass the Second State Examination (Zweites Staatsexamen). This examination, if passed, allows successful participants to enter the bar as attorney, to become judges and to become state attorneys. All careers have the same legal training (Einheitsjurist), even though some careers require additional training (namely public notaries and patent lawyers). Ghana To become a lawyer in Ghana, you have to study law at any university that offers the Bachelor of Laws degree. After completing the four year law degree, graduands can apply to be enrolled at the Ghana School of Law. Following two years of professional training, successful students can take their bar examination. Upon passing the bar examination, an induction and calling to the bar ceremony is held for all graduating students. Hungary In Hungary, the Bar Examination is called \\"Jogi Szakvizsga\\", can be translated as \\"Legal Profession Examination\\". To sit for an exam, the candidate needs at least 3 years of daily 8 hours work experience after having a law university degree (masters level).5/1991. (IV.4.) IM rendelet This exam is composed of three parts: # Criminal Law, Criminal Procedural Law and Law of Criminal Enforcement # Civil Law, Civil Procedural Law and Business Law # Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, Labor Law, Social Security Law and Law of the European Union. After passing these exams the candidate can practice law as a lawyer or as a court secretary, judge, a prosecutor at the public prosecutor's office, as a notary public, deputy notary, or an in-house legal counsel etc., and may operate individually at any field of Hungarian law (which also means that they may appear before any Hungarian court without a professional legal representative 2016\\\\. √©vi CXXX. t√∂rv√©ny 75. ¬ß). Ireland The bar exams in Ireland are the preserve of the Honorable Society of King's Inns, which runs a series of fourteen exams over ten weeks, from March to June each year, for those enrolled as students in its one-year Barrister-at-Law degree course. These exams cover such skills as advocacy, research and opinion writing, consulting with clients, negotiation, drafting of legal documents and knowledge of civil and criminal procedure. For those who fail to meet the requisite 50% pass mark, repeats are held in the following August and September. Israel Israel requires candidates to have a law degree from an educational institution recognized by the Law Faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem before being eligible to take the examinations for admittance to the Israel Bar Association. The candidate must pass a battery of examinations for admittance. There is an initial series of examinations in eight separate areas of law: obligations and labor law, property law, family and succession law, criminal law and procedure, civil procedure and professional ethics, constitutional and administration law, commercial law on corporations, partnerships, and other associations, and commercial law on bankruptcy, liquidations, bills, exchange, and tax law. After passing these exams, candidates must serve as an articled clerk for one year, after which they must pass the final examinations, which deal with court procedure, procedure for registering land rights in real estate, procedure for registering corporations, partnerships, and liquidations, interpretation of laws and judicial documents, professional ethics, evidence, and recent changes in case law and legislation. The final examinations consist of a written examination followed by an oral examination in front of three judges.http://www.israelbar.org.il/uploadFiles/basic%20requirements.pdf Iran The Bar Exam in Iran is administered by two different and completely separate bodies. One is the Bar Association of every province‚Äîall of which are under the auspices of the country's syndicate of the bars of the country. The other one is administered by the Judicial System of Iran subject to article 187 of the country's economic, social and cultural development plan. To receive the license to practice as a ‚ÄúFirst Degree Attorney‚Äù in Iran, an applicant should complete a bachelor of law program. The official career path starts after passing the Bar Exam and receiving the title of ‚ÄúTrainee at Law‚Äù. The exam is highly competitive and only a certain number of top applicants are admitted annually. After admission to the bar, an 18-month apprenticeship begins which is highly regulated under the auspices of Bar Syndicate Rules and supervision of an assigned First Degree Attorney. Trainees or apprentices must attend designated courts for designated weeks to hear cases and write case summaries. A logbook signed by the judge on the bench has to certify their weekly attendance. By the end of the eighteenth month, they are eligible to apply to take the Final Bar Exam by submitting their case summaries, the logbook and a research work pre-approved by the Bar. It is noteworthy, however, that during these 18 months, Trainees are eligible to have a limited practice of law under the supervision of their supervising Attorney. This practice does not include Supreme Court eligible cases and certain criminal and civil cases. Candidates will be tested on Civil law, Civil Procedure, Criminal law, Criminal Procedure, Commercial Law, Notary (including rules pertaining Official Documents, Land & Real Estate registrations and regulations etc.). Each exam takes two days, a day on oral examination in front of a judge or an attorney, and a day of essay examination, in which they will be tested on hypothetical cases submitted to them. Successful applicants will be honoured with the title of ‚ÄúFirst Degree Attorney‚Äù, after they take the oath and can practice in all courts of the country including the Supreme Court. Those who fail must redo the program in full or in part before re- taking the Final Bar Exam. Italy In Italy, the Bar Examination is called \\"abilitazione all'esercizio della professione forense\\". To sit for an exam, the candidate needs a 5-year university degree in jurisprudence and 18 months of legal apprenticeship at a law firm with at least 20 court hearings per semester. The State Bar Exam is composed of two parts: a written exam and an oral exam. The written exam is composed of three written tests over three seven-hour days. The candidate writes two legal briefs, respectively on contracts and torts (and more generally about civil law), and criminal law, and a third court brief on civil, crime, or administrative law. The candidates who pass the written tests (the pass rates vary from 30% to 50% according to jurisdiction) can sit at an oral exam before a panel of judges, lawyers, and law professors, who interview for about an hour the candidates on six areas of law. Italian lawyers may represent their clients on any Italian criminal, civil, or administrative court, except the Supreme Court of Cassation for which an additional exam after several years of law practice is required. Japan The bar exams in Japan yield the fewest successful candidates worldwide. The old format of the examinations, last held in 2010 saw only 6% passing the exam. With the new format of examinations‚Äîeven after extensive reforms and a new mandatory duration of graduate school education for a period of two years‚Äîthe pass rate is only 22%. Since 2014, candidates are allowed to take the examinations within five years before their right to take the exam is revoked and they either have to return to law school, take the preparatory exam or give up totally. It is administered solely by the Ministry of Justice. Korea (South) Due to the colonial-era influence, Korea's bar exam system closely follows that of Japan's. First introduced in 1963, Korea is phasing out in 2017 its old system that allows anyone to take the exam and undergo mandatory 2-year state-sponsored training that is criticized for generating \\"Í≥†ÏãúÎÇ≠Ïù∏\\" or \\"exam jobless\\" referring to people who spend many years of their lives preparing for the exam. The new law school system that began in 2009 allows only the graduates of a law school to apply for the bar exam. MalaysiaPhilippines The Philippine Bar Examination is administered once every year on the four Sundays of November (September before 2011). It covers eight areas of law: political law, labor law and social legislation, criminal law, civil law, commercial law, taxation law, remedial law, and legal ethics and practical exercises. Poland In Poland, the bar examination is taken after graduating from a law faculty at a university. It allows a person to undertake practice, the duration of which varies depending on the specialization. After the practical period applicants must pass the exam held by the Professional Chambers with assistance from some members of the Ministry of Justice. Singapore The Singapore Bar Examination (Part B) is administered once every year, usually over the course of four days. The exam is generally held on the last week of November, and is administered by the Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE). The eight practice areas covered in the examination include, Civil Law Practice, Criminal Law Practice, Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Family Law Practice, Real Estate Practice, Insolvency Practice, and two electives to be chosen from a list of elective subjects offered, such as, Mediation, Arbitration, and Intellectual Property. From 2023 the exam will become more stringent and training will be lengthened. In Singapore, the legal profession is a fused profession, granting the professional qualification of an 'Advocate and Solicitor' to any successful candidate of the Bar Examinations and its practical requirements. To qualify as a candidate for the Bar Examinations, an aspiring candidate must first be a graduate from a law school or university that is on the approved list of schools mandated by the Ministry of Law. The three universities based in Singapore offering a Bachelor of Laws degree are, National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University, and Singapore University of Social Sciences. There are presently twenty-seven (27) foreign universities offering an approved Bachelor of Laws degree on the list, hailing from four countries, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America. To be called to the Singaporean Bar, all law graduates must complete the following: #Sit for, and pass the Singapore Bar Examinations (Part B). #Completed a six-month training contract known as the Practice Training Contract with a local law firm, or practice. #Subject to an order from Court, legal trainees who have completed at least three months of their Practice Training Contract, as well as sat for and passed the Singapore Bar Examinations (Part B), are able to seek partial admission to the bar. By applying to the Court to be part-called, candidates are granted the right to appear before the Court in specific circumstances. In addition, all law graduates of non-Singaporean university must complete the following additional requirements: #Sit for, and pass the Singapore Bar Examinations (Part A). The five subjects which are offered in this exam are, Administrative and Constitutional Law, Company Law, Criminal Law, Evidence, and Land Law. All foreign university graduates are required to pass this exam to prove competence in Singaporean law. Part A of the Bar Examinations are administered by SILE as well. #All foreign university graduates are also required to complete an additional six-month training known as the Relevant Legal Training, to prove practical competence with a local law firm, or practice. #Both the Relevant Legal Training, and the Singapore Bar Examinations (Part A) must be completed by a candidate before said candidate is allowed to commence either their Practice Training Contract, or sit for the Singapore Bar Examinations (Part B). South AfricaSpain In Spain the examination to access the legal profession and legal practice is called State Examination for Access to the Legal Profession. The evaluation test has a total duration of 4 hours and consists of: * 50 questions on ¬´Common subjects in the practice of the legal profession¬ª. * 25 questions on ¬´Specific subjects¬ª according to the legal specialty (civil and commercial, criminal, administrative and contentious-administrative, and labor) Thailand In Thailand, the bar examination is separate from the lawyer licence. To practice law as a lawyer‚Äîi.e. to speak in the court‚Äîone must pass a lawyer licence examination and does not need to be called to the bar. People take the bar examination to become qualified to take a judge or public prosecutor examination. To be called to the bar, one must pass the written exams consisting of four parts as follows. # Civil and commercial law, intellectual property law, and international trade law. # Criminal law, employment law, constitution law, administrative law, and tax law. # Civil procedure law, bankruptcy and business reorganization law, and the system of the court of justice. And #Criminal procedure law, human rights, and law on the evidence. Each part has 10 essay questions. The pass mark is 50. The parts 1-2 are usually taken in October and the rest are usually taken in March. One does not need to pass all four parts in one year. After passing all the written exams, there is an oral exam. Around 10,000 bar students sit the exam each year. In 2013, 1,231 students were called to the bar, 111 of whom did it in only one year. Quite confusingly with international norms, students called to the bar are referred to as netibandit (‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏ö‡∏±‡∏ì‡∏ë‡∏¥‡∏ï), which means Barrister-at-Law in English. The Thai legal profession, however, is a fused one and those with lawyer licenses are able to practice both as barristers and solicitors in the British/Commonwealth sense. Many students called to the bar choose to become judges or public prosecutors instead of lawyers. As the Thai bar examination (administered and awarded by the Thai Bar Association) is separate from the lawyers licensing scheme (administered and awarded by the Lawyers Council of Thailand), this means that judges and public prosecutors belong to a separate licensing organization from lawyers. This is unlike in the US where judges and prosecutors most often come from the ranks of senior lawyers and belong to the same bar. United States In the United States, bar examinations are administered by agencies of individual states and territories. In almost all U.S. states and territories, the bar examination is one of several requirements for admission to the bar. In most jurisdictions, the examination is two days long and consists of multiple-choice questions, essay questions, and \\"performance tests\\" that model certain kinds of legal writing. The National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) creates several component examinations that are used in varying combinations by all but two jurisdictions, sometimes in combination with locally drafted examination components. The main exceptions are Louisiana and Puerto Rico, which follow civil law systems unlike other parts of the United States. Generally, earning a degree from a law school (or, more rarely, apprenticeship in a law office) is a prerequisite for taking the bar exam. Most law school graduates engage in a regimen of study (called \\"bar review\\") between graduating from law school and sitting for the bar.

Formerly, the county town, the Welsh name translates to \\"Little Fortress\\"; a reference to its historic castle. Denbigh lies near the Clwydian Hills. History Denbigh, c.1895 Denbigh Castle, together with its town walls, was built in 1282 by order of King Edward I. The Burgess Gate, whose twin towers adorn the symbol on Denbigh's civic seal, was once the main entrance into the town. The first borough charter was granted to Denbigh in 1290, when the town was still contained within the old town walls. It was the centre of the Marcher Lordship of Denbigh. The town was involved in the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294-95; the castle was captured in the autumn, and on 11 November 1294 a relieving force was defeated by the Welsh rebels. The town was recaptured by Edward I in December. Denbigh was also burnt in 1400 during the revolt of Owain Glynd≈µr. During the Wars of the Roses (1455-1487), the town was largely destroyed, subsequently moving from the hilltop to the area of the present town market. Leicester's Church is an unfinished church. In 1579, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, who was also Baron of Denbigh, planned for there to be a cathedral. His intention was to move the status of city from neighbouring St Asaph. The project ran out of money, and when Robert Dudley died, it was left as ruins; now in the care of Cadw. In 1643, during the English Civil War, Denbigh became a refuge for a Royalist garrison. Surrendering in 1646, the castle and town walls eventually fell into ruin. The town grew around the textile industry in the 1600s, hosting specialist glovers, weavers, smiths, shoemakers, saddlers, furriers and tanners. Denbigh has been an important location for the agricultural industry throughout. =Railway= Denbigh was served by a railway station on the former London and North Western Railway, later part of the LMS. The \\"Vale of Clwyd\\" line leading north to St. Asaph and Rhyl closed in 1955, leaving Denbigh on a lengthy branch running from Chester via Mold and Denbigh to Ruthin, which closed in 1962. A southern continuation beyond Ruthin linking up with the Great Western Railway at Corwen had closed in 1952. The platform of Denbigh station can still be seen beside the road leading to the Home Bargains store. =North Wales Hospital= At one time the majority of the population sought employment at the North Wales Hospital, which, dating back to the 1840s, cared for people with psychiatric illnesses. The hospital closed in 1995 and has since fallen into disrepair. In October 2008, a special series of episodes of Most Haunted, titled 'Village of the Damned', was broadcast from the North Wales Hospital over 7 days. As of October 2018, the derelict building has passed into the ownership of Denbighshire County Council. Old hospital in Denbigh =Futura Cinema= Denbigh had a town cinema on Love Lane. It opened as the Scala in 1928 before being re-branded as the Wedgwood Cinema in the late 1970s. It closed in October 1980 and was re-opened by Lewis Colwell in 1982 and renamed the Futura Cinema. The cinema closed in the 1990s, but the building remained open as a video rental store. In 1995, Peter Moore re-opened the cinema for a short period before being arrested and convicted of the murder of four men. The video rental store closed and the building is now in ruin awaiting redevelopment. Denbigh has no permanent cinema, though Denbigh Film Club regularly operates in Theatr Twm o'r Nant. Population The population at the 2001 Census was 8,783, increasing to 8,986 in the 2011 census. Amenities Attractions in the town include Denbigh Library, Denbigh Castle and the castle walls, Cae Dai 1950s museum, Theatr Twm o'r Nant, medieval parish church St Marcella's, and a small shopping complex. Denbigh Boxing Club is located on Middle Lane. Denbigh Community Hospital was established in 1807. Denbigh Cricket Club is one of the oldest cricket clubs in Wales having been established in 1844. The club plays at the Ystrad Road ground and plays in the North Wales Cricket League. The 1st XI play in the Premier Division having won the Division 1 championship in 2010 with the 2nd XI in Division 3. For over 50 years, a barrel rolling competition has been held on Boxing Day in the town square. Secondary Schools There are two secondary schools located in Denbigh. Denbigh High School is the larger of the two, consisting of nearly 600 pupils and approximately 60 staff. The current headmaster is Dr. Paul Evans St Bridget's is a Catholic voluntary aided school on Mold Road on the outskirts of the town which caters for pupils between the ages of 3 ‚Äì 19. There is a strict admissions policy and until recently the school only accepted girls. The schools current headteacher is Mrs Rona Jones Both of the High Schools in Denbigh, along with Ysgol Brynhyfryd (Ruthin), Ysgol Glan Clwyd (St Asaph), Denbigh College, and Llysfasi College (Deeside) have joined together to offer a combined 6th form under the title ‚ÄòThe Dyffryn Clwyd Consortium‚Äô. Site of Special Scientific Interest Crest Mawr Wood (alt. - Cr√™st) is a Site of Special Scientific Interest to the north west, adjoining Denbigh Golf Club and the Tarmac Quarry, an historic and ancient deciduous woodland. This woodland is endangered due to environmental pressure and competing land use in the area. National Eisteddfodau Denbigh hosted the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1882, 1939, 2001 and 2013.

Fitch was born in Utica, New York. When he was a year old, the family moved to Medford in the Rogue Valley in Oregon. Growing up, he had a keen interest in all the reptiles he could find on his father's 116 acre (0.5 km¬≤) ranch. He recounts that he especially liked snakes, because \\"the real bonus was in seeing horrified adults scatter.\\" In 1926, he enrolled at the University of Oregon, but switched to UC Berkeley for his graduate work. He obtained his M.A. in 1933 and a Ph.D. in zoology in 1937. From 1938 to 1947, he worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as a field biologist in the department of pest control, studying rodents such as squirrels, gophers, and kangaroo rats. He served from 1941 to 1945 in the Medical Corps as an army pharmacist, stationed initially in the United Kingdom, then France, and finally in Germany. In 1946, he married Virginia Ruby Preston, with whom he had three children. In 1948, Fitch accepted a position as Superintendent of the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation and instructor of zoology, where he could again pursue his studies of snakes and lizards. He became assistant professor in 1949 and full professor in 1958. From 1965 on, he did extensive field work in Costa Rica, Mexico, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic. In 1976, he took up field work in Nicaragua and succeeded in getting a five-year-plan for Ctenosaura conservation, which was instituted in the 1980s. He retired in 1980, but was still an active herpetologist as of 2006, collecting snakes and publishing papers. On September 8, 2009 he died in the home of his daughter and son-in-law in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

The facility is owned and operated by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA). The complex currently consists of the MetLife Stadium, which is home to the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League and the New York Guardians of the XFL; the Meadowlands Racetrack, a famous harness racing circuit (which is home of the annual Hambletonian Stakes); and the Quest Diagnostics Training Center, which is the Giants' practice facility. The complex is also the home to the American Dream entertainment venue and the now-closed Meadowlands Arena, which served as a home for the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League, Seton Hall University's men's basketball team, and the team the arena was built for, the now-Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association. History In the mid-1960s, civic leaders in New Jersey began calling for a sports complex in the New Jersey Meadowlands that would be able to lure a NFL team from New York City. The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority Law was passed by the New Jersey Legislature in 1971 and signed by then‚ÄìGovernor of New Jersey William T. Cahill. The first chairman of the NJSEA was David A. \\"Sonny\\" Werblin, former president of the NFL's New York Jets. By year's end, Werblin had secured a deal for the New York Giants, who were then playing in Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, to move to the Meadowlands. Ground was broken on Giants Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack on November 19, 1972. To accommodate the new facility, access roads were improved. The New Jersey Turnpike, which had been suffering the burden of increased traffic volumes near its northern terminus in Ridgefield Park, built a new alignment, the \\"western spur\\", with an exit, interchange 16W, leading directly to the sports complex as well as to Route 3. Routes 3 and 20 (now 120) also received improvements. On September 1, 1976, the Meadowlands Racetrack became the first complex venue to open, featuring harness racing. The track drew a capacity crowd of 42,133 for its initial date. Giants Stadium opened on October 10, 1976, as 76,042 fans watched the New York Giants lose to the Dallas Cowboys, 24‚Äì14. By 1977, plans were in the works to expand the complex. A new arena was to be built on the opposite side of Route 20 from the stadium and racetrack, connected by vehicle ramps and a pedestrian bridge. Brendan Byrne Arena, named for the sitting governor, opened July 2, 1981, with the first of six sold-out shows by musician Bruce Springsteen. The arena was renamed for its corporate sponsor, Continental Airlines (now part of United Airlines), as Continental Airlines Arena, in early 1996, since the arena had a hub at nearby Newark Liberty International Airport. It was renamed again in 2007 for Izod as Izod Center. The first tenant in the arena was the New Jersey Nets in 1981. A year later, the New Jersey Devils of the NHL and the Seton Hall University men's basketball team joined the Nets. The Nets played their first game at the arena on October 30, 1981, and lost to their cross-river rivals, the New York Knicks by a score of 103‚Äì99. The Devils played their first game on October 5, 1982, against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The game ended in a 3‚Äì3 tie. The New York Jets moved to Giants Stadium on September 6, 1984, after playing at Shea Stadium for nearly 20 years. In their first game at the stadium on that day, the Jets lost 23‚Äì17 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in front of 70,564 fans. In 2007, construction began on a mega-mall, named Meadowlands Xanadu. Work came to a halt in 2009, and Triple Five, owners of the Mall of America, took over the project in 2011. The construction was not complete until 2019. The New Jersey Devils and Seton Hall Pirates left the complex when the Prudential Center was finished in 2007, followed by the New Jersey Nets, who moved there in 2010 to go to Prudential Center, then Brooklyn two years later, leaving the Izod Center devoid of a main tenant but free to host more concerts and events. Giants Stadium closed in at the end of the 2009 NFL season and demolition started immediately. In September 2010, MetLife Stadium, then known as New Meadowlands Stadium, opened for its first game. It was privately built and funded by the Jets and Giants. A commuter train line and a training center for the Giants also opened at the same time. MetLife bought the naming rights for the stadium and the entire complex in August 2011. Meadowlands Arena closed in April 2015 to the public after suffering the loss of its major tenants and economic losses from other events. Since then, the arena has been used for concert rehearsals and private video productions. The former arena box offices are used as a station for the NJSEA EMS and the former Winner's Club lounge restaurant is the quarters for the New Jersey State Police. From Secaucus In addition to the three venues, the complex also hosts events in the MetLife Stadium parking lot. State Fair Meadowlands (formerly called the Meadowlands Fair, and not affiliated with the New Jersey State Fair held annually in Sussex County) began in 1986 and has been operated by State Fair of Belleville since 2003. The parking lot is also the home of a twice-weekly flea market, which is canceled when the parking spaces are needed for stadium events. The NJSEA hires in-house security and emergency medical services staff to serve the venues at the Sports Complex, including MetLife Stadium. Law enforcement is primarily provided by the New Jersey State Police Sports Complex Unit.

It is also the home of the New York Guardians of the XFL, the stadium opened in 2010, following the closing and demolition of the Giants' and the Jets' previous home, Giants Stadium. MetLife Stadium hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014. =Meadowlands Arena (former)= Meadowlands Arena (formerly Brendan Byrne Arena, Continental Airlines Arena and IZOD Center) was a multi-purpose indoor arena. Opened in 1981, it was home to the New Jersey Nets NBA team until 2010, the Seton Hall University men's basketball team until 2007 and to the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League until 2007. The Devils and the Seton Hall men's basketball team moved to the Prudential Center in Newark. The renamed Brooklyn Nets currently play in the Barclays Center. It closed early in April 2015. =Meadowlands Racetrack= The Meadowlands Racetrack is a horse racing track that hosts both thoroughbred racing and harness racing. It is known popularly in the region as \\"The Big M\\". Opened in the mid‚Äì1970s, the Meadowlands Racetrack held its first harness race on September 1, 1976 while thoroughbred racing commenced on September 6, 1977. The Racetrack is the site of the Hambletonian, the most prestigious event in standardbred racing. The track is equipped to race at night, when most of its races are. In the middle of the track is a lake, intended to resemble the state of New Jersey. The Meadowlands Racetrack is also one of the leading simulcast facilities in the world in terms of total handle. =Quest Diagnostics Training Center= The Quest Diagnostics Training Center is the main headquarters and practice facility of the New York Giants. It was known as the Timex Performance Center, renamed in July 2013 when the Giants and Quest Diagnostics announced a new partnership after the four-year partnership between the Giants and Timex ended. The facility, on the westernmost portion of the Meadowlands Sports Complex grounds, opened in 2010 and replaced the old Giants' practice fields and headquarters, adjacent to Giants Stadium. =American Dream = American Dream is a large mall and entertainment complex. Formerly known as Xanadu, the project resides within the Meadowlands Sports Complex adjacent to the Izod Center that will have over 450 stores. The first of four opening stages occurred on October 25, 2019, with the other stages opening on a staggered schedule on October 1, 2020. Only 45 percent of American Dream's space is devoted to retail locations. The stores will include six anchor retail tenants with more than each, 12 major retailers with each, and 339 smaller shops of up to . It will include more than 100 eateries, as well as a , 18-vendor food court with a kosher food hall. The other 55 percent of the space contains entertainment facilities.

The station opened for service on July 26, 2009. Studies are also underway about an extension of the Hudson‚ÄìBergen Light Rail line to the MetLife Sports Complex. Despite the opening of American Dream in 2019, the rail line is currently not being used daily. Auto racing In 1983, a Formula One auto race was planned for the New York City area. A temporary street circuit at the Meadowlands Sports Complex was one of the finalists for the location. A course at Flushing Meadows Park, in the New York City borough of Queens, was chosen, but the event was canceled before the first running. In July 1984, the CART IndyCar series held the first Meadowlands Grand Prix on a temporary circuit built in the Giants Stadium parking lot. The race was only moderately successful, and crowds were mediocre at best. In 1988, the course layout was moved to the streets surrounding Brendan Byrne Arena and redesigned to a , six-turn layout in an effort to improve competition. The race continued until 1991, and crowds continued to stay away. From 1988 to 1991 the race was part of the Marlboro Million, a cash prize to be awarded to any driver who won the Marlboro Grand Prix, the Marlboro 500, and the Marlboro Challenge All-Star event in the same year. The prize was never won. In 1992, race officials announced plans to move the race to Manhattan, using a street course at the World Trade Center. Within a few months, however, the race was canceled because of cost concerns. In the early 2000s, conceptual plans were drafted to build a NASCAR-style speedway at the Meadowlands Sports Complex as part of a revitalizing project. However, the plan was rejected and abandoned.

History of Knowledge Economies  Modern economies can be characterised as learning economies in which knowledge is the crucial resource and learning is the most important process. Different kinds of learning and economically relevant types of knowledge can likewise be identified. It is argued that pure market economies, if such existed, would have severe problems in terms of learning and innovation. The 'learning economy' is a mixed economy in a fundamental sense. In the public debate, knowledge is increasingly presented as the crucial factor in the development of both society and the economy. In a growing number of publications from the European Commission and Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development it is emphasised that citizens of EU member countries currently operate in ‚Äòa knowledge-based economy‚Äô. For several reasons many prefer the term ‚Äòthe learning economy‚Äô in characterising the current phase of socio-economic development.Lundvall and Johnson 1994, Lundvall 1996 Active Studies Academic achievements of learning economy using blockchain appeared in April 2018. HORI, Masumi, et al. Learning System based on Decentralized Learning Model using Blockchain and SNS. In: CSEDU (1). 2018. p. 183-190. HORI, Masumi, et al. Development of a Learning Economy Platform Based on Blockchain. In: European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning. Springer, Cham, 2018. p. 587-590. In 2018 at the annual United Nations General Assembly, a decentralized Learning Economy blockchain protocol was proposed. It asserts that if \\"education was the new gold standard,\\" a market economy could be built around it to catalyze and incentivize 21st century education. Blockchain has many applications in education including verifying the integrity of skills, returning the control of identity to the students, and defining research provenance. In April of 2019, research was published at Harvard Kennedy School making a case for a new form of Economy Corporation (E-Corp) to govern this decentralized Learning Economy. On January 30, 2020, the state of Colorado's Department of Higher Education and the Learning Economy Foundation partnered to provide a three year empirical study of a statewide decentralized education and workplace ecosystem as a test case for other states and nations. The C-Lab provides a unified space for Web 3.0 pilots and workgroups from across the state of Colorado. Its first goals are learner record interoperability, allowing learning institutions to exchange student records seamlessly, and learner wallets that empower the students to save their credentials on their phones and share them directly with employers and learning institutions. To further this effort, the Colorado Governor's Office of Information Technology, CDHE, Learning Economy Foundation, and ETH Denver launched the \\"Advance Colorado‚Äù partnership program powered by the State of Colorado to further blockchain technology initiatives. The goal of the consortium is to lay the foundation for a decentralized and open Internet of Education. Early Criticism Much of the initial theories about the advent of a fundamentally new era in which economic activity is increasingly 'abstract', i.e., disconnected from land, labour, and physical capital (machines and industrial infrastructure) and also capital in terms of fund was associated with the 'business management' literature of the 'new economy' NASDAQ bubble, which collapsed in 2001 (but slowly recovered, albeit, in a leaner format, throughout the 2000s). This literature was initially known more for its hyperbole and faddishness than for its academic/empirical integrity. More recently [2011] however, empirical research from cross-disciplinary fields such as innovation studies are altering that perception. Since 2017, the case for decentralized blockchain learning economies has grown stronger along with its criticisms. Many distributed applications have tested economic models that incentivize students and teachers, but without institutional and government support there is little chance of many national learning economies adopting at scale any time soon. Another major concern is new and unknown challenges with student privacy and distributed ledgers, as well as skepticism about the merits of cryptocurrency.

It is the county town and administrative seat of Flintshire County Council, and was the county town of Clwyd from 1974 to 1996. According to the 2011 UK Census, it had a population of 10,058. Origin of the name The original Welsh- language place name, Yr Wyddgrug was recorded as Gythe Gruc in a document of 1280‚Äì1281, and means \\"The Mound of the Tomb/Sepulchre\\". The name \\"Mold\\" originates from the Norman-French mont-hault (\\"high hill\\"). The name was originally applied to the site of Mold Castle in connection with its builder Robert de Montalt, an Anglo-Norman lord. It is recorded as Mohald in a document of 1254. History The Mold cape A mile west of the town is Maes Garmon, (\\"The Field of Germanus\\"), the traditional site of the \\"Alleluia Victory\\" by a force of Romano-Britons led by Germanus of Auxerre against the invading Picts and Scots, which occurred shortly after Easter, AD 430.John T. Koch: Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1, p. 806. Mold developed around Mold Castle. The motte and bailey were built by the Norman Robert de Montalt in around 1140 in conjunction with the military invasion of Wales by Anglo-Norman forces. The castle was besieged numerous times by the Princes of Gwynedd as they fought to retake control of the eastern cantrefi in the Perfeddwlad (English: Middle Country). In 1146, Owain Gwynedd captured the castle. By 1167, Henry II was in possession of the castle, although it was recaptured by the Welsh forces of Llywelyn the Great in 1201. Anglo-Norman authority over the area began again in 1241 when Dafydd ap Llywelyn yielded possession of the castle to the de Montalt family. However, he recaptured it from the Plantagenet nobility in 1245. The next few decades were a period of peace; Llywelyn ap Gruffudd built the Welsh native castle of Ewloe further to the east establishing the House of Gwynedd's military control over the area. Under Welsh rule, Mold Castle was deemed to be a \\"royal stronghold\\". It was recaptured by the forces of Edward I during the first months of the war of 1276‚Äì77. Mold Castle was still a substantial fortification at the outbreak of the rebellion by Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294. However, with the death of the last Lord Montalt in 1329, the castle's importance began to decline. The last mention of the fortification is in Patent Rolls from the early 15th century. With the end of the Welsh Wars, English common law was introduced by the Statute of Rhuddlan. This led to an increase in commercial enterprise in the township which had been laid out around Mold Castle. Trade soon began between the Welsh community and English merchants in Chester and Whitchurch, Shropshire. During the medieval period, the town held two annual fairs and a weekly market, which brought in substantial revenues, as drovers brought their livestock to the English-Welsh border to be sold. Nevertheless, tensions between the Welsh and the English remained. During the War of the Roses, Reinalt ab Grufydd ab Bleddyn, a Lancastrian captain who defended Harlech Castle for Henry VI against Yorkist forces, was constantly engaged in feuds with Chester. In 1465 a large number of armed men from Chester arrived at the Mold fair looking for trouble. A fight broke out which led to a pitched battle; eventually Reinalt triumphed and captured Robert Bryne, a former Mayor of Chester. The Welsh captain then took Bryne back to his tower house near Mold and hanged him. In retaliation up to 200 men-at-arms were sent from Chester to seize Reinalt. However the Welshman used his military experience to turn the tables on his attackers. He hid in the woods while many of the men entered his home; once they were inside, he rushed from concealment, blocked the door, and set fire to the building, trapping those inside. Reinalt then attacked the remainder, driving them back towards Chester. By the late 15th century the lordships around Mold had passed to the powerful Stanley family. In 1477 records mention that Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby had appointed numerous civic officials in Mold (including a mayor), was operating several mills, and had established a courthouse in the town. =16th century onwards= A view of Mold c.1778 Mold, c.1795 In the 1530s, the Tudor antiquarian John Leland noted the weekly market had been abandoned. By now Mold had two main streets, Streate Byle (Beili) and Streate Dadlede (Dadleu- dy), and about 40 houses making up the settlement. By the beginning of the 17th century, the population was beginning to rise due to the development of the coal industry near the town. By the 1630s there were more than 120 houses and huts in the area. The government of Elizabeth I had established royal representatives (Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, and Lords Lieutenant) in every county of Wales. Mold developed into the administrative centre for Flintshire. By the 1760s, the Quarter Sessions were based in the town; the county hall was established in 1833, and the county gaol in 1871. In 1833, workmen digging a Bronze Age mound at Bryn yr Ellyllon (Fairies' or Goblins' Hill) found a unique golden cape dating from 1900‚Äì1600 BC. It weighs and was made from a single gold ingot about the size of a golf ball. It was broken when found and the fragments shared among the workmen, with the largest piece for Mr Langford, tenant of the field in which the mound stood. The find was recorded by the Vicar of Mold and came to the notice of the British Museum. In 1836 Langford sold his piece to the Museum, which has since acquired most of the pieces, though it is said that some wives of the workmen sported new jewellery after the find. The restored cape now belongs to the British Museum. Mold hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1923, 1991 and 2007. There was an unofficial National Eisteddfod event in 1873. Mold was linked to Chester by the Mold Railway, with a large British Rail station together with adjacent marshalling yards and engine sheds; however, these closed when Croes Newydd at Wrexham was opened. The station was closed in 1962 in the Beeching cuts, though the track survived until the mid-1980s to serve the Synthite chemical works. A Tesco supermarket was built on the station site in the 1990s. =The Mold Riot= In summer 1869 there was a riot in the town which had considerable effect on the subsequent policing of public disturbances in Britain. On 17 May 1869, John Young, the English manager of the nearby colliery in Leeswood, angered his workers by announcing a pay cut. He had previously strained relationships with them by banning the use of the Welsh language underground. Two days later, after a meeting at the pithead, miners attacked Young before frogmarching him to the police station. Seven men were arrested and ordered to stand trial on 2 June. All were found guilty; and the convicted ringleaders, Ismael Jones and John Jones, were sentenced to a month's hard labour. A large crowd had assembled to hear the verdict, and the Chief Constable of Flintshire had arranged for police from all over the county and soldiers from The 4th King's Own Regiment (Lancaster), based temporarily at Chester, to be present. As the convicts were being transported to the railway station, the crowd of 1500 to 2000 grew restive and threw missiles at the officers, injuring many of them. On the command of their commanding officer, Captain Blake, the soldiers opened fire on the crowd, killing four, including one innocent bystander, Margaret Younghusband, a 19-year-old domestic servant from Liverpool, who had been observing events from nearby high ground. The musket ball severed her femoral artery and she bled to death. The others killed included Robert Hannaby a collier from Moss, near Wrexham. He was shot in the head in the act of throwing a stone and died instantly. Edward Bellis, another collier, was shot in the abdomen. A local doctor, Dr Platt, performed surgery to remove the ball but Bellis died shortly afterwards. Elizabeth Jones, wife of Isaac Jones, living at Coed Talon, was shot in the back and died two days later from the injury. The Coroner's inquest on the first three deaths was held in the same week as the riot, on Saturday 5 June. The Coroner, Peter Parry, was described as \\"exceedingly old and infirm and being so deaf as to be compelled to use a 'speaking' trumpet, to which affliction must be added that greater one of partial blindness.\\" He was assisted by the Deputy Coroner, his brother Robert Parry, surgeon, of Mold. The Jury's verdict, following clear direction from the Coroner and after retiring for only five minutes to consider the matter, was that of justifiable homicide. Later that afternoon the Coroner held a further inquest on the death of Elizabeth Jones, who had died at 11 pm the previous night. The same verdict was reached. The following week Isaac Jones, a collier at Black Diamond, was one of several men tried for involvement in the riot. He was allowed bail to attend the funeral of his wife. The other men tried were William Griffiths (medical herbalist, former collier, Mold), Rowland Jones (age 25, collier, Pontyblyddan), Gomer Jones (age 17, collier) and William Hughes (collier) The trial found them guilty of \\"felonious wounding\\" and Lord Chief Justice Bovill sentenced them all to ten years' penal servitude.North Wales Chronicle, 5 June 1869.Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser, 5 June 1869.Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser, 11 August 1869.Liverpool Mercury, 8 June 1869.County of Flint record of assizes at Mold 5 August 1869.Liverpool Mercury, 10 June 1869.Kentish Gazette, 15 June 1869.The Daily Post, 5 June 1869.Liverpool Daily Post, 7 June 1869.1871 Census of England. Although he strenuously denied the connection, Daniel Owen, who lived in the town, featured some very similar events in his first novel, Rhys Lewis, published in instalments in 1882‚Äì1884. Transport Mold railway station closed to passengers in 1962. The nearest station is now Buckley, which has services to Wrexham and Liverpool. Flint railway station, to which Mold has regular bus services, is not much further and has direct trains to Cardiff, London and Manchester. There are frequent daytime services from Mold Bus Station to Chester, Wrexham, Denbigh, Holywell, Ruthin and other places.

Her minions destroyed, Harmony returns to Spike for protection until it becomes clear that Spike's infatuation with Buffy has become an obsession (cf. \\"Crush\\"). Having departed Sunnydale, Harmony is next seen in the Buffy spin-off Angel, in the episode \\"Disharmony.\\" She visits her old friend Cordelia in Los Angeles, not telling Cordelia she has become a vampire. Harmony tries to connect with Cordelia, but has difficulty controlling her demon side. She enters Cordelia's bedroom at night, driven by bloodlust, but apologizes for her actions and intentions when Cordelia wakes up. Cordelia misunderstands her explanation, believing her to be a lesbian until the matter is cleared up by Willow in a phone call. Despite this, Cordelia insists on giving Harmony a chance, while the rest of the team grows increasingly frustrated with her habits such as popping gum or tearing pages out of old, irreplaceable books. She accompanies the Angel Investigations team on a mission to investigate a new vampire cult, but soon betrays them to their enemies. Cordelia nearly kills Harmony, but, out of some respect for the friendship they once shared, allows her to leave. Over two years later, Harmony tries to make a life for herself in L.A. She gains employment at the L.A. branch of Wolfram & Hart, as a member of the secretarial pool. Harmony is attracted by the building's necro-tempered glass windows (designed to protect vampires from sunlight which would otherwise cause them to burst into flames), as well as the firm's non-judgmental workplace culture and dental plan. A few weeks into her employment with the firm, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce hires her out of the blue to be Angel's new personal secretary, after Angel and his staff are given control of that branch of Wolfram & Hart; Wesley apparently thought a familiar face would be good for Angel. Angel reluctantly agrees, on the strict condition that Harmony continues to refrain from drinking human blood. Harmony is reunited with Spike when he returns, first as a ghost and then in corporeal form. She tries to connect with him, and initially hopes to renew their relationship now that he has a soul. Spike shows no interest for Harmony until he regains his corporeal form and proceeds to seduce her into a brief, disastrous fling, after which neither of them puts any effort into rekindling their tumultuous relationship. At this point in her un-life, Harmony feels isolated and alone. She knows that she is incompetent as an evil vampire, but her struggle to lead a more normal life is hindered because she lacks a soul. Angel often treats her with distrust and barely masked hostility, and her input, ideas, and presence are generally ignored by his team. Harmony also experiences an inability to connect with her co-workers, who resent her quick rise to the position of the CEO's secretary. In the episode \\"Harm's Way,\\" she is framed for murder by Tamika, another vampire secretary who wants her job; Tamika also substitutes human blood for her supply of otter blood, to make it appear as though Harmony drank from the victim. She clears her name and ironically saves a demon summit by staking her scheming rival on a conference table with a pair of chopsticks, since the demons required a W&H; employee's death to seal their deal. Despite her incompetence, Harmony manages to prove a 'sort of' asset to the team, 'torturing' Eve (i.e. hitting Eve in the face a few times) to get information, helping Wesley search for information about Knox's plans, and aiding Lorne in protecting Eve from her replacement as their liaison to the Senior Partners. She strikes up a brief friendship with Fred Burkle, though her relationship with Illyria, the demon who later inhabits Fred's body, is quite frosty. Harmony becomes a member of the regular cast starting with the episode \\"Underneath\\". In the series finale, \\"Not Fade Away,\\" she betrays Angel, revealing his plans to go after Archduke Sebassis to Marcus Hamilton, the Senior Partners' new liaison, with whom she has a sexual relationship. Angel, however, always expected her to betray him at some point, so he had only confided information he wanted her to reveal. After her betrayal (which Angel blames on her lack of a soul, and she blames on his lack of confidence in her), he fires her, but not before providing her with a letter of recommendation (which he had already written and signed, in anticipation of her disloyalty). As Angel and Hamilton prepare to fight each other, she runs off, wishing them both luck: \\"May the best man win!\\" =Literature= In the canonical continuation of Buffy, Season Eight, Harmony features in the twenty- first issue, \\"Harmonic Divergence\\" by Jane Espenson, which begins a story-arc about the public revelation of the existence of vampires and Slayers. Harmony becomes a MTV reality television star in her own TV series, Harmony Bites, which also stars Clem. Harmony came to instant notoriety after she killed a Slayer who attacked her on live camera. Thanks to Harmony, Buffy and her Slayer army were publicly outed by Anderson Cooper on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360¬∞ later that day. Dark Horse Comics created a MySpace page for Harmony, and the Myspace Dark Horse Presents features a special comic book 'episode' of Harmony Bites written by Jane Espenson. Harmony is now considered a vampire rights spokeswoman. At the end of the twenty-second issue, \\"Swell\\", she is seen being interviewed on TV about the destruction of the Vampy Cat toy line by the Slayers, which she blames on their blind hatred of anything vampire- related (in actuality, the toys were possessed demonic creatures). This, in combination with the criminal activities of rogue Slayer Simone Doffler, the destruction of Sunnydale and the machinations of the villain Twilight has forced the Slayers into retreat as the whole world now views them as terrorists. Harmony appears twice in Angel & Faith. During \\"In Perfect Harmony\\" it is revealed she used her fame to create rules that when vampires feed from humans they can never kill nor sire and must bite only after the human gives permission. The vast majority of vampires follow these rules for the easy food. Harmony is being threatened with a sex tape that shows her siring a man who was dying of cancer. Angel & Faith reluctantly agree to help her find the blackmailer so vampires continue following her rules and do not start killing humans again. Harmony's staff create a plan to restore Angel's image after his actions as Twilight have left him hated by both humans and demons. The blackmailer is revealed to be Clem who has fallen in love with Harmony and wanted to be her hero by stopping the blackmailer. Harmony won't date him but is easily willing to forget people's past actions and says Angel should do the same with his guilt. Angel tells Faith famous people are crazy and instantly throws the image plan into the trash. In \\"Spike & Faith\\" Angel gives Spike Harmony's phone number when Spike is trying to get over his depression about his relationship with Buffy. Spike and Harmony have loud sexual activities in Faith's home; much to Angel & Faith's discomfort. Harmony returns in the tenth issue of Buffy season 10 in an issue titled \\"Day Off (Harmony In My Head).\\" The Scoobies have taken residence in San Francisco and are tasked with writing the rules of the new magic in the world by using the pages of Buffy's Vampyr book. They invite several species from the mystical world as lobbyists to consider when creating the rules. Buffy is annoyed when Harmony shows up representing the older type vampires but is happy to see Clem is with her. Buffy is also displeased the new breed of vampires have selected a vampire named Vicki as their representative because Vicki previously tried to kill her. The new breed is immune to sunlight and can shape-shift. Harmony creates a compromise; the new breed will follow her rules for peaceful interaction with humans and the Scoobies can create a rule so the new breed will be unable to shape-shift in the daylight. Harmony then visits Spike who apologizes for using her in London but she doesn't care as she felt she was using him as payback for the way he dumped her in Sunnydale. Harmony knocks Spike out and intends to have Clem write in the book to make her loved by everyone in the world, and for Buffy, Spike and Angel to finally make peace with each other and agree to a marriage between all three of them. Clem does not do this as the book may hurt her due to its wish fulfillment often being twisted like the Monkey's paw. Spike takes back the book and kicks them both out. However, Clem did write one thing down for Harmony, unicorns are now real. She next appears in the twenty-first issue: \\"In Pieces on the Ground, Part I.\\" Demon invasions have become a global problem, the Scooby Gang is reluctantly working with the human military to battle this, but they also need the strength and numbers of both breeds of vampires. With Harmony leading the old breed and Vicki the new one, they have Buffy & Spike compete in trials of combat to win the vampires' alliance. While the other one fights, Harmony taunts Spike and Vicki taunts Buffy about the relationship insecurities they have. With the vampires' loyalty won, Buffy & Spike leave rattled; while Harmony and Vicki congratulate each other for what they did. Powers and abilities Harmony has the standard powers and vulnerabilities of a vampire. Several episodes make comedy of her subpar fighting skills, though after later training she holds her own against Riley and Spike, and in \\"Harm's Way\\" she kills another vampire after a long battle. In \\"Harmonic Divergence\\", she kills a Slayer, though partially by accident. In the Harmony Bites e-comic, she easily kills Justin, a vampire she sired, by quickly deflecting his attempt at staking her. In \\"Conviction\\", she claimed to \\"type like a superhero, if there was a superhero whose power was typing.\\" Appearances=Canonical appearances= Harmony has appeared in 33 canonical Buffyverse episodes: ; Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series) : Harmony appeared as a guest in 16 episodes: : Season 1 (1997) - \\"The Harvest\\"; \\"Out of Mind, Out of Sight\\" : Season 2 (1997-1998) - \\"Surprise\\"; \\"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\\" : Season 3 (1998-1999) - \\"The Wish\\"; \\"Graduation Day, Part One\\", \\"Graduation Day, Part Two\\" : Season 4 (1999-2000) - \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\"; \\"The Initiative\\"; \\"Pangs\\"; \\"Restless\\" : Season 5 (2000-2001) - \\"Real Me\\"; \\"Out of My Mind\\"; \\"Family\\"; \\"Fool for Love\\"; \\"Crush\\" ; Angel: Harmony joined the cast of Angel as a recurring character at the start of the show's fifth season.

McNab/Braeside is a township in eastern Ontario, Canada, on the south shore of Chats Lake (part of the Ottawa River), straddling the lower Madawaska River in Renfrew County. The township was created on January 1, 1998, when the Village of Braeside amalgamated with McNab Township. Mayor Tom Peckett was elected in October 2014. History McNab township was created in 1825, comprising roughly 80,000 acres of unsettled land, covering the current Town of Arnprior and Township of McNab/Braeside. It was granted by the government (\\"Family Compact\\") to Archibald 13th Laird of McNab (1779-1860), who had fled from his debts in Scotland. He promised to settle it with Highland clansmen, and the first group of eighty-four settlers arrived the same year, 1825. McNab ruled with an iron fist over the Scottish settlers. Only after eighteen years of petitions, court battles, and appeals was his grip loosened when the government finally began issuing Crown grants to the settlers. His feudal powers removed, the Laird eventually sold his lands to the government and returned to Europe in 1852, never to return. Braeside was named in 1872 by W.J. McDonald probably for Braeside, Greenock in Inverclyde, Scotland. Communities In addition to the main town of Braeside, the township also comprises the communities of Burnstown, Clay Bank, Clay Valley, Dewars, Glasgow Station, Goshen, Lochwinnoch (partially), Lundys Corners, Pine Grove, Sand Point, Stewartville, Waba and White Lake.

Tawara is most famous as a contemporary poet. She is credited with revitalizing the tanka for modern Japanese audiences. Her skill as a translator consist of translating classical Japanese into modern Japanese, for example books such as the Man'y≈çsh≈´ and the Taketori Monogatari. Biography She was born in 1962 in Osaka Prefecture, and moved to Fukui Prefecture when she was 14 years old. In 1981, she graduated from Waseda University with a degree in Japanese literature. Under the influence of the poet Sasaki Yukitsuna, she began to write tanka. After graduation, Tawara began teaching at Kanagawa Prefecture's Hashimoto High School, and she taught there until 1989. She wrote a 50 poem sequence, August Morning (ÂÖ´Êúà„ÅÆÊúù), which received the 32nd Kadokawa Tanka Prize. She combined this collection with other small groups of tanka to release her first major collection of poems, Salad Anniversary („Çµ„É©„ÉÄË®òÂøµÊó•) in 1987. It became a bestseller, selling well over 2.6 million copies. This collection went on to receive the 32nd Modern Japanese Poets Association Award. Salad Anniversary started a phenomenon known as \\"salad phenomenon\\", comparable to \\"bananamania\\" (coined for the phenomenon caused by the first major book of Banana Yoshimoto). Tawara became a celebrity, and hosted television and radio shows where she extolled the virtues of tanka, and encouraged everyone to write them. She eventually released a collection of tanka sent to her by her fans, edited and selected by her. Tawara's popularity is mainly intertwined with her skill with tanka. She deftly combines modern Japanese subjects with classical poetic forms and grammatical constructions, which both hearken back to the classical days but also makes the tanka more accessible to Japan's modern youth. Also, as opposed to the tanka of the classical era, Tawara's poems possess a lighter attitude and a crisp tone, as well as a universality that helps to make her poetry understood by all. Tawara has a website entitled The Chocolate Box, where she has a list of her works and a brief profile. She also was touched by the amount of fan mail she received and she sent responses in the forms of recordings. Major works *Salad Anniversary („Çµ„É©„ÉÄË®òÂøµÊó•) [1987] Salad Anniversary, trans.

She is known for her extensive spectroscopic studies of the Sun and chemical elements. Her tables of data are known for their reliability and are still used regularly. Early life and education Fallowfield Friends Meeting Charlotte Moore was born to George W. and Elizabeth Walton Moore in Ercildoun, Pennsylvania, a small village near Coatesville. Her father was the Superintendent of Schools for Chester County and her mother was a schoolteacher. Her parents were Quakers and Charlotte was a lifelong member of Fallowfield Friends Meeting. She attended Swarthmore College, where she participated in many extracurricular activities such as ice hockey, student government, glee club, and tutoring. In order to pay her tuition, Moore was a substitute teacher, one of the few ways she thought she could work her way through college. She wanted to pursue a career outside teaching because \\"I did not enjoy the teaching that I did from first grade through high school. I succeeded at it, but I didn‚Äôt like it; it was too wearing.\\" Moore graduated from Swarthmore in 1920 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and went on to Princeton to work as a human computer. Career On the recommendation of her mathematics professor at Swarthmore, Moore obtained a job at the Princeton University Observatory working for Professor Henry Norris Russell as a human computer carrying out calculations needed to use photographic plates in determining the position of the Moon. Over time, while working for Russell, Moore's interest in astrophysics began to blossom. Russell and Moore researched binary stars and stellar mass, and published extensively on the subject over the years of their collaboration. Her research included an effort to classify 2500 stars based on their spectra. After five years at Princeton, as part of an ongoing collaboration between Russell and research groups there, she moved to the Mount Wilson Observatory where she worked extensively on solar spectroscopy, analyzing the spectral lines of the Sun and thereby identifying the chemical elements in the Sun. With her collaborators, she analyzed the spectra of sunspots. Moore was able to deduce the temperature of sunspots to be about 4,700 degrees kelvin.Elizabeth Landau, \\"How Charlotte Moore Sitterly Wrote The Encyclopedia of Starlight,\\" Smithsonian, September 23, 2019. Her pictures from the Mount Wilson Observatory helped redetermine the new International Angstrom scale. She earned a Ph.D. in astronomy in 1931 from the University of California, Berkeley on a Lick Fellowship; she was not able to study at Princeton because they did not accept women - and would not for the next 30 years. While working on her Ph.D, she continued researching spectroscopy and collected and analyzed data about the spectra of chemical elements and molecules. After obtaining her Ph.D, she returned to Princeton to continue work with Russell as a research assistant. One of her most significant contributions to physics was her identification of technetium in sunlight, the first example of technetium naturally existing. She joined the then National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in 1945. Her tables of atomic spectra and energy levels, published by NBS, have remained essential references in spectroscopy for decades. While there, she began to research the infrared solar spectrum and atomic energy levels. Beginning in 1946, Moore was able to extend her work on ultraviolet spectral lines thanks to the work of Richard Tousey and measurements taken on V-2 rockets; prior to this Moore's studies were limited to telescopic observations partially blocked by the earth's atmosphere. Moore collaborated with Tousey for decades and led to her 1950 publication \\"Ultraviolet Multiplet Table.\\" In 1949 she became the first woman elected as an associate of the Royal Astronomical Society of Great Britain, in honor of her work on multiplet tablets and in identifying solar spot electra. Throughout her career she authored and co-authored over 100 papers and attended the tenth general assembly of the International Astronomical Union on the Joint Commission on Spectroscopy in Moscow in 1958. Sitterly retired from her position at the NBS when she turned 70, in 1968, but continued her research at the Naval Research Laboratory. Sitterly was honored by the Journal of the Optical Society of America by a commemorative issue in 1988. Personal life While working at Princeton in the 1920s, she met physicist Bancroft W. Sitterly, whom she eventually married on May 30, 1937. She continued to publish journals under her maiden name because most of her recognition was under that name. She believed that traveling is one of the most important aspects of a scientist's life, as it promotes collaboration between scientists. She enjoyed gardening, traveling, and music with her husband until his death in 1977. She continued her research until her death from heart failure at the age of 91. Honors Awards *Annie J.

Located in the Historic county of Merionethshire, the Welsh form of the name is derived from Aber (estuary) and the river's name, \\"Mawddach\\". The English form of the name is a corruption of the earlier Welsh form Abermawdd. The community includes the tiny villages of Llanaber, Cutiau, and Caerdeon.  History  Barmouth, with Cader Idris in the background, 1865. The town in the 1890s William Collins, 1835, Guildhall Gallery, London The town grew around the shipbuilding industry, and more recently as a seaside resort. Notable buildings include the medieval tower house, the 19th century roundhouse prison and St John's Church. William Wordsworth, a visitor to Barmouth in the 19th century, described it thus: \\"With a fine sea view in front, the mountains behind, the glorious estuary running inland, and within compass of a day's walk, Barmouth can always hold its own against any rival.\\" (Citadel of Light), which is located east of the town on the adjoining hillside, was the first tract of land to be donated to the National Trust. In January 2014, two trains were stranded at Barmouth after severe winter storms destroyed the sea wall at nearby . Transport The town is served by Barmouth railway station. Transport for Wales operate northbound services to Pwllheli via Harlech, Porthmadog and Criccieth, and eastbound services to Birmingham International via Tywyn, Machynlleth, Welshpool, Shrewsbury, Telford and Wolverhampton. Connections for southbound services to Borth and Aberystwyth can be made at Dovey Junction or Machynlleth. Barmouth Bridge, which takes the Cambrian Line over the River Mawddach, was also previously at the end of the Ruabon‚ÄìBarmouth line, which passed through Bala and Dolgellau. The southern end of the bridge is now the start of the Mawddach Trail, a cycle path and walkway that uses the old trackbed. Local bus services are provided by Lloyds Coaches, and link the town with nearby destinations such as Harlech, Tan-y-Bwlch, Porthmadog and Dolgellau. Cross country bus services are available to Wrexham via Bala, Corwen and Llangollen, as part of the Welsh Government funded TrawsCymru network. The Barmouth Ferry sails from Barmouth to Penrhyn Point, where it connects with the narrow gauge Fairbourne Railway for the village of Fairbourne.

Lincoln also received a merger proposal from Redgate in 1985. Satisfied with its recipe for acquiring and improving insurance companies, Conseco stepped up its acquisition efforts in 1986. It purchased Bankers National Life Insurance Company for $118 million, respectively. In 1998, Conseco purchased the former Greentree Financial, one of the largest financiers of mobile homes, in an attempt to diversify into consumer financial services. They also bought life insurance company Colonial Penn later that year, changing their name to Conseco Direct Life,YouTube - 1998 - Commercial - Conseco Direct Life - formerly Colonial Penn Life - starring Ed McMahon though changing the name back to Colonial Penn in 2001 (known as Bankers Conseco Life Insurance Company in New York state).

Conseco's bankruptcy was the third-largest U.S. Chapter 11 filing at the time, after the bankruptcies of WorldCom Inc. and Enron. In the process of reorganization, GreenTree was divested and thereafter Conseco solely focused on the insurance industry.

Morgan & Co. In the course of CIA-funded research, Wasson made contributions to the fields of ethnobotany, botany, and anthropology.  Career = Banking industry = Wasson began his banking career at Guaranty Trust Company in 1928, and moved to J.P. Morgan & Co. in 1934, where he became a vice president in 1943. Also that year, Wasson published a book on the Hall Carbine Affair, in which he attempted to exonerate John Pierpont Morgan from guilt with respect to this incident, which had been viewed as an example of wartime profiteering. As early as 1937, Wasson had been attempting to influence historians Allan Nevins and Charles McLean Andrews regarding Morgan's role in the affair, and then he used Nevins' report as a reference for his own book on the topic. Wasson worked in public relations for J.P. Morgan & Co., and his authorship of a book on J.P. Morgan. The matter of Morgan's responsibility for the Hall Carbine Incident remains controversial.Andrews papers, Manuscripinterest between Wasson's work as a puts and Archives, Yale University Library. Box 37, Folder 419; Box 40, Folder 441; Box 42, Folder 460. = Ethnomycology = Wasson with his wife Valentina Pavlovna Wasson Wasson's studies in ethnomycology began during his 1927 honeymoon trip to the Catskill Mountains when his wife, Valentina Pavlovna Guercken, a pediatrician, chanced upon some edible wild mushrooms. Fascinated by the marked difference in cultural attitudes towards fungi in Russia compared to the United States, the couple began field research that led to the publication of Mushrooms, Russia and History in 1957. In the course of their investigations they mounted expeditions to Mexico to study the religious use of mushrooms by the native population, and claimed to have been the first Westerners to participate in a Mazatec mushroom ritual. It was the curandera Mar√≠a Sabina who both allowed the Wassons to participate in the ritual and who taught them about the uses and effects of the mushroom. Sabina let him take her picture on the condition that he keep it private, but Wasson nonetheless published the photo along with Sabina's name and the name of the community where she lived.  CIA funding  Wasson's 1956 expedition was funded by the CIA's MK-Ultra subproject 58, as was revealed by documents obtained by John Marks under the Freedom of Information Act. The documents state that Wasson was an 'unwitting' participant in the project. The funding was provided under the cover name of the Geschickter Fund for Medical Research (credited by Wasson at the end of his subsequent Life piece about the expedition).  Role in popularizing psilocybin mushrooms  In May 1957, Life magazine published an article titled \\"Seeking the Magic Mushroom\\", which introduced psychoactive mushrooms to a wide audience for the first time. In his memoir, author Tom Robbins talks about the impact of this article on \\"turning on\\" Americans himself included. The article sparked immense interest in the Mazatec ritual practice among beatniks and hippies, an interest that proved disastrous for the Mazatec community and for Mar√≠a Sabina in particular. As the community was besieged by Westerners wanting to experience the mushroom-induced hallucinations, Sabina attracted attention by the Mexican police who thought that she sold drugs to the foreigners. The unwanted attention completely altered the social dynamics of the Mazatec community and threatened to terminate the Mazatec custom. The community blamed Sabina, and she was ostracized in the community and had her house burned down. Sabina later regretted having introduced Wasson to the practice, but Wasson contended that his only intention was to contribute to the sum of human knowledge.Estrada, √Ålvaro, (1976) Vida de Mar√≠a Sabina: la sabia de los hongos ()Rothenberg, Jerome. 2003. \\"Editor's Preface\\" in Mar√≠a Sabina: Selections. University of California Press. p. XVI = Methodology = Together, Wasson and botanist Roger Heim collected and identified various species of family Strophariaceae and genus Psilocybe, while Albert Hofmann, using material grown by Heim from specimens collected by the Wassons, identified the chemical structure of the active compounds, psilocybin and psilocin. Hofmann and Wasson were also among the first Westerners to collect specimens of the Mazatec hallucinogen Salvia divinorum, though these specimens were later deemed not suitable for rigorous scientific study or taxonomic classification. Two species of mushroom, Psilocybe wassonii R.Heim and Psilocybe wassoniorum Guzman & S.H.Pollock, were named in honor of Wasson by Heim and Gast√≥n Guzm√°n, the latter of whom Wasson met during an expedition to Huautla de Jim√©nez in 1957. Wasson's next major contribution was a study of the ancient Vedic intoxicant soma, which he hypothesized was based on the psychoactive fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) mushroom. This hypothesis was published in 1967 under the title Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality. His attention then turned to the Eleusinian Mysteries, the initiation ceremony of the ancient Greek cult of Demeter and Persephone. In The Road to Eleusis: Unveiling the Secret of the Mysteries (1978), co-authored with Albert Hofmann and Carl A. P. Ruck, it was proposed that the special potion \\"kykeon\\", a pivotal component of the ceremony, contained psychoactive ergoline alkaloids from the fungus Ergot (Claviceps spp.). Several of his books were self- published in illustrated, limited editions, using handmade paper and printed in Italy, that have never been reprinted, with one exception. His last completed work, The Wondrous Mushroom, initially part of the self-published works, was republished by City Lights Publishers in 2014. Ethnography Prior to his work on soma, theologians had interpreted the Vedic and Magian practices to have been based on alcoholic beverages that produced inebriation. Wasson was the first researcher to propose that the actual form of Vedic intoxication was entheogenic..See this lecture on Indoeuropean languages, (mins. 21'-22'): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkVc_WX35eE Further reading *Forte, Robert.

As a boy he went to Chatham High School in Georgetown. At the age of 14 he was captain of his school cricket team in the prestigious Chin Cup inter-school competition. One of his childhood memories is of watching Garry Sobers score two centuries for West Indies v Pakistan perched in a tree outside the ground overlooking the sightscreen. In 1971 he was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. He captained the West Indies between 1974 and 1985 and oversaw their rise to become the dominant Test-playing nation, a position that was only relinquished in the latter half of the 1990s. He is one of the most successful Test captains of all time: during his captaincy the side had a run of 27 matches without defeat, which included 11 wins in succession (Viv Richards acted as captain for one of the 27 matches, against Australia at Port of Spain in 1983‚Äì84). He was the first West Indian player to earn 100 international caps. Lloyd captained the West Indies in three World Cups, winning in 1975 (with Lloyd scoring a century) and 1979 while losing the 1983 final to India. Lloyd was a tall, powerful middle-order batsman and occasional medium-pace bowler. In his youth he was also a strong cover point fielder. He wore his famous glasses as a result of being poked in the eye with a ruler. Wide World of Sports Cricket Yearbook 1985 ‚Äì \\"Farewell Super Cat\\" written by Ian Chappell, pp: 110‚Äì13, PBL Marketing, Pty Ltd, 1985. ISSN 0813-7439 His Test match debut came in 1966. Lloyd scored 7,515 runs at Test level, at an average of 46.67. He hit 70 sixes in his Test career, which is the 14th highest number of any player. He played for his home nation of Guyana in West Indies domestic cricket, and for Lancashire (he was made captain in 1981) in England. He is a cousin of spin bowler Lance Gibbs. Since retiring as a player, Lloyd has remained heavily involved in cricket, managing the West Indies in the late 1990s, and coaching and commentating. He was an ICC match referee from 2001‚Äì2006. In 2009, Lloyd was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He was knighted in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to cricket. Career In 1971‚Äì72, Lloyd suffered a back injury while playing for a Rest of the World team at the Adelaide Oval. He was fielding in the covers when Ashley Mallett hit a lofted drive towards his area. He made an effort to take the catch but it bounced out of his hands when he hit the ground awkwardly. When he went to get up, he felt a stabbing pain in his back and he was unable to move. He spent the next few weeks in an Adelaide hospital flat on his back. In the 1975 Cricket World Cup Final against Australia, the West Indies were deep in trouble at 3/50 when Lloyd strode to the crease. He duly made 102 from 88 balls, the only limited overs international century of his career. With Rohan Kanhai he added 149 for the West Indies to win by 17 runs. Play ended at 8:40pm London time and was the longest day's play ever at Lord's. On 22 January 1985, Lloyd was made an honorary Officer of the Order of Australia for his services to the sport of cricket, particularly in relation to his outstanding and positive influence on the game in Australia.It's an Honour, LLOYD, Clive Hubert, Accessed 22 October 2010. In 2005, Lloyd offered his patronage to Major League Cricket for their inaugural Interstate Cricket Cup in the United States, to be named the Sir Clive Lloyd Cup. His son, Jason Clive Lloyd, is a goalkeeper for the Guyana national football team. In 2007, Lloyd's authorised biography, Supercat, was published. It was written by the cricket journalist, Simon Lister.
