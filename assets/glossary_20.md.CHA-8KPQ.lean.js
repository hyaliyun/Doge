The Mokvi Gospels contains 329 pages, each 30 x 23.5 cm in size, and a long cycle of 157 miniatures painted on gold. The manuscript is preserved at the Georgian National Center of Manuscripts in Tbilisi. The Mokvi Gospels, dated to 1300, was copied by the certain Ephraim at the behest of Daniel, Archbishop of Mokvi, and donated to the Cathedral of the Holy Virgin at Mokvi. Daniel himself is portrayed in one of the miniatures as praying before the Virgin Mary. Naumann and Belting assume that the author of the miniatures was trained in Constantinople around 1290 and brought the Byzantine style to Georgia. The manuscript was then transported to the Gelati Monastery near Kutaisi, where it was still kept in the 1880s. It was then brought to a museum in Tbilisi and evacuated to France after the Soviet invasion of Georgia as part of the Georgian museum treasuries in 1921. It was repatriated to then-Soviet Georgia in 1945 and found its abode at the National Center of Manuscripts. As of 2015, efforts were underway for improved conservation and repair of the manuscript.

History  The Tsebelda fortress is an architectural complex consisting of ruined towers, Christian chapels, a palace, necropolis, and several other structures. It is erected on two cliffs more than 400 m high above the Kodori river gorge. The extant structures at Tsebelda are identified with the Tsibilium/Tzibile of the Classical authors, such as Procopius of Caesarea. It appears to have been a chief fortress in Apsilia, a vassal principality of the Lazic kingdom in the 6th century. The fortress dominated the confluence of three major routes from the northern Eurasian steppe on their way to the Black Sea. Around 550, during the Lazic War, the Laz notable Terdetes betrayed his king Gubazes and handed the fortress of Tzibile over to the Persians. The Apsilians retook the fort, but refused to accept Lazic rule until persuaded to do so by the Byzantine general John Guzes.  Current state  The law of Georgia treats the monument as part of cultural heritage in the occupied territories. In January 2017, Georgia, followed by the United States Mission to the OSCE, accused the Russian military of having put the historical site of Tsebelda under risk of destruction after a nearby located 19th-century Polish cemetery and a church were demolished in order to build a shooting range. Officials from breakaway Abkhazia confirmed the damage during a firing range construction but did not elaborate further details. The Russian Defense Ministry denied any involvement.

A nearby grotto is associated by popular legends with the site of martyrdom of St. Simon. The church before the 1880s reconstruction The design of the extant church dates to the 9th or 10th century and is influenced by the Byzantine and Georgian art traditions, but the church site seems to be two centuries older. At the time when the Georgian historian Dimitri Bakradze visited it in the 1850s, the church was abandoned, but still standing except for the collapsed dome. The church suffered greatly when the local landlord, Major Hasan Margani removed its blocks of stone for the construction of his own mansion. Later, in the 1880s, the church was reconstructed, using blocks of white hewn stone, to its current state. The church is adorned with images of Christian symbols such as a fish, lion, and cross curved in relief.

Career Arnestad studied violin at the Music Conservatory in Oslo, and also studied in France, Germany, Holland and Belgium. In addition to conventional compositional studies, Arnestad also studied African and Oriental music styles. Arnestad‚Äôs compositional output is characterized by strong expressionistic traits with works that feature fragments of neo-classical ideals as well as serialism. His primary compositional focus was acoustics and exploration of harmonic structure and polarity. Studying acoustic theory, Arnestad developed a tonal system based on interference notes. Within this system, tones that are part of an interference-timbre are considered as consonant harmony, and those that are not are viewed as dissonant. The interference-timbre sound serves as structured, solid harmonies, as points of rest and calm in polyphonic development, while the dissonant harmonies are treated as dependent and disquieting. Orchestral works constitute a considerable portion of Arnestad's compositional output. Arnestad was also active as an orchestrator, and his treatment of timbre in the pivotal work INRI (1952‚Äì58) has been characterized as almost brutally expressionistic. One of Arnestad‚Äôs most widely recognized orchestral works is Aria Appassionata (1962), a work in which interference- tonality is combined with twelve-tone technique to form an emotionally-charged tonal language. Additional key works in Arnestad‚Äôs output includes his violin concerto from 1962, and \\"Suite i gamle danserytmer\\" (1966), which is based on \\"The Blacksmith and the Baker\\" for baritone and chamber orchestra, with libretto by Johan Herman Wessel. Arnestad has also composed works for chamber orchestra, voice and piano. Arnestad served as a member of the Norwegian Society of Composers‚Äô advisory board from 1974 to 1979 and was a member of the same organisation‚Äôs scholarship committee from 1971 to 1981.

It called for a repeal of the Eight Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, which bans abortion in nearly all cases, by recognising \\"the right to life of the unborn\\". The protest was organised by Strike 4 Repeal, an ad-hoc, non-affiliated group of activists, academics, artists and trade unionists organising for abortion rights in Ireland. The main march was in Dublin, with 10,000 people on O'Connell Bridge, and later many outside other government buildings. Despite the name \\"strike\\" some people took paid holidays that day. There were also protests in Galway, Limerick, Cork & other cities & towns around Ireland. A protest was also held outside the Irish Embassy in London. It was inspired by a similar Black Protest in Poland several months earlier, which itself was inspired by the 1975 Icelandic women's strike. The march, and repeal movement, was criticised by some anti-abortion writers. Some participants thought the coverage of the event on RT√â, Ireland's national broadcaster, was insufficient, and organised a follow-up picket of RT√â studios. In 2016, the Irish government convened a Citizens' Assembly to make non-binding recommendations on this constitutional ban on abortion, and it was still deliberating on the day of the protest. the Assembly hasn't finished its work.

Keppel and William J. Birnes. Shot in Halifax, Canada, the film stars Bruce Greenwood, Sam Jaeger, Kathleen Quinlan, and Cary Elwes. It premiered on A&E; on September 6, 2004. Plot Robert D. Keppel, a criminology professor at the University of Washington, is approached by Detective Dave Reichert to help profile a serial killer preying on prostitutes in the Seattle, Washington area. Keppel agrees over the objections of his wife Sande, who is tired of him spending more time with crime scene investigations than with her. Keppel receives a letter from serial killer Ted Bundy, whom Keppel had helped send to death row, offering to \\"consult\\" on the case. Keppel conducts a series of interviews with Bundy under the guise of wanting his expertise. In reality, he is hoping that Bundy will reveal details of his own murders before he is executed. Bundy is little help in profiling the killer, whom he dubs \\"The Riverman\\", but he does shed light on his own pathology, particularly his need to \\"possess\\" his victims, even to the point of necrophilia. Finally, Bundy confesses to several unsolved murders in the vain hope that Keppel will delay his execution. Meanwhile, Keppel and Reichert question a suspect, Gary Ridgway, and take a DNA sample. Years later, the DNA is used to convict Ridgway of the murders. Cast * Bruce Greenwood as Robert D.

Early life Born in London, and baptised at St Michael Cornhill in November 1685, he was the second son of William Poyntz, upholsterer, of Cornhill, and his second wife, Jane, daughter of the merchant and accountant Stephen Monteage (1623-1687) and his wife Jane.The Will of Stephen Monteage (P.C.C. 1687), Foot quire, identifies his daughter Jane's marriage to William Poyntz and his grandson Stephen Poyntz. It also refers to the tomb of his mother and grandmother in Buckingham churchyard. Stephen Monteage was born Estienne Monteage to Estienne Monteage of Chastre, goldsmith in London (died 1657Will of Stephen Monteage (P.C.C. 1657), Ruthen quire.

Hunting, 'The Survey of Hatton Garden in 1694 by Abraham Arlidge', London Topographical Record XXV (1985), pp. 83-110, at pp. 91, 102. The given name \\"Deane\\" refers to the family connection with the Deanes of Guiting Power, Gloucestershire.G. Lipscomb, The History and Antiquities of the County of Buckinghamshire (J. & W. Robins, London 1847), II, p. 579, mentions the tomb at Buckingham of Anne, widow of Edward Deane of Pinnock (Temple Guiting, Gloucestershire) and her daughter Jane (died 1670), late the wife of Stephen Monteage, Merchant.The old D.N.B. articles on Stephen Monteage, vol. 38, and Stephen Poyntz disagree as to whether Jane Deane was the wife or the mother of Stephen Monteage (d. 1687) - whose birth mother was Anne Mehoult. John Monteage's will of 1724 includes bequests to his nephew Stephen Poyntz, to Stephen's brothers William, Deane and Joseph Poyntz, and to his sister Hannah Poyntz: John's principal heir and executor was Stephen Monteage the younger, son of Deane Monteage. Stephen Poyntz was educated at Eton College, a king's scholar and in 1702 captain of Montem. On 17 February 1703 he was admitted to King's College, Cambridge, and became in due course a Fellow there, graduating B.A. in 1706, and M.A. in 1711. Diplomat Shortly after he left college, Poyntz travelled with William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire; and he was also tutor to the sons of Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend, with whom he was at The Hague in 1709 and 1710. He acted as Townshend's confidential secretary, communicating on his behalf with the English ambassadors abroad, and, through his chief's influence, he moved into the diplomatic service. Poyntz was commissary in 1716 to James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope, the Secretary of State. Poyntz was made envoy-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Sweden in July 1724. Sir Robert Walpole complained about sums he drew from the Exchequer to secure Sweden's support, but he managed to defend the reputation of Sir John Norris against accusations going back to the Great Northern War. In 1728 he was sent as commissioner to the Congress of Soissons, where he made the acquaintance of George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, and he remained in France until the summer of 1730. He obtained the French agreement to dismantle the fortifications at Dunkirk, regarded as a deft diplomatic coup as well as a political triumph for the Whigs in London. Courtier On the formation of the household of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, second son of George II, Poyntz was appointed as the young Duke's governor and steward of the household. He continued as a trusted adviser. About 1735 he purchased from the Hillersdon family an estate at Midgham in the parish of Thatcham, near Newbury, Berkshire; the Duke spent some of his early years there. Poyntz played a significant part at court. He acted in 1734 as the medium of communication between the king and queen and an Austrian envoy. It was in his rooms at St James's Palace that Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough in 1735 acknowledged that Anastasia Robinson was his wife. In 1735 Poyntz was created a privy councillor and received a sinecure post. Associations and death Poyntz was a friend of Samuel Richardson the novelist, a patron of James Ferguson the astronomer, and helped the scholar Elizabeth Elstob by a recommendation of support to the Queen. He died at Midgham on 17 December 1750, and was buried there. Works Poyntz was the author of the long and anonymous Vindication of the Barrier Treaty (1712). It was a work praised at the time. Family Poyntz married, in February 1732‚Äì3, Anna Maria Mordaunt, daughter of the Hon. Lewis Mordaunt, brigadier-general, and maid of honour to Queen Caroline of Ansbach. She had been a great beauty, addressed by Samuel Croxall in his poem The Fair Circassian. They had two sons‚ÄîWilliam of Midgham (d. 1809), and Charles, prebendary of Durham‚Äîand three daughters, Margaret Georgina, Louisa, and Sophia. Louisa died unmarried. Sophia married Sir Roger Martin.https://books.google.com/books?id=yZhcAAAAcAAJ&pg;=PT8&lpg;=PT8&dq;=anna+maria+mordaunt&source;=bl&ots;=JwbTBxutH1&sig;=ACfU3U17FhO2uQtw- YVrO50jDzzIslfeew&hl;=en&ppis;=_c&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiNu7PByqboAhWpiOAKHS4wBhw4FBDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q;=anna%20maria%20mordaunt&f;=false Margaret Georgina became the wife, at Althorp, on 27 December 1755 (the day after he came of age), of the future John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer.

While an estimated 10% of the population of Mexico is indigenous, it is the least represented in higher education. According to estimates, only between 1% and 3% of higher education enrollment in Mexico is indigenous. In response to this inequality, the General Coordination for Intercultural and Bilingual Education at the Ministry of Education established Intercultural Universities with the active participation of indigenous organizations and academic institutions in each region. These institutions are located in densely indigenous areas and, though they allow for diversity in enrollment, they are especially intended for the indigenous population. Founded on the principle of intercultural education, they aim to foster dialogue between different cultures and represent a way of responding to both the historical and more recent demands of indigenous peoples. In congruence with the recognition of diversity, Intercultural Universities do not propose a fixed approach to their educational activities. While assuring the respect of some basic principles, each university defines its curriculum according to the needs and potentials of the region in which it is located. Students are engaged in activities that relate them to the surrounding communities through research and development projects, with the aim of working and contributing to the development of their territory, their people and their culture. Twelve Intercultural Universities are currently operating with a total enrollment of approximately 7,000 students and a high proportion of female students. Despite the challenges of financing, of students' living conditions and of political vulnerability that these universities face, they represent an important contribution to the achievement of educational equity.

A claim having been paid, the assured's rights of claim will be subrogated to the insurer, who may consider proceeding against a party who has caused the damage. A shipowner may sue a time-charterer or voyage-charterer in the event of breach of contract. For instance, if the charterer exceeds laytime, demurrage will have to be paid; and if the charterer cannot comply with a Notice of Readiness (NOR), the shipowner may repudiate (cancel) the contract of carriage and claim damages for any loss.Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbHThe Mihalis Angelos Carriage conventions In most contracts of carriage the carrier has greater bargaining power than the shipper, and in the 19th century English judges developed rules to protect the weaker parties.M'Andrew v Adams (1834) 1 Bing NC 29 Beginning with the Hague Rules, the various conventions set out to codify and develop such common law principles by providing an international set of basic standards to be met by the carrier, with a view to establishing a universal framework of legal rights and duties. In practice, however, the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on a wide array of exemptions from liability ...such as \\"Act of God\\", \\"Perils of the Sea\\" and \\"negligence in navigation or management of the ship\\").e.g. Hague-Visby Rules Art. IV (1) & (2)Principles of the Carriage of Goods by Sea -Paul Todd Also, whereas up until about 1885,The Glenfruin (1885) 10 PD 103 the carrier's duties were deemed to be strict, by 1905 the duty became one of \\"reasonable care\\" or \\"due diligence\\" only.McFadden v Blue Star Line [1905] 1 KB 697 The Hague Rules of 1924 effectively codified, albeit in a diluted form, the English common law rules to protect the cargo owner against exploitation by the carrier. Nearly 50 years later, the Hague-Visby \\"update\\" made few changes, so that the newer Rules still applied only to \\"tackle to tackle\\" carriage (i.e. carriage by sea) and the container revolution of the 1950s was virtually ignored. The Hague-Visby Rules both excluded cabotage carriage, and declared that deck cargo and live animals were not to be considered as \\"goods\\" (although the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 provided that cabotage, deck cargo and live animals are to be covered in English contracts). The enormous list of exemptions to liability in Article IV made the Rules seem biased in favour of the carrier. As a result, The United Nations produced its own Hamburg Rules which were both more modern and fairer to cargo-owners; but while these have been enthusiastically adopted by developing nations, the wealthier ship-owning nations have stuck to Hague- Visby. In 2008 the final text of the Rotterdam Rules was agreed at UNCITRAL. UNCITRAL: United Nations Commission of International Trade Law. These Rules are very extensive, with over 90 Articles against 11 in Hague-Visby. Although the Rotterdam Rules are up-to-date and address multimodal carriage, they have, nine years later, yet to be in force. It now seems doubtful that the Rotterdam Rules will ever be adopted, but there is a slim possibility that a cut-down version of the Rules (\\"Rotterdam Lite\\") might find favour. China has effectively adopted the Hague Rules. The USA, which tends to shun conventions and instead rely on homespun legislation, has its own statutes. These comprise the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (a mildly updated version of the Hague Rules for goods in foreign commerce), and the Harter Act (for mostly domestic carriage).Lexolology report Relevant statutes and sources * Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 - UK * Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 - UK * Carriage of Goods by Sea Act - (USA) * Harter Act - USA References International trade law * International law ","title":"Law of carriage of goods by sea"},{"id":"53470842","text":"Lt Col John Du Plessis Langrishe FRSE DSO (11 September 1883‚Äì28 February 1947) was a British physician, soldier and landowner.

It is located at a distance of circa 60 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 5643 is about 100,000 light years across. NGC 5643 has an active galactic nucleus and is a type II Seyfert galaxy.  Observation history  The galaxy was first reported by James Dunlop on May 10, 1826 with his 9-inch reflector telescope and described it as exceedingly faint. The galaxy was also spotted by John Herschel and added it in the General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters as number 3572. The galaxy is located only 15 degrees from the galactic plane.  Structure  NGC 5643 is a grand design spiral galaxy, with two well-defined, symmetric arms. In the circumnuclear region are present and other dust spirals, but the two main dust arms are wider. The galaxy is seen nearly face on, at an inclination of ‚àº 27¬∞. = Active galactic nucleus = ALMA and VLT. The galaxy has a low- luminosity active galactic nucleus of Seyfert 2 type and is also a luminous infrared galaxy. The galaxy has a double sided diffuse radiojet. The galaxy exhibits an extended emission line region elongated in a direction close to the radio position angle of 87¬∞¬±3¬∞. Chris Simpson et al. analysed images takes from WFPC2 camera of the Hubble Space Telescope in [O III] Œª5007 and HŒ± and found emission extending eastward for at least 1.8 kpc and in the [O III]/HŒ± map a well-defined V-shaped structure that they identified as the projection of a tridimensional ionisation cone, which shares the same axis with the radio emission. A dust lanes perpendicular to this axis obstructs the nucleus from direct view. A disk of material was found when the data cubes of VLT were analysed. It is aligned with the nucleus and circles it and it possibly provides gas to the active galactic nucleus. The mass of the supermassive black hole has been estimated based on the galaxy stellar velocity dispersion to be 106.4 M‚äô. It has been proposed that the gas outflow has led to star formation on two locations on the bar of the galaxy which lie at the location where the gas from the nucleus encounters the dense material of the bar. Via observations of the galaxy from XMM Newton telescope in 2009, the galaxy is found to be a Compton‚Äìthick active galactic nucleus. Also the galaxy emits soft X-rays, mainly from photoionized matter. The prensence of the compton- thick column which obstructs the nucleus was confirmed from observations by NuSTAR. = Ultraluminous X-ray source = In 2004, Guainazzi et al. detected in the images from XMM-Newton an ultraluminous X-ray source, named NGC 5643 ULX1, located within 0.8 arcminutes from the nucleus. The source outshone the nucleus in X-rays and if it is located within NGC 5643 its luminosity is over 1040 erg/s. Its luminosity is variable. The X-rays could be produced either by an advection dominated disc or a Comptonising corona and the X-ray source considered to be a black hole of stellar origin of approximately 30 solar masses.  Supernovae  NGC 5643 has been home of two supernovae, SN 2013aa and SN 2017cbv. SN 2013aa was discovered by Stuart Parker from New Zealand on a 30-s unfiltered CCD image taken on 13.621 UT February 2013, as part of the Backyard Observatory Supernova Search, at magnitude 11.9. It was classified as a Type Ia a few days before maximum brightness. SN 2017cbv was discovered on March 10, 2017 by the Swope 1-m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory and was classified as a very young Ia supernova. It increased in magnitude from 15.8 to 14.8 within the next day.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 5643 has a satellite dwarf galaxy, ESO 273-014.

In 1850 John Wilson opened a regular steamship service between Gothenburg and Hull, which proved particularly effective in transporting emigrants from northern Europe to America. In 1865 the company AB G√∂teborg-London was formed. In 1882 this became part of the Thule Company after Wilson became a partner in the latter. Wilson served on Gothenburg's city council from 1867 to 1886 as well as director of the Skandinaviska Kredit and vice chairman of the trade associations council.

The Berlin based branch of the federal Chancellor Willy Brandt Foundation also houses the Office of Monumental Protection of the Hanseatic city of L√ºbeck, in Schleswig-Holstein. It is the third establishment in the city to honor a Nobel Prize laureate from L√ºbeck. The director of the Willy- Brandt-Haus is the historian, J√ºrgen Lillteicher. Detail: The symbol of the Zirkelgesellschaft, a fraternity of long-distance merchants Willy Brandt was not born in this building, but in different house in the L√ºbeck district of St. Lorenz.  History  The Willy-Brandt House opened on 18 December 2007, on what would have been Willy Brandt's 94th birthday, in his home town of L√ºbeck. The establishment of a memorial in Willy Brandt's hometown was suggested by G√ºnter Grass, Nobel Prize laureate for literature, who had maintained political ties to him since the 1960s. The city of L√ºbeck provided a patrician house in need of restoration on K√∂nigstra√üe 21 for the museum. It was an assembly house of the Zirkelgesellschaft, a fraternity of long-distance merchants, before it became the seat of the Supreme Court of the Four Free Cities (Bremen, Hamburg, Frankfurt am Main and L√ºbeck) in the 19th century. It was later used as the State Archive of the Hanseatic city as well as a public library. After years of vacancy, the cost of renovating, converting and furnishing the building came to a sum of 3.8 million euros. The federal republic contributed 2.8 million euros and the German Foundation for Monument Protection contributed one million euros.Josephine von Zastrow: Die Willy- Brandt-Gala ‚Äì Ein Festtag f√ºr L√ºbeck.

December 2013 One room presents Brandt's childhood and youth in L√ºbeck, followed by his experiences in the resistance movement, escape to Norway by boat and exile. As a reporter, he attended the Nuremberg Trials, after which he recognized the difficulties Germany faced after the war. His time as the governing mayor of Berlin saw events such as the Berlin ultimatum, the building of the Berlin wall, Kennedy's visit and the step-by-step policy. As a foreign minister and afterwards Chancellor, Brandt followed Ostpolitik, a policy of building relationships with Eastern bloc countries, and called for European unification. A smaller exhibition room shows election campaign posters from 1972, the so-called Willy-Wahl which Brandt won by a landslide victory. In the final, largest room of the exhibition, international themes are presented: Willy Brandt's \\"global commitment\\" for the resolution of North-South disparities, the promotion of peace and freedom, and the assertion of human rights. In the foyer, a sculpture of Willy Brandt can be found in a niche next to the staircase. The original, larger than life sculpture can be seen in the SPD party headquarters, at the Willy-Brandt-Haus in Berlin. The work of the sculptor Rainer Fetting is a loan from a L√ºbeck art dealer and his wife.

Poland has an embassy in Hanoi and Vietnam has an embassy in Warsaw. The relationship between these two nations can be described as special because they both share historical parallels, although they are very culturally different from one another and they are geographically very far apart. Both Poland and Vietnam have had a long history of struggles against powerful foreign invaders such as Russia and China. These shared historical struggles are mentioned in the Vietnamese poem My dear, Poland My dear, Poland, Le Van Hieu (in Vietnamese) by the Vietnamese poet T·ªë H·ªØu. History Embassy of Vietnam in Warsaw While the two nations have little in common due to their geographical positions, they undeniably share historical parallels. Poland and Vietnam are the most ancient nations in Europe and Asia, respectively. More importantly, both Poland and Vietnam were given credit for having repelled the invasions from two of the most powerful empires in history; Poland repelled the invasion from the Ottoman Empire and Vietnam repelled the invasion from the Mongol Empire. It could be said that Poland saved Europe from the threats of Ottoman Empire and Vietnam saved Southeast Asia from the threats of Mongol Empire. Also, both nations have contributed to producing some of the most popular, charismatic and revered national heroes in their respective histories. Poland produced such national heroes as John III Sobieski, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, J√≥zef Poniatowski, Witold Pilecki, Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, Casimir Pulaski, Witold Urbanowicz, Pope John Paul II; whereas Vietnam has Ng√¥ Quy·ªÅn, Tr·∫ßn H∆∞ng ƒê·∫°o, V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p, Phan B·ªôi Ch√¢u, Tr∆∞ng Sisters, Nguy·ªÖn An, L√Ω Long T∆∞·ªùng. Some of these figures are also revered outside their nations. For example, Urbanowicz is popular in Britain. Pulaski and Ko≈õciuszko are revered in the U.S. L√Ω Long T∆∞·ªùng is a well-known figure in Korea and Nguy·ªÖn An is well-known in China. Both nations also share some commonalities in how brutally they were treated by the foreign powers. In their long historical struggles for independence, the Poles and the Vietnamese both had to fight many powerful invaders. Usually, Poland and Vietnam had to fight Russia and China, respectively, and they both very often had to suffer destruction and devastation. In the recent history both nations were also occupied by strong powerful nations. Poland was occupied by Nazi Germany and Soviet Union, whereas Vietnam was occupied by Vichy France and Japanese Empire during the World War II. They were the brutal victims of massacres launched by these imperial forces. Both nations also resisted very bravely. Poland launched Warsaw Uprising to resist against the Nazi Germany and the Vietnamese started August Revolution to fight against the colonial rule of the French and the Japanese. As such, Vietnam received much sympathy from Polish co-workers when they arrived in North Vietnam in 1960s and the Vietnamese immigrants in Poland also perceived Poland in a similar manner because of their historical parallels. When Vietnam were subject to global condemnations and embargoes that were raised by the United States and China, both the Polish government and the Solidarity movement expressed solidarity with Vietnam's fight against the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. It was an act that led to the deployment of Polish troops in Cambodia under the UN mission to help stabilize the political situation in Cambodia.https://polandin.com/39483727/polish-un-military- mission-to-have-a-documentary In 1946, the future founder of Israel, a Polish Jew, David Ben-Gurion, met H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh in Paris. His desire of establishing Israel and the historical impression from Ho to Poland was considered as the first unofficial tie between Vietnam and Poland. Official diplomatic relations were established in 1950. Janusz Lewandowski, representative of Polish delegation during the Geneva Accords at 1954, had protested the idea of separating Vietnam into two parts that proposed by the Government of newly- established People's Republic of China. To monitor the Geneva Accords, the International Control Commission (ICC) consisting of diplomats and soldiers from Poland, India and Canada was set up. The chairman of the ICC was always Indian while the Canadians were expected to support South Vietnam while the Poles were expected to support North Vietnam. In practice, the ICC did not work as expected with the Indian delegation often taking a more pro-North position than the Polish delegation who contrary to expectations proved to be more neutral. Poland‚ÄìVietnam relations grew from the 1950s and 1980s student exchange programs, during which time both Poland and Vietnam were socialist republics under the grasp of the Soviet Union.Nowicka, p.216-217 Both states were members of Comecon. During the Vietnam War, Polish diplomats in North Vietnam collaborated with Italian diplomats in South Vietnam in order to seek peace and end the Vietnam War. The first effort was the \\"Maneli Affair\\" of 1963 named after the Polish commissioner on the ICC, Mieczys≈Çaw Maneli. The \\"Maneli Affair\\" involved a proposal to end the war and ultimately set up a federation of North Vietnam and South Vietnam. The second effort of 1966 was known as Operation Marigold. In Marigold, Janusz Lewandowski of the ICC met with the American ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., presenting an offer on behalf of North Vietnam to open peace talks provided the American stopped bombing North Vietnam first. =Polish Catholic influence in Vietnam= Throughout history of their relations, Poland had played, both unofficial and official role, on the growth and buildup of Roman Catholicism in Vietnam; since Roman Catholicism is the major religion in Poland. In 17th century, Polish Catholic Jesuit, Wojciech Mƒôci≈Ñski, visited Vietnam in a tour through Asia, and had documented about Vietnam as the first Polish official record of the country.http://misjejezuici.blogspot.com/2012/07/wojciech- mecinski.html Pope John Paul II, who was of Polish descent, had canonized all Vietnamese Catholics died from 1533 to protect Christianity as Vietnamese Martyrs in 1988. The Polish Pope opted an open opportunity to establish relations with Vietnam; and had recognized the importance of Our Lady of La Vang, a Marian apparition in La Vang. He had also expressed desire to rebuild the La Vang Basilica in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the first vision. His message was instrumental, leading to the Government of Vietnam to acknowledge the importance of La Vang in Christian history of Vietnam.https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul- ii/en/letters/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19990716_madonna-la-vang.html The Polish Pope remained a revered figure among Vietnamese, both Catholics and non-Catholics, even when he died in 2005. The Polish Pope was also seen as having laid the framework to normalization of relations between the Holy See and Vietnam Archbishop Marek Zalewski, who is the second Vatican non- residential representative to Vietnam, is from Poland.http://www.catholic- hierarchy.org/bishop/bzalew.htmlhttps://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2018-05/pope- francis-nuncio-singapore-vietnam-zalewski.html He played a minor role, yet facilitated an unofficial link on the ongoing normalization between Holy See‚ÄìVietnam relations,http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Mgr-Marek- Zalewski%E2%80%99s-new-task-as-new-nuncio-in-Hanoi-44050.html which was seen with the direct result of Vatican's decision to establish a permanent representative in Vietnam and accepted by the Vietnamese regime,https://zenit.org/articles/seventh-meeting-of-the-vietnam-holy-see- joint-working-group/ moving further to possible future establishment of official tie between two entities and lax of suppression on Catholicism in Vietnam by the Vietnamese regime.https://www.romereports.com/en/2018/12/20/holy-see-to-have-permanent- representative-in-vietnam/ Cultural relations  The 10th-Anniversary Stadium has been called the center of the Vietnamese-Polish community. The Vietnamese community is also served by a number of non-governmental organizations, run by the community itself. The Vietnamese-Polish High School in Hanoi was named in honor of relationship between Vietnam and Poland. Also in Hanoi, the Marie Curie High School was named in honor of the famous Polish woman scientist.

In the same year, Adamed Group made the largest direct Polish investment in Vietnam by acquiring a controlling stake in Davipharm Co. Migration There has been significant migration of Vietnamese people to Poland estimated to be between 30,000-40,000 forming the largest non European migrant community in Poland. Following the Polish transition to a capitalist economy in 1990, and the reforms of Vietnam at 1986, Poland became a more attractive immigration destination for the Vietnamese people, in particular, small entrepreneurs; this triggered a second, larger wave of Vietnamese immigrants to Poland.Nowicka, p.216-217 Many began as vendors in the open air market bazaar at the 10th-Anniversary Stadium selling clothes or cheap food; , there were between 1,100 and 1,200 Vietnamese-owned stands in the area. (in Polish) in Warsaw there were an estimated 500 Vietnamese restaurants, mostly serving fast food.

It was first serialized on Jinjiang (http://www.jjwxc.net/) from January 2007 to August 2007 and first published by Uei-Shiang Co., Ltd. in Taiwan. Its simplified Chinese version was later published by China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Publishing Corporation in July 2016. It was translated into Thai and published in Thailand in December 2016. The storyline is Song Yao's long journey through transmigrations, to and fro between immortal and mortal world. The fiction depicts the struggling of several main characters and their entangled destinations (their ‚Äúdebts‚Äù to each other) and finally comes to a happy end. Translation of the Title Ê°ÉËä±ÂÄ∫ can be directly translated as Peach Blossom Debt. The sense-for-sense translation could be Romance of Love Debt, since peach blossoms are used as a symbol of love in Chinese culture. World Setting The world setting of this fiction is based on Chinese local mythology, Taoist culture and Buddhist culture: There are 3 worlds: mortal world of human beings, Heavenly Palace of the immortals (The immortals mainly origin from Taoism) and Western Paradise of Buddhas. Mortal human beings and animals can become immortal by practice Taosiam or Buddhaism or, like Song Yao, by taking the elixir pills. Immortals and Buddhas can visit each other in Heavenly Palace and Western Paradise. The souls of both the immortals and the mortals can go through transmigrations or samsara. The immortals' transmigrating as a mortal is a part of their practice or a way to pay the karma/debt for what they have done before. Main Characters and terminologies (With Chinese) Immortal Song Yao (Chinese ÂÆãÁèßÂÖÉÂêõ): The leading character and narrator of this story. He used to be mortal but becomes immortal after he takes an elixir pill unknowingly. His Celestial Title is Guangxu (ChineseÂπøËôö, means ‚ÄúInfinite Void‚Äù) Pure Immortal Hengwen (ChineseË°°ÊñáÊ∏ÖÂêõ): The god of knowledge and talent. His Celestial Title is Hengwen, meaning ‚ÄúJudging one‚Äôs knowledge and talent according to his/her literature works‚Äù. He asks Song Yao to give him a name of a mortal, Zhao Heng (Chinese ËµµË°°). Zhao and Song are both the name of ancient Chinese vassal states. Coincidentally, Zhao is also the surname of Empires of Song Dynasty. Stellar Immortal Tianshu (Chinese Â§©Êû¢ÊòüÂêõ): The god of mortal emperors. Tianshu (Chinese Â§©Êû¢) is the ancient name of Dubhe, the brightest star of Plough. In Chinese classic literature, Dubhe is the metaphor for the virtue of an emperor. Imperial Immortal Nanming (Chinese ÂçóÊòéÂ∏ùÂêõ): The god of the fortune of mortal empires Nanming (Chinese ÂçóÊòé) is the alias of a Chinese constellation and/or mythological animal Vermilion Bird (Chinese Êú±ÈõÄ). Stellar Immortal Taibai (Chinese Â§™ÁôΩÊòüÂêõ): Taibai is the Chinese name for Venus, the morning star and the star of the West in Chinese Culture. Traditional Chinese astrology believes Venus is linked with war and the overthrow of emperors. However, in many Chinese fantasy fictions (including this one), He is usually described as an old servant and messenger of Jade Emperor. Jade Emperor (Chinese ÁéâÂ∏ù): The ruler of the immortal word Heavenly Palace (Chinese Â§©Â∫≠). He is a deity of Taoism. His image is basically an immortal version of an ancient emperor of China Queen Mother of the West (Chinese: ÁéãÊØçÂ®òÂ®ò, Ë•øÁéãÊØç): The co-ruler of Heavenly Place.

It is now a Latin Catholic titular see.  History  The city of Cedi√¶ was situated in modern Oum-Kif, in present Algeria. It was important enough in the Roman province of Numidia (in the papal sway) to become one its many suffragan sees, but like most faded completely, plausibly at the seventh century advent of Islam. The first record of the diocese, from 256, mentions bishop Secondinus, partaking in the council called at Carthage in 256 by Saint Cyprianus on 'lapsed Christians', who accept forced idolatry to avoid martyrdom; he died a martyr himself at Cirta in 259, mentioned in the Vetus Martyrologium Romanum under 29 April. Francesco Lanzoni believes him identical to the saint Secondinus venerated throughout southern Italy.Francesco Lanzoni, Le diocesi d'Italia dalle origini al principio del secolo VII (an. 604), vol. I, Faenza 1927, pp. 178‚Äì1179. Later Cediae adhered to the heresy Donatism, like its bishop Fortis, participant at the council called in Carthage in 484 by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, where it had no Catholic counterpart, and probably exiled afterward like most Catholic bishops. The last recorded bishop, Secundus, may still have been Donatist. Archeological digs found remnants of a basilica, probably from the Donatist period, and numerous sarcophagi, one of which is inscribed with a dedication of the church to bishop Secundus.

Built in 1907, it is a distinctive design of the architect Alfredo S.G. Taylor, featuring some of his signature elements. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Robbins Stoeckel House stands south of the village center of Norfolk, on the west side of Litchfield Road just south of the Mountain View Inn. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a dormered gable roof, and an exterior finished in stucco and wooden shingles. A gambrel-roofed ell extends from the north side. A fieldstone chimney rises on the front facade, near the junction between the original main block and the ell. The house was built in 1907 to a design by Alfredo S.G. Taylor, a New York City-based architect who spent many summers in Norfolk. Taylor is credited with more than thirty commissions in Norfolk. This house exhibits a number of signature Taylor elements, including windows with small panes in both square and diamond configurations, the half-round window in the end of the gambrel gable, and the position of the entrance at the crook of the ell. The ell, although it was added in the 1920s for a subsequent owner, was also designed by Taylor.

Jungle had started to emerge in the United Kingdom a couple of years earlier but despite its growth, albeit slow, in the United States, no jungle albums were available on the American market. Moonshine conceived the album as a primer for jungle music for American shores, using music from British jungle label SOUR Records, and as a spin-off to their fast tempo techno compilation series Speed Limit 140 BPM+. Law of the Jungle was the first jungle album released in the United States. The music on the album features typical jungle characteristics including influences from ragga, dub and dancehall, cut-up breakbeats, rude boy motifs and lyrics of urban alienation. The album sold 15,000 copies in the United States and was a major critical success, with many critics describing the album as a great introduction to jungle music. Furthermore, the album has also been credited as helping spread popularity of the genre in the United States. In 1999, music critic Ned Raggett named the album the 15th greatest album of the 1990s, and the decade's greatest compilation album. Background Jungle music emerged circa 1992 in London and Bristol, characterised by its pulsating, fast tempos (150 to 200 bpm),Noys, Benjamin. Into the Jungle, Popular Music, Vol. 14, No. 3 (Oct., 1995), pp. 321 relatively slow and lyrical reggae-derived basslines, breakbeats (often cut-up using breaks such as the Amen break), and other heavily syncopated percussive loops. According to Tim Haslett of CMJ New Music Monthly in his review of Law of the Jungle, described the original jungle sound present on the album as \\"constructed of sped-up drum breaks from '70s funk records from everyone to James Brown to Jimmy Castor and Hermann Kelly.\\" New York Magazine meanwhile described its influence from hip hop and \\"dancehall, dub and techno music that's distinguished by a frantic speed, a deep, detached bass pulse and a staicky surface of radio sound bites and unintelligble ragamuffin-style vocals,\\" citing the genre's similarity to \\"early punk rock‚Äìat least in its tempo, noise levels and desired effect on the more conservative segments of British society.\\" While jungle music's underground spread was large in its native United Kingdom, it was \\"slowly but surely\\" reaching North America, where much of the music was unavailable. As no albums of jungle were available in the United States, Law of the Jungle was conceived and distributed by Moonshine Music, an american electronic label primarily known for releasing techno music, as a jungle compilation for American shores under exclusive licence from British jungle label SOUR Records (Sounds of the Underground), whose catalogue, all of which was recorded at Trinity Studios in London, is used on the album. It was the first spin-off to Moonshine's Speed Limit 140 BPM+ series of compilations of fast-tempo techno music. Credited as executive producer, Stephen Levy compiled the album with David Stone, mastered it with Dave Aude West Hollywood studio The Still and is credited alongside Stan Endo for art direction. Mateo drew the illustration on the album cover. Music Shy FX (pictured in 2004). Described by Simon Reynolds as \\"containing some of the fiercest examples of this ragga-jungle style,\\" all the music on Law of the Jungle was licensed from SOUR Records, who have referred to the album as \\"the key\\" to their American success. Prior to the album's release, the music on the album was notoriously difficult for jungle enthusiasts in the United States to find on import. Ned Raggett, writing about the album for Freaky Trigger, described the album as a product of when jungle music was \\"freed from a variety of attentions\\": \\"this was when a bunch of characters just thought, 'Hm! Wonder what happens if‚Ä¶'.\\" The music is \\"heavy on the gangster/rude boy vibe,\\" reflected in the titles of \\"Hustling,\\" \\"Original Gangsta,\\" \\"Heartless\\" and \\"Original Nuttah\\", and in the lyrical delivery throughout the album, with \\"some of the most aggressively fun vocabs and ways around things vocally than most could ever dream of.\\" The \\"dub bass moves and the drop-ins of shotguns and echo,\\" which have been compared to Lee Perry, give the music a dancehall vibe, which, according to Raggett, is \\"why you have Junior Dan going on about being heartless with a sweet-touched reggae backing at points even while the drums are going wonderfully nuts all around him.\\" Many of the songs concern urban alienation, and while, according to Raggett, \\"staying one step ahead of capture\\" in the \\"urban jungle\\" was not necessarily a new subject for music, the speed to the music is essential, \\"because this isn't being cool and head-nodding, it's bolting forward.\\" \\"Reflection does not belong here,\\" wrote Raggett, \\"and there's no real point in big chants when the next sudden shift is around the corner. But the thing is that it's not all that, because then it wouldn't be fun. And fun is paramount.\\" =Songs= Shy FX and UK Apache's \\"Original Nuttah\\", as well as \\"Original Gangstah,\\" also by Shy FX in collaboration with Gunsmoke, were described as the album's highlights by Tim Haslett of the CMJ New Music Monthly, citing the songs' energy and \\"aura of promise and excitement recalling the exhilaration surrounding Run-DMC's 'Sucker MC'.\\" The former song samples an \\"ambient drone\\" from \\"Black Sunday\\" by Cypress Hill which, according to Simon Reynolds, \\"underscores the G-funk thread running from London, Los Angeles and Kingston,\\" while the latter track, a \\"snare drum- dominated\\" song which \\"unforgettably shouts the terrors and joys of black London,\\" samples dialogue from Goodfellas. \\"Blow Out Jungle VIP\\" by Bass Selective features a \\"discosalsa piano line, synth strings and diva vocals slammed into it all.\\" \\"Heaven n' Hell\\" by MC Olive n' Slam Collective features brooding samples in its background. T. Power's \\"Elemental\\" features a sampled quote about \\"the beast man\\" in its introduction and has been described as \\"a strange tightrope-walk of music, clean and clinical without being dead.\\" Critics have noted its \\"razor sharp drum cuts start up\\" and \\"synths and noises.\\" \\"Hustling\\" by Booyaka Crew features vocals from dancehall musician Tippa Irie. Release and reception Law of the Jungle was released on 18 October 1994 in the United States by Moonshine Music, and was the first jungle compilation released in the United States. The album was the first spin-off of Moonshine's Speed Limit 140 BPM+ series. Moonshine sent copies of Law of the Jungle with VHS copies of the BBC jungle music documentary Anatomy of a Fresh Vibe to journalists in order to improve their knowledge on jungle. In addition to CD, the album was also released on red vinyl. Law of the Jungle sold 15,000 copies, and in 1995 became a success with radio, reaching number 1 on CMJ's Top 25 Dance chart, compiled from the magazine's RPM chart which combined airplay reports of electronic music from numerous commercial, non-commercial and college radio stations. Tim Haslett of CMJ New Music Monthly said Law of the Jungle was an \\"exemplary album\\" for jungle music, a \\"splendid collection of tracks [documenting] a genre that has arisen out of a specifically Black British context,\\" and a \\"an outstanding introduction\\" to the genre. New York Magazine also called the album an \\"excellent introduction\\" to jungle music, and was \\"worth it, if only so you can I.D. the crashing new sounds hurling out of clubs this month.\\" Simon Reynolds of Vibe was favourable, claiming the album to contain \\"lovely\\" ragga-jungle music, while reviewing the album alongside the fifth edition of the Speed Limit 140 BPM series, whose \\"intelligent drum and bass\\" music he said was more \\"provocative\\" than Law of the Jungle. Norman Weinstein of Wired called the album a \\"smartly compiled anthology\\" and recommended it alongside Crammed Discs' compilations Renegade Selector and Jungle Vibes. As the first jungle album released in the United States, it helped spread the reach of the genre in the country. Critical acclaim for the album has also not waned over time, with the album being seen as a major jungle compilation; in 1999, Ned Raggett of Freaky Trigger ranked the album at number 15 in his list of \\"The Top 136 or So Albums of the 90s\\", the highest ranked various artists album on the list. Raggett said \\"this wasn't the first jungle collection, and it may not have all the notable early tracks. Oh, but does it kick, thrive, live, flow,\\" and concluded: \\"Music that could contain the universe that conservative rock jerks and self-righteous ambient types hated. Of course it is brilliant.\\" Larry Flick of Billboard called the album \\"sizzling.\\" Track listing # U.K. Apachi / Shy FX ‚Äì \\"Original Nuttah\\" (A. Williams, A.W.

The battle was fought near the tiny village of , near Bras≈Çaw, Grand Duchy of Lithuania (present-day Belarus), between the Russian corps of Prince Yuri Dolgorukov and the Tatar regiment of the Grand Duchy, commanded by . The battle ended in a Russian victory, as the Lithuanians were forced to retreat and the Russians occupied Bras≈Çaw.  Prelude  Prince Dolgorukov's corps (9000 soldiers) crossed the Daugava River on 22 May, with the majority of the troops and tabor crossing at Dyneburg, while the rest of the troops under the command of General Johann von Rautenfeld crossed the river at Kras≈Çaw. Both columns of the Russian corps then moved on Bras≈Çaw. Soon after crossing to the other bank of the Daugava, Rautenfeld sent his Don Cossacks to scout the town of Druja. Cossack intelligence indicated that a Lithuanian Tatar banner under the command of Rotmistrz Rej≈ºewski was stationed in the town. Upon their return, the Cossacks smashed a detachment sent by Kirkor's regiment, and captured two Lithuanian Tatar uhlans. Rautenfeld immediately sent a detachment of 160 soldiers. However, when Rej≈ºewski learned of the advancing Russians, he withdrew to G≈Çƒôbokie. Rautenfeld gave up the pursuit and continued to march on Bras≈Çaw, which he occupied on 26 May.  The battle  There are two known accounts describing the battle of Opsa - one by Szymon Zabie≈Ç≈Ço, and the other by J√≥zef Su≈Çkowski. According to Zabie≈Ç≈Ço, when Rautenfeld took Bras≈Çaw, the bulk of Dolgorukov's corps marched on Opsa. The vanguard was made up of 100 Cossacks led by Captain Belogorodtsev. Belogorodtsev sent a seven-man scout detachment, who stumbled on a similar reconnaissance troop from Kirkor's Tatar regiment. This led to fighting in the vicinity of Opsa, during which Kirkor's regiment fought against a Cossack force of a few hundred men led by Colonel Kireyev. After a few hours of fighting, the Lithuanian regiment was forced to retreat. Rotmistrz Mi≈Ç≈Çaszewicz was captured, and Lieutenant Achmatowicz was severely wounded. Zabie≈Ç≈Ço believed that a few dozen Russian soldiers were killed. Su≈Çkowski writes that Kirkor's regiment watched the movements of the Russian troops. Rautenfeld encircled Opsa on the night of 25 May, with the aim of neutralising the Lithuanian Tatar force. Kirkor wanted to avoid being captured by the Russians, so he threw his regiment into a desperate attack, which allowed him to break out of the encirclement and retreat. During the fighting, the Lithuanians lost 300 troops, and the Russians lost between fifty and 300 men.

Development Scott McCloud's The Morning Improv initially ran from August 2001 to June 2002, during which McCloud spent an hour or two every day of the week to slowly develop an experimental webcomic.

McCloud continued The Morning Improv in July 2003, after a year-long hiatus, using a slightly different mechanism to select a title. Rather than picking a title himself, McCloud set up a system to allow his readers to \\"vote\\" for one of ten submitted titles by donating small amounts of money to McCloud through BitPass.

In May 2012, the heads of state of Botswana, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania gathered in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, for a two-day Summit for Sustainability in Africa, in the company of several public and private partners. At the summit, they adopted the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa.  A multi-year process  By adopting the Gaborone Declaration for Sustainability in Africa, these ten countries have engaged in a multi-year process. They have recommitted to implementing all conventions and declarations promoting sustainable development and undertaken to: * integrate the value of natural capital into national accounting and corporate planning and reporting processes, policies and programmes; * build social capital and reduce poverty by transitioning agriculture, extractive industries, fisheries and other natural capital uses to practices that promote sustainable employment, food security, sustainable energy and the protection of natural capital through protected areas and other mechanisms; and * build knowledge, data, capacity and policy networks to promote leadership and a new model of sustainable development and to increase momentum for positive change.  Beyond GDP  The overall objective of the Declaration was ‚Äòto ensure that the contributions of natural capital to sustainable economic growth, maintenance and improvement of social capital and human well-being are quantified and integrated into development and business practice.‚Äô This statement was propelled by the signatories‚Äô realization that GDP has its limitations as a measure of well-being and sustainable growth.  Follow-up  The interim secretariat of this initiative is being hosted by the Department of Environmental Affairs within the Botswanan Ministry of Environment Wildlife and Tourism, with technical support from Conservation International, a non- governmental organization. Conservation International has pledged funding for a situational analysis which will provide baseline information on where the ten countries stand with respect to the agreed actions outlined above and set priorities for moving forward. Since the 2012 summit, an implementation framework has been drafted to track progress. = Gabon = In 2012, Gabon adopted Emerging Gabon: Strategic Plan to 2025. The Strategic Plan identifies two parallel challenges: the need to diversify an economy dominated by oil exports (84% in 2012) and the imperative of reducing poverty and fostering equal opportunity. In conformity with the Gaborone Declaration, natural capital is to be integrated into the national accounting system. The plan also foresees the adoption of a national climate plan to limit Gabon‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions and forge an adaptation strategy, among other moves to foster sustainable development. The National Climate Plan was presented to the president in November 2013 by the National Council on Climate Change, a body created by presidential decree in April 2010. The government has also created a joint Centre for Environmental Research with the University of Oregon (USA) that will focus on the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change and environmental governance, including the development of ecotourism. The share of hydropower in Gabon‚Äôs electricity matrix is to progress from 40% in 2010 to 80% by 2020. In parallel, inefficient thermal power stations are to be replaced with clean ones to bring the share of clean energy to 100%. By 2030, Gabon plans to export 3 000 MW of hydropower to its neighbours. Efforts will also be made to improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution in such areas as construction and transportation. This new paradigm is to be ensconced in a law on sustainable development which will create a fund compensating the negative effects of development. This law was adopted in August 2014. The law has raised some concerns in civil society as to whether it will protect the territorial rights of third parties, particularly those of local and indigenous communities. The three pillars of Emerging Gabon: Strategic Plan to 2025 are: * Green Gabon: to develop the country‚Äôs natural resources in a sustainable manner, beginning with an inventory of 22 million ha of forest (85% of the land cover), 1 million ha * of arable land, 13 national parks and 800 km of coastline; * Industry Gabon: to develop local processing of raw materials and the export of high value-added products; * Services Gabon: to foster quality education and training, in order to turn Gabon into a regional leader in financial services, information and communication technologies, green growth, tertiary education and health. In order to adapt university curricula to market needs, existing universities will be modernized and a Cit√© verte de l‚Äô√©ducation et du savoir (Green City of Education and Knowledge) will be created in the heart of the country in Boou√©. Constructed using green materials and running on green energy, this complex will group a campus, research centres and modern housing. Foreign universities will be encouraged to set up campuses on site. = Botswana = It was Botswana which hosted the Summit for Sustainability in Africa in 2012. In 2013, Botswana initiated the development of a National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. A climate change policy will be developed first, followed by the strategy. The process has reportedly been highly consultative, with the participation of rural inhabitants. Botswana ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change on 11 November 2016.

Commissioned in 1929 for a scion of the Vanderbilt family and completed in 1932, it is the first successful residential commission of William Lescaze, and the first documented example in the United States of an International Style country house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history Sun Terrace is located in an isolated rural setting near the geographic center of New Hartford. It is set on a wooded ridge southwest of the town center, its east flank traversed by Stub Hollow Road. The house is set at the crest of the ridge, with expansive views to the west and southwest. It is a 1-1/2 story structure, with a frame of steel finished with cement stucco. It is an asymmetrical but roughly rectangular mass, with a flat roof, cantilevered decks, and a prominent curved wall section. It has grouped windows, including at some of its corners, and is generally devoid of exterior ornamentation. A spiral staircase provides access between the rooftop terrace and lower outside spaces. Interior features include a curved soapstone fireplace, and extensive use of fluorescent lighting, a technology in its infancy at the time of the house's construction. The house was commissioned from William Lescaze, a Swiss architect, in 1929 by Frederick Vanderbilt Field, a scion of the Vanderbilt family railroad fortune who was disinherited for his political views. Lescaze was at the time also designing the PSFS Building, the nation's first International style skyscraper. When completed, this house was the first country house of that style, being preceded in residential architecture only by the Lovell House of Richard Neutra.

The present ch√¢teau on the site was constructed from the mid-18th century; parts of the original castle remain.Ministry of Culture: Ch√¢teau History Humbert II de Thoire built the castle at Poncin in 1180. It was one of the favourite residences of the lords of Thoire-Villars, who kept their court of accounts there. In 1290,Charles-Laurent Salch, Dictionnaire des ch√¢teaux et des fortifications du Moyen √Çge en France, 1987, 1304 p. (), p. 921. it was rebuilt by Humbert IV de Thoire. On 19 October 1308,Marie-Claude Guigue, Topographie historique du d√©partement de l'Ain, Bourg-en-Bresse, Gromier Ain√©, 1873, p. 298. Humbert V, lord of Thoire and Villars, had it entirely remodelled and sold it, for 7,500 livres viennoises, in suzerainty to the lord de la Tour du Pin, Jean II de Viennois, dauphin of Viennois who returned it to him in fief lige. The rights passed in turn to the Counts of Savoy, recognised by acts of 16 October 1375 and 7 February 1385. On 29 October 1402, Humbert VII, last of the lords of Thoire-Villars, \\"heavy with years and troubles\\", sold the seigneurie of Poncin to Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, along with all of his lands in Bresse and Bugey, keeping the use of them until his death, which came on 7 May 1423. The castle stayed with the House of Savoy for a century and a half. Poncin was forsaken by the Dukes of Savoy, who seldom went there. It was, among others, included in the dowery of Anne de Chypre, widow of Louis, Duke of Savoy, and in that of Claudine de Bretagne, Viscountess de Bridiers (La Souterraine), widow of the Philip II, Duke of Savoy, dowager of Annecy, Ch√¢teauneuf in Valromey (Songieu), Poncin and Cerdon, who made a residence of it for a time. In April 1513,Samuel Guichenon, Histoire de Bresse et de Bugey. Partie 2., Jean Antoine Huguetan & Marc Antoine Ravaud, Lyon, 1650, p. 87Charles III, Duke of Savoy included it, with Cerdon and some other territories in Bugey, in the dowry of Philiberte de Savoie, his sister, Marquise of Gex and Fossan (Fossano), wife of Giuliano de' Medici, Duke of Nemours, Marquis of Suriane (Soragna) and Chazene. She died in 1524 without children. Having made her brother her heir, Poncin reverted to Savoy. On 7 November 1531, the lordship of Poncin and its castle, with that of Cerdon, was given to Charles de la Chambre, Baron of Meximieux and Sermoyer, in exchange for lands in Loyettes. On 18 September 1565, Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, took de la Chambre's lands at Poncin and Cerdon in exchange for the lordships of P√©rouges and Montr√©al, granting them in appanage to Philip, Duke of Nemours. The Dukes of Nemour, throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, made important modifications to the castle. Their descendants retained ownership until the 18th century. In 1601, the castle was entirely dismantled by Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron, on the orders of King Henri IV. In 1717, the land was given to Artus-Joseph de la Poype-Saint-Jullin who partially reconstructed. Around 1750, it passed to the Quinson family. Gaspard Roch de Quinson, wanting to install gardens, restored the terrasses for this purpose in 1760. The Quinsons still owned it at the time of the French Revolution. At the Revolution, the ch√¢teau was sacked and severely damaged. It remained abandoned for forty years, until a new mayor of Poncin, monsieur Jantet, bought it in 1831 to create a very beautiful English garden. The ch√¢teau then became the property of Joseph Savarin de Marestan who had been named conseiller de la pr√©fecture of l' Allier. he came from an old Bugey family, ennobled at the end of the 17th century, which had provided a succession of bodyguards and musketeers to the king and had, in 1815 been given the title Baron de Marestan.

He was mainly active in the fields of optics and solid-state physics.  Biography  Ben Nijboer was born as the eldest son of Roelof Nijboer and Janna Klamer. He grew up in Groningen where he visited the Rijks H.B.S; one of his teachers in mathematics was professor Dr O. Bottema from Delft. In 1932 at the age of sixteen he enrolled as a student in mathematics and physics at the Groningen University and after his bachelor's degree he majored in theoretical physics. His teachers were the future Nobel laureate in PhysicsFrits Zernike, dr. H. C. Brinkman and dr. R. Kronig. He graduated with distinction in 1937. On August 16, 1941, he married in Vries Ali Wildeman (1913-2017). From their marriage three daughters were born.  Work and research  After his graduation in 1937. Ben Nijboer spent a year in Bristol on a scholarship in the group of the future Nobel laureate Nevill Mott. He worked on a problem concerning semiconductors, by his own account \\"without much enthusiasm.\\" He came in contact with Jewish physicists who had emigrated from Germany, amongst whom Herbert Fr√∂hlich, Heinz London and Walter Heitler. He published his first article in 1937 (with C. J. Bouwkamp) in Physica: Bemerkungen √ºber Feldstarkeabh√§ngigkeit der dialektrischen Konstante und Kerneffekt . On return from England, he was drafted for military service, which was extended for an additional year as a consequence of the mobilisation. His conscription ended with the demobilisation in May 1940. His first paid job was being a teacher substitute in Groningen; he substituted for a teacher who was court-martialed to three months imprisonment for surrendering to the Germans before he shot his last bullet. = Doctoral research = In the summer of 1940, he was professor Zernike's assistant at the University of Groningen. In the context of his doctoral research, he explored a problem in theoretical optics: optical imaging in a microscope. The problem here is how to account for the effect of diffraction, combined with the geometric image defects due to the lens not being ideal. His teacher Zernike had developed a computational method for the case of spherical aberration and Nijboer managed to expand this for astigmatism and coma. Van Kampen, N.G. In memoriam Ben Nijboer. The results are known as the Nijboer-Zernike theory. In 1942 he acquired his Ph.D. with his dissertation The diffraction theory of aberrations. At the beginning of the 21st century, this theoretical work was revived as a consequence of advances in the chip lithography. In 2002, sixty years after Nijboers dissertation, his research was followed up with the Extended Nijboer Zernike (ENZ) Analysis & Aberration Retrieval by researchers at the Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven and the TU Delft. = Work in Princeton = A Fulbright scholarship enabled him in 1949 to work in Princeton, New Jersey (USA) at the Institute for Advanced Study for a year. He stayed there from September 1, 1949 to June 1, 1950 and met physicists like Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann, Abraham Pais, Rudolf Peierls and Freeman Dyson. He worked with George Placzek and L√©on Van Hove on the theory of neutron diffraction. The nuclear reactors, due to their large-scale production of neutrons, offered a new possibility for the study of solids and liquids, from which more information could be derived than from the X-ray scattering. An X-ray is a snapshot of the position of the atoms, while neutron scattering gives information about their movements. The interpretation of this information required a theory, which was developed by Placzek, Van Hove and Nijboer. Since then, this is the basis of this entire field of research.N.G.van Kampen, Levensbericht L.C.P. van Hove, in: Levensberichten en herdenkingen, 1992, Amsterdam, pp. 21-26 = Professor in Utrecht = In 1950 he was appointed by the University of Utrecht as a lecturer, with the teaching assignment of physics for chemistry students. In 1955 he studied for 6 months at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen. On May 27, 1955 he was appointed as professor of theoretical physics at Utrecht. His inaugural address was titled: Electrons and nucleons, the building blocks of matter . His closest colleagues were L√©on Van Hove and Nico van Kampen. In 1961, Van Hove left for CERN in Geneva and Ben Nijboer became his successor as professor-administrator of the Institute for Theoretical Physics. In 1964-1965 he worked for a year at the 'Argonne National Laboratory' in Chicago (USA). Together with his PhD students Ben Nijboer studied several subjects: various aspects of the construction of Crystal with F. W. De Wette and J.J.J. Kokkedee, the theory of Van der Waals equation with MJ Renne and K. Schram. On August 1, 1984 he retired from the university at the age of 68. Between 1937 and 1988 he published 54 scientific articles. In 1988 he published his last (with Th Ruygrok) in the Journal of Statistical Physics, titled On the energy per particle in three- and four- dimensional Wigner lattices '.

The algorithm expands on traditional Monte Carlo aggregation which operates by placing candidates together and selecting a subset at random. Each member of this subset is then asked for an opinion usually by filling out a form. A resultant opinion scalar can be generated by application of the Softmax function over the generated form set. However Monte Carlo Polarization goes a step further and attempts to construct the subset with the greatest standard deviation in response, referred to as the form data response eigen-norm vector scalar. http://omlc.org/~prahl/pubs/pdfx/ramella05a.pdf  Origin  The idea of Monte-Carlo Polarization was firstly invented in Athens, (more commonly known as Thens), by Errikos Babudopoulos in 1978, but was mostly used in research in the 1990s by famous mathematicians, such as Grigori Perelman, in proving the soul conjecture.  Inception  The origins of Monte Carlo polarization came from the following observations made in early 1922: # All opinions are valid # Some opinions are more valid than others Where the validity of an opinion is defined by the Emotional Intelligence Hierarchical metric space, using the obvious distance function.  Procedure  Given an array A of n elements with values or records A0 ... An‚àí1, sorted such that A0 ‚â§ ... ‚â§ An‚àí1, and target value T, the following subroutine uses Monte Carlo Polarization to find the index of T in A. # Set L to 0 and R to n ‚àí 1. # If L > R, the search terminates as unsuccessful. # Set m (the position of the middle element) to the floor (the largest previous integer) of (L + R) / 2. # If Am < T, set L to m + 1 and go to step 2. # If Am > T, set R to m ‚Äì 1 and go to step 2. # Now Am = T, the search is done; return m. Extract the emotional category isofunctor morphismvector and append this to the business manifesto. Note: This can be done in matrix form. This is left as an exercise for the reader. http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/pubs/matrix1_SICOMP.pdf  Other forms  Although this a very recent cutting-edge technique, it has seen a couple of variations upon the basic algorithm in the last couple of month, most notably JSON driven resolution methods. the basic idea is that instead of supplying the algorithm with n records, it is more useful to provide the algorithm with emotional meta-data to guide its search and improve its complexity beyond the usual logarithmic bounds and this by a factor of log(n)/2. It allows to select intermediate m values for the search index and skew them towards the wanted emotional value in the initial records.  Applications  The acceleration structures permitted by the Monte Carlo Polarization consist mainly in BVH and EBVH hierarchies. The logical subdivision of the kernel space leads to a logarithmic complexity, which is key to the scalability of the sentient analysis tools. A key application is the direct targeting of hidden nodes in neural networks. By applying a Monte Carlo Polarization filter to the input layer of the neural system, hidden layers will be systematically and dynamically selected based on user-defined characteristics. Only the specified layers and units will receive and process the data. Compared to standard drop- off methods, Monte Carlo Polarization is both more effective and more secure. Instead of having all nodes receiving the data and selecting output from a subset, the unnecessary nodes are directly filtered out. The result is a greatly increased level of accuracy and protection, as unreliable and malicious nodes will be left out, and a higher degree of efficiency. The neural system that is created using the aforementioned method is the basis for many Computer Vision projects. A specific highlight is the American web- animated sitcom \\"F is for Family\\".  Node.js support  Monte Carlo polarization can be easily deployed through Node.js. npm save install monte-carlo The library provides a basic implementation of Monte Carlo polarization, and shows the kernel space learning algorithm applied to session tokens.

Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma. Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma. The Brothers Halbertsma were three brothers born in the Frisian village of Grou towards the end of the 18th century, who played a role of crucial importance for the development of a written literature in the Western Frisian language.Breuker, p. 587.Hemminga, p. 56.Jensma, p. 197. These three brothers were: *Justus (or Joast) Hiddes Halbertsma (1789‚Äì1869).Breuker, p. 588. He studied theology in Amsterdam, and afterwards was a Mennonite minister in Bolsward and since 1822 in Deventer. He was a somewhat distant and cerebral author of short stories and poems. In his works ideas were more important than emotions. Besides his literary achievements he was also a scholar of linguistics, and with his (unfinished) Lexicon Frisicum he took the first step towards the composition of a dictionary of the Western Frisian language.Breuker, pp. 588‚Äì591.Wiersma, pp. 10‚Äì12. *Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma (1792‚Äì1852).Breuker, p. 591. He kept their father's bakery running after the untimely death of both their parents in 1809, later becoming an international merchant in dairy products (mainly butter and cheese). He lived in Grou his entire life, and wrote for the most part humorous rhymes and poems. Those were generally not of the same literary quality as his brothers' works, but became quite popular with the common man.Breuker, pp. 591‚Äì592.Wiersma, p. 9. *Eeltsje Hiddes Halbertsma (1797‚Äì1858).Breuker, p. 592. He studied medicine in Leiden and Heidelberg, and became a physician in Grou. His poems and short stories were much more emotional than those of his brother Justus, and his poetry in particular is still very much admired.Breuker, pp. 592‚Äì594.Wiersma, pp. 9‚Äì10. His oeuvre included the poem De Alde Friezen,Oppewal and Boorsma, pp. 90‚Äì93. which in 1875 became the national anthem of the Western Frisian people.Schroor, p. 2831. Apart from these three writers, who are usually meant when speaking of the 'Brothers Halbertsma', there was a fourth brother, who did not produce any literary work: *Binnert Hiddes Halbertsma (1795‚Äì1847). He took over the family bakery which had been kept going by his brother Tsjalling until he was old enough, and became a baker in Grou. Later he sold the bakery and started a new business trading in staves for wooden barrels. Under the leadership of his son Hidde Binnerts Halbertsma and his grandson Pieter Goslik HalbertsmaSchroor, p. 1125. this company evolved into Halbertsma Houtbewerking N.V., which was taken over in 1990, and since is part of the Faber Halbertsma Group.Schroor, p. 1124. The Brothers Halbertsma were all born in the house of their parents on Kowemerk (\\"Cow Market\\") street in Grou, a village in the central part of the Dutch province of Friesland.Wiersma, p. 7. They were sons of the baker and small-time merchantOppewal and Boorsma, p. 16. Hidde Joasts Halbertsma (1756‚Äì1809)Terpstra, p. 317. and his wife Ruerdtsje (or Riurtk) Tsjallings Binnerts (1767‚Äì1809).Wiersma, pp. 7‚Äì8. Two children who were born later died in early childhood,Terpstra, p. 316. the little boy in 1803, and the little girl in 1805. Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother. Ruerdtsje Binnerts was a scion of a prominent family in Grou. Her people were Mennonites, and although her husband had been raised a Calvinist, he converted after marrying her. From Justus' letters Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman, a loving mother, and a deeply religious person.Wiersma, p. 8. About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a mariner before his marriage. He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases. In 1784, he published a long Dutch-language poem under the title Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland (\\"Terrible Ice-drift and Flooding in Gelderland\\"). From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents were a family trait. The Brothers Halbertsma were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Justus was just twenty years of age, Tsjalling seventeen, Binnert thirteen, and Eeltsje only eleven.Wiersma, pp. 8‚Äì9. Later, Justus and Eeltsje started to write short fiction and poetry which can be considered folk literature.Wiersma, p. 11. As Justus acted as editor for Eeltsje's work for his entire life, their poetry and prose were strongly connected from the very beginning and for the most part published together.Breuker, p. 593. For that reason the linguist Foeke Buitenrust Hettema would later describe Halbertsma as the 'literary agent' of his brothers Eeltsje and Tsjalling. In 1822, Justus and Eeltsje's early works were collected under the title De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar (\\"Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket\\"), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story.Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37. This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young.Breuker, p. 597.Twerda, p. 297. This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's. Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time. A second, expanded edition of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages of a larger size.Terpstra, p. 313.Twerda, p. 298.Wiersma, pp. 5, 11. After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (De Noarger R√∫n oan Gabe Skroar), 1840 (Twigen √∫t in Alde Stamme), 1854 (Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen), and 1858 (De Jonkerboer and Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonst√™d).Brothers Halbertsma 1958, pp. 589‚Äì594. Eventually, contributions by the third brother, Tsjalling, were also inserted. After the death of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff.Breuker, p. 604.Wiersma, p. 5. In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of Rimen en Teltsjes (\\"Rhymes and Tales\\").Breuker, pp. 603‚Äì606. This work is now thought of as the national book of Western Frisian literature, and although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critics,Breuker, pp. 594‚Äì596. it is undeniable that Rimen en Teltsjes and its predecessor De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries. In 1949, author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave \\"the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected.\\"Wadman, p. 14. As of today Rimen en Teltsjes still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics.

He transferred to the 15th Hussars on their return from Corunna, serving with them during the Burdett riots of 1810 and the Luddite disturbances in the Midlands and Lancashire of the following years. In 1813 he exchanged as a captain to the 21st Light Dragoons at the Cape, where he acted as aide-de-camp to the newly appointed governor, Lord Charles Somerset. Whilst stationed there he commanded a military detachment, made up of volunteers from regiments at the Cape, which occupied the remote desert island of Tristan da Cunha soon after the arrival of the Emperor Napoleon on Saint Helena and also fought a duel with the transexual army surgeon James Barry. He rose through the ranks to lieutenant (17 May 1810) and captain (5 November 1812). In 1817, he went with his regiment to India, serving with a squadron employed as a field force in Cuttack, on the frontiers of Orissa and Bihar, during the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817‚Äì19. The 21st Dragoons (except a detachment on Saint Helena) were disbanded in England in May 1819 and Clo√´t√© was placed on half- pay. In 1820, he was occupied as deputy-assistant quartermaster-general, in superintending the landing and settling of a large body of government immigrants, known as 1820 Settlers, on the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony. In 1822 he was sent home with important despatches, made brevet major on 21 November 1822, and appointed town-major of Cape Town, a post he held until 1840.

In 1840 he was appointed deputy quartermaster-general at the Cape, and retained the post until 1854, by which time he had been promoted Colonel (11 November 1851). In 1842, he was sent with reinforcements from Cape Town to relieve a small force under Captain Smith of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot, which was besieged by insurgent Boers near Port Natal (now Durban), when his firm action not only prevented battle, but prepared the way for permanent settlement of the subsequent colony of Natal. He was quartermaster-general in the Xhosa Wars of 1846, was mentioned in despatches, and in 1848 made C.B. He was chief of the staff with the army in the field in the Kaffir war of 1851‚Äì3, including the operations in the Basuto country, and at the Battle of Berea, where he commanded a division.

The site was initially excavated in 2010 by a joint team of the Middle Mekong Archaeological Project and the Department of Heritage of Laos. Perhaps most important is the site's status as one of the stone jar burial sites from iron age Laos, the most famous of which is the Plain of Jars. Test excavations in 2010 included two trenches. Finds from trench B included a circular stone disk, possibly made of limestone or a similar material. The initial reports listed the possibility that the disk represented a jar covering or grave marker similar to those found on the Plain of Jars. The B trench also included the remains of four pots, one of which was directly under the discovered disk and accompanied by loose remains. The single datable piece of material that has thus far been recorded was from the lowermost portion of the excavation and gave a date of c. 13,000, which could indicate an earlier site not recorded. The site also included a Buddhist painting on the cave walls that villagers believed was from the 1950s.  Looting  The interior has been almost entirely destroyed by looters, though initial reports suggested the damage was not critical. When the archaeologists returned in 2013, they characterized the site as almost entirely destroyed.

She was raised in Monto, Queensland, and in Rockhampton, where she also learned to play cricket. In November 2009, Hill made her debut for Queensland Fire. In 2011, she moved to the Sunshine Coast to pursue a career in professional cricket. Injury prevented Hill from having much of an impact on the 2011‚Äì12 Women's National Cricket League season. The following summer, she had limited opportunities due to competition from other pace bowlers, but still played five of the eight WNCL matches and nine of the 12 T20s. In 2013‚Äì14, she enjoyed more success, taking wickets in both series at averages of 29.33 and 18.42 respectively. Hill was a member of the Brisbane Heat squad since its inaugural WBBL01 season (2015‚Äì16). A schoolteacher by profession, Hill worked at St Ursula's College, Yeppoon, while living in Rockhampton, and as of 2015 was the Year 10 co-ordinator at Unity College, Caloundra. In 2014, she took up professional sprinting, and, in her debut performance, won the 100m Ladies Gift at the 33rd annual Ipswich Winter Carnival. In 2015, she competed in Australia's premiere handicap sprint, the Stawell Gift. In April 2018 she made the decision to join her then partner (now wife), Lauren Winfield, in England and on arrival took the decision to change sports to rugby league - a game she had not played since junior level. Despite this lack of experience she was given a contract by Leeds Rhinos Women and was an integral member of the Leeds squad that won the 2018 Challenge Cup and the League Leaders Shield in the 2018 Women's Super League. Hill succeeded Lois Forsell as captain of the Rhinos for the 2019 season and was named as the 2019 Telegraph Woman of Steel at the Super League end of season awards on 6 October 2019. In February 2020 Hill signed a short term contract to play for Sydney Roosters in the 2020 NRL Nines before rejoining the Rhinos for the 2020 Women's Super League.

In southeastern Russia, during years of outbreaks S. jacobsoni often attacks healthy trees along forest edges or standing alone along roads and in fields and gardens, making it an important pest for elm trees there. Reported hosts include Ulmus davidiana, Ulmus japonica, Ulmus laciniata, Ulmus propinqua, Carpinus betulus, and Pyrus ussuriensis.  Description  Body length is 3‚Äì5 mm long. The general color is dark-brown and shining, with lighter legs, elytra and antennae. The forehead of males is depressed and red hair covers its edges, which are curled toward the middle of the forehead. Female forehead is convex, bearing a medium longitudinal groove. Longitudinal wrinkle near the mouth and vertex punctured in both sexes. The pronotum is somewhat longer than wide (7:6 ratio). It is covered with coarse punctures that are larger at the edges, particularly at its anterior. The length of the elytra is almost equal to their combined width. The elytra have longitudinal grooves made of large round punctures. The spaces between these grooves contain rows of smaller punctures, which are irregular on the first two inter-groove spaces, but form regular single lines on the others. The abdomen is covered with short reddish hairs, which are denser on the first two and the last segments. The abdomen of males is concave toward the rear, with a steep depression on the second abdominal sternite, and bearing a horizontally extended finger-shaped tubercle on the middle of the posterior edge of the second abdominal sternite. This structure distinguishes it from other Russian Scolytus species. Males also have bumps on the 3rd and 4th abdominal sternites, which females lack.  Life cycle  The usual flight period is June‚ÄìJuly in southeastern Russia. The female bores a vertical egg gallery (5‚Äì7 cm in length and up to 2.5 mm of diameter) below the bark of the trunk or thick branches of declining elms, either standing or fallen, including elms burned by grass fires, and also on healthy elms when beetle population is high or if the elms stand a short while away from the forest. Eggs are laid on the sides of this gallery on the inner surface of the bark. Long galleries contain about a hundred eggs. Upon hatching, larvae bore their own galleries perpendicularly from the egg galleries, close to one another, often touching adjacent larval galleries, but rarely intersecting. Larvae pupate in mid‚ÄìJuly. Adults emerge in late July and early August. Soon after emerging, adults feed on thin young branches of elms, chew the thin bark and part of the sapwood, thus making grooves that run along or around these branches. There is usually a single generation per year. Sometimes there is a second generation, which flies in July‚ÄìAugust, and lay eggs in mid‚ÄìAugust. Their larvae develop in September, and reach near full larval maturity prior to the winter. Larvae overwinter. Several species of Chalcidoidea parasitoids use S. jacobsoni larvae as their host.  Distribution  This species has been reported from southeastern Russia (Primorsky Krai province and Sakhalin island), northeastern China (Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces), and Japan. The only North American report is with a single S. jacobsoni specimen caught in the wild in 2009 in the Vernon landfill in southern British Columbia, Canada, with a Lindgren funnel trap (multiple black funnels aligned vertically to mimic a tree trunk, with a collection vial at the base, to collect insects associated with trees) baited with a Scolytus multistriatus pheromones lure and an ultra high release ethanol lure. More traps were deployed in and around this area the following years but this species was never caught again.

In February 1871 he was elected to the post-defeat National Assembly where he supported the Legitimist faction. Subsequently, he stood on three successive occasions for election to the Senate (upper house), but without success.  Biography  Francisque-Marie- Joseph Ramey was born in the Ch√¢teau de la Bastie d'Urf√© at Saint-√âtienne-le- Molard, in the Loire department. He came from a political family. His grandfather, Marie-Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Ramey de Sugny, had been briefly imprisoned during the Terror, but had survived long enough to be released following the fall of Robespierre. Francisque-Marie-Joseph Ramey de Sugny was elected to the National Assembly on 8 February 1871, representing his natal department in the legislature. Reflecting the rural traditionalism of his region, he belonged to the catholic monarchist faction in the chamber, backing the restoration of a monarchy and the dismissal of the republican President Thiers, and opposing the Constitutional Laws which established the Third Republic and the Wallon amendment. He was also Conseiller g√©n√©ral of the Canton of Saint-Just-en-Chevalet between 1852 and 1880, and then again between 1887 and 1904. Between 1880 and 1887 the position was held by a republican. His term in the National Assembly ended in 1876 and in the election of 30 January 1876 he was a candidate for the department, but he lost out narrowly to another (moderate) republican, Lucien Arbel. The constitutional crisis of May 1877 triggered another general election. Ramey de Sugny was a candidate again, but again without success. The margin of his defeat at his third attempt to gain election to the Senate, in 1879, was greater still.

History  The temple is in Thukkachi village, on the banks of the Arasalar River, east of Kumbakonam. The village derives its name from Durga Achi, after the goddess Durga seen in the temple, which over time got corrupted to become Thukkachi. The original temple was built by Rajendra Chola I (ruled between 1014-1044 CE). Legend says that Vikrama Chola suffered from vitiligo and visited many temples to pray for respite from the disease. Lord Abathsahayeswarar (Shiva) visited him in his dream when he was camping near Thukkachi, and asked him to worship him for 48 days. The king was completely cured in due course and subsequently ordered the expansion of the temple.

Founded as the New-York Petroleum Exchange, in 1884 the exchange reported oil clearances amounting to 2,373,582,000 barrels, averaging 7,782,000 barrels per day. That year the exchange also began trading in stocks, bonds, and other securities. The institution merged with the competing exchange New-York Mining and National Petroleum Exchange on February 28, 1885, forming the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange. History By December 1883, the New York Times wrote that \\"much interest\\" was being shown in a proposed consolidation between the competing New-York Petroleum Exchange and the New-York Mining Stock and National Petroleum Exchange. The matter was voted on by both exchange members on December 22, 1883. At the vote, members of the New-York Mining Stock and National Petroleum Exchange largely favored consolidation. However, the New-York Petroleum Exchange saw 269 in favor and 250 against, out of a total membership of around 688. Afterwards, a joint committee of three members from each Exchange was proposed, for the drafting of a new constitution and by-laws prior to any consolidation. On March 11, 1884, it was reported that the governing board of the New-York Mining Stock and National Petroleum Exchange had voted against consolidation 29 to 2. One of the reasons given was that the National Exchange treasury contained $204,000, while the New-York Petroleum Exchange only had $74,570. However, a resolution was passed that members of the New-York Petroleum Exchange could join the National Exchange. The Times reported on August 8, 1884 that \\"An animated meeting of the New-York Petroleum Exchange was held yesterday afternoon for the purpose of considering the subject of amending the constitution of that Exchange so as to permit the members to trade in stocks, bonds, and other securities.\\" On September 24, 1884, the Governing Committee of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) sent notices to Stock Exchange members who were also New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board members, stating that according to Stock Exchange rules, membership could not be retained in both. At a meeting held on December 10, 1884, the New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board amended its constitution. The amendment limited membership to 2,000, with members above an initial 1,700 required to pay a $2,000 initiation fee. In late December 1884, the president of the New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board L. H. Smith issued key facts. Among them, membership was listed at 1,004 at the time, with plans to increase the building fund to potentially build a building to accommodate the exchange. For 1884, the exchange reported oil clearances amounting to 2,373,582,000 barrels, averaging 7,782,000 barrels per day. On February 3, 1885, the Governing Committee of the exchange voted not to radically remodel their building at Broad-street. The competing exchange New-York Mining and National Petroleum Exchange merged with the New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board on February 28, 1885.

The title traces its origin from the times of the Old Pahang Sultanate, and was historically known as Maharaja Indera Pahlawan. The territory under his jurisdiction is Chenor, and land between the Bera and Kuala Luit (corresponding to most of Maran constituency, and some parts of Bera constituency). During the reign of Raja Bendahara Tun Ali, the title was renamed 'Orang Kaya Indera Pahlawan', with the added prefixes 'Orang Kaya'. The title is the third most influential among the four major chiefs, since his territory is the second most closer to the capital after Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar . Role Historically, the Orang Kaya Indera Pahlawan was part of the Orang Besar Berempat ('four major chiefs') that wielded very wide powers in Pahang. They had the authority to impose taxation and to decide all criminal and civil cases except those which involved capital punishment. In fact, their power was limited only by the capacity of the monarch to restrain them, and it varied according to their proximity to Pekan, the further from the court, the greater their authority. They were obliged to appear at Pekan once a year to menjunjung duli ('pay homage'). They had to pay a form of tribute called banchi to the monarch. Their districts were subject to serahan; the obligation to buy, at exorbitant prices, goods the monopoly for the sale of which, in certain localities the ruler was in the habit of granting to one of his favourites. In the month of Muharram. they appeared at court with offerings. In the time of war they were required to take the field with men, arms and food. The installation of the monarch was incomplete unless the Orang Besar Berempat assisted thereat. The Pahang constitutional theory was that the Orang Besar Berempat and, to a lesser degree, the other chiefs were the foundation upon which the monarch's authority rested. During the time of Johor Empire, the four major chiefs gave allegiance to the Bendahara as representing the Sultan, but, in time, the sovereign being to them a nebulous figure, their allegiance tended to become more and more a matter of loyalty to the Bendahara personally. This became formally sealed with the establishment of Pahang Kingdom in the late 18th century. Succession The titles of the Orang Besar Berempat were hereditary. When a chief died, his successor, before approval of his appointment, was required to make a ceremonial offering to the monarch. This usually took the shape of gold-hilted kris, but other forms of offering were permissible. If the eldest son of a deceased chief were unfitted for the succession, it was proper to appoint a younger son, a brother, or a nephew to the chieftaincy. Genealogical tree The present family of Orang Kaya Indera Pahlawan claim matrilineal descent from a Minangkabau, To' Gemok who came to Pahang following the route by Ulu Serting, Penarik and Bera, and founded a settlement in Chenor. The first mention in records of this chieftaincy was in 1740 when Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah summoned the chief to Pekan. The original territory of the Chenor fief was the land extending from the Bera to Kuala Luit. The Chenor chiefs are related to the royal family of Pahang through Tun Ismail, who is the second son of Tun Ali by his wife Cik Wan Ngah.

They were the primary armament of the Soviet Union's first cruisers built after the Russian Civil War. History The 180mm Pattern 1931-1933 weren't a single model of gun, but instead were a family of related guns, either built from converted /50 Pattern 1905 guns which were relined down to or they were newly built guns. The original guns were constructed of a three piece A tube, reinforced by two layers of outer tubes and a jacket. The lengths of these guns varied between 56-60 calibers and their weights varied, but their performance was similar. :The main variants of gun and mount were: :* 180mm/60 B-1-K Pattern 1931 - Naval guns converted from earlier 203mm guns in MK-1-180 single turrets. :* 180mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 - Newly built naval guns in MK-3-180 triple turrets. :* 180mm/56 Pattern 1933 - Coastal artillery built from converted 203mm guns in open MO-8-180 or MO-1-180 single mounts and MB-2-180 twin turrets. :* 180mm/56 Pattern 1933 - Railway artillery converted from earlier 203mm guns on TM-1-180, single gun, shielded mounts. Naval Use 180mm/60 B-1-K Pattern 1931 - In 1927 work on the former Imperial Russian Navy Admiral Nakhimov-class cruiser Krasnyi Kavkaz was restarted after being halted in 1917 following the October Revolution. It had been planned to arm the Krasnyi Kavkaz with eight 203mm guns in double turrets, but it was found impossible to mount this much armament on such a small and lightly constructed hull. Instead four smaller caliber 180mm/60 B-1-K Pattern 1931 guns were mounted in single turrets. Early testing found that the muzzle velocity for these guns was abnormally high which reduced barrel life to only 55-70 rounds, so the guns were derated and smaller propellant charges were used. 180mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 - Since the pattern 1931 wasn't satisfactory a new gun design with a lower muzzle velocity and shorter barrel length designated the 180 mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 was produced. Early prototypes were of built-up construction, but in 1932 the technology for producing loose liners was purchased from the Italian firm of Ansaldo. Later 180 mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 guns were constructed of a loose liner, A tube, jacket and breech ring. The 180 mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 were manufactured with two different styles of liners, one had shallow rifling and the other had deep rifling, the two liners were not interchangeable and required different ammunition. The shallow rifled liners still only had a life of 55-70 rounds, but the deeply rifled liners had a life of 320 rounds. In 1933 the Soviets purchased plans for the contemporary Raimondo Montecuccoli- class light cruisers from the Italian firm of Ansaldo. This new class of cruisers was known as the Kirov-class and were armed with nine 180mm/57 B-1-P Pattern 1932 (7.1 in) guns in three MK-3-180 triple turrets. Like their Italian contemporaries the Kirov-class cruisers suffered many of the same design flaws. These included abnormally high muzzle velocity and poor barrel life. Shot dispersion due to the guns being mounted too closely together on a common cradle and crowded turrets which hampered crew efficiency, ammunition handling and rate of fire. Coastal Artillery 180mm/56 Pattern 1933 - Coastal artillery built from converted 203mm guns. The barrels for these guns were shortened from the original 60 calibers to 56 calibers and they were mounted on open MO-8-180 or MO-1-180 single mounts and MB-2-180 twin turrets. Ballistic performance was similar to the 180mm/60 B-1-K Pattern 1931, these guns also had short barrel lives and reduced charges were used to prolong barrel life. These guns were deployed in defensive emplacements along the Pacific, Arctic, Baltic and Black Sea coasts. Railway Artillery 180mm/56 Pattern 1933 - Railway artillery built from converted 203mm guns. The barrels for these guns were shortened from the original 60 calibers to 56 calibers and they were mounted on TM-1-180, single gun, shielded mounts. Ballistic performance was similar to the 180mm/60 B-1-K Pattern 1931, these guns also had short barrel lives and reduced charges were used to prolong barrel life.

With a market share of 9%, Rijk Zwaan is the number four vegetable breeding company worldwide. The family-owned company breeds over 25 different types of vegetables, including lettuce, tomato, cucumber, bell pepper and cabbage. History =Foundation and growth= The founder of the company, Mr Rijk Zwaan, came from a family of seed growers and seed traders living in the Dutch town of Enkhuizen, which evolved into a centre for the seed production industry in the late nineteenth century. In 1924 Zwaan opened a shop selling seeds on the street called Zwaanshals in Rotterdam. In order to select plants himself and hence gain more control over the seed quality, he arranged for his own seed production and breeding facilities to be built in Bergschenhoek in 1932. In the period following the Second World War, there was explosive growth in the horticulture sector. Westland, Zwaan‚Äôs key sales area in the west of the Netherlands, became an important region for the production of vegetables in greenhouses. The company grew rapidly in the second half of the 20th century and the headquarters were moved to De Lier in Westland in 1970. In 1964 the first foreign subsidiary was set up, in Germany. From 1980 onwards the international market became increasingly important for the company and the number of facilities outside the Netherlands grew. =Management buyout= In 1986 the Zwaan family decided to sell their shares in the company to BP Nutrition because of a lack of successor within the family. BP Nutrition invested in Rijk Zwaan for the first two years, but the multinational then changed its strategy and put the organisation up for sale in 1989. The board of directors, employees and even customers vigorously opposed sale of the business to parties that wanted to dismantle or merge the breeding company. They wanted the company to remain intact and independent. With financial support from employees and the Cebeco-Handelsraad agricultural and horticultural cooperative, the board of directors succeeded in buying the company from BP Nutrition. Since the 1990s, the company‚Äôs progress has been characterised by internationalisation and new technology. In 1989 the organisation became a shareholder in biotechnology company Keygene. In 2004 the breeding company set up a second research facility in Fijnaart. Since 1989, Zwaan has opened an average of one new facility a year outside of the Netherlands. Products The Rijk Zwaan product portfolio mainly comprises fruit vegetables, leafy crops, root crops and cabbage types. Varieties of said crops are selected based on traits including flavour and texture, consistency, production value and health and nutritional values. The company breeds vegetables and sells the seeds produced from them. =Developing new varieties= The breeding of vegetable varieties is focused on crossing plants with usable traits and selecting the best offspring. To do this, the breeders make use of the diversity that nature has to offer in combination with market knowledge and modern technology. Much of the research in vegetable breeding is aimed at selecting offspring more precisely and working more efficiently. This facilitates the faster development of varieties with the traits demanded by the vegetable chain (growers, processors, traders and consumers) such as resistances. The growing conditions and sales markets for vegetables differ widely around the world, which makes it necessary to develop varieties that are specifically suitable for particular local production conditions and market situations. Rijk Zwaan does not develop varieties that are governed by regulations for genetically modified organisms (GMOs). =Seed production and logistics= Vegetable seeds are a natural product. They must be produced under ideal conditions and quality control is essential. The seeds that Rijk Zwaan produces around the world are shipped to the Netherlands for cleaning and checks of their purity, variety authenticity, seedborne diseases and germination vigour. Some seeds are also subjected to extra treatment, such as encapsulation - to make them easier to sow - or a coating against germination diseases. =Support and sales= The company sells seeds and shares its knowledge with customers. To assess whether crops are suitable for local conditions, the varieties are trialled in practice by growers around the world. By sharing knowledge about production techniques and product sales, Rijk Zwaan helps growers to improve their yields. This is especially the case for small, local growers in countries where vegetable production is still in its infancy. When advising growers, Rijk Zwaan collaborates with governments, NGOs and other (local) partners. The company also exchanges information with other partners in the vegetable chain, such as retailers, food manufacturing companies, vegetable processing companies and restaurants.

Niveo-aeolian or cryo-aeolian deposition is the process by which fine-grained sediments are transported by wind and deposited on or mixed with snow or ice. The wind sweeps the snow and sand grains into aeolian forms such as ripples, and further sorts the snow and ice grains into distinct layers When snow melts or sublimates, the sediments are redeposited onto the surface below., forming patterns known as denivation features. Niveo-aeolian deposition is most widespread in polar climates, but may be found anywhere that is at least seasonally below freezing. In most places, much or all of the snow in these niveo-aeolian deposits melts in the spring or summer. However, \\"perennial\\" niveo-aeolian deposits have been observed in Antarctica's Victoria Valley. Initially, after the wind has deposited it, the surface of a niveo-aeolian deposit typically consists of a rippled bedform of mixed sand and snow. Beneath the surface, the deposits commonly consist of alternating layers of snow and sediment. These layers may be up to thick. However, sometimes the sediment and snow are intermingled without distinct layers. Niveo-aeolian deposition plays an important role in soil transport in cold climates, such as the formation of loess soils in Alaska through the deposition of windblown silt. Further south, in coastal landscapes of the Laurentian Great Lakes, niveo-aeolian deposition facilitates the transport of sand into lakes and marshes, thus enhancing the sand signal. The prolonged denivation process also creates a source of fresh water, in the otherwise extremely dry dune and beach environment, for months after all surface snow has melted. Cryo-aeolian deposition has been proposed as one explanation for certain landforms on the planet Mars. In particular, denivation has been suggested as a cause of apparent meltwater fans in Kaiser Crater. Proposed terrestrial analogs for these Martian landscapes include the Victoria Valley in Antarctica and the Great Kobuk Sand Dunes in Alaska.  Denivation  A sand-covered section of Lake Michigan shelf ice, showing stress cracks and meltwater fan from denivation. During denivation, any outer snow melts first, so that the outer surface of the remaining niveo-aeolian deposit consists of sand. This surface sand exhibits tensional surface cracks due to the continued melting of the underlying snow. Denivation features may take several forms, including \\"snow ramparts\\" formed by slumping down a dune or hill slope, thermokarstic sinkholes caused by melting below the surface, hummocks caused by sediment draped over the remaining ice, spongy surfaces caused by the collapse of the sand and snow layers, and debris flows caused by meltwater. Smaller features include pellets, cracks, and dimples. Denivation features typically disrupt aeolian patterns only temporarily. After all the snow or ice has melted or sublimated, continued wind action gradually destroys them.

The municipality was established on 1 January 2017 by merger of the former communes of Saint-Lupicin (the seat) and Cuttura.Arr√™t√© pr√©fectoral 4 July 2016  Geography  Coteaux du Lizon is a little town located in the Parc naturel r√©gional du Haut-Jura in Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√©, Eastern France. The city is cut in two parts by the narrow but deep valley of the Lizon, a small river about 7 km long that cuts a little canyon in the vicinity of Coteaux du Lizon. The commune also has two vast coombs, one of which is towards the hamlet of \\"Grande-Maison\\" on the heights of the commune at the foot of the Roche d'Antre, which has climatic characteristics close to those of the coombs of la Br√©vine or Mouthe. Coteaux du Lizon is surrounded by the Roche d'Antre massif to the west and by the little mountains on which Avignon-l√®s-Saint- Claude is situated to the east. Although it is in the Haut-Jura, none of the peaks in the territory of the municipality exceeds 1000 m, but nevertheless, at 5 km to the south, there is the Cr√™t de Surmontant, which peaks at 1065 m. Note that the maximum altitude of its canton is near Lamoura at the Cr√™t Pela, culminating at 1495m. The Lizon is the main watercourse crossing the commune. There is also the Cuttura dam, a small water reserve located between Cuttura and Saint-Lupicin. There are many small mountain streams in the municipality.  Climate  Due to its altitude, Coteaux du Lizon features a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen : Dfb), bordering on an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen : Cfb). High precipitations are present all the year, which are a particularity of Coteaux du Lizon's climate. Only two seasons are long : winter and summer. Summers are very warm, with many thunderstorms, sometimes with hail and winters are moderately cold and very snowy from the altitude point of view. The rain, which is abundant and evenly distributed throughout the year, can be absent for a long time, the most recent example (which took place in 2020) is a rain-free period that lasted from March 11 to April 20 (so that's 41 days in a row without rain). This is certainly the longest period without rain ever seen in Coteaux-du-Lizon. Clairvaux-les-Lacs is the village which has the nearest climate with Coteaux du Lizon (except for the snowfall and the snow cover). The heat record is 40.1 ¬∞C, recorded on July 25, 2019. The cold record is estimated at -30.1 ¬∞C on February 10, 1956, so the difference between these two absolute records is 71 ¬∞C (a little reminder : the largest difference between two records in the world is in Verkhoyansk, Siberia and its 105 ¬∞C difference).

Plot Doug Sanborn (Ralph Bellamy) runs a small charter company based at a regional airport. His daughter, Kitty (Suzanne Pleshette), a young female pilot wants to be in the Unlimited class at the air races but her male friends stymie her ambitions. Her former boyfriend Taff Malloy (James Farentino) has recently come back from the US Navy and a stint as a pilot in Vietnam. Now married to Lisa (Juliet Mills), a tragic accident on their honeymoon, results in his wife's death. With Lisa's recent death, Kitty tries to console Taff but he is distraught and rebuffs her. In frustration, she seeks out Taff's rival, bad-boy pilot Hal Random (Jeremy Slate) and runs off with him. When her father and other male friends find out about the affair, they berate Kitty and make her feel so bad she wants to kill herself. Flying her North American P-51 Mustang racing aircraft with the intention of crashing it, Kitty is followed by Taff in his Grumman F8F Bearcat, who tries to talk her out of it. His soothing words finally make an impression and help to bring Kitty back safely.

Ficus carica played many important roles in history and has become a symbol in many different cultures and religions.  Origins of cultivation and domestication  The origin of the common fig is debated.Mordechai, Kislev E.; Anat Hartmann,; Ofer Bar-Yosef 2006 Early Domesticated Fig in the Jordan Valley. Science. 312(5778): 1372-1374 Some believe it to be indigenous to Western Asia and then spread by human activity throughout the Mediterranean.Siddiq, Muhammad. 2012. Tropically al and Subtropical Fruits: Postharvest Physiology, Processing and Packaging. Figs: 455-477 Despite uncertainty about its geographic origins, most archaeobotanists agree that the domestication of the fig tree occurred around 6500 years ago in the Near East. Scholars agree that the domestication of the fig tree came long before the domestication of other fruit crops like grapes, olives, and dates. Researchers have found significant evidence of fig cultivation at many different late Neolithic and Neolithic sites along with Bronze Age, Assyrian, and Egyptian sites.Janick, J. 2005. The Origins of Fruits, Fruit Growing, and Fruit Breeding: 18-20 But evidence for the first cultivation of figs has been found in the Lower Jordan Valley in an early Neolithic village known as Gilgal 1.Hooper, Rowan. 2006. Figs Came First, New Scientist 190(2555): 1 This evidence dates back to the 12th millennium BP and suggests that the widespread cultivation of figs pre-dated the domestication of cereal crops by almost one thousand years. Ficus carica specimens made ideal candidates for domestication because they are one of the most easily proliferated of all fruit trees. By simply planting a seed, or by cutting off either a limb of the fig tree or a part the fruit itself may result in an entirely new individual tree.Eisen, Gustav. 1901. The Fig: Its History, Culture, and Curing, With Descriptive Catalog of the Known Varieties of Fig The ability to produce many more plants in such a straightforward manner may have appealed to the early consumers of figs, as would the fruit's ability to withstand harsh, varying temperatures.Tous, J. and Louise Ferguson.1996. Mediterranean Fruits: 416-430 Along with their rigidity, Ficus carica trees produce 3 crops throughout the year, so the yield from these plants would be significantly worth the effort put into growing them. Figs also contain a large amount of sugar. Perhaps the sweetness of these fruits also played a role in their domestication, as it would have made them more desirable to the human palate. During the domestication of fig trees, humans compromised the characteristics of the fruit and promoted evolutionary divergence from the wild ancestor of the plant. Intuitively, those growing the figs chose to let the plants with the most desirable characteristics reproduce. In this case, plants were selected towards an increase in the size of the overall fruit. Figs with various different flesh colors were also chosen so that there are now white-, amber-, red-, and purple-colored figs. The plants that produced the sweetest fruit were also selected, increasing the sugar content of the domesticated fig versus the wild fig. Those plants that produced fruits that did not split during maturation and harvest were considered ideal because they produced a higher, usable, crop yield with more diverse uses, being less fragile and easier to handle.  Smyrna figs  Smyrna figs need to be pollinated by a fig wasp, in contrast to Ficus carica, which reproduce without pollination. Figs and fig wasps have had a symbiotic relationship throughout history.Leong, B.M. 1891. Fig Caprification or The Setting of the Fruit: 1-33 The fig wasps need the figs in order to reproduce, while the figs rely on the wasps to aid them in their pollination.Denham, Tim. 2007. Early fig domestication, or gathering of wild parthenocarpic figs? Antiquity. 81(312): 457-461. Without pollination the fig will fall off of the tree without producing fruit. To secure their crop, fig farmers around the Mediterranean help in the caprification (the process of fig pollination). They aid this process by buying male figs from different regions that are already filled with fig wasps. They then string these figs together and hang them in their trees. When the fig wasps emerge, they pollinate the figs and allow them to mature. In this way, figs are reliant on human activities, which is representative of their domestication. Without human interference, they would not likely reach maturity. In the years prior to the 1900s, a problem arose for those who grew Smyrna figs outside of the Mediterranean. Fig wasps were only found in a very small portion of the world and there was no other known way to pollinate figs. In artificial caprification, the maturation of the figs is completely reliant on humans; fig wasps are entirely absent. Male figs are broken open, releasing their pollen. Toothpicks dusted with this pollen is then poked them into female figs, thus artificially pollinating them and allowing them to reach maturity. This process of artificial caprification was vital to the culture of figs in California until fig wasps were eventually imported into the state from Turkey. In this case, without the close interaction with humans, these figs would have never succeeded in this part of the world.  Historical significance  Fig trees and fig fruits have many different historical and cultural references. In art, fig leaves have been used to cover the sexual characteristics of muse, forming a representation of modesty and vulnerability. There are also many references to figs within the Bible. One example being, when Adam and Eve dress themselves with fig leaves after eating the forbidden fruit. Perhaps this suggesting that the leaves serve as some form of protection. They are also present in different aspects of Greek mythology. They are, for example, known as the sacred tree to the god Dionysus, god of wine and fertility. They appear within a portion of the Qur'an that is titled ‚ÄúThe Fig‚Äù in Arabic. It can also be found in another section of the Qur'an, in which the fig is referred to as ‚Äúa fruit that descended from paradise.‚Äù In Rome, figs were thought to represent femininity, due to the appearance of the fleshy inside of the fruit. In this society, figs were meant as a way of presenting weakness. In the sense, they appeared in a much more negative light than in other cultural contexts.  Dispersal  As time went on, figs were spread from their indigenous region of Western Asia, and their comfortable home in the Mediterranean, throughout many other places around the world (of course, despite their increasing ability to grow in many different regions, the Mediterranean still remains the ideal location for the raising of figs). They migrated into Afghanistan and expanded to southern Germany and the Canary Islands. They made their way to England and then China, and eventually to Japan, South Africa, India, Australia, the United States (California to be more specific.), and of course many other places around the globe. Figs soon found themselves woven into the economy of many different countries. The production, import, and export of figs is vital in some regions. For example, in 2010, Turkey was the number one exporter and producer of figs in the world, producing around 24% of the world's supply and exporting around 254, 838 metric tons. Egypt was the second largest producer, producing around 184,972 metric tons. Austria trailed Turkey as the second largest exporter, exporting somewhere near 6,131 metric tons. In 2009, France, Austria, and Germany were the top 3 importers of figs, with Canada trailing as number 4. The demand for figs has remained steady for many years and it looks as though it will stay that way for a while, or perhaps even increase, which would of course be good news for the countries that lead in the fig trade.  Modern uses  There are many different ways that people continue to consume fig fruits today. The most common forms of consumption are either dried, sliced, and then eaten, or dried and then made into a sticky paste which can then be used in a variety of different products. This is mostly because it is extremely hard to keep fresh figs, as they spoil within a very short amount of time. So, more often than not, if figs are to be consumed fresh then they must be eaten in the place which they are grown because they are unable to make the journey of exportation. It is for this reason that, for most of their history, around 95% of all the figs produced in the world were destined to be dried. However, despite the difficulties that they pose, the demand for fresh figs has recently greatly increased. From 2002 to 2006, the demand for fresh figs increased four-fold. Besides dried or fresh, figs are also sometimes canned and used in pastries and, although it is not commonly known, they can even be fermented and distilled into alcohol. It many places in the world, it is common to grind up the figs that either do not meet standards, or rot before they can be consumed, in order to make a sort of animal feed.

The novel is a psychological horror and campus novel , which follows the experience of a university president, M.R. Neukirchen, \\"haunted by her secret past as the child of a poor, mentally ill religious fanatic who tried to drown her in a riverside mudflat\\".  Development and context  Oates says that the novel started as a \\"dream vision\\" describing it as \\"I saw a woman sitting at a large table wearing inappropriate, very heavy makeup that had dried, like mud, and was darker than her skin.\\" Oates wrote the novel in response to the dream, and during a period that was hard for Oates: her husband died while she was drafting the novel. Kevin Nance of the Washington Post describes these two influences as creating a deeply autobiograhical novel.  Themes and style  The novel reflects on themes of memory and mental health. Oates includes autobiographical elements like she does in other novels, using the fictional exploration of the \\"brutal world of her childhood\\" as a means of probing her fictional protagonist's psyche. The novel starts with a \\"psychotic mother abandoning her two small girls to die\\", and that scene follows M.R. Neukirchen throughout the novel. Emma Hagestadt of The Independent also describes Oates' approach to this often repeated plot device in fiction, as accented by \\" Oates's idiosyncratic eye for unsettling detail.\\" In the Inside Higher Ed interview of Oates, Serena Golden explores how the novel both reflects and diverges from the challenges faced by women academics in high profile universities.

Early life  O'Toole was born in Hacketstown, County Carlow, Ireland to Nicholas O'Toole and Brigid O'Toole (n√©e O'Connor). Her father Nicholas was imprisoned in Naas Gaol in 1882 because he was a follower of Charles Stewart Parnell's no-rents campaign. O'Toole emigrated to the United States at age 16. She was the first woman to be naturalised in Steuben County, New York, in 1900, and afterwards became the first woman to be appointed official stenographer in Steuben County.  Legal career  O'Toole studied at Washington College of Law, completing her Bachelor of Laws in 1908, and Master of Laws in 1914. She was first appointed Judge of the Municipal Court of Washington, D.C. by President Harding in 1921. At the time of her appointment, there were only three woman judges in the United States. In 1924, she was a delegate at a meeting of the American Bar Association, held in London. She was re-appointed to the Municipal Court by President Coolidge in 1925. O'Toole was a member of the board of trustees of the Washington College of Law, and held the position of Acting Dean of the College while Dean Grace Hays Riley attended the American Legion Convention in Paris in September 1927. In January 1928, E. E. Dudding, national president of the Prisoner's Aid Society, wrote to the Department of Justice nominating O'Toole to fill the vacancy on the bench of the District of Columbia Supreme Court caused by the resignation of Judge Adolph Hoehling, stating, \\"There is no better lawyer in Washington or anywhere else. She knows the law. She is judicial. She would make one of the best judges to be found and would, I think, raise public opinion of Federal courts\\". O'Toole was reappointed to the Municipal Court by President Hoover in 1929. In 1930, O'Toole was named one of the 50 women who had done the most for Washington by The Washington Post. Referring to O'Toole as a \\"pioneering woman member of the bench\\" and \\"a fixture in Washington's judiciary system\\", The Washington Post in 1934 reported on how, prior to her initial appointment, \\"the very mention of her name as a prospective member of the bench made usually dignified men pace the floor and use undignified language\\". In 1931, she was elected to the executive committee of the National Association of Women Lawyers, which her colleague Dr Ellen Spencer Mussey had helped found in 1919. She spoke at the Thirty-Seventh Annual Meeting of the National Association of Women Lawyers on 5 August 1936. O'Toole was also a member of the Phi Delta Delta Women's Legal Fraternity and the District of Columbia Women's Bar Association.  Views  = Capital punishment = In September 1929, The Washington Daily News reported that O'Toole was \\"one of the most ardent anti-capital punishment workers in the District [of Columbia]\\". She is stated to have said, \\"I am convinced that experience, history, and psychology teach us that the death penalty is wrong. In any event, it does not suit our times and the upward and onward progress of our civilisation. That we constantly try to mitigate its horrors for ourselves by seeking and selecting the least painful methods of inflicting it, by limiting the number of witnesses, and so on, is the sure argument for its abolishment\\". O'Toole led a successful campaign to have the Washington Chamber of Commerce go on record as opposing capital punishment. = Divorce = An interview with O'Toole was published in The Washington Post on February 26, 1928, under the headline \\"High Divorce Rate a Sign of Progress: Some Very Frank Opinions From a Woman on the Bench, Judge Mary O'Toole, of the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia, and Why She Does Not 'View With Alarm' Recent Increase in Marriage Breaks\\". She was quoted in the interview as saying, \\"A woman seeks divorce for one of three main reasons: To protect herself from a person no longer tolerable; to be free, perhaps to acquire other bonds; or to free her husband, her economic independence lulling the fear of want and poverty, so large a factor in the life of women of an earlier day\\". = Women's suffrage = O'Toole campaigned for women's suffrage in Washington, D.C., and wrote a column for a local newspaper that started, \\"Why do I favour suffrage for the District? As well ask me why I want to eat. One seems quite as obvious as the other\\".  Other interests  O'Toole was the first president of the Women's City Club of Washington, D.C. which was founded in 1919. On the club's ethos, O'Toole said the group hoped to attract not only women in the academic and professional sphere, but housewives as well. The Club's charter called for a \\"better understanding among women, and a place for women to meet and socialise\\". She was the first woman to be chosen as director of the Washington Chamber of Commerce, and was a director in the Citizens Savings Bank of Washington, D.C. O'Toole also had membership with the Sulgrave Institution, the Columbia Historical Society, the Catholic Actors Guild, the American Catholic History Association, the American Association of University Women, and the National Women's Republican Club (New York City).  Extended family  O'Toole's great-grandniece is Lucy Mulhall, captain of the Irish Women's Rugby sevens team.

He has a graduate degree in Biology from the Central University of Venezuela (Caracas, 1993) and a master's degree in Digital Arts from the Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona, 2015), and he is the co-founder of the prestigious conservationist nongovernmental organization PROVITA.

Here we are, Bol√≠var Square, Bogota, Colombia. 520 Reindeer, BOD Corpbanca, Caracas, Venezuela. Brice√±o's passion for photography began when he was a teenager and he first exhibited his work in 1987. Between 1996 and 2002, he carried out several solo exhibitions, relating to the following topics: Veils and Turbans (1996, Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi); Passengers (a series that won him First Prize in the Luis Felipe Toro Prize and which was exhibited in Caracas' Museum of Fine Arts in 1997); Devotion (a series that depicts different forms of popular religious beliefs in Venezuela, which was shown at Galer√≠a Los Talleres, Mexico in 1998; in Casa de las Am√©ricas, Havana, 1999; and at Maison Internationale, Brussels in 2000); Guadalupanos (Ateneo de Caracas, 1999); and The Shamans (Galerie Adriana Schmidt, Stuttgart, 2002). Between 2001 and 2007, he worked on the project entitled Gods of America: Natural Pantheon, in which he used digital photomontage (carried out during long-term periods of field research), creating a pantheon of deities and mythological beings from indigenous cultures across the American continent. This project covered ten cultures from six countries: Huichol (Mexico 2001), Piaroa (Venezuela 2002), Kogui and Wiwa (Colombia 2003), Wayuu (Venezuela 2005), Kuna (Panama 2005), Quero (Peru 2005), Kayap√≥ (Brazil 2006), and Ye'Kuana and Pem√≥n (Venezuela 2007). He received several grants that allowed him to carry out the project, including grants from the Programa de Intercambio de Residencias Art√≠sticas (Grupo de los Tres G3), the Estancia para Creaci√≥n Art√≠stica Grant (Government of Mexico) and the Apoyo an Artistas Grant, (Centro Nacional de las Artes, Mexico). Gods of America represented Venezuela at the 52nd Venice Biennale (2007) and have been exhibited, in either solo or group shows, in Finland, France, Hungary, Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, the United States,http://gabarron.org/NewYork/Exhibitions/PastExhibitions/SavetheForestSavetheCulture/Cover/tabid/257/Default.aspx Mexico, Colombia, New Zealand and Venezuela. The artist received the Green Leaf Award for Artistic Excellence 2008, awarded by the Natural World Museum and the United Nations Environment Program for this compelling series, in addition to various other prizes and highly commented awards in his home country, Venezuela. In 2008, Brice√±o carried out a project entitled The Tree, in which he photographed the New Zealand Maori's worship of forefathers. Afterwards, in 2009, the Colombian Ministry of Culture invited him to create a series about the current situation of indigenous groups in their country, which resulted in the exhibit Look at us. Here we are in Bogot√° and other cities around Colombia. The same year he was invited by the Government of Finland and the S√°mi Parliament to carry out the project 520 Reindeer. A homage to S√†mi language, which depicts the richness and importance of the languages of the S√°mi, who are the last surviving indigenous people in Western Europe. This series has been exhibited in Venezuela and in Finland, and one of its main pieces was presented at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York during the Indigenous Peoples and Food Sovereignty exhibition. Now, the complete series belongs to the S√°mi people SIIDA Museum in Inari, Finland. In 2010, the institution Art Works for Change and the United Nations Environment Program invited him to carry out an artistic project on biodiversity in Rwanda, which he entitled Millions of pieces. One Puzzle. This series was presented during on the occasion of the World Environment Day celebrations of 2010, and it was exhibited at the Field Museum in Chicago. Two years later, in 2012, the artist presented The weepers. Our last tears (hired female mourners), a series consecrated to the repression of emotions, so characteristic of our contemporary culture, produced entirely in Northern Peru. That same year, he received the 2011 International Association of Art Critics Award for his outstanding career and commitment to the expression of a poetics of respect for the planet, its inhabitants and its cultures. Most recently, in 2014, Brice√±o presented the series Omert√† on oil. The era of silence, a video installation consisting on several video-portraits of victims of torture and other forms of disproportionate use of force by the military and paramilitary groups controlled by the government of Nicolas Maduro, during the civil protest and demonstrations that took place on February and March of that same year. Furthermore, his last series to this day, The skin of Mars, reflects precisely on the violence of war and the scars we bear as species and as individuals through the overlapping of images of planet Mars taken by NASA and pictures of as many sculptures of the homonymous god that rest in the collections of art museums around the world. Finally, in addition to his personal artistic endeavours, the artist has often collaborated with conservationist organizations: in 2007 he worked for Conservation International documenting the institution's cooperation programs for the Ye'kuana people in Venezuela, and in 2012 he photographed the Pum√© and Yopal communities, also in Venezuela, for The Nature Conservancy. Likewise, he has been invited to join the jury of the annual photography contest sponsored by PROVITA and the IUCN.

Life Deering was born in Saxony, educated at Hamburg and Leyden, and came to London in 1713 as secretary to Baron Schach, envoy to Queen Anne from Peter the Great. He remained in England as a tutor till November 1718, when he married and returned to the continent, where he took a degree at Reims, 13 December 1718. He went on to Paris, studying anatomy and botany under Bernard de Jussieu. In August 1719 he came back to England. For a time Deering worked as a medical practitioner in London. He joined the botanical society set up by Johann Jakob Dillenius and John Martyn, which existed from 1721 to 1726. In 1736, no longer married, Deering moved to Nottingham, with a letter of recommendation from Hans Sloane. At first Deering was successful in his practice, and issued a short tract on his method of treating the small-pox; but he may have been temperamentally unsuited to the work, He was made ensign in 29 October 1745, in the Nottingham infantry regiment, during the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. A sufferer from gout, in late life Deering succumbed to asthma, and declined. He died 12 April 1749, and was buried in St. Peter's churchyard, Nottingham, opposite the house he lived in. His name is commemorated by the genus Deeringia R.Br., still current in the family Amaranthaceae. Works Two years after moving to Nottingham, Deering published a list of local plants. With some of the cryptogams he had been helped by Dillenius. They collaborated in other ways, acknowledged by Dillenius in the preface to his major work Historia Muscorum. Materials collected by John Plumptre (died 1751) for a history of Nottingham were passed to Deering by friends. Edited by him for publication, they appeared posthumously as Nottinghamia Vetus et Nova (1751). It was printed by George Ayscough, and contained in particular a detailed description of the stocking frame.

Military medicine In 1909, a military manual from the Mounted Service School in Fort Riley recommended cannabis indica for treating abdominal pains in horses, or to supplement ether for treating spasms. During World War I, military doctors recommended that the American Expeditionary Force carry cannabis indica tablets to treat headaches, insomnia, and cramps. Drug use in Panama and investigations Some of the earliest reports of recreational cannabis use in the military came from the Panama Canal Zone in 1916, where troops were noted to be using the drug. Also in 1916, thousands of US troops used marijuana while in Mexico on General John Pershing's punitive expedition against Pancho Villa (1916‚Äì1917). In 1921, the commanding officer of Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, prohibited the use of cannabis on the base. A 1933 report by the U.S. Army Medical Corps published in the publication Military Surgeon, titled Marijuana Smoking in Panama, based on a study of U.S. Army personnel in the Panama Canal Zone, found that cannabis was generally not addictive and was less harmful to soldiers than alcohol.Ruth C. Stern & J. Herbie DiFonzo, The End of the Red Queen's Race: Medical Marijuana in the New Century, Quinnipiac Law Review, Vol. 27, p. 688.Marijuana Smoking in Panama, Military Surgeon, Vol. 73 (1933). The report recommended that use of cannabis on military bases should continue to be prohibited, but outside of these areas there should be no further restriction. Industrial hemp The Rens Hemp Company of Brandon, Wisconsin, closed in 1958, was the last legal hemp producer nationwide in operation following World War II. Prior to its 1957 shutdown, Rens had been the primary provider of hemp rope for the United States Navy. Edgewood Arsenal human experiments From the 1950s to the 1970s, Edgewood Arsenal conducted experiments on human subjects with cannabis and its derivatives. One study indicated \\"no loss of motivation or performance after two years of heavy (military sponsored) smoking of marihuana.\\" Vietnam War Though alcohol was the drug most commonly used by American troops in the Vietnam War, cannabis was the second-most common. Initially rates of usage among deployed soldiers were comparable to those of their stateside peers, with 29% of troops departing Vietnam in 1967 reporting having ever used marijuana in their lives. A 1976 study however showed that from 1967‚Äì1971, the proportion of troops having used marijuana peaked at 34% before stabilizing to 18%, while the number of troops who had used cannabis prior to deployment stayed around 8%. Cannabis use by troops in Vietnam was generally dealt with using Article 15 non-judicial punishment in units such as the 101st Airborne. During the Vietnam War period, cannabis use also became common among US forces in the United States and in Europe, with a 1971 article claiming that over 1,000 midshipmen at Annapolis Naval Academy used cannabis, and a survey in Germany showing that half of the soldiers in the surveyed battalion were regular cannabis users.

Her work is focused on abstracted mixed-media (primarily painting and printmaking) and minimalism. She is a Professor Emeritus, University of California, Berkeley and retired from teaching in 2006. O'Neal's art has been exhibited widely throughout North America and internationally, with group and solo shows in Italy, France, Chile, Senegal and Nigeria. She lives and works in Oakland, California, and maintains a studio in Chile. Early life and education Mary Lovelace was born in Jackson, Mississippi, on February 10, 1942. She credits her father for nurturing her love of the arts. During her childhood and adolescence O'Neal's father, Ariel Lovelace, was choir director and professor of music at Tougaloo College and the University of Arkansas. O'Neal attended Howard University in Washington, DC, from 1960 to 1964 and studied with David Driskell, Lois Mailou Jones and James A. Porter, receiving her B.F.A. in 1964. She attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine during the summer of 1963. During her time at Howard University, O'Neal became active in the Civil Rights Movement and mentored by many influential leaders in the movement, including Stokely Carmichael, Jacob Lawrence and his wife, painter Gwendolyn Lawrence. She worked briefly at the Free Southern Theater (FST) with one of the theatre founders, her first husband John O'Neal. O'Neal continued her fine arts education at Columbia University, studying with Aja Junger, Stephen Greene, Leon Golden and Andra Rat. While at Columbia, O'Neal became involved in the Black Art Movement in New York City, which further influenced her work. She received her M.F.A. from Columbia University in 1969. Career Mary Lovelace O'Neal's paintings have progressed through different phases over her long career, beginning with loose forms and evolving to more precise patterns. O'Neal has received numerous awards and exhibited in many national and international exhibitions throughout her career. She was invited as resident artist to participate in the international arts festival in Asilah, Morocco, in 1983. O'Neal curated an exhibition for the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Santiago, Chile, \\"17 Artistas Latino y Afro Americanos en USA\\" in 1991. Two years later, she received the Artist En France Award sponsored by the French government and Moet & Chandon. In 2005, she was selected to represent Mississippi in the Committees Exhibition at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C. O'Neal started teaching full-time at University of California, Berkeley in 1978. In 1985 she became the first African American artist to receive tenure in the department of art, and then appointed in 1999 as the Chair of the Department of Art Practice until her retirement in 2006. She has taught at several institutions in the U.S. including the University of Texas at Austin, San Francisco Art Institute, California College of Arts and Crafts, Oakland, California. And she has taught internationally at Jorge Tadeo Lozano, Bogota, Colombia. In 1984, O'Neal worked on monotype printmaking with Robert Blackburn at the Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop in New York City. She enjoyed the process so much and she explored various other printing processes and printed over 200 prints at Blackburn's shop over the years. = Lampblack Series, 1960s-70s = O'Neal developed these paintings while earning her MFA at Columbia University. This series of monochromes, made in the late 1960s-early 70s, were monumental and made using ebony pigment that was rubbed into raw unstretched canvas using a chalkboard eraser or her hands. The deep black of the surface could, \\"absorb and silence the noise of ideology, activate space, and impact the body.\\" = Chasing Down the Image, Retrospective at Mnuchin Gallery, February 2020 = In February 2020, Mnuchin Gallery held O'Neil's first solo exhibition in New York since 1993, which surveyed over five decades of her work, from the late 1960s through 2000s. The mini retrospective, Chasing Down the Image, reveals the ways in which O'Neil has engaged abstraction and materiality exuberantly for political ends, marrying experimental black aesthetics with influences of Minimalism. She was engaged with issues taken up by Donald Judd, Joseph Stella, and Sam Gilliam while simultaneously having conversations with Amiri Baraka who pushed her to make images of the Black Power movement instead of abstraction. During the 60s and 70s O'Neal's abstraction went against the emphasis placed on figuration by the Black Arts Movement and the Black Panthers as a means for Black empowerment. O'Neal's work, \\"insists on the aesthetic integration of experiences and styles once construed to be mutually exclusive.\\" = Mary Lovelace O'Neal: Whales, A Romance... at the Museum of the African Diaspora, March 2020 = In March 2020, the Museum of the African Diaspora mounted a solo exhibition of O'Neal's Whales Fucking series from the 1970s. These expressionist abstract landscapes were made in response to her first visit to the Bay Area that decade.

This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet/priest Ezekiel, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. This chapter records a visit of some of the elders of Israel to Ezekiel, and God's response through the prophet dealing with the sins of idolatry. Text The original text was written in the Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 23 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). The idolatrous elders (14:1‚Äì11) A group of elders approached Ezekiel (cf. Ezekiel 8:1 and 20:1) to 'enquire' of YHWH, which is a traditional practice of using the prophet as mediator to convey specific questions to YHWH (cf. ). YHWH told Ezekiel that he refuses to hear in the enquiry 'because of the seriousness of the elders' idolatry' (cf. 20:3‚Äì4) and 'the elders are not condemned simply for idolatry, but for 'lifting up' their idols 'into their hearts' (cf. the Jerusalem elders in 8:9‚Äì12, who maintained secret 'picture rooms' inside the temple itself). YHWH only responded by warning the elders 'to turn back from idolatry or suffer death at his hands' (verses 6‚Äì8), and if a prophet should deliver a response to the idolater's enquiry, YHWH would then destroy the prophet as well as the enquirer. =Verse 3= : Son of man, these men have set up their idols in their heart, :: and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: : should I be enquired of at all by them? NKJV * \\"Son of man\\" (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ü÷æ◊ê◊ì◊ù -): this phrase is used 93 times to address Ezekiel. * \\"Idols\\" (Hebrew: ◊í÷¥÷º◊ú÷º◊ï÷º◊ú÷¥ ; plural: ◊í÷¥÷º◊ú÷º◊ï÷º◊ú÷¥◊ô◊ù gillulim): found 39 times in the Book of Ezekiel and in . Originally means \\"trunks, logs, blocks,\\" that can be \\"rolled\\", it could denote \\"the primitive stone menhir or construct. * \\"Set up their idols in their heart\\": Rashi interprets this as \\"Their heart is toward their idols to worship [them].\\"Rashi's commentary on Ezekiel 14:3. *\\"The stumbling block of their iniquity\\": from Hebrew: , ,Hebrew Text Analysis: Ezekiel 14:3. Biblehub is a unique phrase of the prophet Ezekiel (Ezekiel 7:19; 14:3, , ; ; ).Note [c] on Ezekiel 7:19 in NET Noah, Dan'el, and Job (14:12‚Äì23) In this section YHWH addresses the question of individual responsibility for sin, which was mentioned in chapter 9 when the righteous people in Jerusalem were 'marked so as to escape the city's destruction' (Ezekiel 9:4; cf. ), and whether a few righteous individuals might suffice to save an entire city (cf. Abraham in ) or at least members of their own family (cf. Abraham for Lot in Genesis 19:29). The number of citizens to be spared was apparently quite small, as Ezekiel protests that YHWH is destroying the last remnant of Israel (). YHWH posits that should the three 'legendary paragons of virtue': Noah, Dan'el, and Job, inhabit this land, even 'they would be helpless to save their own children from YHWH's punishment of famine, wild beasts, sword, and plague', which recalls the scenario in chapter 5 and 7 that YHWH is about to bring 'four levitically prescribed punishments against Jerusalem and Israel'. The conclusion of this chapter is clear: Jerusalem ('which is patently not inhabited by Noah, Dan'el, or Job') will not be spared, even 'for the sake of some few righteous citizens, or by the righteousness of those exiles whose children will now share in the city's doom' (). YHWH adds an ironic note that there will be survivors of the city's destruction who will be brought into exile to show the exiles of 'their obvious wickedness', so people will know that 'YHWH did not destroy the city without reason' (). =Verse 14= : Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, :: they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, : saith the Lord God. KJV * \\"Three men\\": These three men are selected as they had plead in different \\"worlds\\", according to Rashi, that is Noah witnesses the world destroyed and rebuilt, Daniel the temple destroyed and rebuilt, Job the prosperity/\\"greatness\\" destroyed and rebuilt.Rashi's Commentary on Ezekiel 14:14. These three Israel's righteous spiritual heroes \\"could not have prevailed with God in prayer to save the people\\" from the coming disasters. =Verse 20= : Though Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live, saith the Lord God, :: they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; : they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness. KJV * \\"They shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness\\": The city of Sodom could be saved with a minimum number of righteous people (), but the righteous people can only save one's own soul in the case of determined judgment on Jerusalem.

She works are about Utopian ideas, the future, and alternative concepts for society. Her main instruments are drawing, interviews, the Internet, mechanics/electronics, and street art. She uses techniques from surveys to speculative fiction to explore \\"the collective production of culture, the interface of art and science, and the production and negotiation of public space\\". Her projects provide skeptical footnotes to global history. She modifies or mimics urban signs, advertisements, or services, jolting viewers out of their habitual ruts, upsetting conventional ways of seeing and of representing the world. Her interview-based drawing projects connect the streets and the Internet. Her aim is to create space for unusual thoughts and empowered communication: \\"The point is to rewrite existing structures as alterable, to change and rethink them (...) Through a collective work process (Wenzel) opens up new perspectives and visions of specific themes.\\" Wenzel often actively involves passersby in surveys or service interventions, testing machines of her own invention, or she interviews citizens as local specialists ‚Äì experimenting with forms of collective authorship and working against traditional notions of artists as \\"visionaries\\" who are supposed to possess special insights denied to the \\"average person\\". According to Wenzel, new ways of seeing, which are developing as part of the digital revolution, and of changing concepts of the urban realm are especially suitable for artistic infiltration to reflect the underlying structures of daily life. Life and works K√§the Wenzel: Bonebots, 2010In 2016, Wenzel became professor for Aesthetic Practice and Contexts at European University Flensburg. She studied in Marburg, Florence, and Berlin.

She was an exchange scholar with the Fulbright Program at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2009‚Äì10.

Using Mughal miniature paintings with overlaid dialogue, Royal Existentials comments upon contemporary politics, social issues, and philosophy. Content Each strip of Aarthi Parthasarathy's Royal Existentials consists of a repeated classic Mughal miniature painting with dialogue overlaid, each panel having different dialogue. The webcomic updates weekly, and the dialogue presented in the webcomic comments on the social or political events of the time. Despite the repetitive panels, the webcomic maintains a clear rhythm by using well-placed pauses in its writing. Parthasarathy frequently comments upon the Jaipur, Kangra, and Deccan paintings she uses as well, noting the representation of women and their place in court in her dialogues. Development Parthasarathy founded The Royal Existentials in November 2014, after being inspired by David Malki's Wondermark, which injects Victorian art with humorous speech balloons. She came across Wondermark in 2010, and quickly thought that someone should do an Indian version of the same concept. The Royal Existentials is a product of Falana Dimka films, a company Parthasarathy co-founded with Chaitanya Krishnan. The lay-out of the webcomic and any additional art is provided by Krishnan, who said about the use of Mughal miniatures that their \\"opulent setting ... lends itself to talking about issues like inequality.\\" Parthasarathy found that the often anonymous subjects of these paintings lend themselves well for her scripts. Parthasarathy sits down to write a new strip every Thursday, so that she can publish it on the following day. The Royal Existentials doesn't explicitly cover whatever is in the news, but rather focuses on whatever is on its creator's mind, and can take on a philosophical perspective as well. Parthasarathy described her webcomic as a \\"diary of thoughts.\\" In an interview with The Bangalore Mirror, Parthasarathy stated that there's a \\"serious imbalance\\" in how feminists are represented in media, and that she \\"wanted to correct it with humour.\\" She noted that her goal is not to \\"manage her frustration with patriarchy\\" (a notion she finds \\"ridiculous\\"), but that she deliberately wants to change the world with humour, which she described as \\"a very powerful tool.\\" Reception Tarishi Verma of Hindustan Times stated that the webcomic uses its paintings \\"to brilliant effect\\". Parthasarathy herself stated that \\"the best part has been that there‚Äôs been a lot of discussion brought about the by Royal Existentials. People have come up to me and just had great, long conversations.\\" Bengalaru- based performing artist Avril Stormy Unger stated that The Royal Existentials allows people who are put off by more modern art styles the opportunity to understand feminism from a different perspective.

The briefcase bombing came two months after the Hafte Tir bombing, which killed over seventy senior Iranian officials, including Chief Justice Mohammad Beheshti, then Iran's second-highest official. According to sources, nobody \\"knew exactly who had been in the room at the time of the detonation.\\" Eventually, there were three participants that had been unaccounted for that included Masoud Keshmiri, Rajai, and Bahonar. It was later revealed that both Rajai and Bahonar had died in the explosion. According to Albert Benliot, Ayatollah Khomeini charged the MEK with responsibility for the bombing, \\"however, there has been much speculation among academics and observers that these bombings may have actually been planned by senior IRP leaders, including later Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, to rid themselves of rivals within the IRP.\\" Afterwards, the interim presidential council announced five national days of mourning, and Iran's Parliament selected Ayatollah Mahdavi Kani as the next prime minister. Bombing Front page of Ettela'at newspaper, reporting the blast. The Iranian Prime Minister's office after the 1981 explosion. According to the survivors, the bomb exploded when one of the victims opened a briefcase brought by Masoud Keshmiri as an \\"agent of MEK\\". Ettela'at reported that the explosion destroyed the first floor and partially damaged the second floor of the Prime Minister's building, located on Pastor Street. Rajai, Bahonar, and military and security officials were killed. The injured were rescued from the rubble and transported to the hospital. Due to their severe burns, the corpses were not easily identified, and some of the victims were identified through their teeth. =Prominent officials killed= * President Mohammad Ali Rajai * Prime Minister Mohammad Javad Bahonar * Col. Vahid Dastjerdi, chief of Iranian police * Abdol Hossein Daftarian =Prominent officials injured= * Col. Sayyed Mousa Namjoo, Minister of Defense and Khomeini's representative in the Supreme Defense Council * Brigadier General Sharafkhah, Deputy Commander of Ground Forces * Col. Vesali * Col. Akhyani, Chief of Staff of Iran's Gendarmerie * Col. Katiba'ee, representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Suspects Although no group claimed responsibility for the bombing, it was nevertheless attributed to the MEK. Ann K. Reed notes that Western observers believe the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) was \\"most likely to have been responsible for the bomb blasts of June 28 and August 30.\\" However, Van England notes that \\"the explosions were set off by insiders - the first by an accomplice working in the offices of the IRP, the second by the guard in charge of security at Prime Minister Bahonar's headquarters.\\" Mangol Bayat also expressed doubts that the MEK would be capable the attacks \\"since infiltration of the regime at the very high level would have been necessary.\\" The Islamic Republic of Iran later claimed that the attack was carried out by MEK agent Masoud Keshmiri, secretary of Bahonar's office and of the Supreme National Security Council, who used a fake passport to escape Iran after the attack. More than twenty suspects were identified in the subsequent investigation, including Masoud Keshmiri, Ali Akbar Tehrani, Mohammad Kazem Peiro Razawi, Khosro Ghanbari Tehrani, Javad Ghadiri, Mohsen Sazgara, Taghi Mohammadi, and Habibollah Dadashi. =Perpetrator= The Islamic Republic of Iran identified Masoud Keshmiri (who had served as Bahonar's office secretary for a year prior to the bombing) as the perpetrator. An official in the Prosecutor General's office said that Keshmiri had concealed his anti-government activities so well that a corpse mistaken for his was buried on 31 August with full honors as a martyr of the Islamic revolution. Abdol Hossein Daftarian was stuck in the elevator after the explosion, where he suffocated to death. The MEK bought some time for Keshmiri by spreading the rumor that the man found in the elevator was actually him. Although the Iranian authorities arrested and executed numerous MEK agents, Keshmiri fled the country using a fake passport. Aftermath Following the deaths of Rajai and Bahonar, an interim presidential council was formed, as stipulated by Article 130 of the Iranian Constitution. The interim council consisted of Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, then Parliament's speaker, and Ayatollah Mousavi Ardabili, then president of the Supreme Court.

It has a humble beginning as a prayer group started in 1917 as Asamankesse but later got affiliation with Apostolic Church Bradford. History Peter Anim Newman began a healing ministry in 1917 under the name Faith Tabernacle as a result of healing received from acute stomach upset and guinea worms infections after he had read a magazine published by Faith Tabernacle USA called \\"Sword of Spirit\\". In 1931, Anim through a fellow Faith Tabernacle minister in Nigeria David O. Odubanjo contacted missionaries of the Apostolic Church of Bradford, to pay his team a visit. Rev George Perfect a missionary sent by Apostolic Church Bradford to Nigeria, passed by Asamankesse in Ghana and stay with the Faith Tabernacle church for two weeks. An agreement was met between George Perfect and Peter Anim. Also Peter Anim and his members fully embraced the doctrine and practices of the Apostolic Church Bradford. Hence, Anim's church became The Apostolic Church Gold Coast. A year later,a major \\"Holy Ghost Outpouring' was experienced. Healing, miracles and salvation was greatly recorded and therefore impacted the growth of the ministry numerically. They requested for an external missionary from Bradford, which was granted in 1937, James McKeown, was sent as the first Pentecostal missionary from UK to Asamankese. The church by then practices strictly divine healing. James McKeown had suffered from malaria and subsequently hospitalized in the European Hospital in Ghana. He responded to treatment successfully. However, he faced hostility from the Church which felt betrayed by their missionary had receive medical treatment against the teachings of the church. This disagreement led the church into division. The followers of James McKeown remained Apostolic Church Bradford while the followers of Anim became Christ Apostolic Church Beliefs The Christ Apostolic Church believes that God is revealed in The Unity of the Godhead and the Trinity of the persons therein, man's deprave nature, the need for repentance and Regeneration, and the Eternal Doom of the finally impenitent.

The fortresses were positioned at Semna because of the expansion of Egypt into Lower Nubia by Senusret III, and were a means of protecting and controlling access into Egypt. The Semna Despaches record the movements of people around the Semna Gorge, and reports their activity's back to an unnamed official in Thebes. Many of the Despatches deal with people who had come to the forts to trade with the Egyptians while others talk about patrols that had gone out and found people in the surrounding desert. The Semna Despatches provides the bulk of information that pertains to the administrative functions of the forts around the Semna Gorge. The Semna Despatches form one of very few records that tell us about what the forts around the Semna Gorge did, and what life was like in the forts. These Despatches are therefore very important to us historically, and give us a glimpse into the forts. The Despatches also provide a look at the Egyptians attitudes towards the people of Nubia to the south as they record the interactions between Egyptians and Nubians. These Despatches are now housed in the British Museum. The Semna Despatches are now part of the British Museums collection; after being gifted by Alan Gardiner who had acquired them around 1900 in return for his financial help with preservation and publishing the papyri. The collection is cataloged as AE10752.1, AE10752.2, AE1075.3, AE10752.4, AE10752.5, AE10771.1, AE10771.2, AE10772.2. Unfortunately, two of the Despatches suffered significant damage from the use of cellulose nitrate film with both of the papyri being seriously damaged  Semna Forts  During the reign of Senusret I the Egyptians started to push further south into lower Nubia and by the reign of Senusret III it became necessary to build forts around Semna Gorge; this area would provide a defensive position in case of attack by Nubia, who were still a powerful enemy. The forts also served a second purpose which was to control access into Egypt. The people whom they were trying to keep out were Nubians as you can clearly see in the boundary stela of Senusret III which speaks of the Nubians as a wretched vile people. To accomplish the task of keeping the Nubians out the Egyptians would send patrols into the desert to find people who may be trying to cross the border clandestinely and report those movements to the other forts as well as to officials in Thebes which is the main reason the Semna Despatches were created. Nubian's Egyptian attitudes towards Nubians was based more on stereotypes and religious feeling then actual facts. The Egyptians saw the outside world as one being of disorder which must be controlled to preserve Maat (or order) with this extending to outside country's particularly Nubia. Because the Egyptians saw Nubia as disordered its people were considered disordered and therefore it was good to destroy and control them as we see in the Boundary Stela of Senusret III. We can see in the Semna Despatches the Egyptians upholding Maat by keeping the Nubians out.  Discovery  The Semna Despatches were found in a Theban tomb which was below the Mortuary Temple of Ramesses II by J.E.Quibell in 1895-1896. The Despatches were found in a wooden box in a very poor state of decomposition with estimates that around two thirds of the Papyri having been already lost when Quibell found them. The Despatches suffered another mishap as when they were being hoisted out of the tomb they fell from the basket back down the shaft potentially damaging more of the already fragile papyri. After Quibell got them back to England they sat on a shelf in the Edwards Library at University College, London until they were given to the esteemed Egyptologist Alan Gardiner to preserve and publish around 1900  Translation  The Job of translating the Semna Despatches fell to Paul C. Smithers who worked on them in early 1940 until his death in 1943. Unfortunately, because it was war time, and because Smithers died in September 1943 from a lingering illness he was unable to consult the original plates containing the Semna Despatches so instead he worked from photographs. Because of the difficulty in working from photographs Smithers encountered some errors in translation that was fixed by Dr Bryan Kraemer and Dr Kate Liszka in 2016 Kraemer and Liszka also made a translation of two separate papyri found with the Semna Despatches which also related to the Semna Forts. Unlike the Semna Despatches which dealt with monitoring the movements of people around the Semna Gorge these papyri dealt with administration and talk about the inspection of officials in the fort of Elephantine. = Semna Despatches Despatch 1. = = Paul C.

[...]  Conservation  Given the poor state of preservation the Semna Despatches were in when they were discovered it was inevitable that they would need to be preserved. Alan Gardiner funded the preservation with Hugo Ibscher doing the actual preservation work which was begun in 1903 and lasted until around 1939. Ibscher used several different methods for preserving the papyri which included attaching them to Celluloid Nitrate film, gelatin film, and cardboard then sandwiching them between glass. Unfortunately, the use of celluloid nitrate film can be very unstable and in the case of two of the papyri burning has been caused because of its use. Fortunately, only the two damaged papyri were found to contain celluloid nitrate film with the rest being gelatin film that is far more stable. The way the preserved papyri were mounted has caused damage however. Because the papyri were mounted in-between two sheets of glass when the frame is moved the papyrus moves slightly causing damage. To stop further damage the British museum started in 2006 to remove the frames and the gelatin film then remount the papyrus to fine tissue paper to ensure their continued preservation. This recent preservation could only be carried out on some of the papyri however as the adhesive used on the others, Celluloid nitrate adhesive, is very difficult to remove and because of the papyrus‚Äô already fragile state the British museum decided to not try and remount those.

The topic of the canvas is taken from the Book of Judges, verses 4:11-22 and 5:24-31. It depicts the moment in which Jael is about to kill Sisera, a defeated Canaanite general. After his defeat he flees to a nearby settlement. There Jael takes him in, promises to feed him, and hide him from the authorities. The moment he is asleep she drives a tent peg through his temple. This subject is seldom depicted in seventeenth century art, there very few other examples contemporary to this painting. The date, 1620 can be seen at the bottom of the Artist's prominent signature, carved in to the pillar.

While living and working in Florence, Artemisia adopts this surname, which belonged to one of her uncles, rather than the Roman Gentileschi, to strengthen her ties the city among her potential patrons.

The prominence of the artist's signature indicate that this was a work she felt worthy of praise. The three-line signature reads, \\"ARETEMITA LOMI/FACIBAT/MDCXX.\\" This is the first example of Artemisia using the imperfect tense of the Latin verb Facibat, perhaps a reference to the way in which Michelangelo signed his Pieta.

Prior to restoration the painting had extensive paint loss in the upper left and lower right hand corners. As a result of the restoration the highlights on Sisera skirt were strengthened and some of the shadows are more mechanical in nature than those you would expect to see by Artemisia's hand.

It has a patchy distribution on the Pacific coast of Central and South America, occurs in places on the Atlantic coast of that continent, and has a more widespread range on the Atlantic coast of West Africa. Description Members of the genus Rhizophora are very similar to each other in morphology. They grow up to tall often with aerial stilt roots, but in more marginal habitats are shorter, more branched and scrubby. The leaves grow in opposite pairs, each pair with two interlocking stipules. The leaves are simple and entire, with elliptical hairless blades and slightly down-rolled margins. The lower surfaces have numerous tiny corky warts which appear as black spots on dried leaves. At one time considered to be a subspecies of Rhizophora mangle, R. racemosa is now accepted as a full species, most easily distinguished by the fact that the stem of the axillary flowers branches up to six times, making a maximum cluster size of 128. However, the inflorescences more usually contain 32 to 64 flowers. Other distinguishing characteristics include thick, short rounded bracteoles and rounded flower buds. Ecology Ripe propagule Flowers In West Africa, estuaries, bays and lagoons are fringed by tidal mangrove forests, dominated by Rhizophora and Avicennia. When new mudflats are formed, seagrasses are the first plants that grow on the mud, with Rhizophora racemosa, a pioneering species, being the first mangrove to appear. With time, the mud solidifies and more tree and plant species arrive. On the seaward side the trees are short but get steadily taller further inland. The nipa palm (Nypa fruticans) has been introduced to Nigeria and Cameroon and has become invasive, to the detriment of the native mangrove species. Some insect pollination takes place, but R. racemosa is largely wind- pollinated. The fruit produce propagules which may fall into the water and be dispersed by wind and currents. Uses In West Africa, Rhizophora racemosa is used for construction poles and firewood on a limited scale. The smoke has antimicrobial properties and is also used for smoking meat.

Some of these collaborated with the Nazi regime.  ReGeDe  Before 1927, there was hundreds of deaf clubs all over Germany. Each club had its own agenda and differed by city and deaf community. In 1927 Weimar Germany, a transformation was beginning. It was to be a transformation that would change the deaf community in Germany permanently. = Beginning = The Reichsgewerkschaft der Geh√∂rlosen Deutschlands, abbreviated and stylized as ReGeDe, was known in English as The Reich Union of the Deaf of Germany, and was founded in 1927 in Weimar, Germany was a social organization. By the Easter of 1933, ReGeDe was fused into the National Socialists' public welfare program. Less than a year later, ReGeDe boasted more than 3,900 members, including deaf activist Karl Wacker who fought on behalf of the deaf community against the sterilization law. The ReGeDe union included such groups as deaf advocacy and support agencies, self-help organizations, sports clubs, and much more. \\"the division of deaf associations into church-affiliated groups, and athletic union, and others\\". was too much to Siepmann. He saw \\"just one association for the German deaf‚Ä¶a union\\" The union he envisioned was the ReGeDe. Following Siepmann's example, further efforts were made to incorporate the remaining independent organizations into ReGeDe. ReGeDe had a strong desire to crush local deaf organizations, and all of the associations that now formed ReGeDe enticed, threatened, and coerced deaf children to become members, and appeals were even made to their parents. Werner Thomas made such a plea to involve deaf children in Hitler Youth, found in the Newsletter of the Berlin Deaf Athletic Association: > \\"Of the Leipzig and Dresden Sports Associations almost one hundred percent > of the members are doing their duty with joyful hearts as Hitler Youth. It > is then all the more shameful that many Berlin athletes still oppose > membership...training in Hitler Youth and the troopers is very worthwhile > for the German people as a whole. There out youngsters will be trained in > iron discipline, comradeship and self-sacrifice...We, as deaf, will never be > called to the labor force, to the army and so on. Service in Hitler Youth > offers you the last opportunity to go through a hard school...serving the > interests of Adolf Hitler's Reich takes precedence over everything!!!...I > urge you for the last time...to report to the troop leader...otherwise, > dissociate yourselves with our fine community...Finally I appeal to the > respected parents and also to my fellow club members to give their full > understanding to the action that I have undertaken in the state's interest\\" REGEDE's recruitment methods were successful, as it grew from 3,900 on Easter in 1933, to 11,588 members by January 1, 1937. Fear of the sterilization law most likely amplified these member numbers as some deaf believed that becoming a member of ReGeDe would allow them to be protected from the sterilization law. However, the leaders never promised protection from the law, it was only assumed by the German deaf. As the Nazis gained more power, ReGeDe moved to become a more thorough Nazi organization. \\"Contributing greatly to this powerlessness [of the deaf peoples] was the unification and harmonization policy of the ReGeDe, whose Nazi leadership clique fully endorsed the ideology of Nazi eugenicists and race hygienists.\\" In 1927, shortly after ReGeDe's founding, Fritz Albreghs (1892‚Äì1945) became its chairman. ReGeDe was led by the Deaf Nazi Fritz Albreghs, the 'Fuhrer of the Deaf'. He used both sign and speech to get across the Nazi message. Albreghs organized ReGeDe by Nazi leadership standards, and supervised it strictly. All local deaf clubs and associations were taken over by district associations, and those, in turn, were under the district inspectorates. = The Downfall = Siepmann, head of the German deaf athletic club, the Deaf Union for Physical Training also supported consolidation under Nazi leadership. \\"The organization's head, Fritz Albreghs, had applied for Party membership for everyone in ReGeDe.\\" Albreghs and the administrative head Ballier, both of whom signed the ReGeDe membership card, did not hesitate to denounce their \\"hereditarily diseased\\" fellows. Albreghs even wore a brown stormtrooper uniform and swastika-eventually most leaders of REGEDE did as well. In 1942 Albreghs was removed from the leadership of ReGeDe, and Karl Brunner took leadership. However, the following year leadership was taken by Karl Engelmann who lead the Deaf Hitler Youth. The actions of the German Deaf Workers Union founded in 1918 and which joined the ReGeDe were said to \\"instead of building up [the deaf community] had destroyed everything in a fratricidal war!\\" Albreghs, Siepmann and Edmund Matz worked together to pursue a policy of unifying all organization for and of deaf Germans with the premise: \\"where resistance arises, it will gradually be eliminated\\" and \\"when necessary, harshly and ruthlessly\\" ReGeDe worked with teachers and administrators in encouraging support for the Nazi regime and its racial hygiene program. One regional association in 1937 reported that \\"collaboration with Nazi public welfare is excellent. Almost the entire body of teachers of the deaf are working effectively in our common sense of destiny.\\" Part of this \\"destiny\\" involved sterilization of deaf and other 'hereditarily diseased.' ReGeDe was a \\"strong proponent of sterilization\\", even going as far as releasing a statement that: \\"prevention is better than cure,\\" and that it is patriotic to be sterilized since \\"the deaf do not need to be soldiers but sterilization is a sacrifice like soldiering.\\" People felt threatened by the sterilization law and joined ReGeDe in hopes of avoiding being sterilized. It was said that \\"whoever refused was taken away by police.\\" Teachers, principals, nurses, and ReGeDe leaders turned in deaf people, and sometimes even personally took them to the clinics. One deaf person who experienced these events recounted: \\"despite the fact that I was a party member, I was sterilized after a 12-month long judicial process.\\" Horst Biesold, the author of Crying Hands conducted a survey and found that 5 of the 1,215 forcibly sterilized deaf respondents reported that the ReGeDe had informed on them, with Albreghs and Ballier reporting 2 of those 5. = Deaf women in Nazi society, and ReGeDe's role = Emilie Klusener-Esch founded the women's division of association of the deaf in 1911, but it was not active. Emilie was involved in the development of introducing deaf women to Nazi ideology. She joined the Nazi women's organization in 1932, and shortly thereafter, Albreghs gave her authority to establish the Reich women's union within the ReGeDe. Emilie was voluntarily sterilized even though she came from a \\"hereditarily sound\\" family. She touted that being sterilized is a sacrifice. and used that sacrifice as a model to convince other deaf women to also be voluntarily sterilized.  Deaf Union for Physical Training  The athletic club was founded by Heinrich Siepmann, a leader of the Deaf who proposed the consolidation of the separate Reich Union with the athletics division under the Nazi regime. Athletics was seen as a means by which children could be conditioned, not only physically, but socially in favor of representing Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party as a whole. It was felt that children should engage in athletic activity at least once a week. The tactics by which recruitment efforts were made included, among others, enticement, threats, and coercion.  Friends of the Deaf  Friends of the Deaf, also known as Jedide Ilmim, was a Jewish support organization for deaf people founded by Markus Reich and would be continued by his son, Felix Reich. The \\"Friends of the Deaf\\" was established in an effort to help fund the school Markus Reich had founded, the Israelite Institute for the Deaf of Germany. The efforts made by this group would aid in amassing support from the community for the Deaf cause.

Riverton was located directly on the Mississippi River, and flourished during the 1870s and 1880s. The location is today occupied by a shipping port and industrial park. North of the former settlement is Great River Road State Park. History Riverton was located along a bend in the Mississippi River called \\"Rosedale Bend\\", and nearby Rosedale was located at the top of the bend. The location was originally known as \\"Wood Yard\\" and \\"Old Pride's Point\\", and was a place where steamboats would stop during the 1840s to load fuel-wood harvested from the dense forests near the river. Riverton was one of many Mississippi settlements established on the Mississippi River opposite the mouths of the White River and Arkansas River in Arkansas. B. J. Martin built the first railroad in Bolivar County from Riverton to Bogue Phalia, approximately east. The railcars were pulled by mules. Charles T. Christmas, a former slave from Riverton, patented a bailing press in 1880 which made cotton bales more compact, and therefore cut shipping costs. In 1884, D. Reinach built one of the largest stores in the Bolivar County at Riverton, and served as postmaster of the Riverton post office. A post office operated under the name Riverton from 1873 to 1896. Decline Large sandbars formed along the east bank of Rosedale Bend, leaving both Rosedale and Riverton without access to the river. Riverton \\"gave up the battle in the 1880s and quietly disappeared\\". Port of Rosedale During the late 1970s, the United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed a -long channel running southwest from the Riverton location to the Mississippi River. The Port of Rosedale was erected on the site of the former settlement, featuring a port facility and industrial park. In 2011, the Port of Rosedale processed 1.5 million tons of cargo.

Though significantly smaller than the well- known Rio Carnival or the Portuguese Carnival of Madeira, the Goa Carnival is the largest in India and one of the few traditional celebrations of the Catholic holiday in Asia. Despite falling into obscurity during the latter days of the Portuguese colonial rule of Goa, the Goa Carnival was resurrected as a minor street celebration in 1965 and has since turned into a major tourist attraction for the small state.  Origin  While the roots of the Carnival in Goa date back to the introduction of Roman Catholic traditions during the Portuguese conquest of Goa, the festival itself fell into obscurity during the later days of colonialism, as Portugal's authoritarian regime known and is celebrated on the same day as Portugal Estado Novo limited freedom of assembly and press. After the end of Portuguese rule, the festival was resurrected by Timoteo Fernandes in 1965, a Goan musician who modeled it after the famed Rio Carnival. Today, the urban parade includes floats from local villages, commercial entities, and cultural groups. It is still organised in a very traditional manner, including by the staging of streetside local plays, in the coastal taluka of Salcete. According to the Government of Goa's Department of Tourism, the carnival is \\"Goa's most famous festival and has been celebrated since the 18th century.\\" The Carnival usually starts off on Fat Saturday (known as Sabado Gordo) and concludes on Fat Tuesday (known as 'Shrove Tuesday'), just before Ash Wednesday and the first day of the Catholic season of Lent. In Panjim, the capital of Goa, the festival is complemented by \\"Grape Escapade\\", a local Wine festival, and a dance at Samba Square in the centrally-located Garden of Garcia da Orta. According to local tradition, during Carnival Goa is taken over by King Momo, usually a local resident who presides over the festival during the 4-day span. King Momo traditionally proclaims the Konkani message ‚ÄúKha, piye aani majja kar‚Äù (English: ‚ÄúEat, drink and make merry‚Äù).  Parade  The parade usually begins on Fat Saturday evening with a procession headed by King Momo. Balloons, horse-drawn carriages, decorated bullock carts and elaborate floats are the highlights of the parade. The festivities during Goa Carnival include dancing troupes, revelers wearing masks and costumes, live music, sports competitions, floats & parades, and food and drinking. = Dates = In 2018, the festival was celebrated from 9‚Äì12 February. In the urban areas, individual float parades were held in the Goan cities and towns of Panjim, Margao, Ponda, Vasco, Curchorem, Mapusa and Morjim.

Either international identifier GBA (Alderney) or GBG (Guernsey) may be displayed on the vehicle, and this is seen either in the oval format required internationally by the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, or on the side of the registration plate, in a similar style to that used in the EEA under EU Regulation 2411/98. The latest numbers issued (in late Summer 2017) are in the low 3000's (e.g. \`AY 3017\`). Alderney is identified as a jurisdiction in its own right in the 1926 Convention on Motor Traffic. Before the Second World War registration were issued at the Island Hall by the Island's Government, the States of Alderney; following the 1948 Agreement driver and vehicle licensing was delegated by the States of Alderney to the Guernsey Government as one of the \\"transferred services\\"; thus motor vehicle registrations are now issued by the Guernsey Government upon application to the General Office of the States of Alderney at the Island Hall in Alderney. Registration certificates (known informally as 'log books', as in the UK) are issued by Guernsey on the States of Guernsey's Environment Department logo, but with the issuing authority stated as the States of Alderney. Because of this, the international designator for Guernsey may be displayed on the car instead of GBA, if preferred by the car's owner (this is relatively rare, however). There are no legal requirements as to how an Alderney plate is to be made up ‚Äì the Alderney Road Traffic Ordinance appears to be silent on this. Alderney plates are commonly seen as either white or silver on a black background (pre-1973 UK style), or black on the white or yellow (both pre-2001 and post-2001 UK typeface styles).

It is one of the densely populated Awo-Omamma rural settlements in the Njaba River basin. Location Umuezukwe is located strategically on the bank of Njaba River in the southern end, facing Ngbelle, Abiaziem, Awa, Ndegwu and Izombe, just across the river. Politically, Umuezukwe is in Eziawo Ward II of Awo-Omamma in Oru East.It is bordered by Isieke Community to the East, Umuezike to the West, Otulu in Oru West to the North-East, and Onitsha-Owerri Expressway to the extreme North, which cuts through Awo-Omamma Junction. Oil Palm Trade Like some other Awo-Omamma villages on the banks of Njaba River, Umuezukwe was known for its oil palm trade during the era of international oil palm business. The then government of Eastern Region operated an Oil mill factory near Njaba River waterfront in Umuezukwe. In addition to the government managed Umuezukwe Oil mill, private businesses moved in, established and operated their commercial mills within the community and its neighbours. Due to the lucrative oil palm trade and the commercial waterway in the region, the community's Eke Market held on the river beach, becoming a converging point for local and international traders, thus supporting the larger market of neighbouring Oguta. The market was renamed 'Eke Beach Umuezukwe'. The economic activities around the entire area turned Umuezukwe into one of the renowned river ports in the basin, and an economic hub for exports and evacuation of goods to and from the Eastern coast via Orashi River-Oguta Lake-Njaba River routes. Early Christian Mission Umuezukwe is a peace-loving accommodaing and friendly village. It was among the early communities in the Njaba/Orashi River region, and the first in Awo-Omamma to embrace Christianity. This was possible because of its location on Njaba River-Oguta Lake-Orashi River navigable waterways and trade route. =Parish= The Irish Christian missionaries founded St Anthony's Catholic Church, Umuezukwe, in the 1890s. On 28 March 2013, the Roman Catholic Church confirmed Umuezukwe as a parish at the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Orlu. =Education= In 1897, the foundation blocks for St Anthony's Primary School, Umuezukwe, was laid. The school was eventually completed in 1908. Following government take over of the management of the School from the church, it was renamed Umuezukwe Primary School, a public institution. Analysis of survey conducted on 16 April 2014 for combined Pre-primary and Primary Schools showed the school was understaffed and in need of modern and adequate classrooms to support effective teaching and learning. Specifically, the survey found that the school had 345 learners served by 5 teachers and 9 classrooms. That is, 185 male students and 160 female students. Tourism Umuezukwe has a number of tourism potentials capable of lifting its economy and that of the entire river basin. In addition to its Ughamiri (local name for Njaba River) waterfront, oil-palm forest, Umuezukwe is known in the region for its sacred monkeys which exist and move freely in their natural habitat within the 'Afo' sacred forest, and in the community. The ancient economic nerve, Umuezukwe, and the entire Awo-Omamma people are also rich in cultural festivals, masks, and dance. Sections of Awo-Omamma closer the river are in lowlands. Umuezukwe, other Awo-Omamma and Oguta LGA communities across the river such as Ubahaeze, Umuezike, Umuelibe, Ngbelle, Abiaziem, Ndegwu and Awa, have hilly areas and valleys with forests just before the waterfronts on both sides. In addition, the relics of the historic Umuezukwe Oil mill on the beach, the historic and asphalt-needed 'Umuezukwe Road' washing unto Njaba River, and the relics of St Anthony's Primary school building, are other attractive sites in the community. The historic network of roads in Umuezukwe aided the lucrative trade and farming relationships with neighbours and other riverine communities in Oguta LGA, Ohaji/Egbema, and Rivers State through Njaba River-Oguta Lake-Orashi River navigable waterways to the Eastern coast. There is also the Palm Beach Villa, an old holiday resort, founded by Dr BU Nzeribe, on the southwest of the community along the waterfront. Cash Crops In addition to its known cassava, yam and fish produce, Umuezukwe produced and earned income from cashew nuts from the community's cashew plantain in the hilly lowland valled region known as Aba-Umuezukwe. Economic challenges Poor and undeveloped road conditions coupled with unreliable electricity supply are some of the serious infrastructure and environmental challenges working against the restoration of the economic potentials of Umuezukwe, the entire Awo-Omamma and rural farming border communities in Oguta LGA. =Rural Access Road= The river basin's rural communities have huge economic potentials, including arable land and fishing ports for farming, that require basic infrastructure, more importantly interconnecting roads and bridge across Njaba River to link up \\"Umuezukwe Road\\" to their neighbours in Oguta LGA, in order to unlock the economic potentials and improve the lives of residents and businesses in Oru East and Oguta LGA communities. The trade and historic route to and from Orlu communities connecting Omuma, Amiri, passing through Umuezukwe over Njaba River, Oguta to the Eastern coast and other Niger Delta communities, needs to be developed, bridged and asphalted to improve economic activities - movement of goods and people in the region. Umuezukwe has produced a number of notable people such as; Morgan K Orioha, Theophilus Kingsley C and many others.

One of the 4-IPO metabolites is toxic to the lungs, liver and kidney in humans and animals. This metabolite can covalently bind to proteins, thereby interfering with normal cell processes. The toxic metabolite, an enedial, is mostly formed in the bronchiolar exocrine cells (club cells) in the lungs of rodents. Necrosis of bronchiolar cells is therefore the primary damaging effect of the toxin, due to this location of metabolism. The secondary pathological effects are edema, congestion and hemorrhage caused by the destruction of the bronchiolar exocrine cells. In humans the metabolite is mostly formed in the liver, and causes liver toxicity.  Structure and reactivity  4-Ipomeanol is a chemical compound belonging to the family of furans. It consists of a furan ring, which is substituted at the third carbon of the furan ring with a pentanone containing a hydroxyl group. A furan ring is a five-membered aromatic ring consisting of one oxygen atom and four carbon atoms; a pentanone is a ketone consisting of five carbon atoms. Other 3-substituted furans are ipomeanine (IPN), 1-ipomeanol (1-IPO) and 1,4-ipomeanol (DIOL), differing in the locations of the hydroxyl groups. 4-IPO has three functional groups which determine the molecule's reactivity. These are the furan ring, the ketone group and the alcohol group. = Reactivity of furan ring = The furan ring is aromatic according to H√ºckel‚Äôs rule, so the furan makes the compound relatively stable. Therefore, this ring will not react easily with other compounds. Furan is heterocyclic, which means that it is cyclic, but one or more of the ring atoms is not a carbon atom. In the case of furan this heteroatom is an oxygen atom. This atom is sp2 hybridized and has one lone pair in an sp2 orbital and a second lone pair in a p orbital, overlapping with the p orbitals of adjacent carbons. This results in a pi bond formation. = Reactivity of ketone = A ketone group is polar, as oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. Therefore, the carbonyl atom of the ketone group is electron deficient, thus electrophilic, and can easily react with nucleophiles. However, it does not undergo substitution reactions, as the attached molecule is a too strong base to be eliminated. As a result of this, irreversible nucleophilic addition reactions are possible: a nucleophile can add to the carbonyl carbon, but due to the lack of a good leaving group, no base is eliminated. This intermediate molecule takes up a proton, so a hydroxyl group is formed. When there is sufficient acid present, the hydroxyl group can be protonated further, making it a good leaving group. This functional group will then react as an alcohol group. As described above is the basic reaction mechanism of ketones. In this way ketones can undergo several organic reactions, reacting with compounds like grignard reagents, acetylide, cyanide, and hydride ions, amines, water, alcohols and peroxyacids. = Reactivity of alcohol = The alcohol group is a strongly basic leaving group that cannot undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions. However, it becomes a better leaving group after protonation, which converts the leaving group from OH‚àí to H2O. H2O is a weaker base than OH‚àí and can thus undergo substitution reactions with weakly basic nucleophiles. This reaction occurs following a SN2 mechanism, as 4-IPO is a secondary alcohol. Dehydration of the at the pentanone substituted alcohol group is also possible, following an E1 reaction mechanism. This reaction is acid-catalyzed and results in the loss of a water molecule. Like with the SN1 reaction, protonation of the leaving group is required first. Water then is eliminated, leaving behind a carbocation, which leads eventually to alkene formation. Furthermore, secondary alcohols can undergo oxidation reactions. This results in the formation of a ketone.  Synthesis  left 4-IPO can be isolated from sweet potatoes infected with the fungus Fusarium solani. However, it can also be synthesized from the commercially available chemical diethyl 3,4-furandicarboxylate. Partial hydrolysis of diethyl 3,4-furandicarboxylate (I) with an equimolar quantity of NaOH results in the monoester 4-(ethoxycarbonyl)furan-3-carboxylic acid (II) occurs. This is followed by decarboxylation by heating with a copper powder yielded ethyl 3-furoate (III). The Claisen condensation is used to form ethyl 3-furoylacetate (IV). By reacting with propylene oxide, lactone (V) is formed. Decarboxylation is achieved by gently heating lactone in the presence of diluted acid (VI).  Metabolism  Metabolic activation of 4-IPO occurs by one of the enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily. The oxidation of the furan ring leads to the formation of an unstable epoxide (cyclic ester with a three-atom ring), so an alkylating intermediate species, 4-IPO enedial, is formed. In rodents it is CYP4B1 that activates 4-IPO [1], an enzyme of the CYP4 family, of which the CYP4B subfamily is involved in the fatty acid metabolism. CYP4B1 is present in high levels in the lungs and its affinity for 4-IPO is greater than for liver CYP enzymes. Therefore, the activated form of 4-IPO is mainly toxic to the lungs in rodents. Schematic illustrating bioactivation versus inactivation routes for 4-IPO after either P450- or uridine 5‚Ä≤-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase-mediated metabolism However, in humans the reactivity of CYP4B1 is different and it does not activate 4-IPO. The CYP enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are active in the liver and are similar to the rodent CYP4B1. 4-IPO is thus metabolically activated by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in humans. These two enzymes are both part of several pathways involved in the drug metabolism. As both CYPs are mainly active in the liver, 4-IPO causes hepatotoxicity in humans. In both rodents and humans phase I metabolism involves the biotransformation of 4-IPO into an epoxide intermediate by CYPs. This epoxide is unstable, so it degrades into an enedial intermediate. The enedial intermediate is toxic, as it can bind to proteins. However, it can be detoxified in phase II metabolism, in which the enedial can be conjugated with either N-acetyl lysine (NAL) or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). This results in a NAL/NAC-IPO adduct, which can be excreted. Furthermore, 4-IPO can directly undergo phase II metabolism, by conjugating glucuronosyl to the hydroxyl group of 4-IPO by uridine 5‚Äô-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), forming 4-IPO glucuronide. This can, like the NAL/NAC-IPO adduct, be excreted. However, the major pathway involves the enedial intermediate and the NAL/NAC-IPO adduct is the major product of biotransformation. In contrast with these findings of in vivo studies, several other pathways for biotransformation of 4-IPO are found in vitro. In vitro microsomal incubation of 4-IPO and its GSH adducts as products Next to oxidation of the furan ring of 4-IPO, so that the 4-IPO enedial is formed, the hydroxyl group of 4-IPO can be oxidized. Oxidation of this functional group leads to ketone formation, so IPN is formed. IPN can undergo oxidation of the furan ring by CYPs, like 4-IPO. After this bioactivation reaction, the product can be conjugated to glutathione (GSH) by glutathione-S-transferase (GST). Furthermore, 4-IPO can be reduced and DIOL is the product of this biotransformation. Finally, 4-IPO can interact with NADP+, forming a molecule which contains 4-IPO and NADPH. Of these four pathways described, the oxidation to IPN and the reduction to DIOL are the major processes. Next to the difference in possible metabolic reactions 4-IPO can undergo, there is also a difference in the metabolization of the reactive 4-IPO enedial. This compound can be metabolized by either UGT or GSH. Metabolization by UGT results in NAL/NAC-IPO adducts, while multiple products can be the result of GSH metabolism. Interaction of the 4-IPO enedial with GSH leads both to a Michael adduct and a dihydrohydroxyfuran adduct. The Michael adduct is the product of a Michael addition (1,4-addition of a cysteine), of the cysteine in GSH at the 4-position of the enedial. This Michael adduct can undergo dehydration and forms, via a tricyclic 2‚Äô-pyrroline adduct (14), a mono-GSH pyrrole adduct (16). Another reaction the Michael adduct can undergo is again dehydration and conjugation with GSH. Via the formation of subsequently an imine, enamine and an iminium ion, a bis-GSH pyrrole adduct (18) is formed. Another reaction via which the Michael adduct can form a bis- GSH pyrrole adduct (20), is firstly by undergoing elimination of a ketone group, followed by again dehydration in combination with GSH conjugation. The dihydrohydroxyfuran adduct can also undergo dehydration in combination with GSH conjugation in a similar way as the Michael adduct, which results in a bis-GSH pyrrole adduct (19). Furthermore, the dihydrohydroxyfuran can dehydrate and form a mono-GSH pyrrole adduct (17).  Pharmacological use  Distribution of 4-IPO across tissues shows the same patterns for intravenous, oral and intraperitoneal injection and peak concentrations are achieved one to two hours after administration. By then most of the 4-IPO will be located in the lungs, followed by liver, kidney and blood. Apart from having the highest 4-IPO concentration, lung cells also show the highest level of covalently bound 4-IPO. This is in contrast with the gut, where the most occurring form of 4-IPO is unbound. After four hours 4-IPO levels show a plateau which persists for 24 hours. 4-IPO molecules still present at that time are mostly bound to other macromolecules. The IC50 was determined by an automated cell culture growth inhibition assay which shows IC50 ranging from 2-8 mM, depending on the cell type. The IC50 was also determined by another group which found roughly the same. Detoxification is suspected to occur primarily via glucuronidation of 4-IPO. Out of all the metabolites found in urine, the primary excretion pathway, 4-IPO glucuronide was the most abundant. Excretion of 4-IPO glucuronide can be increased when rats were treated with phenobarbital, which increases Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity. Half-life varies from species to species. In mice the half-life is approximately 33 minutes after intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg 4-IPO. This is lower in rats and dogs. Rats need around six minutes to reduce the 4-IPO concentration by half and dogs around ten minutes. Both were administered a single intravenous dose of 6 mg/kg. = Preclinical trials = Several in vitro experiments were performed to explore the possible uses of 4-IPO, which showed promising results. Different lung, ovarian, breast and melanoma cancer cell lines showed apoptosis or inhibited tumor growth when exposed to high levels of 4-IPO (100 ug/uL). These results could not be replicated in conventional cancer screens, probably due to the fact that 4-IPO metabolism relies on very specific enzymes and environments which could not be replicated by conventional screens. However, 4-IPO showed effects when exposed to human lung cell lines. Four cell lines were tested and two showed inhibited tumor growth. Both cell lines were non-small cell lung carcinoma, while the two cell lines with no effects were small cell tumors. Other experiments showed that 4-IPO reduced tumor growth in a microencapsulated tumor assay at a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Furthermore, covalent binding of 4-IPO intermediates was observed in fresh lung biopsies. = Phase I Trial= On the basis of this knowledge a phase I trial was performed to study the effects of 4-IPO on the human body. 34 men and 10 women with non-small cell lung cancer were tested. The trial showed no significant hematological or renal toxicity but also no effect on the tumor. Measurements with biopsies obtained from the patients showed an IC50 of 6 mM, which is around 75 times higher than the measured plasma concentrations and likely higher than the plasma concentration achievable in vivo. = Phase II Trial= An earlier phase I and pharmacological trial showed that hepatotoxicity is dose limiting in humans and not lung toxicity. Based on these results a phase II trial was conducted to test the effects of 4-IPO on patients with advanced measurable hepatocellular carcinoma. Nineteen patients were treated with 1032 mg/m2 4-IPO. One patient showed a brief reduction in metastasis in the lung, but the rest showed no significant effects. As a consequence the authors recommend that 4-IPO is not used for further testing. = Further use in cancer treatment = Recently 4-IPO has been used in experiments where it plays a role in T-cell therapy. Autologous T-cells can be altered to express tumor specific antigens. These cells will then bind to tumors and induce apoptosis. There are side-effects associated with this kind of treatment and 4-IPO can help to control those side effects. A suicide gene is needed to induce apoptosis in T-cells when needed. CYP4B1 is inactive in humans but with minor changes in the amino acid sequence it can be activated again. This would result in T-cell death when the cells are exposed to 4-IPO, because they metabolize 4-IPO efficiently. Non toxic 4-IPO analogues are also capable of inhibiting nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK) metabolism. NNK is a pre- carcinogen which is activated inside the lung. Out of the four analogues tested (4-hydroxy-lphenyl-1-pentanone (HPP); 7-hydroxy-1-phenyl-1-octanone (HPO); 4-hydroxy-1- (2-thienyl)-1-pentanone (HTP); 4-hydroxy-l-(3-pyridyl)-l-pentanone (HPYP)) HPP and HPO showed competitive and noncompetitive inhibition of NNK and it reduces tumor formation in mice.  Toxicity  4-IPO is a specific lethal toxicant which mainly targets bronchiolar exocrine cells in the smaller bronchioles of rodent and cattle lungs. With an increased dosis it is also possible to affect other cells and the airway of organisms. Covalent binding of 4-IPO to members of the CYP family (mainly CYP4B1) eventually leads to biotransformation of 4-IPO into an enedial intermediate, which is able to bind to a variety of proteins. These binding events are permanent and responsible for 4-IPO toxicity. This will result in cytotoxicity and eventually necrosis of bronchiolar exocrine cells, while ciliated bronchiolar cells and other epithelial lung cells are not affected, due to lower levels of cytochrome proteins. Necrotic patches, also called lesions or primary pathological changes, can develop into edemas, resulting in thickening of the alveolar septum, congestion, and hemorrhage (secondary and tertiary pathological changes). Lethality is probably due to pulmonary edema. Prior to death the dogs also showed rapid and shallow respiration, while in rats labored respiration and lymphocyte depletion can be observed. The LD50 dose varies between different species. In female mice 21 mg/kg/day 4-IPO are sufficient while in male mice 35 mg/kg/day were necessary. 15 mg/kg 4-IPO intravenously administered into rats is lethal and in dogs this dose is 12 mg/kg. It is possible to increase the LD50 by 2‚Äì4.5 fold when individuals are treated with multiple non-toxic doses beforehand. In humans, 4-IPO shows minimal effects in the lung because the enzymes needed for biotransformation of 4-IPO are not present. Instead the liver is affected, because human liver cells do contain enzymes to biotransform 4-IPO. Something similar can be observed in male mice. Apart from the effects seen in the lungs they also have certain enzymes in their kidney which can transform 4-IPO into its reactive intermediate. As a result, renal toxicity is observed. Female mice and immature male mice do not have these enzymes. Therefore, they are resistant to renal toxicity.  Effects on animals  4-IPO has, similar to humans, a toxic effect on animals. It is toxic to livestock and many laboratory animals. Male rabbits, mice, rats and hamsters were used to test the effect of 4-IPO on. In all four species, the lung was a major target. In the hamsters and mice additional liver necrosis and renal necrosis, respectively, was detected. 4-IPO can also threaten newborn calves. If they become exposed to 4-IPO it increases their susceptibility to bovine parainfluenza virus 3. Parainfluenza itself does not have severe health effects but together with other infections it can lead to complex enzootic pneumonia.

As a journalist in Berlin, Hirsch was involved in the infamous libel case of Kurt Soelling. Biography =Early life= Hirsch studied history at the University of Heidelberg where he graduated under German historian and political journalist, Hermann Oncken in 1924.Hirsch,1946 After university, Hirsch moved to Berlin to pursue a career in journalism at the Berliner Tagelblatt and later became the editor at the Achtuhr Abendblatt. Following the rise of Nazism, Hirsch went into exile in America, and completed a librarian degree at Columbia University in 1936. He subsequently moved to Bard College, where he would teach history and expand the library. =Kurt Soelling Controversy= On the 18th May 1932, Judge Kurt Soelling (born Seligsohn), the Chairman of the Berlin District Court, brought a libel action against Hirsch for an article he wrote in the Achtuhr Abendblatt that revealed Soelling's Jewish identity. Soelling was born into a Jewish family, but baptised a protestant in later life. He had been a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany but in 1931, declared himself a Monarchist and became a prominent supporter of the burgeoning Nazi party and Adolf Hitler. Hirsch's article not only revealed the judge's Jewish identity, but alleged that he had converted to Protestantism to further his judicial career. Hirsch denounced Soelling as a \\"dishonest politician\\". The case concluded on the 19th May 1932, with Soelling admitting that he was of Jewish descent, but that he had converted out of conviction. He explained his activities within the Nazi Party as an attempt to understand the organisation, and justified his use of the Nazi salute by the fact that everyone else at the rallies he attended had used it. Hirsch lost the libel case, and was ordered to pay damages of 500 Reichsmark. According to a dispatch issued by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency regarding the intriguing proceedings: > There was something of a sensation in court when it came out in the course > of the proceedings that Judge Soelling is the son of the lay head of the > Romberg Jewish Community, and that he had held over his baptism until after > the death of a rich uncle who was a strictly observant Jew, so that he > should not be cut out of his will, and that he had been baptised only after > he had received the legacy. Justice Soelling was eventually disbarred and forbidden to practice law in Germany as a result of the Nazis' anti-Semitic reforms of 1933. =Marriage and children= He married long-term friend, academic Elisabeth Feist in 1938, and they had two children together. Towards the end of his life, he suffered from Parkinson's disease. He died in 1982, at a retirement home in Newtown, Pennsylvania.  Notes  References * Mosse, W. E. (1965).

Built in 1982 by Burrard Yarrows Corporation in Vancouver, British Columbia, she was part of the fleet of Canadian icebreakers, drillships and support vessels operated by Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the drilling subsidiary of Dome Petroleum and later Amoco Canada Petroleum Company. In 1997, the vessel was sold to China Oilfield Services and renamed Bin Hai 293. She was used to support offshore oil production in the Bohai Sea until 2016 when the 34-year-old icebreaker was sold for scrapping.  History  = Development and construction = In the mid-1970s, Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar), the drilling subsidiary of Dome Petroleum, began drilling for oil in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea using ice-strengthened drillships and an extensive support fleet of icebreaking vessels. Aiming for year-round operations, the company also began developing its own experimental icebreaker concepts to support exploration drilling and, eventually, production-related operations. The first vessel of this research and development program was the 1979-built Canmar Kigoriak which represented a radical departure from conventional icebreaker designs with, among other features, a single-shaft mechanical propulsion system instead of a more commonly-used diesel-electric powertrain. Following the successful demonstration of Kigoriaks icebreaking capability in the Beaufort Sea, it was agreed to continue the program with the construction of a second vessel. In addition to testing new design features such as an improved hull form and twin-shaft propulsion system, the new icebreaker would be a 4:1 scale model of a proposed Arctic tanker intended for transporting oil year-round from the Canadian Arctic to the market. The construction of new icebreaking supply vessel was awarded to Burrard Yarrows Co. in Vancouver, British Columbia, in June 1979. The keel was laid on 8 October 1981, only about one month after the construction had begun, and the hull was launched on 26 May 1982. The icebreaker was delivered to Canmar on 24 September 1982. Canmar's new icebreaker was named after Robert LeMeur (1920‚Äì1985), a French-born priest- missionary who arrived to Tuktoyaktuk in 1946. He was awarded the Membership of the Order of Canada in 1982 for his efforts to preserve and promote the Inuit culture.Robert LeMeur, C.M., o.m.i.. The Governor General of Canada. = Robert LeMeur (1982‚Äì1997) = Robert LeMeur was designed to support seasonal exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea. Her typical annual operational profile would begin in May with a warm-up that would gradually bring the vessel systems online after five months of cold lay-up. After commencing break-out, the Canmar icebreakers would first carry out one or more resupply missions to the drilling islands where exploratory activities have continued through the winter. In June, the icebreakers would return to the winter base to escort the drillships to predetermined drilling locations. Once the spread-mooring system had been deployed and drilling commenced, the icebreakers would remain on site to carry out ice management by breaking up large floes that could threaten the drilling operation. Once all ice had melted, Robert LeMeur would continue with supply missions to different Beaufort Sea drilling operations. In the autumn, the Canmar icebreakers would return to continue ice management around the drillships until ice would become too thick for the mooring systems. By the end of November, the drillships would be escorted back for winter lay-up and Robert LeMeur would carry out final supply runs to the drilling islands. Although the vessel would typically be laid up for winter in mid-December, she was capable of continuing supply operations through the winter. In some years, Robert LeMeur was involved in research and development projects during the winter months or drydocked on Canmar's floating dock for inspection and repairs. In 1982‚Äì1989, the Canmar drillships drilled only 10 wells for Dome Petroleum and other oil companies in the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea. In addition, four more wells were drilled by the drillships in the Alaskan waters in 1985‚Äì1991. Other wells were drilled from artificial drilling islands as well as novel drilling systems such as Kulluk and the single steel drilling caisson.Beufort Sea Exploration Wells. BOEM. While a number of oil and gas discoveries were made, none of the findings were sufficient to warrant commercial production. Following the falling oil prices in the 1980s and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, hydrocarbon exploration in the Beaufort Sea and the MacKenzie Delta gradually ended.Oil and Gas Exploration & Development Activity Forecast, Canadian Beaufort Sea 2013-2028. Lin Callow, LTLC Consulting, March 2013. Robert LeMeur was reportedly laid up in 1996. The experience gained from Robert LeMeur and the other Canmar icebreakers was used in the design of the 1988-built Swedish icebreaker Oden which incorporates some design aspects of the Canadian icebreakers' hull form, propulsion and auxiliary systems used to reduce ice resistance.New Powerful Icebreaker Under Construction At Gotaverken Arendal.

After having been reflagged to Liberia and renamed Robert for a short period of time, the former Robert LeMeur was acquired by a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation and renamed Bin Hai 293.Êª®Êµ∑293, meaning \\"Coastal 293\\". She became part of a large fleet of vessels distinguished only by number and was used to support Chinese offshore platforms in the seasonally frozen Bohai Sea. Bin Hai 293 was sold for breaking in late 2016. At the time, the vessel originally built for the Canadian Arctic had spent more than half of her 34-year-long career in the Bohai Sea under the Chinese flag. The decision to scrap the old icebreaker was likely related to the large fleet renewal program, which included ice- strengthened tonnage, carried out by China Oilfield Services.Shipbreaking Bulletin of information and analysis on ship demolition #46, from October 1 to December 31, 2016. Robin Des Bois, 31 January 2017. Despite having been sold for demolition already in 2016, the AIS transponder of Bin Hai 293 was still active in March 2017, showing the vessel moored at Tianjin.  Design  = General characteristics = The main dimensions of Robert LeMeur were dictated by the various design constrains. The length overall, , was the maximum that would still allow the vessel to come alongside spread-moored drillships. The beam, at reamers and amidships, was governed by the propulsion machinery that was ordered early in the design process. While the initial requirements called for an operating draught of , the icebreaking draught was later increased to when the ice class of the vessel was upgraded from CASPPRCanadian Arctic Shipping Pollution Prevention Regulations Class 2 to Class 3. In addition, since it was decided not to dredge the Tuktoyaktuk harbour to a greater depth, Robert LeMeur was also designed to carry as cargo as possible at a lower draught of . The displacement of the vessel at design waterline was 5,853 tonnes, corresponding to a deadweight of 2,690 tonnes.Robert LeMeur: A Supply Ship for the Arctic. Motor Ship, 63, 1983, p. 36. Robert LeMeur had a spoon- shaped icebreaking bow designed to minimize ice resistance, a further development of Canmar Kigoriaks hull form. The bow was also fitted with reamers that made it about wider than the vertical-sided midbody, breaking a wider channel that would help with turning in difficult ice conditions. The deckhouse was mounted forward of a open cargo deck and nine bulk cargo silos. The superstructure design was chosen to minimize vibrations and maximize visibility from the one-man primary conning position. She had accommodation for 14 crew members and 12 supernumeraries. Under the main deck, Robert LeMeur had a full-length double hull as per Canmar policy. = Power and propulsion = Robert LeMeur had a diesel-mechanical propulsion system with two diesel engines driving controllable pitch propellers in nozzles. The main engines were supercharged 12-cylinder MaK 12M453 medium-speed diesel engines rated at each. The engines were fitted with oversized flywheels to increase the inertia of the propulsion system against ice impact. The shaftlines were placed so close to each other that the nozzles in the stern were actually joined together. Onboard electricity was generated by four Caterpillar D399 auxiliary generating sets. For maneuvering, Robert Lemeur had twin rudders with a maximum turning angle of 45 degrees and two transverse bow thrusters. For icebreaking operations, Robert LeMeur had an extensive outfit of various \\"ice management systems\\" designed to reduce friction between ice and the hull of the vessel. A powerful hull wash system could be used to wet the snow on ice ahead of the vessel by spraying water through eighteen openings on the hull, reducing the ice resistance by 20 to 30 percent based on ice trials in various ice conditions. A secondary system could be used to pump water below the waterline between hull and ice floes. Two air bubbler systems were fitted: one in the bow to lubricate the hull and another in the stern to prevent ice from entering the nozzles. The hull was coated with an abrasion-resistant low- friction epoxy paint. Finally, a heeling system capable of rocking the vessel back and forth could be used to prevent the vessel from getting stuck and assist in turning. In ice, Robert LeMeur could achieve a speed of . The maximum icebreaking capability was predicted to be about . In open water, the vessel could reach a speed of . The bollard pull of the icebreaker was 103 tons.

History Cox was born in London, \\"within the sound of Bow Bells\\", a son of a hat-maker with an established business in the city. He was educated at St Saviour's School, a classmate of Sydney Waterlow. Cox served an apprenticeship, but left the trade to train as a schoolteacher at the Normal College, Borough Road, run by the British and Foreign Bible Society. The principal, Henry Dunn (1800‚Äì1878), author of Principles of Teaching, or The Normal School Handbook 1837, offered him a position with the projected branch of the school in Cairo, but the scheme changed with the Egyptian boys being brought to London instead, and Cox was put in charge of a school in Gloucester. While there, he served as lay preacher at the village of Longney. His next post was to a school in Croydon, then was trained as a missionary at the Congregational Home Mission College, near Bedford. He was then sent to serve as pastor at the Congregational Church at Market Weighton in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and after four years received the call to Adelaide, which he accepted, perhaps influenced by his sister Martha Cox (1826 ‚Äì 25 June 1919), who married Charles Cleeve Collison (1820 ‚Äì 7 November 1884) and was mother of Charles Nicholas Collison and emigrated to South Australia in 1849 or 1850. :The Congregational (or \\"Independent\\") Church in Adelaide, founded by T. Q. Stow, from November 1840 had a chapel in Freeman Street (later part of Gawler Place). In 1851 a breakaway group led by William Peacock and I. J. Barclay founded their \\"Ebenezer Chapel\\" opened in June 1851 on land donated by Peacock near the old East Terrace Market. Cox arrived in South Australia with his widowed mother Sarah Cox (c. 1891 ‚Äì 3 December 1865) aboard Victoria in November 1857 and preached his first sermon at the Ebenezer Place (named for the chapel and not vice versa) chapel. Soon the little church (\\"obscurely situated in a dirty lane off Rundle street\\" ‚Äî Rev. W. Harcus) was full to overflowing, and a larger premises was clearly called for. :A public meeting was held at White's Assembly Rooms, with William Peacock presiding over a gathering of 1,000 people. Vigorous addresses were delivered by the Hons. J. H. Barrow, Alexander Hay and Thomas Reynolds and Revs. William Butters, William Harcus, and Silas Mead of the Flinders Street Baptist Church, and as a result plans for a new building were soon under way. :The cornerstone of the new Hindmarsh Square Church was laid by William Peacock on 21 August 1861 and new building, built to seat 450 and with its schoolroom and vestries completed a year later. Rev. Cox preached his first sermon in the new church on Sunday 7 September, assisted by Charles Manthorpe, and C. W. Evan, and was uninterruptedly associated with this church until 1897. He had a most harmonious relationship with his \\"flock\\", and resisted invitations, possibly more lucrative, to leave for Melbourne. He has been described as a tireless worker for the sick, the aged and the dispossessed, notably the Aboriginal population. He was closely connected with the London Missionary Society, the South Australian Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society and Union College. Cox was twice Chairman of the Congregational Union, and occupied the post of secretary for 17 years. He was secretary of the Fraternal Association of Congregational Ministers and chairman of the Aborigines' Friends' Association. He was, with George Taplin, largely instrumental in establishing the Point Mcleay Mission. Cox was an authority on art and frequently called upon to act as judge at art exhibitions conducted by schools and amateur art groups, but reluctantly had to relinquish this pleasant duty when faced with failing eyesight. He resigned his pastorate on 21 November 1897 and died eight years later, and was succeeded by Rev. S. Lenton, who served the Hindmarsh Square Church from 1898 to 1904.

He had one elder brother, Justus (1789‚Äì1869),Breuker 1993, p. 588.Terpstra, p. 316. and two younger brothers, Binnert (1795‚Äì1847), and Eeltsje (1797‚Äì1858). Two children who were born later died in early childhood, the little boy in 1803, and the little girl in 1805. The brothers were very close, possibly as a consequence of the fact that both their parents died at a relatively young age in 1809, when Tsjalling was only seventeen years of age.Wiersma, pp. 8‚Äì9. Justus, Tsjalling and Eeltsje, who, as authors, became known as the Brothers Halbertsma later in life,Hemminga, p. 56. were much like their father, while Binnert more resembled their mother. This mother, Ruerdtsje Binnerts, was a scion of a prominent family in Grou. Her people were Mennonites, and although her husband had been raised a Calvinist, he converted after marrying her. From the letters of Tsjalling's brother Justus, Ruerdtsje emerges as a smart businesswoman, a loving mother, and a deeply religious person.Wiersma, p. 8. About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a mariner before his marriage. He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases. =Nature= Tsjalling Halbertsma was, according to his brother Justus, an imitator of great skill, a trait he had inherited from their father. Justus also wrote about him, \\"There was no greater lover of silliness and jokes in all of Friesland than my brother Tsjalling; but, mark this, always in the wasted hours. When it was time for business, all of the joking stopped, and then activity, policy, hard work and calculations were the order of the day from early in the morning to late in the evening.\\" One of his biographers (J. P. Wiersma) described Tsjalling Halbertsma as \\"a talented, conspicuous person, full of drollery, not without vanity, but original in thought and word, distinctive in all his doings, a trendsetter.\\"Wiersma, p. 13. A different biographer (G. A. Wumkes) wrote about him: \\"Here the pen is wielded by a man of high character.\\"Wumkes, p. 485. =Trade= When Hidde Halbertsma died, in January 1809, and was followed in death by his wife Ruerdtsje Binnerts in December of that same year, the Brothers Halbertsma became orphans at a young age. Justus, the eldest brother, was in Amsterdam at that time, studying to become a minister, while Eeltsje, the youngest, was boarding in the provincial capital of Leeuwarden, where he attended the Latin school. In consequence, it fell to Tsjalling to keep their father's bakery running with the help of their father's baker's mates, until the third brother, Binnert, was old enough to take over the business. After that, Tsjalling Halbertsma started to work for one of his uncles in Grou, who was a merchant trading in butter and cheese. At that time farmer's wives churned and made cheese at the farmstead, selling their products to merchants who traded it away, not seldom to foreign markets.Twerda, p. 296. In time, Halbertsma took over his uncle's company, which he expanded steadily over the course of many years.Terpstra, p. 320. At first he worked on commission for the Amsterdam trading house of Pijnakker, but later on, he went into business for himself, buying up dairy products in Friesland and selling them with considerable profit in London. Halbertsma became a wealthy man, who, with his brother Binnert (who had sold the bakery and had become a wood merchant) and only ten others, such as Freerk Dirks Fontein of Harlingen, Michiel Hylkes Tromp of Woudsend, Hans Klazes Wouda of Sneek and Dirk Piers Zeper of Leeuwarden was a member of the new Frisian Chamber of Commerce. Furthermore, from 1850 to his death, he had a seat in the provincial assembly of Friesland. In 1837, Halbertsma had himself a large new house built in Grou, something his brothers were rather boastful of in their letters. He also dressed himself according to the latest fashion, leading to Eeltsje complaining, in 1841, that his brother had become a dandy. But in the end Halbertsma miscalculated badly: when the shares in other businesses he had invested in dropped sharply in value in 1848, he panicked, sold out, and put all his money in rye. When subsequently the rye market also collapsed, he suffered heavy losses amounting to about half of his fortune. This was a severe blow, especially to his ego, which he never truly recovered from. =Family= In 1813, Halbertsma married Tetsje Sjollema (1793‚Äì1836). She was from Grou, and he had known her for all of his life. A year after she died, he remarried, to Reinskje van der Goot (1807‚Äì1862), who was also from Grou. When this second marriage was contracted, he ordered fifty flags to be hung out in the village, and he gave away a fat cow to the poor. One of Halbertsma's sons from his first marriage, Johannes Tsjallings Halbertsma (1827‚Äì1884), took over the dairy trade after his father's death, and moved it to the city of Sneek.Schroor, p. 1125. There Halbertsma's grandsons Hylke (1857‚Äì1932) and Herrius (1864‚Äì1920) established the dairy Normandia in 1888. =Authorship= Tsjalling Halbertsma began his career as a writer in 1817, on occasion of his brother Binnert's wedding. Afterwards, he wrote fairly regularly until 1835, with a clear peak around 1830, later followed by incidental writings until 1841. The last eleven years of his live he did not produce any new works. He ofted used the pseudonyms 'Master Jouke' and T.T., which was an abbreviation of 'Tsjalling Tsysker' (\\"Tsjalling Cheese-maker\\").Dykstra en Oldenhof, p. 42. Halbertsma's literary works were always overshadowed to a large degree by those of his brothers Justus and Eeltsje; they consist of folk literature, often with a satirical or playful motif, which, however, was very popular with the common man. His Sets en Tsjerk yn Snitser Merk (\\"Sets and Tsjerk at the Fair yn Sneek\\") was almost a match for the more famous poem De Boalserter Merk (\\"The Bolsward Fair\\"), by his brother Eeltsje. Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma. Tsjalling Halbertsma's oeuvre was fairly limited,Terpstra, o. 320. and consisted for a large part of rhymes written for the occasion of Shrove Tuesday and New Year, weigh-house notes, accompanying texts for prints, and fortune-telling notes,Terpstra, p. 321. partly in West Frisian, but to a considerable degree, especially in the early years, in Dutch. Furthermore, it is known that, even before his brothers Justus and Eeltsje published their De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar in 1822, Tsjalling Halbertsma also wrote small tales and poems for a society in Grou. It is unclear what sort of society this was, but it seems very likely it was a remnant of a so-called 'people's society' from the French period, such as were established all over Friesland from 1795 on. Halbertsma published a number of his works in almanacs, although this was limited, insofar as it can still be determined, to the period from 1829 to 1833. The first of his works he had printed in an almanac must have been Sets en Tsjerk yn Snitser Merk, which appeared in Suringar's Almanak for the year 1829. Gerard Tjaard Nicolaas Suringar himself would assert years later that De B√™ste Freed yn Ljou'ter Merke (\\"The Best Friday of the Fair in Leeuwarden\\") was the first piece by Halbertsma which he had published, but he must have been mistaken, as it can be clearly shown from Justus Hiddes Halbertsma's letters that De B√™ste Freed appeared in Suringar's Almanak of 1830. Completely apart from the rest of Halbertsma's works is De Roeker (modern spelling: De R√ªker; \\"The Bouquet\\") a magazine which was edited by himself, and which included articles concerning topical subjects, but also some of his own tales and poems. Of this publication only a few volumes were published in 1832 and 1833. =Death= Tsjalling Hiddes Halbertsma died on December 12, 1852, in his birthplace of Grou, when he was almost 61 years old. When he was still alive, he had been the steadfast centre of the Halbertsmas of Grou, where his brothers Binnert and Eeltsje especially were often visiting and always welcome. According to his brother Justus, the family became \\"a scattered herd\\" after his death,Wiersma, p. 12. and Eeltsje wrote to Justus: \\"I feel like a soldier who has seen his best comrade sink down next to him on the field of battle.\\" Legacy After the death of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was gathered under the supervision of librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff.Breuker 1993, p. 604.Wiersma, p. 5. In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of Rimen en Teltsjes (\\"Rhymes and Tales\\").Dykstra and Oldenhof, p. 37.Terpstra, p. 313. Apart from a few of his poems and his part in De Skearwinkel fan Joutebaas (\\"Boss Joute's Barbershop\\"), Tsjalling Halbertsma works, however, remained outside of that collection. It was not until the fourth reprint of Rimen en Teltsjes, which was published in 1918 by publisher and bookshop owner Rinse van der Velde from Leeuwarden, that the composition of the work was thoroughly adjusted. At that time Tsjalling's contribution took a more visible form through the absorption of De Wiersizzerij fan Maaike Jakkeles (\\"The Fortune-telling of Maaike Jakkeles\\") and a number of shorter texts and poems. Today, Rimen en Teltsjes is seen as the national book of Western Frisian literature, and although the literary value of this collection was later disputed by some critics,Breuker 1993, pp. 594‚Äì596. it is undeniable that Rimen en Teltsjes and its predecessor De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar played a role of crucial importance in the development of a new literary tradition after Western Frisian had been used almost exclusively as a spoken language for three centuries. In 1949, author and literary critic Anne Wadman wrote that the Halbertsmas gave \\"the Western Frisian people a literary monument, in which it saw its own life as a nation [...] reflected.\\"Wadman, p. 14. As of today Rimen en Teltsjes still occupies the first slot in the ranking of Western Frisian literary classics.

Home energy storage devices store electricity locally, for later consumption. Electrochemical energy storage products, also known as \\"Battery Energy Storage System\\" (or \\"BESS\\" for short), at their heart are rechargeable batteries, typically based on lithium-ion or lead-acid controlled by computer with intelligent software to handle charging and dischargning cycles. Companies are also developing smaller flow battery technology for home use. As a local energy storage technologies for home use, they are smaller relatives of battery-based grid energy storage and support the concept of distributed generation. When paired with on-site generation, they can virtually eliminate blackouts in an off-the-grid lifestyle. Operating modes =On-site generation= The stored energy commonly originates from on-site solar photovoltaic panels, generated during daylight hours, and the stored electricity consumed after sundown, when domestic energy demand peaks in homes unoccupied during the day. Small wind turbine are less common but still available for home use as a complement or alternative to solar panels. Electric vehicles (EVs) used during weekdays, needing recharging overnight, are a good fit with home energy storage in homes with solar panels and low daylight-hour electrical consumption. EV manufacturers BMW, BYD, Nissan and Tesla market own-brand home energy storage devices to their customers. By 2019, such devices had not followed the price reduction of automotive batteries. The units can also be programmed to exploit a differential tariff, that provide lower priced energy during hours of low demand - seven hours from 12:30am in the case of Britain‚Äôs Economy 7 tariff - for consumption when prices are higher. Smart tariffs, stemming from the increasing prevalence of smart meters, will increasingly be paired with home energy storage devices to exploit low off-peak prices, and avoid higher-priced energy at times of peak demand. Advantages =Overcoming grid losses= Transmission of electrical power from power stations to population centres is inherently inefficient, due to transmission losses in electrical grids, particularly within power-hungry dense conurbations where power stations are harder to site. By allowing a greater proportion of on-site generated electricity to be consumed on-site, rather than exported to the energy grid, home energy storage devices can reduce the inefficiencies of grid transport. =Energy grid support= Home energy storage devices, when connected to a server via the internet, can theoretically be ordered to provide very short- term services to the energy grid:- * Reduced peak hour demand stress - provision of short-term demand response during periods of peak demand reducing the need to inefficiently standing up of short generation assets like diesel generators. * Frequency correction - the provision of ultra short-term corrections, to keep mains frequency within the tolerances required by regulators (e.g., 50 Hz or 60 Hz +/- n%). =Reduced reliance on fossil fuels= Due to the above efficiencies, and their ability to boost the amount of solar energy consumed on-site, the devices reduce the amount of power generated using fossil fuels, namely natural gas, coal, oil and diesel. Disadvantages =Environmental impact of batteries= Lithium-ion batteries, a popular choice due to their relatively high charge cycle and lack of memory effect, are difficult to recycle. Lead-acid batteries are relatively easier to recycle and, due to the high resale value of the lead, 99% of those sold in the US get recycled. They have much shorter useful lives than a lithium-ion battery of a similar capacity, due to having a lower charge cycle, narrowing the environmental-impact gap. In addition, lead is a toxic heavy metal and the sulfuric acid in the electrolyte has a high environmental impact. Second life for EV batteries To offset the environmental impact of batteries, some manufacturers extend the useful life of used batteries taken from electric vehicles at the point where the cells won't sufficiently hold charge. Though considered end of life for electric vehicles, the batteries will function satisfactorily in home energy storage devices. Manufacturers supporting this include Nissan, BMW and Powervault. Salt water batteries Home Energy Storage devices can be paired with salt water batteries, which have a lower environmental impact due to their lack of toxic heavy metal and ease of recyclability. Unfortunately, Saltwater batteries are no longer being produced on a commercial level after the bankruptcy of Aquion Energy. Alternatives or complement Pico Hydro Using a pumped-storage system of cisterns for energy storage and small generators, pico hydro generation may also be effective for \\"closed loop\\" home energy generation systems. A storage heater or heat bank (Australia) is an electrical heater which stores thermal energy during the evening, or at night when electricity is available at lower cost, and releases the heat during the day as required. Accumulators, like a Hot water storage tank, are another type of storage heater but specifically store hot water for later use.

History  The station opened on 28 August 1841 by the Blyth, Seghill and Percy Main Railway. The station was situated on the A190 Station Road, on the south side of the level crossing. The Seghill Colliery was situated to the north, on the second of the third line that branched off the passenger line. The primary goods traffic handled at the station was bricks, clay and ganister; this was ceased on 9 December 1963. The station was closed to passengers on 27 June 1964 and closed completely on 7 June 1965. Reopening proposals There have been proposals to reintroduce passenger services to part of the former Blyth and Tyne Railway system since the 1990s; Denis Murphy, the then Labour MP for Wansbeck, expressed support in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate in April 1999 and again in a debate in January 2007. The Railway Development Society (renamed Railfuture in 2000) also endorsed the proposal in 1998. Later, in 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies published a ¬£34 million proposal to restore passenger services from to . In the early 2010s, Northumberland County Council (NCC) became interested in the reintroduction of passenger services onto remaining freight-only sections of the network. In June 2013 NCC commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme. The GRIP 1 study was received by NCC in March 2014 and in June 2015 they initiated a more detailed GRIP 2 Feasibility Study at a cost of ¬£850,000. The GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between Newcastle, Ashington and possibly a new terminus to the east, at , was feasible and could provide economic benefits of ¬£70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034. The study suggested that due to the short distance between the former stations at Seghill and only one, rather than both, of them should be reopened. At the time it was suggested that, subject to funding being raised for the ¬£191 million scheme, detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021 though by October 2018 such works were yet to begin. After receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC initially announced that they were preceding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail but such a report was not commissioned at the time. Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to work towards the reintroduction of a passenger service onto the line, encouraged by the Department for Transport's November 2017 report, A Strategic Vision for Rail, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. Consequentially, NCC commissioned a further interim study in November 2017 (dubbed GRIP 2B) to determine whether high costs and long timescales identified in the GRIP 2 Study could be reduced by reducing the initial scope of the project but the report failed to deliver on this. Despite this, the county council has continued to develop the project, announcing a further ¬£3.46 million in funding for a further business case and detailed design study (equivalent to GRIP 3) to be completed by the end of 2019. It is envisaged that passenger trains could be introduced as early as 2022. However, the revised proposals, released in July 2019, are reduced in scope from the plan considered in the 2016 GRIP 2 study and propose 4-phase project to reduce the initial cost of the scheme. Under these plans, the reopening of Seghill station appears to have been dropped in favour of reopening Seaton Delaval station, though even that option has been excluded from the initial ¬£90 million phase and is instead proposed as part of Phase 2 of the project.

The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. The political party Venstre has been based in the building since 1971. History Carlsminde originates in an old tenant farm. Courty physician and kancellir√•d Johan Peter Homuth constructed a small country house at the land in 1751 and later expanded the estate with more land twice. The current building was built for a later owner, Peter Wasserfalls, a grocer and manufacturer, probably a few years prior to his death in 1782. Wasserfall left the estate to his son who also purchased another nearby property. Carlsminde then changed hands many times. One of the later owners was prime minister Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow who wanted a summer residence close to Copenhagen. The property was given the Carlsminde by Bolette Rudolphine Berg (1761-1836) in memory of her late husband Carl Berg. She also completed a 3.5 hectare park in English landscape style. Carlsminde was owned by hunting master Rasmus Petersen from 1855 to 1867. During this period Carlsminde changed status from tenant farm to ownership. A later owner, Valet de chambre G. F. Bentzen, changed the facade in 1894. Carlsminde was acquired by Isak Gl√ºckstadt in 1903. He expanded the estate from 10 to 25 hectares. The park was expanded by the landscape architect Erstad J√∏rgensen . It was centred on lake with pikes and tenches and was also home to two Indian elephants. In 1907 Gl√ºckstadt commissioned Carl Brummer to built a Norwegian-style cabin. It was moved to Rungsted in 1910 and to Holte in the early 1940s. Dethlef J√ºrgensen owned Carlsminde from 1913 to 1947. He sold off most of the land, creating the streets Carlsmindevej and Carlsmindeparken. J√ºrgensen was a central figure at Klampenborg Racecourses. In 1913 he constructed the side wing with stables for nine horses. A later owner, Erik M√∏ller, a CEO, established a riding ground to the rear of the stables in the 1950s. Venstre acquired the property in 1970 and has been based there since 1971. Architecture The building seen from the garden The main building fronts a large courtyard located on the southside of S√∏ller√∏dsvej. A detached side wing marks the east side of the courtyard. The side wing The main building is 11 bays long and consists of a high cellar, bel √©tage and a hipped Mansard roof with blue-glazed tiles. The three-bay median risalit was adapted in the 1893. The two windows that flanked the main entrance were replaced by niches with sandstone vases. The Rococo-style Cartouche above the main entrance and the Neclassical attica was also added at this point. The combination of decorative elements from different architectural styles is a characteristic feature of the Historicist style that dominated Danish architecture in the 1890s. The side wing contains two small apartments flanking a stable with room for nine horses. The northern gable of the side wing is integrated in the wall that partly surrounds the property. Today The secretariat of Venstre is based in the building. The garden is used for events on Constitution Day (5 June).

The henge, which has been almost completely flattened, was only discovered in the 20th century. Geophysical surveys and excavation have uncovered many of its features, which include a northeast entrance, an internal circle of postholes, and fragments of bone and pottery. Location Coneybury Henge is around 1.4 kilometres east-by-southeast of Stonehenge, which can be seen from the site. The location has extensive views southeast across the Avon valley, and west towards Normanton Down. The henge is difficult to identify on the ground, having been levelled by ploughing, but has been identified on aerial photographs, geophysical survey, and by excavation. The absence of any mention of the henge in historical records suggests that it may have been levelled in medieval times or soon after, and this theory is supported by ridge and furrow marks visible on some aerial photographs. Discovery and excavation The site was first noted from the air in the 1920s and thought to be a disc barrow. Later aerial photographs gave strong indications it was a Class I henge. The photographs show an oval ditch, around 45 metres by 55 metres in diameter. The entrance is on the longer axis on the northeast side. Traces of an external bank are said to be visible. The henge was excavated in 1980 as part of the Stonehenge Environs Project. The excavations revealed a broad oval ditch around 4 metres wide by 3 metres deep defining the henge. Excavation of internal features included a few pits and postholes, numerous stakeholes, and an arc of postholes inside the inner edge of the enclosure ditch which may have represented a post circle. Some of the internal features may pre-date the henge. Finds included pottery ranging from the early Neolithic to middle Bronze Age, as well as animal bone and a human cremation. Coneybury Anomaly Around 12 metres northwest of Coneybury Henge, evidence suggesting a unique cross-cultural feast has been found. The Anomaly is a pit containing a large amount of early Neolithic pottery together with a large quantity of animal bone, and flint tools of both Mesolithic and Neolithic types. The bones included at least ten cattle, plus several roe deer, two red deer and a pig. The material was radiocarbon dated to 3980-3708 BCE, before the henge was constructed and within three centuries of the introduction of Neolithic technology to Britain. It is interpreted as the result of a single event, not a long occupation or recurrent use. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The ceramic assemblage included bowls and cups, all of rather similar manufacture. Many of the fragments were large, indicating that they have not been trampled after they were discarded, and thus that a single, relatively short event led to the Anomaly.Richards, J. (ed.) 1990. The Stonehenge Environs Project. London: English Heritage Archaeological Reports 16/ York: Archaeology Data Service https://doi.org/ 10.5284/1028203 The cattle were not butchered in the same way as the roe deer; most limbs of the cattle are absent - possibly redistributed among participants - while the deer bones remained in the pit. Isotope ratios in the bones indicated that all the animals came from within 20km of Coneybury. They included at least three groups of cattle, each from a different place and comprising individuals of multiple ages, while the deer all came from the immediate neighbourhood. The cattle were all female and had grazed on open ground; they had not eaten straw from manured cereal plots. The primary pit Ô¨Åll includes both Neolithic and Mesolithic tool types. There is no obvious source from which residual Mesolithic material could be derived, and no evidence of differential weathering. The blades/blade-lets must therefore be part of the event that caused the Anomaly. This intimate mixture of Neolithic and Mesolithic tools is unique, and seems to indicate a single event attended by two different cultural groups. The excavators suggest that the Coneybury Anomaly represents the material remains of a gathering organized by a regional community, with participants coming from different areas. One group of attendees provided deer instead of, or in addition to, cattle. This group may have been hunter-gatherers who survived alongside farmers, engaging with them in a solidarity feast which requires equivalent contributions from participants and maintains community cohesion. If this is correct, the regional feasts that have been suggested for the later causewayed enclosures were already taking place in the earliest Neolithic phase, albeit on a smaller geographical scale.

She was active as a teacher of the Dramatens elevskola from 1847 until 1884 (except for the years 1851-56). Life Hanna Brooman was the foster child of the opera singer Johan Erik Brooman. She never married. As an adult, she was active as a music- and language teacher in Stockholm for many years. From 1847, Brooman was engaged as a teacher in the school of the actors- and ballet students at the royal theater and opera in Stockholm, the Dramatens elevskola. Except for the period of 1851-56, she kept this post until her retirement in 1884. The students of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Royal Swedish Opera and Royal Swedish Ballet during this period started as children, and though they were instructed in their future profession by experts, they were also given instruction in elementary subjects. This part of their education had previously been provided by the head of the Dramatens elevskola, and the students had been housed as boarding school students in the home of Christina Fundin (mother of Wilhelmina Fundin), but the boarding school of Fundin was closed in 1846, and Brooman was employed to provide the elementary education schooling to the students. Hanna Brooman provided instruction in Christianity, Writing, piano forte, French, German, Italian, history and geography for both male and female students, as well as sewing and needlework for the girls. Erik af Edholm described her as \\"a good teacher and person\\" (1869), and Frans Hedberg described her in his necrology: :\\"She taught with the heart as much as with her reason; with an unusually rich, patient, never undying love, as far away from all indulgence as well as from all bad tempered mastering, as warm for the greater gifts as well as for the small, yes, often more tenderly for the spiritually poor than for those, which whom the conscientious teacher could have glowed, if it had been her nature.\\"J (Hanna) A Brooman, urn:sbl:17030, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av T.

Sahlman argued that the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 was a crisis of corporate management resulting from a disorder of \\"incentives, risk management and control, accounting, human capital, and culture.\\" Sahlman suggested that successful business plans need to focus on \\"the people, the opportunity, the context, and the possibilities for both risk and reward.\\" With his colleague Josh Lerner, Sahlman argued that several steps could be taken to make entrepreneurship as competitive in the United States as it is in China or Brazil. For example, they suggested that the USG should invest more in business ventures, and use the toolbox of taxes and subsidies to encourage innovation. They also suggested that the government should let entrepreneurs address social ills, as in the case of charter schools. They added educated immigrants should be given green cards to improve the rate of human capital in the United States. Moreover, they suggested that capital markets should be liberated from unnecessary regulations. They also suggested that the government should publish financial data and encourage dialogue between trade organizations, and discourage unfair competition by banning monopolies. Additionally, they noted that the government should do away with Obamacare and encourage entrepreneurship in healthcare; lower taxes; find the right balance in protecting intellectual rights to enable innovation; maintain flexible dismissals; and reduce political gridlock.

Acoustic noise and vibrations due to electromagnetic forces can be seen as the reciprocal of microphonics, which describes how a mechanical vibration or acoustic noise can induce an undesired electrical perturbation.  General explanation  Electromagnetic forces can be defined as forces arising from the presence of an electromagnetic field (electrical field only, magnetic field only, or both). Electromagnetic forces in the presence of a magnetic field include equivalent forces due to Maxwell stress tensor, magnetostriction and Lorentz force (also called Laplace force)Belahcen, A. (2004). Magnetoelasticity, magnetic forces and magnetostriction in electrical machines. PhD thesis, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland.. Maxwell forces, also called reluctances forces, are concentrated at the interface of high magnetic reluctivity changes, e.g. between air and a ferromagnetic material in electric machines; they are also responsible of the attraction or repulsion of two magnets facing each other. Magnetostriction forces are concentrated inside the ferromagnetic material itself. Lorentz or Laplace forces act on conductors plunged in an external magnetic field. Equivalent electromagnetic forces due to the presence of an electrical field can involve electrostatic, electrostrictive and reverse piezoelectric effects. These phenomena can potentially generate vibrations of the ferromagnetic, conductive parts, coils and permanent magnets of electrical, magnetic and electromechanical device, resulting in an audible sound if the frequency of vibrations lies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz, and if the sound level is high enough to be heard (e.g. large surface of radiation and large vibration levels). Vibration level is increased in case of a mechanical resonance, when electromagnetic forces match with a structural mode natural frequency of the active component (magnetic circuit, electromagnetic coil or electrical circuit) or of its enclosure. The frequency of the noise depends on the nature of electromagnetic forces (quadratic or linear function of electrical field or magnetic field) and on the frequency content of the electromagnetic field (in particular if a DC component is present or not).  Electromagnetic noise and vibrations in electric machines  Electromagnetic torque, which can be calculated as the average value of the Maxwell stress tensor along the airgap, is one consequence of electromagnetic forces in electric machines. As a static force, it does not create vibrations nor acoustic noise. However torque ripple (also called cogging torque for permanent magnet synchronous machines in open circuit), which represents the harmonic variations of electromagnetic torque, is a dynamic force creating torsional vibrations of both rotor and stator. The torsional deflection of a simple cylinder cannot radiate efficiently acoustic noise, but with particular boundary conditions the stator can radiate acoustic noise under torque ripple excitationTan Kim A.

Some tangential magnetic force harmonics can directly create magnetic vibrations and acoustic noise when applied to the stator teeth: tangential forces create a bending moment of the stator teeth, resulting in radial vibrations of the yoke Devillers E., Le Besnerais J., Regniez M. and Hecquet M., (2017).

Besides tangential force harmonics, Maxwell stress also includes radial force harmonics responsible for radial vibrations of the yoke, which in turn can radiate acoustic noise.  Electromagnetic noise and vibrations in passive components  = Inductors = In inductors, also called reactors or chokes, magnetic energy is stored in the airgap of the magnetic circuit, where large Maxwell forces apply.

Resonance effect in electrical machines  In radial flux rotating electric machines, resonance due to electromagnetic forces is particular as it occurs at two conditions: there must be a match between the exciting Maxwell force and the stator or rotor natural frequency, and between the stator or rotor modal shape and the exciting Maxwell harmonic wavenumber (periodicity of the force along the airgap)Le Besnerais, J.

Under resonance conditions, the maxima of the electromagnetic excitation along the airgap and the maxima of the modal shape displacement are in phase.  Numerical simulation  = Methodology = The simulation of electromagnetically induced noise and vibrations is a multiphysic modeling process carried in three steps: * calculation of the electromagnetic forces * calculation of the resulting magnetic vibrations * calculation of the resulting magnetic noise It is generally considered as a weakly coupled problem: the deformation of the structure under electromagnetic forces is assumed not to change significantly the electromagnetic field distribution and the resulting electromagnetic stress. = Application to electric machines = The assessment of audible magnetic noise in electrical machines can be done using three methods: * using dedicated electromagnetic and vibro-acoustic simulation software (e.g. MANATEE ) * using electromagnetic (e.g. Flux, Jmag, Maxwell, Opera), structural (e.g. Ansys Mechanical, Nastran, Optistruct) and acoustic (e.g. Actran, LMS, Sysnoise) numerical software together with dedicated coupling methods * using multiphysics numerical simulation software environment (e.g. Comsol Multiphysics, Ansys Workbench)  Examples of device subject to electromagnetic noise and vibrations  = Static devices = Static devices include electrical systems and components used in electric power storage or power conversion such as * inductors * transformersWeiser, B., Pf√ºtzner, H., & Anger, J.

Early life and education  Counts was born and raised in New York City, the son of Carolyn Counts Fox (n√©e Lawler) and Dr. Robert Milton Counts. He studied Theatre and Economics at Skidmore College from 1988 to 1993, where he created The Life and Times of Lewis Carroll, a performance that was both an abstract re-interpretation of Alice In Wonderland and a poetic performative portrait of Lewis Carroll. At Skidmore, Counts also created the \\"Failure Series\\", an open forum of experimental performance concepts that continued after he graduated under the leadership of collaborators Ian Belton http://www.skidmoretheaternews.com/people/2016/4/6/rebel-director-ian-beltons- nomadic-journey and Yehuda Duenyas.http://theascent.co/#/about The series included a wide range of performance, theatrical, operatic and scenic elements spread over several acres of Skidmore Campus which anticipated much of his later work with immersive performance installations and theater. His most notable influences from his time at Skidmore were Gautam Dasguptahttp://www.skidmoretheaternews.com/new- blog/2016/2/25/ads88xz1wgmr6b4xs6mlpen0ir8pi9 and his then wife, Bonnie Marranca, co-founders of the PAJ: Performing Arts Journal. Counts went on to study with Dasgupta off and on for the next 20 years.http://scholar.colorado.edu/thtr_gradetds/27  Career  = Theater and Performance = In his formative years, Counts was drawn to the work of theater and visual artists who forged idiosyncratic and often fiercely independent artistic paths, including Robert Wilson, Reza Abdoh, Richard Foreman, Joseph Cornell, John Cage and Merce Cunningham, Robert Rauschenberg, Marcel Duchamp, Antonin Artaud, and Gertrude Stein. A common thread is the way the work of these artists was fueled by a subconscious or non-literal dynamic generated through collisions and confluences along the intersections of visual art, literature, music, sound, and live performance. After graduating from Skidmore, Counts founded the C & Hammermill Company and Exhibition Space in a 100 ft.-long warehouse in Saratoga Springs. Counts collaborated with company members on a series of installations, site-specific performances and guerrilla artworks on the Fifth Avenue promenade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a 40-acre estate in Devon, Pennsylvania (Waterloo Mills and the Kings of Prussia), and the streets of Prague in the Czech Republic (Frontier and the Kings of Prussia, a seven-day site specific guerrilla theater production performed in 14 different outdoor locations, and Kral, an abstract re- interpretation of King Lear staged in a prewar movie theater that had been converted into a night club). When he moved back to New York City, he co- founded GAle GAtes et al. ‚Äì a name inspired by Counts‚Äô grandmother ‚ÄúShe was a brilliant woman. Spoke eight languages. Was one of the first women to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Extremely cultured. But it was her relationship to paintings that was my introduction to the visual arts as a child. She inspired me with this idea that at the most fundamental level the idea of making art is giving a gift. A celebration. It should elevate us. Even if it can be dark and cerebral, it‚Äôs still this idea of putting your hand out, this ‚Äúlet me show you something beautiful and challenging.‚Äù The core tenets of what is my aesthetic and what I think about art and my relationship with it is derived from my relationship with her, so naming the company after her was a very logical thing to do. What she thought art was, was going to be ever foundational to what the company did.‚Äù Michael Counts, 19 September 2012. ‚Äì with performer and producer Michelle Stern and scholar and Butoh performer John Oglevee, whom Counts had met in Prague and had made the introduction to Stern on their return. With the help of the LMCC, where the embryonic company had been appointed Artist-in-Residence, Counts was able to work with vast spatial ‚Äúcanvases‚Äù right away, securing temporary use of the vacant floors of skyscrapers in the financial district which provided the epic perspectives that have remained an essential aspect of his work. After creating his second work for the Metropolitan Museum of Art promenade, The Making of a Mountain, in 1995, Counts directed and designed a series of performances and installations from 1996 to 1997 in multiple indoor and outdoor locations in Manhattan and in touring residencies in Thailand and Japan, gathering a growing circle of artistic collaborators along the way. In New York, 90 Degrees from an Equinox? Where are We? And Where are We Going? was a twelve- hour performance installation that took place over the course of six days in a 65,000 sq. ft. space on the 51st floor of 55 Water Street. Texts by Gertrude Stein and John Cage were performed alongside original and found texts by actors performing in an environment made of a field of wild grass harvested from Jamaica Bay. wine-blue-open-water was a walk-through performance installation freely adapted from Homer‚Äôs Odyssey with a pre-recorded text by Ruth Margraff. Set elements were rolled in on wagons past performers stationed like statues on a vacant floor of 67 Broad Street. Counts and the company also produced Oh‚Ä¶ A Fifty-Year Dart (a series of episodes that unfolded over the course of three months), Departure, Ark, and TO SEA: Another Mountain at a range of locations including Grand Central Terminal, the SoHo Arts Festival and the Tunnel nightclub. Internationally, a nine-member company went to Thailand to collaborate with the BoiSakti Dance Theatre of Indonesia under the auspices of the Bangkok-Bali-Berlin Festival, and Counts, Stern and Oglevee were joined by composer Joseph Diebes to study Butoh at Min Tanaka‚Äôs Body Weather Farm in Japan. At the Farm, Counts directed and designed I Dug a Pit a Meter Six in Either Direction and Filled it Full of Sake. I Mixed in Honey and Milk and Poured It Over Barley and Pine Nuts and Rice and Onion and Fruit and Blood and Stopped. The performance was set halfway up a mountain, requiring the audience to make an arduous hike then descend at night, the experience of which was integrated into the performance concept. Counts described the work as occupying the territory ‚Äúwhen dance-theatre starts to bleed more into proper theater‚Äù. After completing the LMCC residency, Counts began to search for a permanent home for the company that could accommodate the cinematic perspectives that were now a constant in his work. Brooklyn Academy of Music Executive Producer Joseph V. Melillo pointed him to the Brooklyn waterfront neighborhood now known as DUMBO, where David Walentas of Two Trees Management offered him a lease for a 40,000 square foot warehouse and shopfront gallery in exchange for the company attracting a steady stream of visitors to what was then a somewhat forbidding neighborhood. Counts, Stern and Diebes were joined by resident artists Michael Anderson, Tom Fruin and Jeff Sugg to create four large-scale performance installations and mount numerous exhibitions and off- site events over the following five years. To SEA: Another Ocean, a performance installation for four performers and 500 blue umbrellas, marked the official opening of the space in September 1997. The first fully staged production Counts directed and designed in the new space was The Field of Mars, which was inspired by Tacitus‚Äô account of the burning of Rome. A one- line summary in the playbill read \\"This performance is as a dream is, or a landscape. Its meaning is more or less what you determine.\\" The pre-show began in the shopfront gallery as the audience milled around a bar and one by one noticed an actor dressed in elegant evening wear suspended high above on a wire. He descended a ladder with his hands, then led the audience up a ramp decorated with a frieze of tiny flames (a reference to the Great Fire of Rome) to the warehouse space above, where they encountered a series of episodes described in The New York Times as ‚Äúa fun house for the senses‚Ä¶ a cascade of images conjured by the conscious and subconscious, and with the question of how pictures framed in the mind's eye make their way into everything, from ancient myth to abstract paintings to commercial movies.\\" The audience was guided through multiple installations by intelligent and moving stage lights and Diebes‚Äô through-composed electronic score: a living room whose back wall disappeared to reveal a pixie in a slowly receding forest, a tryst in a public bathroom mounted on wheels and swirling around the space, a family dinner at an ornate and extravagantly long table, a tartan-skirted schoolgirl emerging from the top of a wardrobe, and more. A sequel, The Field of Mars - Chapter 1, was mounted in 2006 by Counts Media, in which groups of six people were guided through multiple locations in mid-Manhattan including Grand Central Terminal, a Park Avenue office building, a minivan, the basement of a manufacturing building in the Fashion District, and the interior of a Lincoln Continental. The Field of Mars ‚Äì Chapter 1 was produced in part as a developmental workshop for The Ride, a commercial entertainment concept developed with a group that included Broadway producers Robyn Goodman, Vivek Tiwary, Charles Flateman, Barry Tatelman and media executive Scott Carlin. The Field of Mars ‚Äì Chapter 1 also anticipated Counts' 2017 work, The Path of Beatrice, an extension of his immersive escape room Paradiso. Tilly Losch, produced later in 1998 and described by Counts as ‚Äúa dream one might have had if falling asleep after watching Casablanca‚Äù, took its inspiration from the eponymous shadow box sculpture by Joseph Cornell. It was the first of two GAle GAtes et al. productions in which the audience was seated for the duration so that the 120 feet throw of the backstage area was visible through the false proscenium of an industrial passageway. The proscenium was initially masked by a backdrop as a series of vignettes played out in front - two soldiers playing chess, a row of seated cinemagoers rolling across the stage on casters to audio from the film Casablanca, a Butoh solo. The proscenium then opened up to reveal a series of shadow box-like scenes that receded further and further back into the space as the action progressed ‚Äì a couple arguing in one window and a pensive man listening to Nina Simone in another in a recreated section of the Met Life Building Clock Tower facade and a recreation of Andrew Wyeth's painting Christina's World. Christina was portrayed as having lost the use of her legs and dragging herself into position to the sounds of birdcalls, crickets and gusts of wind. The sun set at the same pace it does in real time, and lights in the model house on the hill turned on one by one. The scene concluded after a model hot air balloon and an airplane appeared far off in the sky. In the climactic scene - a recreation of the titular Cornell work - the hot air balloon was shown in virtual close-up as a performer floated through a frame suspended on wires. The advantages of having permanent access to a warehouse space began to be fully utilized in Tilly Losch. Set elements could be tinkered with and refined over the course of months. A new mechanism was developed that could tilt a wall imperceptibly over the course of two minutes, operated by hand wrenches. The title of 1839 (1999) refers to the year photography was invented, and was conceived as a dream of Daguerre ‚Äúin which a child, in the guise of Oedipus, wanders through a landscape peopled by narcissists in love with their own photographed images.‚Äù The landscape was a kinetic collage of multi-layered, allusive imagery. There were yet more three- dimensional reproductions of artworks ‚Äì Manet‚Äôs Olympia, a large classical still life, a cat from a Balthus painting ‚Äì interwoven with invented scenarios. A hermaphrodite appeared in different guises, at one point dressed in a sailor costume identical to the ones adorning a statue of a child and worn by the Oedipus character. An armadillo puppet stood up on its hind legs to reveal a naked young woman on whose skin an image of the solar system was projected. There were multiple scenes involving a surreally distanced Oedipal coupling of two actors who recited a combination of Sophocles and invented texts. At one point, the Oedipus figure shot arrows across the full throw of the backstage area at a circle of light as the Jocasta character looked on. In 2000, Counts was invited to direct Gertrude Stein‚Äôs Listen to Me at the CalArts Center for New Performance in Valencia, California. The production featured three iterations of the same three characters: a man dressed alternately in a snowsuit and a schoolboy‚Äôs uniform; a woman also appearing in multiple incarnations including an opulent 18th century white wig topped by a silver model of a three-masted sailing ship; and an art museum guard. The stage design featured a series of sunken trenches created by rows of white cuboids that extended the width of the stage and rose to chest height, and a suspended walkway above. The choreography was by Ken Roht, who had previously worked with Reza Abdoh and became a frequent collaborator of Counts‚Äô in the years following.  A Counts Performance Installation Scene by Scene: So Long Ago I Can‚Äôt Remember  The last large-scale performance installation produced by GAle GAtes et al. in DUMBO was So Long Ago I Can‚Äôt Remember (2001) a free adaptation of Dante‚Äôs The Divine Comedy with a text by Kevin Oakes pre- recorded by the actors (who lip-synched their lines in the live performance) and choreography by Roht. So Long Ago marked a return to the walk-through format of previous performance installations. Dante‚Äôs nine circles of hell were depicted in a series of installations in which audience members alternately roamed and were seated as multiple performances unfolded around them - and, at some points, in their midst. The audience entered through the back of the warehouse for the first time and took their seats at cafe tables. A dominatrix-like mistress of ceremonies portraying Virgil - the only performer whose words were not pre-recorded - issued instructions on how to move through the space and rules for interacting with the performers. A chorus of women in elegant modern matching suits with fur collars appeared, one in the attitude of walking a statue of a greyhound sitting stiffly at attention, followed by a solitary male actor also in elegant modern clothing (Counts‚Äô Dante). He stopped in front of an opening in a large wall which then tipped over and fell to the floor around him, pushing a strong gust of wind out at the audience.A reference to a scene in Buster Keaton‚Äôs Steamboat Bill, Jr. in which the facade of a house falls on Keaton who, having been standing in the trajectory of a windowframe, was unscathed. The actor was then joined by an actress for a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers tap routine. They exited to reveal a boatful of lost souls crossing the river Styx. The audience was then guided sometimes by the dominatrix, sometimes through the gestures of the characters, sometimes by light or sound through a succession of long narrow spaces representing the rings of hell. In the next installation, members of a dysfunctional family stood on a platform that spanned the width of the space forming a kinetic frieze, their arguments abstracted through multiple distancing layers of time, space and verbal embellishment. At one end of the frieze stood a clutch of Nazi soldiers speaking German, at the other, a girl in a red dress reciting text on a swing. A hanged man in a fedora clutching a violin case appeared, and a chorus of dancers performed a Vegas floor show decked out in headdresses, shiny bikinis and high heels, first fully costumed but later either nude or bare-breasted wearing an assortment of briefs. The next space featured a floor covered with sand and a Florentine stone wall where an ailing Pope delivered a monologue as Dante and two clerics looked on. The audience was then led behind the stone wall and seated as they observed a maid, a pair of hotel guests, and two gangsters move wordlessly in and out of a hallway in the Waldorf Astoria as a mafia hit may or may not have taken place behind one of the doors. The wall was then winched up to reveal a chorus of dancers wearing the same red dress as the girl on the swing, who stepped forward to deliver a monologue while exiting. The second act began with a speech by the anarchist labor organizer Emma Goldman envisioning a bleak future for the workers. The audience was then led across a bridge spanning a pool of white fluorescent lights as Dante stood silently by in 13th century costume, head bowed. The bridge led to a small space in which the audience huddled around a quartet of seated actors lit from below in ghoulish green light delivering a string of non-sequiturs about a Pomeranian. This was followed by Purgatorio, a twenty-minute wordless opera for a seated audience by Diebes. Four sopranos wandered among ostensibly artificial tree trunks made of rags and painted black. The actor playing Dante doubled as a young man in modern dress burying an undisclosed treasure in the dirt. The performance concluded with Paradiso. The girl in the red dress was suspended over a pool of dry ice that spanned the entire floor of the shopfront gallery as the couple that had previously been seen in the hotel hallway mounted a stairway leading up to a place beyond view. The audience observed the scene while walking over an elevated walkway as Manhattan's East River skyline appeared across the water through the shopfront windows of the gallery. The walkway took the audience through the gallery entrance onto the street. There was no curtain call.  Theatre after 9/11  The events of 9/11 took place a few weeks after So Long Ago closed. In the aftermath, there was a significant shift in Counts‚Äô work back towards his original intentions for doing site- specific works outdoors for unsuspecting audiences. The only theatre production Counts has directed since was Play/Date, a site specific ‚Äúimmersive theatre experience‚Äù produced by 3 Legged Dog and installed in the three levels of the Fat Baby nightclub on the Lower East Side. Actors were initially stationed at tables throughout the space, performing scenes written by multiple playwrights portraying blind dates, late night hook-ups, star-crossed text messaging, break-ups, and unrequited love. The audience was invited to join any of a number of scenes taking place simultaneously as the amplified conversations were projected through a sound system while multiple digital screens in the seating areas displayed courtships by text. = Opera and Orchestral Music = In 2011, Director of New York City Opera (NYCO) George Steel invited Counts to direct and design a new production entitled Monodramas at Lincoln Center. Monodramas was an evening of works for solo soprano and orchestra: the world stage premiere of La Machine de l'√ätre by John Zorn, Erwartung by Arnold Schoenberg, and the US stage premiere of Neither by Morton Feldman, with a libretto by Samuel Beckett. Steel had first encountered Counts‚Äô work at GAle GAtes et al. and had been in discussions about presenting performances of John Cage in the GAle GAtes et al. space prior to 9/11. The production featured episodes that provided a through line tying all of the works together, bookended by an intro and outro performed in silence. In 2012, Counts was invited by New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert to direct and design New York Philharmonic 360, a staging of ‚Äúspatial music‚Äù for orchestra in the Park Avenue Armory‚Äôs Drill Hall presented in-the-round. Counts designed an immersive lighting and performance environment for works by Gabrieli, Boulez, Mozart, Stockhausen and Ives that included living statues costumed for their subsequent performance of the Act I finale of Mozart's \\"Don Giovanni\\" which the audience encountered in a space under the bleachers upon entering, and large luminous screens installed behind each orchestra that glowed in blue, red and yellow. There were three orchestras for Stockhausen's Gruppen, arranged in a circle, with audience sections in the center and in between. The performance was featured in a free worldwide webcast on Medici.tv. Counts returned to New York City Opera in 2013 to direct and design Rossini‚Äôs Moses in Egypt. The set design featured a backdrop of LED screens displaying imagery created in collaboration with Ada Whitney, co-founder and creative director of . Animations of night skies, deserts, and the parting of the Red Sea were interspersed with abstract shapes and video of natural forms. Through the use of an LED backdrop, Counts was able to realize on a big screen the cinematic pans and aerial shots that had been an implied element of his live stage work, while adding new effects through confronting the invented time on the LED screens with the real time of the live performance, partly through the use of a revolving stage. Moses in Egypt marked the first time New York City Opera had performed in its original home, City Center, since moving to Lincoln Center in the mid ‚Äò60s. In 2016, Counts staged the world premiere of the seven-hour The Ouroboros Trilogy, a production by Beth Morrison Projects presented by Arts Emerson at the Cutler Majestic Theatre in Boston, MA. The work united three scores by Scott Wheeler (Naga), Zhou Long (the Pulitzer Prize-winning Madame White Snake) and Paola Prestini (Gilgamesh) under the umbrella of libretti written by a single author, Cerise Lim Jacobs. Madame White Snake was presented at the Hong Kong Arts Festival in March 2019https://www.hk.artsfestival.org/en/programmes/opera-madame-white-snake-by- zhou-long-and-cerise-lim-jacobs/. = Immersive and Interactive Events and Installations = While virtually all of Counts‚Äô works prior to 2002 could be categorized as immersive events, his work in theatre, visual art and interactive installation after 9/11 developed along separate tracks. The first work Counts created after 9/11 was Looking Forward, a video homage to New York City mounted in April‚ÄìMay 2002 in the clock faces of the DUMBO clocktower. A looped series of video portraits showed the faces of volunteers who had recorded messages describing ‚ÄúNew York moments‚Äù. The audio of the voices of the New Yorkers who were interviewed, set to an original soundtrack, was simulcast by WFMU on May 3. Looking Forward was followed by (and was a prelude for) The World: An Immersive Installation Performance, a series of interactive events that returned to the format of Counts' earlier works in which an overarching, open-ended narrative would unfold in multiple episodes staged in different locations over a period of months. For the prelude, two dozen writers were invited to respond to a group of miniature cinematic vistas and environments created by Counts that situated dozens of figurines on surreal landscapes, and the resulting playtexts were presented in public readings. The first episode was a performance installation at the Whitney Museum of Art‚Äôs Annex at the Altria Atrium in Midtown Manhattan inspired by the texts. The second episode was presented by the Guild Hall Museum in East Hampton, NY. Multiple sets and dioramas were installed in the windows and parking spaces of a nearby restaurant, including a vintage red Ferrari dino illuminated by red stage lights and silent characters appearing one by one in the dioramas and atop an elevated outdoor platform under placards in the shape of speech bubbles on which wordless video collages were projected. After GAle GAtes et al. closed in 2003, Counts embarked on a series of interactive works situated in the public realm. In Yellow Arrow (2004), Counts collaborated with Christopher Allen, Brian House, and Jesse Shapins to create ‚ÄúMassively Authored Public Art‚Äù that was a forerunner of the geospatial web in its creation of a ‚Äúdeep map‚Äù of the world. Volunteers who submitted online requests were sent coded stickers by mail and asked to write a message, place the stickers in a location of their choice, and submit a photograph of the site by SMS. In 2005 Counts and the Yellow Arrow Mobile App/Global Public Art Project created an immersive installation and exhibition for Piaget at Art Basel Miami, and in 2006 extended the scope of the project to an augmented reality game called ICUH8ING. An estimated 7,535 Yellow Arrow stickers were placed in 467 cities and 35 countries worldwide.. In 2007/8, Counts founded Counts Media and raised financing to fully realize the conceptual blueprints for Yellow Arrow and two digital projects created, directed and designed for the Blue Man Group - Mobkastr; an early application of mobile technology to performance designed for the North American tour of How to be a Megastar); and BILL: The World‚Äôs First Live and Interactive Video Billboard in Las Vegas. 2010 saw the launch of The Ride, a custom-designed bus tour along a 4.2 mile route through Mid-Manhattan. The bus seats were turned to the side so that the audience could look directly at the sidewalks, where live performers would appear including a UPS delivery man who launched into a breakdance, a ballet duet on Columbus Circle, a rapper improvising rhymes to pedestrians on 42nd Street, and a re-enactment of Alfred Eisenstaedt‚Äôs photograph of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square on V-J Day. Each bus was equipped with a sound system and dozens of synchronized video monitors. Two tour guides played the roles of urban researchers as they introduced each new sight and videos with historical and statistical background played on the screens. Beginning in 2014, Counts renewed his work on immersive live performance in events that crossed over into the worlds of fashion and television. As Creative Director of the Jet Set Event for Michael Kors in Shanghai, Counts utilized a large eyeliner video projection screen in an aircraft hangar (Hongquiao Airport in Shanghai, China) where a private jet plane was parked. The same year, he was creative consultant and stage director for Walking Dead Escape, an immersive theatrical adaptation of the Walking Dead Comics and AMC television show produced by Skybound EXP at the Hartford Xfinity Theatre and at Petco Park for the San Diego International Comic Con. Counts then wrote, directed and produced The Walking Dead Experience ‚Äì Chapter 1 in partnership with Walker Stalker Con. Groups of seven people were dropped into a sequence of encounters lasting 30 minutes that rendered a small town in the throes of a deadly outbreak, all set in a 10,000 square foot immersive space with special effects. In 2016, Michael Counts conceived, designed and directed a fashion show concept and presentation in collaboration with Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff for the Betty & Veronica by Rachel Antonoff brand at New York Fashion Week which combined the aesthetics of comics and pop art with high fashion in anticipation of the launch of Riverdale on the CW. Also in 2016, Counts partnered with former Jerry Bruckheimer producer and Las Vegas nightclub impresario Jennifer Worthington to create PARADISO: Chapter 1, an immersive escape room adaptated from Dante‚Äôs The Divine Comedy. Groups of ten gamers moved through a series of five interconnected chapters in which they periodically encountered live performers in interiors conceived as the premises of the Virgil Corporation. In March 2017, Counts and his Paradiso creative team launched The Path of Beatrice, an extension of PARADISO: Chapter 1 that took audience members in small groups of 1-4 people through a series of real world experiences over the course of a week, referencing the David Fincher film The Game and 2013 cult film The Institute. = Visual Art = GAle GAtes et al.‚Äôs move to a permanent home in 1995 brought with it an obligation to attract a steady flow of visitors. Initially with Stern and later with New York City gallerists including Mike Weiss, Counts co-organized a series of exhibitions from 1996 to 1999 that attracted a steady flow of visitors to the DUMBO shopfront gallery. In 2001-2, Counts collaborated with Bob Bangiola (then at New York's Brooklyn Academy of Music), and Anne Ellegood (now Executive Director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles), on organizing the Emerging Curator Series, whose unifying principle was viewing the curator as an artist. While there was resistance to this concept in New York's visual arts establishment, the series became a valued early career platform for curators and artists who soon thereafter rose to prominence in the art world. A few years later, curators in the US were widely regarded as having the capacity to be producing artists - as they already had been in Europe for some time - and scholarly articles were being written about the phenomenon. Concurrently, Counts was making small sculptures that rendered in miniature the same kinds of cinematic vistas and abstract theatrical environments he was designing for his large-scale installation and performance works. The sculptures were exhibited in solo shows in the GAle GAtes et al. gallery and at RARE Gallery and included in group shows and art fairs including Scope and Art Basel Miami) (with Step One Gallery). In 2011, Counts created a series of twelve sculptures that took key motifs from Monodramas, the evening of operas for soprano and orchestra he was directing and designing at Lincoln Center. Six of the twelve sculptures in the series, entitled Dream Sequence 3:52:29 am‚Äì3:56:12 am, were displayed in the lobby of the theatre during performances of Monodramas as visual elements integral to the experience of the evening as a whole. The other six sculptures were simultaneously exhibited at John McWhinnie at Glenn Horowitz. In 2016, Counts collaborated with Florida artist JEFR√ã and 3-Legged Dog on creating The Beacon and Code Wall, a six-story hyperbolic convex-concave tower animated by dynamic video designs commissioned by the Tavistock Development Company for the planned community of Lake Nona in Florida. = Talks and Presentations = Michael has been a featured speaker at MIT‚Äôs Media Lab, Omnicom‚Äôs Global Summit for the Radiate Group, and on panels hosted by City College and The Rockefeller Foundation. He has led workshops at several schools and other educational institutions including the California Institute of the Arts, Chiang Mai and Bangkok Universities, the Williamstown Theater Festival, and NYU‚Äôs Tisch School of the Arts. Michael‚Äôs media concepts have been presented at MIT and at Ericsson‚Äôs Innovation Lab in Stockholm. He launched A-Plan Coachinghttps://www.a-plancoaching.com/ in February 2018 and the iTunes podcast Producing Innovation in February 2019.  Style  A key inspiration for Counts‚Äô work is Wagner‚Äôs concept of Gesamtkunstwerk, a total work of art in which all the various elements of drama ‚Äì music, sound, text, movement, set and costume design ‚Äì are integrated into a unified whole. Another key inspiration is the work of the American director and designer Robert Wilson, to whom Counts is often compared and was a conscious influence. Some of the titles and locations of Counts‚Äô early work paid direct homage to Wilson.The Life and Times of Alice Liddell is a nod to Wilson‚Äôs own early work The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud, and I Dug a Pit a Meter Six in Either Direction and Filled it Full of Sake. I Mixed in Honey and Milk and Poured It Over Barley and Pine Nuts and Rice and Onion and Fruit and Blood and Stopped to Wilson‚Äôs I Was Sitting On My Patio This Guy Appeared I Thought I Was Hallucinating. Like Wilson‚Äôs KA MOUNTAIN AND GUARDenia TERRACE: a story about a family and some people changing, I Dug a Pit was performed on an actual mountain. While there are clear similarities between their work, Counts emerged from Wilson's shadow and found his own voice relatively early in his career. This is arguably because Counts drew so deeply on the raw material of his own personal experiences in his work ‚Äì submerged as these were beneath multiple layers of allusion. Some have speculated that the reason his work continues to draw routine comparison with Wilson is due to the decline in the number of avant-garde artists active in performance beginning in the 1990s. In other words, the contexts in which his work could be fully understood and appreciated have narrowed considerably ‚Äì there simply aren‚Äôt many other artists to compare him to. Counts‚Äô performance installations featured stylized movement that could take many forms, often infused with an erotic charge. Although key performers he worked with had undergone intensive studies in Butoh, this was not an influence on his own directorial approach but rather one of many elements within it (except in terms of the level of concentration, discipline and physical control required throughout, which could be considerable). After 2000, he began working regularly with choreographer Ken Roht, who performed with Reza Abdoh‚Äôs company Dar-a-Luz and served as Adboh‚Äôs choreographer on many productions. = Immersive Environments = A constant thread in Counts' work is the experience of immersion. In his own words: ‚Ä≥My approach with all the things I‚Äôve ever staged was to create a world and then immerse the audience in that world‚Ä¶ Creating an alternate reality where the rules were different but it held together. It might be very abstract, but it held a certain logic that the whole world operated within. It was then a compelling experience to be a voyeur in that world on the part of the audience.‚Ä≥ Counts arguably created his most highly developed immersive environments in GAle GAtes et al.‚Äôs 40,000 square foot warehouse space, which served as a kind of laboratory in which he incubated performance concepts that grew more and more elaborate and refined over the course of the five years the company was in residence. Many consider The Field of Mars and So Long Ago I Can‚Äôt Remember as the two productions that epitomize Counts‚Äô immersive theatre aesthetic. These two performance installations ‚Äì made before digital technology became a core component of his work and cast the public more fully in the role of author, and before the immersive genre went mainstream ‚Äì were mounted in the cavernous DUMBO warehouse space through which audience members were free to wander and choose their own individual perspectives on the action unfolding around them. The feeling of moving through Counts‚Äô fantasy landscapes added a layer of visceral complicity ‚Äì the physical sensation of the body traveling through space had the effect of ‚Ä≥warming up‚Äù the individual's imagination and made it all that much easier for willing viewers to immerse themselves in the unending flow of images, sounds and movement. This feeling can be compared to walking through the galleries of an art museum, much as Counts wandered through the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a child. In some of the sequences in The Field of Mars, the experience was more like exploring different rooms in a nightclub, or, in the eyes of Peter Marks of The New York Times, ‚Äú a little bit like chasing a two year old around an apartment.‚Äù In Art and America, Douglas Davis described the Field of Mars audience as ‚Äúdazzled witnesses to a cosmic event.‚Äù. In PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art, Michael Rush describes the experience of a Counts production as \\"akin to diving into a hypertext on the internet, but he‚Äôs doing all the clicking and controlling. It‚Äôs also like cruising through a fun house at the carnival, but the creatures popping out of the darkness aren‚Äôt just screaming, they‚Äôre reciting oblique texts from classical literature, art criticism, Fellini movies, and Dada playlets.\\" = Language = Counts‚Äô use of language in his original works is another area in which there was a significant change post 9/11. In the years preceding, he worked with complete scripts that were either compilations of text fragments lifted from a variety of sources or playtexts by a single author (including two scripts he wrote himself). Then, authorship shifted to public participants prompted by live performers, pre-set tasks and texts for apps and other digital platforms which superseded theatrical scripts at the heart of his work. The most important function of language in Counts‚Äô oeuvre is as source material which is then transformed into the conceptual underpinnings of his ultimate performative frameworks. Counts‚Äô description of how a book collection of the world's great letters was a seminal influence encapsulates this process: \\"There were various accounts. Dostoyevsky writing to his brother after he was almost assassinated, to letters of obscurity. It was a portrait of human history through correspondence. And that book changed my life. I would build pieces around some of the ideas and letters and relationships and the stories that were revealed.\\"  Private life  Counts lives in Brooklyn Heights with his wife Sharon and two sons, Wilder and Dashiell.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was the second of three partial eclipses that took place that year, the first of two in two months, the next was on November 29 and covered a part of the Northern Hemisphere. It was part of solar saros 111. Description The eclipse was visible in Northern and Southern Antarctica including the South Pole, a tiny portion near the Antarctic Peninsula, a tiny part of the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. It was during the decade that Antarctica was being explored by Europeans and added to the known atlas of the time. The eclipse started at sunrise in the Indian Ocean at around the 50th meridian east, it finished at sunset not far from the Antarctic Peninsula. It showed about up to 20-25% obscuration in Antarctica. The greatest eclipse was in Antarctica at 70.6 S, 21.2 E at 1:20 UTC (2:20 AM local time). The subsolar marking was in the Coral Sea.

He moved to Victoria from Toronto in 1995, taking a BA in Humanities from the University of Victoria, and touring with a rock band. In 2000 Budd then became the audio preservationist for CBC during its campaign to digitize its audio archives, including Nisga'a First Nation heritage. In 2002 he again attended the University of Victoria, where he completed his graduate degree in History. Voices of B.C. Budd is the host of the CBC Radio series Voices of B.C., where he recounts the stories of B.C. pioneers from tapings of their voices that were recorded in the 1950s and '60s by journalist Imbert Orchard. Budd is also the author of its companion book Voices of British Columbia: Stories from our Frontier, published in 2010. That year the book was nominated for a BC Book Prize. In 2014 he then released a follow-up book entitled Echoes of British Columbia; both books were sold alongside a three-CD set of 26 original pioneer recordings. Echoes was the 2nd prize for The Lieutenant-Governor's Medal for Historical Writing 2014.

This bastion, originally called the Basti√≥n de los Moros, is located on the side of the House of the Jesuits and is the work of Crist√≥bal de Roda. When it was completed by 1630, the cannons of San Ignacio pointed towards the Bay of Las √Ånimas, the same one that today receives the traffic of cabotage, and that then it extended by all the beach. Therefore, its mission was to discourage any attempt against the pier or against the banks and to contribute to the covering of Bocagrande (another entrance to the Bay of Cartagena). However, this purpose was threatened when the Society of Jesus built its college in the contiguous curtain. In fact, the neighborhood between a religious building and a military building generated all sorts of disputes, which were finally settled by the Spanish Crown, by order to build, on behalf of the Jesuits, a curtain of new wall a few meters ahead, leaving between the new and the old one a step of round, or way to watch from the fortification. The curtains are those straight and steep stretches of a \\"square front\\" that connects two bastions, in this case between those of San Ignacio and San Francisco Javier. Once the curtain was built it became necessary to move the bastion to the vicinity of the church of San Ignacio, from where it took its current name. Later, in 1730, the engineer Juan de Herrera y Sotomayor gave the bastion of San Ignacio its present dimension and annexed a garita, while it rescues its access ramp. From the house-college of the Jesuits (now the Naval Museum) it can see this bastion in all its splendor.

It was first aired on 27 December 2016 on BBC Two. The episode was directed by Graeme Harper and written by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton. Stylistically, it took heavy inspiration from classic 1970s anthology programmes, such as Beasts, Thriller, Tales of the Unexpected and Armchair Thriller, and was filmed using authentic equipment. Pemberton intended the episode to be a recreation of this kind of classic programming, with critics characterising it as a homage, pastiche or loving parody. \\"The Devil of Christmas\\", which is set in December 1977, begins with an English family (played by Pemberton, Rula Lenska, Jessica Raine and George Bedford) arriving at an Austrian Alpine chalet, where their guide (played by Shearsmith) tells them the story of the Krampus. It shortly becomes apparent, however, that viewers are watching a film, and a director (voiced by Derek Jacobi) provides commentary on the events. The critical reception of \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" was very strong, with praise directed at the writing, acting and production. As a recreation of 1970s anthology programmes, it was considered a success. The ending, critics noted, was extremely dark; though many offered considerable praise for the final twist, a minority criticised it as gratuitously unpleasant. Production Jessica Raine (pictured, 2015) starred in the episode as Kathy. The second series of Inside No. 9 aired from 26 March to 29 April 2015. In May, Shearsmith said that he and Pemberton had talked about doing a third series, and were hopeful that they would be able to, but that the BBC had not yet requested one. A third series was confirmed by the BBC in October 2015. Further information, including hints at settings and confirmed performers, was released in January 2016, when the series began filming. \\"The Devil of Christmas\\", the first episode of this third series, was released as a Christmas special in December 2016, with the remainder of the series following in 2017. The episode can be understood as a part of the tradition of Christmas ghost stories, which includes the works of Charles Dickens and the BBC's A Ghost Story for Christmas series. The inspiration for the use of the Krampus myth came from Pemberton's reading, while stylistic influence, according to Pemberton, came from \\"old '70s style\\" episodes of Beasts, Thriller and Tales of the Unexpected. For Pemberton, the 1970s style of the episode was a literal representation of what, metaphorically speaking, Inside No. 9 had been doing since the first series. The episode was variously described as a recreation or re-enactment of this source material, or else as a homage, a pastiche a \\"loving, but merciless\\" parody, or spoof of it. In addition to those influences mentioned by the writers, commentators identified Acorn Antiques, Psycho, Tales from the Crypt, Dead of Night, Whistle and I'll Come to You, and Garth Marenghi's Darkplace as potential influences. \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" was filmed \\"in the style of a '70s portmanteau horror episode\\". This entailed the use of non-standard methods and technologies. The whole filming process took only two days, with the cast taking minimal breaks between shoots. For the actors, it was thus more like appearing in a play than a typical 21st century television filming experience. The episode was filmed on a set constructed at Studio D in the BBC Elstree Centre, run by BBC Studioworks, and authentic 1970s costumes and props were rented for the filming. The studio was retrofitted with cameras and lighting equipment that would have been used on a 1970s set, including three Ikegami HK 323 cameras and a single Ikegami HK323P camera, all provided by a company called Golden Age Recreations. The filming of the episode thus differed from the series's usual single-camera setup approach. Adam Tandy, Inside No. 9 producer, said that \\"Studio D has the heritage and familiar atmosphere that I remember from when I worked at Elstree in the 1980s; however, a lot of modernisation has taken place since then and this has allowed us to monitor our 4:3 625-line PAL pictures in BBC Studioworks' state of the art HD production gallery.\\" For Shearsmith, the result was that \\"it looks shit, but it's brilliant\\". The episode was directed by Graeme Harper, a veteran television director known for his work on Doctor Who. As each episode of Inside No. 9 features new characters, the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" stars Shearsmith as Klaus, Pemberton as Julian, Rula Lenska as Celia, Jessica Raine as Kathy, George Bedford as Toby, Derek Jacobi as Dennis Fulcher, Cavan Clerkin as the unnamed interviewer, and Naz Osmanoglu as the young Dennis Fulcher. Plot The episode opens with a clapper for a film named The Devil of Christmas. Set in December 1977, the film follows Julian, his pregnant wife Kathy, his mother Celia and his son Toby as they are shown into an Austrian Alpine chalet by Klaus. The party discuss their plans until Toby is struck by an unpleasant painting of the Krampus on the wall. In a voiceover, the film's director Dennis Fulcher talks to another man about the making of the film, in the style of an audio commentary. The video is rewound so Dennis can comment on a continuity error. He continues to discuss the film over the remainder of the episode, including commenting on the way that \\"Celia\\" misses her marks and fluffs her lines, and the way \\"Julian\\" says his lines too quickly in his eagerness to get to another job. Klaus tells of the Krampus, unnerving Kathy. Before bed, Toby leaves out his boots for the Krampus, and Kathy empties a bottle of tablets. The next morning, Toby's boots are filled with switches, indicating‚Äîaccording to Klaus's story‚Äîthat he has been visited by the Krampus due to his naughtiness. Celia suspects Kathy, who is not Toby's mother, but Julian rebukes her. At dinner, Toby tells of the wonderful day he has had with Klaus. Toby heads to bed, and Kathy speculates that Toby was sleepwalking the night before, becoming agitated when Julian and Celia are unconvinced. That night, both Toby and Celia are out of bed, and the figure of the Krampus is seen. The next day, scratches are found on Toby's body, and Celia leaves with the child. That night, Julian finds that Kathy has scratches on her back, and the pair discover that her boots are stuffed with switches. Julian later finds Kathy downstairs. Celia calls to say she and Toby are safely home, and Kathy admits that her child is not Julian's. The Krampus snatches her, and Julian keels over, clutching his heart. He needs his medication, but Kathy watches him die, holding his empty pill bottle for him to see. \\"The Krampus\\" is revealed to be Klaus in a costume, but Klaus then removes a fake moustache and drops his accent; he is Simon, Kathy's lover. Fulcher explains that there is a final scene. The actors ready, and the scene begins: Kathy is on a bed, and pours Champagne. She is joined by Simon, still half-costumed, who chains her to the bed. Simon claims to be Krampus, and the scene ends with Kathy screaming as \\"Krampus\\" cackles. The actor playing \\"Krampus\\" leaves, with the actress playing Kathy believing the filming is over. The cameras keep rolling as plastic is put under \\"Kathy\\" by two Stagehands for a scene she did not know about. A new actor is dressed as the Krampus, and Kathy is roughly gagged by a stagehand. The new Krampus advances, armed with a machete; the older Dennis explains that \\"Kathy\\" understands, and that we are witnessing genuine fear. The tape cuts just as the machete is about to fall. Dennis says that he is surprised the tape has surfaced again, but that it was \\"one of the better ones\\"; The Devil of Christmas, unbeknownst to \\"Kathy\\", was a snuff film. Dennis's interviewer terminates the police interrogation. Reception Derek Jacobi (pictured, 2006) provided the voice of Dennis Fulcher, but does not appear on-camera. His commentary provided much of the episode's humour. For the most part, critics responded extremely positively to \\"The Devil of Christmas\\"; it was awarded five out of five stars by Adam White of The Telegraph, four out of five stars by James Jackson of The Times, and selected as \\"pick of the day\\" by Gerard Gilbert of i. It was praised as a fitting start to the series and as an entertaining Christmas special in its own right. Critics described it as \\"sublime\\" and \\"a treat\\"; it came \\"highly recommended\\" from the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, and the writer Matt Baylis summarised it as \\"horridly clever, wickedly good\\". Ian Hyland, writing for The Mirror in 2017, called it the most memorable television over the Christmas period. For him, the episode was almost as strong as \\"The 12 Days of Christine\\", in his view the best episode of Inside No. 9. Other critics did not place it as highly in comparison; Frances Taylor, writing for RadioTimes.com, listed \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" as the seventh best of the first 13 episodes. Both the comedic and horrific elements of the episode were praised. For White, the episode was \\"a demented, finely-honed comedy\\", though for Sally Newall, of The Independent, the comedic elements were less prominent. She described it as a \\"deliciously dark ... masterclass in the twisted, unsettling stuff that the League of Gentlemen and Psychoville creators do so well\\", but claimed that \\"a growing sense of doom\\" was more prevalent than \\"belly laughs\\". Dessau, too, commented on the lack of humour, while Chris Bennion, writing for the Saturday Review (of The Times) described it as \\"laugh-out-loud hilarious\\", while nonetheless \\"the stuff of nightmares\\". For White, much of the episode's strongest humour came from Dennis Fulcher's voice-over; Jackson called this a \\"pitch-perfect parody of a DVD commentary\\". Critics praised the cast for their hamming and effective delivery of what Bennion called the \\"stilted, stagy dialogue\\"; Toby Dantzic, writing for The Telegraph Saturday Review, called the acting \\"stellar\\". The attention to detail by the cast and crew was widely praised; the \\"dated styling\\" was, for Jackson, \\"spot on\\". Louisa Mellor, of the entertainment website Den of Geek, explained that \\"from the aspect ratio to the music, title font, sets, lighting, camera moves, hair, make-up and costume... everything was recognisable from the sort of 1970s television plays that, when you think about it, may have provided inspiration for Inside No. 9 as a whole\\". For her, \\"the retro send-up provided enough entertainment on its own‚Äîthese days you have to be very good to make TV that bad\\". White, similarly, argued that \\"it's a gargantuan, incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible TV, a skill reserved for only the greatest of comics\\". Even despite the flaws of the film within the episode, Rebecca Nicholson, of theguardian.com, found it \\"relatively gripping\\". Sarah Hughes, writing in i, compared \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" to an episode of Tales of the Unexpected; it was she, argued, \\"both an immaculately conceived homage to Roald Dahl's original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown\\". Commentators noted that the ending was genuinely unsettling and dark. Rachel Aroesti, writing for theguardian.com, described the episode as moving \\"from a twee period piece to what has to be the most depraved half-hour of television ever to grace the festive schedules\\". For many critics, the final twist was praiseworthy; it was characterised variously as the episode's \\"secret weapon\\", \\"very fitting\\", \\"suitably macabre\\", and \\"fantastically nasty\\". For Hughes, it \\"was a lovely sting in the tale, and one of which Dahl would almost certainly have approved\\". Two reviews in The Times, however‚Äîone unsigned, and one by Matt Rudd‚Äîwere more critical. The unsigned review advised viewers to switch off before the end, as \\"the fabulous styling gives way to a gratuitously nasty conclusion, a bad misjudgment from such a talented writing team\\". For Rudd, the shocking ending served no purpose; critical of \\"shocking for the sake of shocking\\", he argued that the episode's \\"half-hour of self-satisfied 1970s pastiche followed by a frenzied knife attack is very unpleasant indeed\\". In i, an unsigned review of \\"The Bill\\"‚Äîthe second episode of the third series‚Äîsuggested that viewers may have been put off the programme by the \\"rather nasty final couple of minutes\\" of \\"The Devil of Christmas\\". Though Jackson considered the ending \\"overwrought\\", he felt that it \\"pulled the rug\\"; \\"turning on a sixpence, the screams of 'Kathy' turned truly horrifying; the tackiness suddenly real and disturbing\\". Mellor considered the ending \\"a terrific twist as long as you didn‚Äôt look at it too closely\\", arguing that the interviewer's patience and the crew's collusion were unlikely. However, she suggested, there is little to be gained by criticising these aspects of the episode. For Baylis, the ending was unexpected, revealing \\"darkness of the shabby human kind\\". In the closing seconds of the episode, he said, \\"we suddenly saw it all, without seeing anything\\".

They have been designated a scheduled ancient monument. Discovery These carvings or petroglyphs were first recorded in 1986 (although a '1751' carved date suggests an earlier discovery) when the Kingencleugh Estate decided to clear an area of vegetation along the north side of the Liddell Burn that is a minor tributary stream of the River Ayr in an area famous for its quarrying of red sandstone. The removal of vegetation exposed the carvings that are distributed across two faces of a vertical outcrop of rock and they were reported to the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock. The presence of possible medieval carvings, the extensive quarrying with numerous workmen employed in the area, especially during the construction of the Ballochmyle Viaduct, emphasises how surprising it is that these glyphs were overlooked for so long, especially as they are only about 2 km south-east of Mauchline's town centre. Description The rock here is described as being a \\"pink dessert sandstone from the Permian age showing clear signs of dune bedding\\". The cup and ring marks are composed of two 'panels' with several hundred 'cup and ring' and other glyphs or carvings in a range of styles, ranging from single shallow cups through to deeper cups with multiple rings. Less common, but unique in the Scottish context are ‚Äòsquare with cup‚Äô carvings; ‚Äòringed stars‚Äô are also present. Three deer-like carvings and some other inscriptions with Lombardic style letters were also carved into the rockface and these are thought to be medieval in date. Several feet of soil were removed from the bottom of the corner that divides the two main halves of the site and this uncovered three 'trilithon-like' carvings and others may await discovery where the soil has not been removed. The carvings were protected by the vegetation and began to deteriorate after this was removed and in addition vandalism and theft of a panel has taken place. It is likely that they were historically hidden from direct view by trees and shrubs. The Ballochmyle glyphs or motifs are carved on red sandstone, however they are found elsewhere on other sedimentary rocks such as Millstone Grits, as well as the harder igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granites and schists. File:Ballochmyle Cup and Ring marked stone - 1.JPG  Concentric circles and cups. File:Ballochmyle Cup and Ring marked stone - 5.JPG An area where 'cups' dominate. File:Cup marks at Mauchline, Scotland.JPG  It is unusual to find these glyphs on a vertical rock face. File:Concentric ring and cup carvings, Mauchline, Scotland.JPG  Some have channels running down from them. File:Cup and Ring Marks at Mauchline, Scotland.JPG  Natural fissures, etc. may have been incorporated into the design. File:Ballochmyle Quarry.JPG Extensive quarrying took place at Ballochmyle and many glyphs may have been destroyed. The basic 'cup' is the most common carving however a wide range of glyphs exist with single to multiple concentric circles that are sometimes cut through in various ways by channels, etc. Where concentric rings exist the central cup often appears to dominate in depth and size suggesting that they were subject to repeated reworking over a period of time. Some incomplete or poorly formed glyphs exist here suggesting that different persons were involved in making them and frequent overlays of existing glyphs with either 'cups' or 'cup rings' suggests that they were created over an extended period of time. Studies suggest that distinct stylistic groupings may be present with one panel area having simple cups and cups with grooves, whilst another area has predominately bold cups with multiple concentric rings. An area with an apparent Lombardic style lettering may read 'ASAID' with two or three unreadable leading letters and a likely lost section. The final element is a date '1751' that is considered authentic but did not lead to further recorded investigation. Evidence suggests that cup and ring art was created from the Neolithic through to the Bronze Age, that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC. Creation and meaning Ballochmyle Bridge and gorge. Cup and ring mark stones are frequently found throughout Britain, with over 2500 sites in England alone, however an unusual feature of those at Ballochmyle is that they have been carved on nearly or actual vertical surfaces rather than horizontal and often 'altar-like' exposed stone outcrops. These types of carvings were created using 'hammerstones' or 'peckers', examples of these have been found elsewhere, hitting the surface of the rock repeatedly or using a grinding motion until the desired design was formed Some of the long grooves appear to be a series of cups that were then joined together. The soft nature of the stone at Ballochmyle gives insights into how the glyphs were created with many small holes that could not have been formed by a hammering action. The contrast with the original rock surface and the effect of shadow and rain usually makes the markings stand out however hints of the use of coloured pigments have been found at other sites and such things as animal fat, charcoal, plants dyes, etc. could have been used during various types of ceremonies to enhance the glyphs or as part of their cultural use. The frequency and widespread use of the same glyphs or motifs indicates that they had definite interpretive meanings and significance to the cultures that created them and these developed and then persisted over thousands of years. The locations indicate that these carvings were mostly for public display and not usually intended as part of secret practices where the fact that they were hidden was important. It may be relevant that the Ballochmyle area has both spectacular geological formations and geographical features in addition to the presence of a significant liminal zone in the form of a major watercourse, the River Ayr. Carvings into rocks can have deeper meanings such as with the carved footprint Petrosomatoglyphs at Dunadd in Argyll, linking a person literally to the land. The concept of the Anima locus is pertinent here, that is the 'soul' of a place, its essential personality as perceived in the imagination and emotions of visitors. A concept linked to the belief in supernatural spirits of nature as residing in stones, springs, mountains, islands, trees, etc. A form of religious significance linked to life and death, past and present, real and spiritual worlds, etc. has been proposed. A significant factor is that, as previously stated, they were created from Neolithic through to the Bronze Age, that is approximately 4000 BC to 1500 BC and they ceased when the Celtic Culture began to dominate and suppress older cultural practices. During this time smaller nomadic groups that might visit certain sites seasonally developed into sedentary communities with hierarchical leadership structures and specific communal religious practices. A facsimile of an unusual cup and ring mark stone from Dalgarven, North Ayrshire A cup and ring mark stone from Sardinia Many 'galleries' of cup and ring mark art are in prominent places within the landscape, such as river gorges, waterfalls, outcrops, caves, etc. and it has been suggested that they may have defined territorial boundaries, either for a locality or for a significant land holding. Few prehistoric track ways have been positively identified however some link with the more practical aspects of Ley lines may be indicated by the observation that cup and ring art is sometimes found overlooking natural harbours, on prominent natural landscape features, in mountain passes, along valley sides, at the entrances to inland routes, etc. It is thought that natural features of the rock faces may influence the cup and ring mark sizes, distribution and type in addition to 'framing' the carvings. Fissures, grooves, wind erosion marks, cracks, dune bedding, etc. may all have been regarded by the Cup and ring mark carvers as significant and meaningful in their own right to be copied, enhanced, removed or incorporated as possibly the work of their 'ancestors' or even the works of the gods themselves. Some cup and ring mark panels may have only been used seasonally and the varying level of complexity at sites has been interpreted as being both more and less significant in terms of the level of meaning present. The universality of cup and ring markings suggest a commonality of the origins of such glyphs that may relate to natural phenomena that are deemed significant, such as the concentricles that form on water when an object or offering is placed in it and although this may have been interpreted differently by the many cultures involved, the liminality with associated themes of thresholds and communication with the 'other side' may be one explanation for the use of cup and rings rather than the extensive use of glyphs such as ovals, boxes, triangles, star-shapes, etc. Surveys of the markings In 2015 AOC Archaeology group were employed by the Forestry Commission Scotland to carry out a survey of laser scanning and photogrammetry on the Ballochmyle cup and ring marks. Laser scanning recorded the glyphs in 3D in minute detail, taking millions of measurements. The Photogrammetry involved photographing the site from many different angles and then bringing the data together to create a 3D model. The RCAHMS carried out a survey on behalf of Historic Scotland in 1987 and a series of drawings were lodged with what is now Historic Environment Scotland.

The bastion of Santo Domingo has a particular importance, since it is the origin of the construction of the city walls of Cartagena de Indias in the early 17th century. This work of fortification was conceived around 1602 by the engineer Battista Antonelli and his nephew Crist√≥bal de Roda, also engineer, who decided to build it on the avenue through which the pirate Francis Drake had penetrated, in 1586. The city did not have stone barracks, and its few defenders, placed in an improvised trench in the strait of the isthmus that separated Bocagrande from the city, just where Avenida Santander is nowadays, could not face the invader. From this episode is a curious document written in Latin and signed by Drake, where he acknowledged receipt of the formidable rescue that the authorities were forced to pay, and a few years later, the decision to close the avenue of Bocagrande with the bastion of Santo Domingo . Therefore, the bastion protected the access to the city from the peninsula of Bocagrande, constituting itself in the first one of the great bastions of the walls of Cartagena. This bastion is model of the proportions regulated by the Italian school of fortification. In its collar the low squares are opened, that is to say, the lower parts of the esplanade of the bastion, where in the 16th and 17th centuries it was customary to locate the cannons. At the beginning of the 18th century, during the considerable reforms of Juan de Herrera y Sotomayor, the lower squares disappeared, but the vaults that served as access remained on both sides of the ramp. From that same period they must date the canals, which carry the waters from the most hidden cracks of the bastion to the public cistern. Herrera also added the large watchtower, which crowns the main angle of the bastion and which points to the sea. Don Juan de Herrera also moved the gate puerta de San Felipe from the left side to the opposite flank of the bastion, where it can still walk quietly. This bastion was also known by the name of San Felipe and Santa Mar√≠a, but it was the name of the gate puerta de Santo Domingo, also contiguous to the bastion, which gave it the name it carries until today.

In addition to writing detective fiction, Talty has written several nonfiction books on crime and American history. He cowrote the book that was the basis for Captain Phillips, and wrote The Black Hand, a novelization about the killing of Italian American cop Joe Petrosino in 1909. In 2013, the movie Captain Phillips was released in the US, directed by Paul Greengrass and starring Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. The screenplay by Billy Ray was based on the 2010 book \\"A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy Seals, and Dangerous Days at Sea\\" by Richard Phillips with Stephan Talty as co-writer. In 2017, Paramount Pictures announced that it had acquired the movie rights to Talty's upcoming novel The Black Hand. Leonardo DiCaprio will star as Joe Petrosino, and the film is due for release in 2018.

A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth. It was the last of three partial eclipses that took place that year, the first of two in two months, the last was on May 4 which covered a part of the Northern Hemisphere. It was part of solar saros 150. Description The eclipse was visible in much of Antarctica with the exception of most of the northern and northeastern parts, it included most of southern South America, the South Zetland Islands and the South Orkney Islands. The edge of the eclipse included Paraguay (parts are now in Argentina) and southern Brazil. The eclipse started at sunrise in Chile south of Antofagasta and finished at sunset in Antarctica. It showed about up to 10% obscurity in the South Pole area and in Uruguay, 20 to 35% at the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia. The greatest eclipse was in Antarctica at 61.9 S, 110.5 W at 11:19 UTC (4:19 AM local time). The subsolar marking was west of Angola in Africa.

They are known for their depressive doom style.  Name  Wasara in old Finnish orthography means ‚ÄòHammer‚Äô. The modern spelling is Vasara.  History  Antti √Östr√∂m, Ipi Kiiskinen and Mikko Nevanlahti were childhood friends in the town of Lohja in Southern Finland, and in 1996 they decided to form a band. The band was formed as Ali Baba and took influences from a range of musical genres including punk and rock. In 1999 the band changed its name to Wasara and Sami Tikkanen was added on guitars. Two demos were released on CD between 2000 and 2002. The first of these; Sinulle did not create the type of sound that the band were looking for. The second, a self-titled work was more successful and secured a two album deal with Firebox Records. Their first album Kaiken Kauniin Loppu was released in 2003. Mikko Nevanlahti left shortly afterwards and was replaced by Tuukka Heikurinen on drums. Before the release of the second album Meist√§ On Maa T√§ysi in 2005 Harri-Lempinen had taken over on drums. The second album was released on Roihu Records, which was a division of Firebox. A further change with Saku Lempinen replacing Sami Tikkanen on guitars took place in 2008. The third album Hehku was released in 2011. The band reportedly split in early 2012 however by 2014 they were back together playing live gigs. They remained active until at least March 2016, but there has been no new recording.  Musical style  Lyrically Wasara focus on the subjects of despair, sorrow and pain. Suicide is a common issue in their lyrics. At times the harsh lyrical style is that of Death Metal. However the songs are produced at a mid-tempo with some folk elements and may also be described as Groove Metal. Their music has been defined as 90s Heavy Rock rather than Metal. It has also been compared with early Amorphis. Although melancholy is a common thread, their albums offer variation in style and pace, with clean and harsh vocals used. = Current lineup = * Antti √Östr√∂m ‚Äì vocals, guitar, lyricist (1996-) * Ipi Kiiskinen‚Äì Bass_guitar (1996-) * Tuomo Tolonen ‚Äì guitar (2001-) * Harri Lempinen ‚Äì drums (2004-) * Saku Lempinen ‚Äì guitar (2008-) * Tipi Vainio ‚Äì Keyboards (2014-) = Past members = * Sami Tikkanen ‚Äì guitar (1999-2008) * Mikko Nevanlahti ‚Äì drums (1996‚Äì2003) * Tuukka Heikuriseen ‚Äì drums (2003-2004)  Discography  =Demos= * Sinulle (2000) Not on label * Wasara (2002) Not on label =Albums= * Kaiken Kauniin Loppu (All in a Beautiful End) (2003) * Meist√§ On Maa T√§ysi (2005) * Hehku (The Glow) (2011) =Singles= * Kivisade (Stone Rain) - CD Single (2003) * Manan Maille - Digital (2005) * Kuollut On Kuollut - Digital (2011)  External links  * https://www.facebook.com/pg/wasaraband/about/?ref=page_internal * http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Wasara/14820 * https://www.discogs.com/artist/708822-Wasara References Finnish rock music groups ","title":"Wasara"},{"id":"53476535","text":"}}} The tangent-secant theorem describes the relation of line segments created by a secant and a tangent line with the associated circle. This result is found as Proposition 36 in Book 3 of Euclid's Elements. Given a secant g intersecting the circle at points G1 and G2 and a tangent t intersecting the circle at point T and given that g and t intersect at point P, the following equation holds: :PT^2=PG_1cdotPG_2 The tangent-secant theorem can be proven using similar triangles (see graphic).

He has been critical of logging projects that he viewed as providing little benefit to landowners and of the Ok Tedi mine. He was promoted to Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology in the Somare government in August 2003 until he resigned amidst conflict between PAP and Prime Minister Somare's National Alliance on 18 May 2004. However, after further turmoil, he was reappointed to the ministry the same day as Minister for Labour and Industrial Relations. In August 2004, he supported Brian Pulayasi's successful challenge for the PAP leadership, ousting Moses Maladina. On 23 June 2006, he was demoted to Minister for State Assisting the Prime Minister. Biyama was re-elected for the United Resources Party at the 2007 election. In May 2012, the Roy Biyama Building, a government office building in Balimo, was opened in his honour.

The original version of \\"Shine\\" was released three years earlier on her EP Shine, although it has been re-worked for this album. It was intended to be the lead for her initially planned second album, but the plans fell through after a dispute with her label. After Nalick separated from her label, she got married and took a two year break from the music industry. In 2010, Nalick announced her return to the music business on her Facebook page. She formed her own independent label, Nyctograph, and released Broken Doll & Odds & Ends. The title track of the album, \\"Broken Doll\\", was developed after she found her old Barbie dolls discarded and broken. The song develops this as a theme of once feeling special, but then being left behind. The song was written early in the process, when Nalick was still under contract with Sony Music. One of the themes the album explores is the discomfort Nalick felt at being asked to be somebody different than herself. Initially, the album was intended to be an acoustic album, but Nalick's friends who performed on the album had talent with many instruments, so that she gave them the opportunity to explore a variety of sounds to put on the album, so that various instruments like the sitar, the mandocello, and the glockenspiel ended up on the album.

It is one of the few places worldwide that share an identical name with London's famous Downing Street, where the official residence of the British prime minister is located. Created in the late 19th century, the Straits Settlements government built an administrative complex along the street. Thus, as is the case in London, Downing Street in George Town was once the seat of government in Penang.  History  The only surviving portion of the Straits Settlements-built Government Offices has since been converted into the Penang Islamic Council offices. HSBC Penang headquarters, completed in 1951, replaces the older HSBC Building which was obliterated during World War II. Originally, the area where Downing Street now runs through does not exist; the sea reached all the way up to Beach Street, making the latter the eastern coastal road of George Town. This particular area was created through a massive land reclamation project in the 1880s, which also created Weld Quay and expanded the harbour facilities required for the booming entrep√¥t trade at the time. Downing Street was envisioned as part of George Town's civic precinct, and between 1889 and 1907, the government of the Straits Settlements constructed the U-shaped Government Offices along Downing Street. The Government Offices included the Resident Councillor's Office, the Audit Office, the Public Works Department and the Marine Department, as well as the Land Office in its western wing and a post office in the eastern wing. Other than the Government Offices, the British authorities also built other administrative buildings along Downing Street, such as the Education Department, the Treasury Office and the Indian Immigration Depot. This concentration of administrative functions effectively made Downing Street the administrative centre of the Straits Settlement of Penang. In 1906, the original HSBC Building at the junction with Beach Street was completed. However, most of this colonial architecture were destroyed during World War II. Japanese and Allied bombers repeatedly attacked this particular location due to its importance as Penang's administrative heart, causing the almost total destruction of the Government Offices. The other administrative buildings and the HSBC Building were completely destroyed by the end of the war. Only one part of the Government Offices remain standing to this day. This section of the former Government Offices now houses the Penang Islamic Council offices. The present HSBC Building was also rebuilt and completed in 1951.

Lucius Afranius and Titus Quinctius Atta are known to have written fabulas togatas. It is also treated as an expression that functioned as the overall description of all Roman types of drama in accordance with a distinction between Roman toga and Greek pallium. There are recorded sources that cite how this drama could be obscene and moralistic. By mid-second century BCE the fabula togata become one of the two types of drama that constituted a bifurcated Roman comedy along with fabula palliata. The fabula togata was distinguished from the palliata primarily by its use of Roman or Italian characters, transferring the comic situations of the bourgeois palliata to the lower-class citizens of the country towns of Italy. The palliata was based on originals of Greek New Comedy, tragedies from Attic sources as well as the grand dramatization of Rome's past. There is no existing complete fabula togata but there are surviving fragments that indicate aspects of the creative practice.
